understood if and how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses. Here, we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from their endogenous loci in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and characterized the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced structural plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of synaptic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AMPA receptor</kwd><kwd>vesicle trafficking</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>single-particle tracking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Victor C</given-names></name><name><surname>Houlihan</surname><given-names>Patrick R</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Walpita</surname><given-names>Deepika</given-names></name><name><surname>DeSantis</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glutamate receptor-containing vesicles are positioned in the dendritic shaft near sites of synaptic activity by F-actin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity – the modulation of synaptic connections in response to changes in neuronal activity – is regarded as the cellular basis for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Nelson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Magee and Grienberger, 2020</xref>). Changes in postsynaptic spine morphology (i.e. structural plasticity) and protein composition are observed during synaptic plasticity and are thought to contribute to changes in synaptic transmission (i.e. functional plasticity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nakahata and Yasuda, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kasai, 2023</xref>). Persistent pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release stimulates postsynaptic spine enlargement and insertion of proteins into the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi and Majewska, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Patterson and Yasuda, 2011</xref>), including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Song and Huganir, 2002</xref>) – ionotropic glutamate receptors that permit the influx of sodium, potassium, and in certain cases calcium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chater and Goda, 2014</xref>). This increase in AMPAR abundance, as well as changes to AMPAR conductance, results in a greater inward flow of ions in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given that the number of AMPARs at synapses is highly regulated during synaptic plasticity, AMPAR trafficking has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Henley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groc and Choquet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Díaz-Alonso and Nicoll, 2021</xref>). The majority of AMPARs are synthesized in the cell body and then enter the secretory pathway, where they are trafficked in vesicles and inserted into the neuronal membrane via exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shepherd and Huganir, 2007</xref>). AMPARs on the membrane can diffuse into synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choquet and Opazo, 2022</xref>) and can also be endocytosed and delivered to lysosomes for degradation or recycled through the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehlers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanley, 2018</xref>). An important feature of synaptic plasticity is input specificity – plasticity stimulated at one synapse does not spread to inactive synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kandel et al., 2013</xref>) – suggesting that AMPARs are inserted selectively into stimulated synapses. The mechanisms that regulate how AMPARs are delivered to synapses undergoing plasticity are not fully understood, but evidence points to two models: (1) AMPARs in vesicles are trafficked and exocytosed directly into or adjacent to stimulated synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park, 2018</xref>); and (2) AMPARs diffusing in the neuronal membrane are selectively trapped at stimulated synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tardin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehlers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Penn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choquet and Opazo, 2022</xref>).</p><p>AMPARs in vesicles are trafficked through dendrites by both microtubule- and actin-based motors, and disrupting active transport of AMPARs interferes with long-term potentiation (LTP), a commonly studied form of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hoogenraad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gutiérrez et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether AMPAR-containing vesicles (hereafter referred to as AMPAR vesicles) are delivered directly to synapses undergoing plasticity, due in large part to limitations in imaging AMPARs in vesicles as opposed to on cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groc and Choquet, 2020</xref>). One approach to studying AMPAR vesicles utilizes chemically inducible dimerization to control the release of exogenous AMPARs (i.e. AMPARs expressed from plasmid DNA) from the endoplasmic reticulum into the secretory pathway, followed by tracking AMPAR vesicles as they traverse photobleached sections of dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet et al., 2023</xref>). Using this technique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hangen et al., 2018</xref> found AMPAR vesicles slow down and pause in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels during neuronal activity, and consequently hypothesized that a calcium-mediated mechanism primes AMPAR vesicles for exocytosis. However, it is unclear if pausing is directly linked to AMPAR exocytosis at synapses undergoing plasticity. Additional studies have demonstrated that endosomes containing exogenous AMPARs can enter dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">EstevesdaSilva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowen et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility of direct AMPAR exocytosis into synapses. However, scanning electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled AMPARs fail to reveal a substantial fraction of AMPAR vesicles in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, imaging exogenous AMPARs tagged with super ecliptic pHluorin shows that exocytosis occurs largely at extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Patterson et al., 2010</xref>), favoring a model in which receptors diffuse into synapses after exocytosis.</p><p>Much research has been focused on understanding how synapses capture AMPARs as they diffuse through the neuronal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groc and Choquet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choquet and Opazo, 2022</xref>). After exocytosis, AMPARs diffuse freely in random directions, but diffusion decreases precipitously at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tardin et al., 2003</xref>) because AMPARs are anchored there by postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, such as PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bats et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Synaptic activity changes both the composition of proteins in the synapse and posttranslational modifications on AMPARs, further enhancing receptor anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lu and Roche, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). These observations support a model where AMPARs may not be trafficked to specific loci, but rather diffuse in random directions, only to be concentrated in active synapses as a consequence of their increased residence time. Importantly, crosslinking AMPARs on the neuronal membrane to prevent their diffusion impairs synaptic potentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Penn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Getz et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the net distance a receptor can travel via diffusion is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Groc and Choquet, 2020</xref>). Consequently, this model depends on the presence of nearby extrasynaptic reservoirs from which synapses can draw AMPARs during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choquet and Opazo, 2022</xref>). How reservoirs are established and maintained is not fully understood, but given that synapses can be located hundreds of microns from the cell body, it is probable that receptors are actively transported near sites undergoing synaptic plasticity.</p><p>To address whether and how neurons specify the location to which AMPAR vesicles are delivered, we developed a method to identify vesicles containing AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed at native levels from endogenous loci and characterize the motion of these vesicles in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Using this technique, we identify previously undescribed motion behaviors for GluA1-containing vesicles (hereafter referred to as GluA1 vesicles). We show that stimulating synaptic activity with glycine-induced chemical LTP (cLTP) or structural plasticity with glutamate uncaging-evoked structural LTP (sLTP) results in the local confinement of GluA1 vesicles in the dendritic shaft. We find that confinement concentrates GluA1 vesicles near sites of stimulation, thereby increasing the size of GluA1 reservoirs near these sites. GluA1 vesicle confinement is the result of stimulation-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft, which changes the rheological properties of the dendritic cytoplasm in a manner that inhibits transport along the length of the dendrite and inhibits diffusion of GluA1 vesicles. Finally, we show that actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft near the sites of stimulation facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1 vesicles from intracellular reservoirs to sites of exocytosis. In sum, our results suggest that neurons enhance the delivery AMPARs to active synapses by restricting the motion of AMPAR vesicles away from these synapses while simultaneously promoting AMPAR exocytosis near these synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GluA1-HaloTag is trafficked to postsynaptic densities and responds to stimulation</title><p>To study the intracellular transport of AMPARs during neuronal activity, we developed a method to label endogenous AMPAR GluA1 subunits (encoded by <italic>Gria1</italic>), expressed at native levels, using homology-independent targeted integration (HITI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. HaloTag (HT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Los et al., 2008</xref>) enables labeling of GluA1 with bright and photostable Janelia Fluor (JF) dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>), which can be conjugated to the HaloTag ligand (HTL). We used HITI to insert HaloTag into the extracellular amino-terminal domain (NTD) of GluA1 at R280 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), resulting in a high knock-in efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

Consequently, we counted the number of ATS per cell as a proxy for whether one or two alleles are edited (center bar graph).

These experiments demonstrate that surface receptors bleach much more rapidly than vesicles. We find that GluA1-HT surface receptors bleach within 100 frames.

To avoid visualizing pre-existing GluA1-HT, GluA1-HT was first labeled with a saturating concentration of JF<sub>646</sub>-HTL in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Next, JF<sub>646</sub>-HTL and CHX were washed away, and after an incubation period to allow GluA1-HT translation to recover, de novo synthesized GluA1-HT was labeled with JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL. Because JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL labels only newly synthesized GluA1-HT, signal detected by fluorescence microscopy is dramatically reduced in this fluorescence channel, allowing us to identify sparse, punctate GluA1-HT-JF<sub>549</sub> conjugates (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We then used single-particle tracking (SPT) analysis to reconstruct trajectories, and hidden Markov modeling with Bayesian model selection (HMM-Bayes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Monnier et al., 2015</xref>) to determine important motion parameters (i.e. velocity and diffusion coefficient) and predict the motion type (i.e. active transport versus diffusion) of each trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we separated GluA1-HT vesicles from surface GluA1-HT based on motion type, fluorescence bleaching characteristics, and localization in the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>).</p><p>Having established a pipeline to label, track, and analyze GluA1-HT vesicles, we sought to evaluate whether the motion of GluA1-HT vesicles is modulated by synaptic activity. Glycine-induced chemical LTP (cLTP) is an established method of stimulating synaptic plasticity and increasing the surface expression of GluA1 in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Passafaro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molnár, 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that cLTP induction might change the motion of GluA1-HT vesicles in the dendritic shaft to support increased GluA1-HT exocytosis during neuronal activity. Using a membrane impermeable variant of JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL termed JF<sub>549</sub>i-HaloTag ligand (JF<sub>549</sub>i-HTL; ‘i’ for impermeant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xie et al., 2017</xref>), we validated that cLTP stimulates increased expression of GluA1-HT on neuronal surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). We then imaged and tracked GluA1-HT vesicles in dendrites during cLTP induction, and observed clear qualitative differences in motion compared to vesicles in the dendrites of unstimulated control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video5">Figure 1—video 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video6">Figure 1—video 6</xref>). Most strikingly, we observed a loss in long-range motion along the length of the dendritic shaft in cLTP-stimulated neurons. When HMM-Bayes is applied to characterize trajectories collected during cLTP induction, we find a significant decrease in the fraction of GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, pie charts). The diffusion coefficients (D) for GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing diffusion are also significantly reduced by cLTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, histogram). In addition, vesicles exhibit increased subdiffusion (i.e. constrained diffusion due to molecular crowding or interactions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feder et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saxton, 2007</xref>) in response to cLTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>).</p><p>These observations demonstrate that the overall motion of GluA1-HT vesicles is inhibited by cLTP, suggesting that vesicle motion is locally confined (defined in this work as the restriction of vesicle motion away from its initial position). We reasoned that if cLTP spatially confines GluA1-HT vesicles then it should, in addition to decreasing the fraction of vesicles undergoing active transport, prevent diffusing vesicles from transitioning to active transport and leaving their local regions. A critical feature of HMM-Bayes is the ability to infer multiple motion states from a single trajectory and determine state-transition probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Monnier et al., 2015</xref>). Using HMM-Bayes, we find multi-state GluA1-HT vesicles stochastically switch motion states from active transport to diffusion and from diffusion to active transport with approximately the same probability under unstimulated control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11C</xref>, Control, k<sub>AT-D</sub> vs k<sub>D-AT</sub>). By contrast, during cLTP, GluA1-HT vesicles have a greater probability of switching from active transport to diffusion than from diffusion to active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11C</xref>, cLTP, k<sub>AT-D</sub> vs k<sub>D-AT</sub>). Furthermore, GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing diffusion have a high probability to continue diffusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11C</xref>, cLTP, k<sub>D-D</sub>). Taken together, our observations suggest that cLTP induction results in the local confinement of GluA1-HT vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Local induction of synaptic activity confines GluA1 vesicles near the site of activity by disrupting GluA1 vesicle motion</title><p>If confinement is a mechanism to increase the intracellular reservoir of GluA1-HT near sites of synaptic activity, then stimulating plasticity at a specific synapse should alter GluA1-HT vesicle motion near that synapse.

Furthermore, GluA1-HT vesicles in Zone 1 imaged 10 min after the cessation of sLTP stimulation exhibited similar motion behaviors to those imaged immediately after the cessation of sLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, Active transport bar graph and Diffusion histogram), suggesting that vesicles are confined.</p><p>To further test whether vesicles are confined near the site of synaptic activity, we used HMM-Bayes to determine the probabilities that vesicles switch between active transport and diffusion in each zone during sLTP. sLTP increases the probability that multi-state GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing active transport in Zone 1 switch to and stay in a diffusive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, sLTP Zone 1, k<sub>D-AT</sub> vs k<sub>AT-D</sub>, and k<sub>D-D</sub>) in a manner dependent on the presence of MNI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, No MNI, k<sub>D-AT</sub> vs k<sub>AT-D</sub>, and k<sub>D-D</sub>).

These observations demonstrate that multi-state GluA1-HT vesicles proximal to the site of stimulation have low probabilities of being transported away from the site of stimulation.

Treating neurons with LatA not only prevents redistribution of tractin during cLTP, but also reduces the intensity of tractin signal in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, cLTP +LatA), demonstrating that actin polymerization leads to the redistribution of tractin during cLTP. Because the expression of actin-binding peptides may result in artificial F-actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Melak et al., 2017</xref>), we also labeled F-actin with phalloidin after cLTP and imaged using STED microscopy. cLTP resulted in greater phalloidin labeling in dendritic shafts, while LatA treatment during cLTP decreased phalloidin labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), recapitulating our finding that cLTP induces actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether sLTP-mediated changes in local actin networks play a role in positioning vesicles near sites of stimulation. We observed a significant increase in tractin fluorescence (MFI) in spines stimulated with sLTP and in the dendritic shaft proximal to these spines, reflecting increased actin polymerization at these locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, blue outline). Tractin signal increases in an approximately 30 μm longitudinal section along the length of the dendritic shaft surrounding the sLTP-stimulated spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The increase in tractin MFI during sLTP is dependent on actin polymerization and is not an artifact of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Having found that sLTP increases actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft proximal to the uncaging site, we tested whether sLTP-mediated actin polymerization confined GluA1-HT vesicles. By tracking GluA1-HT vesicles after sLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>), we find that sLTP significantly reduces the fraction of GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing active transport, as well as the diffusion coefficient of GluA1-HT vesicles, inside but not outside regions of the dendritic shaft with actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Moreover, multi-state GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing active transport inside, but not outside, regions of actin polymerization during sLTP have an increased probability of switching to diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). By contrast, sLTP stimulation has no effect on the motion of vesicles in cultures with no MNI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Importantly, the effect of sLTP on GluA1-HT vesicle motion is disrupted by LatA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, LatA prevented cLTP-mediated changes in GluA1-HT vesicle mobility, demonstrating that cLTP-induced actin polymerization results in the confinement of GluA1-HT vesicles as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that sLTP-mediated actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft confines GluA1-HT vesicles near the site of stimulation, but it is unclear whether confinement actually generates an increased number of vesicles near these sites.

To study the exocytic rates of endogenous GluA1, we fused super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP) to HaloTag and knocked this tandem reporter into the NTD of GluA1 such that the tag is exposed to the low pH lumen of vesicles during transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).

To test this idea, we used HMM-Bayes to infer the motion of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles after inducing structural plasticity with sLTP stimulation. Pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles exhibit two or more motion states, where the final state before exocytosis is immobility (i.e. vesicles are immobilized by docking immediately prior to exocytosis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we characterized the motion states of vesicles prior to immobility (docking). Similar to GluA1-HT vesicles, non-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles (i.e. vesicles that do not exocytose) exhibit reduced active transport in response to sLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom bar graph, No MNI vs sLTP, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Non-exocytosis). Surprisingly, sLTP increased the fraction of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles exhibiting active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom line graph, No MNI vs sLTP, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Pre-exocytosis). Similarly, cLTP also increased active transport of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results show that synaptic activity stimulates the active transport of GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles to exocytic sites, even though the net distances they travel are short.</p><p>As active transport delivers vesicular cargo much faster than diffusion, this finding is consistent with the model that AMPARs need to be rapidly trafficked to exocytic sites during synaptic activity in order to maintain a rapidly accessible membrane-bound reservoir of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, it is striking that synaptic activity increases the active transport of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles while simultaneously confining the motion of non-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles. AMPAR-containing endosomes are primarily trafficked along to the length of dendrites by microtubule-based motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">EstevesdaSilva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>), but can also be recruited by myosin Va and Vb to the sites of exocytosis during LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft plays a dual role during synaptic activity by: (1) disrupting microtubule-based transport of GluA1 vesicles near synaptic activity (increasing the concentration of GluA1 vesicles); and (2) acting as a substrate for the myosin-based transport of a minority of vesicles to exocytic sites. This may explain the different motion states we observe between pre- and non-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles during stimulation. Interestingly, we primarily observe GluA1-HT vesicles undergoing transport parallel to the length of the dendritic shaft (longitudinal motion) prior to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, control and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Pre-sLTP). After stimulation, we find GluA1-HT vesicles that exhibit motion perpendicular to the length of the dendritic shaft (lateral motion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, cLTP and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Post-sLTP). Consequently, we asked if vesicles that changed their directional bias in response to stimulation were in fact pre-exocytosis vesicles being transported to their exocytic sites by myosin.</p><p>To examine this possibility, we first measured the directional bias, described by the angle theta, of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicle trajectories in response to sLTP-stimulated synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Theta of ~90<sup>o</sup> indicates that the vesicle is moving parallel to the dendritic shaft (longitudinal motion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top trajectory), whereas theta of ~0<sup>o</sup> indicates the vesicle is moving perpendicular to the dendritic shaft (lateral motion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom trajectory). When we examine the directional bias for non-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles in the absence of sLTP stimulation, we find a strong bias for longitudinal motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Non-exocytosis vesicles). By contrast, pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles do not exhibit strong biases for either longitudinal or lateral motion in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, top histogram, No MNI, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Pre-exocytosis vesicles), indicating that vesicles travel in random directions to exocytic sites in the absence of synaptic activity. However, when synaptic activity is induced by sLTP, pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles have a strong bias for lateral motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, top histogram, sLTP). Likewise, cLTP induction also leads to increased lateral motion for pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, Control vs cLTP). These results show vesicles move laterally to exocytic sites in response to synaptic activity, which we speculate is due to vesicles moving from the center to the periphery of the dendritic shaft.</p><p>We then sought to determine whether increased lateral motion during synaptic activity is driven by myosin. We first examined the motion states of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles that move laterally during stimulation and find most exhibit active transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This result suggests that GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles move by motor-based transport to exocytic sites. Moreover, when actin polymerization or myosin activity are inhibited, the fraction of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles exhibiting active transport is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom line graph, sLTP +LatA and sLTP +MI). Next, we tested the effect of inhibiting actin polymerization on directional bias and find that LatA strongly reduces the lateral motion of pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles in response to sLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, middle histogram, sLTP +LatA). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of myosin also blocked lateral motion in response to sLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, bottom histogram, sLTP +MI). Inhibition of either actin polymerization or myosin activity also prevents increased lateral motion of pre-exocytosis vesicles in response to cLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, cLTP vs cLTP +LatA and cLTP +MI). Together, these findings demonstrate that pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles are transported laterally by myosin to the sites of exocytosis in response to synaptic activity.</p><p>Lastly, we sought to confirm our finding that actin polymerization itself is sufficient to block longitudinal motion. We examined theta for GluA1-HT vesicles in response to stimulation and find a decrease in longitudinal motion and increase in lateral motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>, sLTP and cLTP), similar to what we observe for pre-exocytosis vesicles. However, when GluA1-HT vesicles are treated with LatA during stimulation, we observe a decrease in lateral motion and a strong increase in longitudinal motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>, sLTP +LatA and cLTP +LatA). By contrast, inhibition of myosin during stimulation reduces lateral motion but does not increase longitudinal motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>, sLTP +MI and cLTP +MI, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Moreover, inducing actin polymerization with Jasplakinolide (Jsp) while blocking myosin activity reduces longitudinal motion without increasing lateral motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref>, Jsp +MI). These observations support our conclusion that F-actin is necessary and sufficient to confine GluA1 vesicle motion near sites of synaptic activity. Nevertheless, myosin also promotes the surface expression of GluA1 by mediating its active transport to the sites of exocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have developed a novel method to identify, track and characterize the motion of vesicles containing GluA1, enabling us to better understand how AMPARs are delivered specifically to sites undergoing plasticity. We use homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) to tag endogenous GluA1 with HaloTag (GluA1-HT) and then a block-and-chase labeling protocol with Janelia Fluor (JF) dye ligands to achieve a sparse labeling density suitable for the detection of GluA1-HT vesicles. We then utilize single-particle tracking (SPT) followed by hidden Markov modeling with Bayesian model selection (HMM-Bayes) to describe the motion of GluA1-HT vesicles during chemical and structural LTP (cLTP and sLTP). Using this strategy, we find that GluA1-HT vesicles become confined by actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft proximal to sites of stimulation, resulting in an increased intracellular reservoir of GluA1-HT near these sites. Using a pHluorin-HaloTag fusion with GluA1 (GluA1-HT-SEP), we examine how local vesicular reservoirs of GluA1 contribute to GluA1 exocytosis. We find that pre-exocytosis GluA1-HT-SEP vesicles undergo short-range transport perpendicular to the length of the dendritic shaft near sites of stimulation in a manner dependent on both actin polymerization and myosin activity.</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose a new model in which neurons utilize actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft to specify the location to which AMPARs are delivered during synaptic activity. First, actin polymerization occurs in the dendritic shaft proximal to the site of synaptic activity, resulting in molecular crowding in the dendritic cytoplasm at this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). The increased crowding inhibits the longitudinal motion of GluA1 vesicles, concentrating intracellular GluA1 near the site of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). F-actin then acts as a substrate for myosin Va and Vb – activated by the influx of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) – to recruit GluA1 vesicles to the dendrite membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Here, GluA1 vesicles undergo exocytosis, increasing the amount of surface bound GluA1 that can then diffuse into synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft proximal to the site of synaptic activity promotes GluA1 exocytosis by increasing the local pool of GluA1 vesicles and facilitating myosin-dependent transport to the dendrite periphery.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under unstimulated conditions, GluA1 vesicles are transported longitudinally along the dendritic shaft.

Primarily, we edit genomic copies of <italic>Gria1</italic> to express GluA1-HT and thus avoid pitfalls associated with expressing tagged GluA1 from a plasmid – overexpressing GluA1 can lead to mislocalization and excess formation of calcium permeable GluA1 homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>), altering conductance and neuronal activity. The low level of GluA1-HT expression driven by native <italic>Gria1</italic> promoters is also advantageous because it enables us to achieve sparse particle labeling through a block-and-chase protocol without photobleaching. As photobleaching removes all signal from a designated area, particles are tracked as they travel from outside to inside this region. Consequently, data from photobleaching experiments may be biased towards fast moving particles (i.e. those with active transport) and may omit slowly diffusing particles. HITI can potentially introduce indels into target genes and knock out copies of <italic>Gria1</italic> in some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>), but we find a low frequency of indels around the insertion site of HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and also that <italic>Gria1</italic> expression levels in transfected neurons are similar to those in untransfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These observations indicate that HITI-mediated editing of <italic>Gria1</italic> does not often lead to unwanted mutations, especially those that knock out copies of <italic>Gria1</italic>. Nevertheless, tagging strategies with higher accuracy (e.g. vSlender; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nishiyama et al., 2017</xref>) could be viable alternatives to HITI.</p><p>Our observations of GluA1 vesicle trafficking differ somewhat from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">EstevesdaSilva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hangen et al., 2018</xref> found that GluA1 vesicles undergoing active transport had decreased velocity and paused (i.e. temporarily lost active transport) more frequently during cLTP and photostimulation. By contrast, we find vesicles switch their motion state to diffusion and rarely switch back to active transport (i.e. vesicles stably lose active transport) in response to cLTP and sLTP. Vesicles also exhibit reduced diffusion coefficients after stimulation. Based on these differences, we conclude that GluA1 vesicles are confined, not paused, near sites of synaptic activity. These discrepancies are likely attributable to differences in our methodological approaches. Importantly, our labeling and analysis strategy enabled us to characterize the diffusion coefficient and state-switching probabilities of GluA1-HT vesicles, not just parameters associated with active transport. In addition, we use a specific MNI uncaging protocol to stimulate spine plasticity (not just calcium transients). We find that this protocol also induces actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft, which we demonstrate is the mechanism underlying vesicle confinement.</p><p>The precise mechanistic details of how actin polymerization is stimulated in the dendritic shaft and how it regulates GluA1 vesicles during synaptic activity remain to be determined. F-actin is found at the base of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schätzle et al., 2018</xref>), and in the dendritic shaft in shaft synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>) and in periodic submembrane actin rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lavoie-Cardinal et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these F-actin networks remodel to regulate GluA1 vesicle motion during synaptic activity is not known. Furthermore, it is unclear if F-actin also coordinates the localization of other proteins and organelles near synaptic activity. For example, F-actin patches position lysosomes in shaft synapses to support AMPAR turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), and thus could play a similar role near sites of synaptic activity. However, if actin-induced molecular crowding is generally obstructive to motion, additional mechanisms may be necessary to ensure only relevant particles localize to sites of synaptic activity. For example, myosin cargo adaptors that interact with GluA1 may further enhance the specificity of GluA1 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer and Sellers, 2012</xref>), while other motors might enable GluA1-negative vesicles to bypass F-actin blockades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferro et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, AMPARs are transported to multiple loci along a single dendrite, suggesting there must also be a mechanism to ensure not all GluA1 vesicles are trapped at a single synapse. One possibility is that there is a sufficient pool of GluA1 vesicles undergoing anterograde and retrograde transport to reach multiple synapses. Further investigation could clarify how actin polymerization is regulated in the dendritic shaft, and how F-actin filters specific cargo in response to synaptic activity.</p><p>Previous studies have found that AMPARs are primarily transported along the length of the dendrites on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">EstevesdaSilva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Setou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>), but we and others find that short-ranged transport near the site of synaptic activity is mediated by Myosin Va/b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Correia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). These observations suggest that GluA1 vesicles are transferred from microtubules to actin for local transport. The exact mechanism for this exchange is not known but our findings indicate that F-actin-induced crowding results in the detachment of GluA1 vesicles from microtubules prior to attachment and transport on F-actin. Thus, F-actin enhances local transport by acting as a substrate for myosin-based cargos, but also by creating a cytoplasmic environment that strongly disfavors microtubule-based transport (preventing transport away from the stimulated site). Such a mechanism could have important implications for how cargo in general is transferred since changes to the subcellular environment could alter modes of transport indirectly rather than through the interactions between motors, cargo, and cytoskeleton.</p><p>The precise control of synaptic protein trafficking is vital to synaptic transmission, and thus learning and memory. Nevertheless, many mechanisms regulating synaptic protein trafficking remain to be fully understood. Here, we identify a novel mechanism through which actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft can regulate the surface expression of GluA1 specifically at sites with stimulating inputs. Because F-actin can exert direct and indirect effects on a variety of particles in the dendritic cytoplasm, our findings raise interesting questions regarding whether actin polymerization is a general mechanism to coordinate the delivery of proteins during synaptic plasticity. Elucidating whether and how actin regulates the motion of proteins in the dendritic shaft during neuronal activity could help us better understand the cellular bases for learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Animal work was conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of Janelia Research Campus (IACUC protocol #21–0206).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To generate the HaloTag donor construct (px552-sg-Gria1-HT), miRFP670 was first amplified from pBAD/His-miRFP670 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shcherbakova et al., 2016</xref>) and cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of PX552 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Swiech et al., 2015</xref>).

The PCR amplicons for HaloTag and SEP were fused using overlap extension PCR, and cloned into the MfeI and NheI sites of px552-sg-Gria1-HT to generate px552-sg-Gria1-HT-SEP. The Cas9 expression construct (PX551) was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Swiech et al., 2015</xref>).

Additional sequences between the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that are not related to the expression of F-tractin-mNeongreen (i.e. the sgRNA insert and the HaloTag donor sequence) were removed by digesting the construct with MluI and NheI and inserting a short double-stranded DNA oligo with 5’ overhangs that are complementary to MluI and NheI, creating hSyn-tractin. The GEM-HT-ST construct (hSyn-GEM) was created by amplifying PfV from pCMV-PfV-Sapphire-IRES-DSRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>), fusing PfV, HaloTag, and SNAP-tag by overlap extension PCR, and cloning the product into the KpnI and BsrGI sites of hSyn-tractin, creating hSyn-GEM.

To generate pCAG-GluA1-HT-P2A-GFP, HaloTag was amplified from px552-Gria1-HT and fused to the N-terminal of GluA1 by overlap extension PCR. This amplicon was cloned into the SphI and BstBI sites of pCAG-GluA1-P2A-GFP. To generate pCAG-GluA1-HT-SEP-P2A-mScarlet, HaloTag-SEP was first amplified from px552-sg-Gria1-HT-SEP and fused to the N-terminal of GluA1 by overlap extension PCR. This amplicon was then cloned into the SphI and BstBI sites of pCAG-GluA1-P2A-GFP to generate pCAG-GluA1-HT-SEP-P2A-GFP.

We then applied an automatic intensity threshold using Otsu’s method – an established thresholding method that enables us to minimize subjective analysis – to each individual fluorescence channel to be used for colocalization analysis. Using these threshold levels, we created a new volume channel corresponding to the colocalizing voxels between the two fluorescence channels. We report both the Pearson’s coefficient (which indicates whether the intensities of two signals co-vary) and the Manders’ coefficients (which indicate whether two signals overlap). For punctate signals that co-occurred inside a spine, but did not colocalize (i.e. HaloTag/GluA1 and postsynaptic density markers), we measured the distance between fluorescence signals using Abberior Imspector. First, images from the two channels (e.g. TRITC for HaloTag and Cy5 for PSD-95) were overlaid and a line profile was applied to adjacent signals (i.e. a single line was drawn through the center of an orange puncta and far-red puncta) in a single spine.

For any multi-state trajectory that exhibited ambiguity in its motion states (i.e. its motion states appeared to differ subjectively from the motion states assigned by HMM-Bayes, and the motion states were predicted by HMM-Bayes with low probability), we segmented the trajectory based on the apparent motion of each segment and reanalyzed each segment with HMM-Bayes and MSDanalyzer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Vesicle identification</title><p>After reconstructing trajectories for GluA1-HT and GluA1-HT-SEP particles and characterizing their motion, we identified vesicles for further analysis. To identify vesicles, we first removed particles that clearly localized inside spines for the majority of steps in their trajectories. Next, we filtered all particles that exhibited active transport based on HMM-Bayes analysis. For particles that exhibit only diffusive motion, we then filtered out all particles that bleach completely within 100 frames (the maximum number of frames required for a GluA1-HT homotetramer to bleach; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Lastly, we removed particles that have diffusion coefficients greater than 0.45 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (i.e. particles on cell surface; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6C</xref>) or less than 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (i.e. particles trapped in postsynaptic densities; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). To separate vesicles into zones (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we first measured the length of the dendritic shaft using the GFP fill. As images were typically centered on uncaging sites, we separated the length of the dendritic shaft into 3 equal sections based on proximity to the uncaging site. For example, if a dendrite is 90 μm long, Zone 1 would be the 30 μm length of dendrite immediate flanking the uncaging site; Zone 2 would be the two 15 μm lengths of dendrite flanking Zone 1; and so forth for Zone 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Chemical stimulation</title><p>To determine whether chemical LTP (cLTP) increased the concentration of GluA1-HT on neuronal surfaces, we washed cultured neurons three times with stimulation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 30 mM ᴅ-glucose, 20 mM bicuculline, 1 μM strychnine, pH 7.4) and then stimulated neurons with 0.2 mM glycine in stimulation buffer for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neurons were rinsed twice with wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 30 mM ᴅ-glucose, 20 mM bicuculline, 1 μM strychnine, pH 7.4) and then incubated with 25 nM membrane impermeable JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL (JF<sub>549</sub>i-HTL) in wash buffer for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with wash buffer and fixed as described (see Immunofluorescence). For live-cell GluA1-HT vesicle tracking experiments, the dish was placed onto the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TiE microscope after three washes with stimulation buffer (see Single-particle tracking for imaging setup). After a desired field of view was identified, stimulation buffer was exchanged for 0.2 mM glycine in stimulation buffer. A desired Z plane was identified and imaging commenced immediately. For Jasplakinolide (Jsp) stimulation experiments, neurons were first washed with imaging buffer and placed onto the Nikon Eclipse TiE microscope. After a desired field of view was identified, Jsp in imaging buffer was added to the dish to a final concentration of 0.25 μM. After 10 min of incubation with Jsp, we commenced imaging. For experiments with Latrunculin A (LatA), neurons were pretreated with 1 μM LatA for 10 min. In addition, LatA was added to every buffer for stimulation and imaging. For experiments examining the effect of Nocodazole on the active transport of particles, neurons were pretreated with 500 nM Nocodazole for four hours prior to imaging. 500 nM Nocodazole was also added to imaging buffer during imaging. For myosin V and VI inhibition, a cocktail of 4 μM Pentabromopseudilin (PBP), 10 μM MyoVin-1, and 4 μM of 2,4,6-Triiodophenol (TIP) was added to stimulation buffer during chemical stimulation and photostimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Photostimulation</title><p>For all photostimulation experiments, neurons were washed three times with photostimulation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 30 mM ᴅ-glucose, pH 7.4, plus 1 μM Tetrodotoxin; TTX). Photostimulation buffer was then replaced with 2 mM MNI-caged-ʟ-glutamate (MNI) in photostimulation buffer, and samples were placed onto a Nikon Eclipse TiE microscope (see Single-particle tracking for imaging setup). For all MNI uncaging experiments, we used a 405 nm uncaging laser (20 mW at the fiber end,~1 μm spot diameter; Nikon). To calibrate the strength of the 405 nm uncaging laser, we used GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), a genetically encoded calcium indicator, to monitor the influx of calcium in response to MNI uncaging. Neurons expressing GCaMP6s were identified using the FITC channel. The 405 nm uncaging laser was parked 1 μm from the tip of a dendritic spine head and fired once for 0.1 ms to determine whether the laser power was sufficient to evoke calcium influx at the targeted spine, in neighboring spines, and in the dendritic shaft. After performing uncaging once and recording the calcium influx, we moved to another spine on another neuron and repeated uncaging. We varied the laser power between 10 and 100% to determine the laser power that would maximally activate GCaMP6s only in the targeted spine. For glutamate uncaging-evoked sLTP experiments, we used neurons expressing GFP and GluA1-HT (or just GluA1-HT-SEP for exocytosis experiments). We selected dendritic spines to be targeted for glutamate uncaging-evoked sLTP based on their morphology in the FITC channel. We then positioned the 405 nm uncaging laser 1 μm from the tip of the dendritic spine head. sLTP was stimulated by firing the 405 nm uncaging laser at 1 Hz for 50 s with a pulse width of 0.1 ms. After photostimulation, we checked whether the dendritic spine head of interest had expanded in area in the FITC channel. To examine the effect of sLTP on GluA1-HT vesicle motion, we performed timelapse imaging on GluA1-HT vesicles in the TRITC channel (see Single-particle tracking) immediately before and after sLTP stimulation. For experiments using GluA1-HT-SEP, we identified spines for stimulation using the Cy5 channel (i.e. GluA1-HT-JF<sub>646</sub>) due to the loss of the FITC channel to SEP. To account for photobleaching and determine the adjusted number of vesicles after photostimulation, we determined the vesicle counts before and after sLTP stimulation in no MNI controls. We then used the fold loss in vesicles after sLTP stimulation in no MNI controls to correct the number of vesicles after sLTP stimulation across all conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Tractin imaging</title><p>To examine the effect of cLTP on the length of F-actin fibers in the dendritic shaft, cultured rat hippocampal neurons expressing tractin were imaged using an inverted Carl Zeiss LSM 880 microscope (see Immunofluorescence) with a 63 x Plan Apochromat oil-immersion objective (NA = 1.4). To achieve higher resolution, emitted photons were collected with a 32-channel spectral GaAsP PMT for Airyscan processing. As these experiments were performed on live cells, a PeCon Incubator XL enclosure with Lab-Tek S1 heating insert and CO<sub>2</sub> lid were used to maintain constant environmental conditions of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37 °C during imaging. Prior to imaging, neurons expressing tractin were washed three times with stimulation buffer (see Chemical stimulation) and placed onto the Zeiss LSM 880 stage. A dendrite of interest expressing tractin was identified and a z-stack of the dendrite acquired. After acquisition of the dendrite before cLTP (pre-cLTP), stimulation buffer was exchanged for 0.2 mM glycine in stimulation buffer. After 15 min, a z-stack of the dendrite (post-cLTP) was acquired with identical imaging parameters. Airyscan processing was applied to both the pre- and post-cLTP images. The F-actin skeletons were then quantified as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Briefly, we improved signal-to-noise by applying background subtraction and a minimum filter to the raw images. We then masked tractin signals in spines. We used Otsu’s method to threshold filaments and generate a binary mask, which we then skeletonized. Finally, we measured the length of the skeleton using the AnalyzeSkeleton ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Phalloidin labeling</title><p>Neurons were fixed and permeabilized as described above (see Immunofluorescence), except MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were removed from all buffers. Neurons were then blocked for 1 hr in 0.1% Triton X-100 blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature. F-actin was then labeled with 0.13 μM Abberior Star 635 p conjugated phalloidin (Abberior) in 0.1% Triton X-100 blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. After labeling, neurons were washed once with PBS and mounted in MOWOIL-DABCO. Superresolution images were acquired using an Abberior Expert Line STED microscope (see Immunofluorescence). While STED imaging greatly improved resolution, it also reduced the strength of F-actin signals. Consequently, we could not use the method described above (see Tractin imaging and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to measure the length of F-actin fibers labeled with phalloidin. Instead, we masked phalloidin signal in spines using the Intermodes method - a method for automatic intensity thresholding - and measured the mean fluorescence intensity of phalloidin inside the dendritic shaft.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Radius of confinement and directional bias analysis</title><p>To determine the directional bias of a trajectory using angle analysis, we implemented a custom MATLAB program. Specifically, for a given trajectory, we defined the radius of confinement as the distance from the centroid of a trajectory to the furthest point in the trajectory to the centroid. Next, we created a mask around the dendrite in which the trajectory is localized and set the dendritic path along the length of the dendrite. We then determined the point on the dendritic path that is closest to the centroid of the trajectory. The angle, theta Θ, created by these three points (the point on the dendritic path closest to the centroid, the centroid itself, and the point on the trajectory furthest from the centroid) indicates whether the motion of the trajectory is biased <italic>towards</italic> the length of the dendritic path or <italic>along</italic> the length of the dendritic path. Theta ~ 0<sup>o</sup> indicates that the motion of the trajectory is biased perpendicular to the dendritic path (i.e. lateral motion) while theta ~ 90<sup>o</sup> indicates that the motion of the trajectory is biased parallel to the dendritic path (i.e. longitudinal motion).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed to determine the preservation of GluA1-HT and GluA1-HT-SEP functionality. Cultured hippocampal neurons were assessed at DIV7-8. Labeling GluA1-HT/HT-SEP with JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL was performed 12 hr prior to patch clamp experiments. GluA1-HT/HT-SEP positive and negative neurons were identified via epifluorescence. Whole-cell configuration was achieved using pipettes pulled and polished to a resistance of 2–5 MΩ. SylGard 184 coating was applied to reduce pipette capacitance. Pipette solution composition included 120 mM Cs-MES, 5 mM NaCl, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 5 mM Lidocaine, 1.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, 4 mM Mg-ATP. External solution contained 135 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM Glucose. The external solution was supplemented with 200 nM TTX and 10 µM AP5. Cell capacitance was estimated and corrected to 80% with a 10 µsec lag. Gap free voltage clamp recordings were performed at 100 kHz acquisition frequency with a 1.0 kHz Bessel filter. Voltage was clamped to –70 mV, correcting for liquid junction potential. Following baseline measurements, 100 µM glutamate in pH adjusted external solution was locally perfused for 5 s using a fused silicate pipe positioned within 100–200 µm of the neuron recorded. The neuron then recovered with continued bath perfusion and local perfusion of glutamate-free external solution. For analysis, the gap-free epochs were reduced 50-fold. The data was normalized to current density via cell capacitance estimations. Peak current density for each response was determined. To determine whether GluA1-HT and GluA1-HT-SEP were functional using a heterologous expression system that does not express GluA1, HEK293T cells were transfected to express GluA1-P2A-GFP, GluA1-HT-P2A-GFP, or GluA1-HT-SEP-P2A-Scarlet (see Cell culture and transfection). After 48 hours of recovery, voltage-clamp recordings of glutamate induced GluA1 currents were performed similarly to the above described neuronal recordings. Patch pipettes pulled to 2–4 MΩ resistance were filled with internal solution containing 2.8 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.3. After whole-cell access was achieved, a brief baseline recording of external bath solution was performed; the external solution was comprised of 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.3. Due to the propensity of glutamate contamination in immortalized cell-line cultures, we anticipated desensitization of functionally expressed GluA1. To re-sensitized GluA1, we performed 2 min of constant, local perfusion of external solution supplemented with 50 µM cyclothiazide. After the cyclothiazide pretreatment, 2 mM glutamate with 50 µM cyclothiazide was locally applied to the patched cell for 10 s; this stimulation was followed by a washout period with normal external solution. Currents were adjusted to the control-bath baseline and normalized via cell capacitance. Data is reported as peak glutamate induced current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis and experimental replicates</title><p>All statistical tests and correlation analysis were performed in GraphPad Prism, version 8. Specific statistical tests to determine the significance of results are indicated in the figure legends. Histograms and probability functions were generated using the Distribution Fitter Application (Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox) in MATLAB. For experiments where GluA1-HT particles were tracked after chemical stimulation (e.g. cLTP induction), particles were tracked in one segment of a dendrite and then the neuronal culture was discarded. In other words, each timelapse is of a dendrite from an independent neuronal culture. This was done to roughly synchronize the start of each timelapse after chemical stimulation. For all MNI uncaging experiments, one spine was targeted per neuron (i.e. we identified a spine on a new neuron for each sLTP stimulation experiment). A maximum of three spines (i.e. three neurons) were targeted for MNI uncaging in one culture before the culture was discarded. Targeted spines were separated by at least 3 mm to minimize the possibility that a spine was exposed to uncaged MNI from a previous experiment. Typically, two to three neuronal cultures were prepared from a single dissection. Consequently, experimental replicates were performed on neurons derived from at least two rats. Nevertheless, we found no significant difference in either the fraction of GluA1-HT vesicles exhibiting active transport or the mean diffusion coefficient of GluA1-HT vesicles between neurons derived from different dissections under a single condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5F–G</xref>). In other words, variation stemming from technical and biological replicates was significantly less than variation due to treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Newly created materials, including custom MATLAB codes, for this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Erin K O'Shea is President of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, one of the three founding funders of eLife, and a member of eLife's Board of Directors</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Designed and performed all experiments except whole-cell voltage clamp recordings</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Designed and performed whole-cell voltage clamp experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal work was conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of Janelia Research Campus (IACUC protocol #21-0206).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80622-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files, source data files have been provided for all figures.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our colleagues Dr. Heejun Choi, Dr. Kyle Harrington, Dr. Jingyi Hou, Dr. Dong-woo Hwang, Dr. Aurelie de Rus Jacquet, Dr. Namsoo Kim, Dr. Xi Long, and Dr. Young J Yoon for useful discussions; Dr. David E Clapham and Dr. Pietro De Camilli for their helpful suggestions and feedback on this manuscript; Dr. Luke D Lavis and Jonathan B Grimm for providing the Janelia Fluor dyes and guidance on their usage; Dr. Damien Alcor from the Janelia Research Campus (JRC) Light Microscopy Center and Dr. Andrian Gutu for their assistance with imaging platforms; Dr. Hyun Ah Yi and Dr. Alina D Gutu from the JRC Viral Tools facility for packaging AAVs; Dr. Kevin McGowan, Sarah Kivimaki, and Jordan Towne from JRC Molecular Genomics for assistance with cloning; Jenny Hagemeier and Leanna Eisenman from JRC Cell Culture Shared Resources for their help with cell cultures; Michelle Quiambao for administrative assistance; and the <italic>eLife</italic> editorial and production teams for assistance in submitting and publishing this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The new technology needs to be better validated.</p><p>1a: The rate of point mutations and indel formation by HITI-knockin are not validated. Currently, the authors validated the gene insertion only by in situ hybridization.

However, Figure 1E (immunostaining) only represents a correlation between these two signals. There seem to be many green and red signal where they don't co-localize, and even in the yellow part, it is hard with this resolution to know how much they co-localize. To address this issue authors can use better microscopy such as the airy scan system that they used for F-actin imaging, and also show that GluA1 and halo co-localize significantly more than other synaptic receptors (e.g. halo and NMDAR).</p><p>This story also relies on the fact that the author's system can clearly distinguish GluA1-HT vesicles from surface GluA1-HT (line 208). Authors claim that this separation was based on 1) its localization on the shaft, 2) bleaching characteristics of puncta signal, and 3) its motion type. For 1), as the authors themselves show in Figure 6, surface GluA1-HT (GluA1-HT-SEP) can exist in the shaft so this is not a good indicator. Also synapses can be often been in the what seems to be in the shaft area with poor optical sectioning. For 2), Figure 2- supplemental 1 does not describe the distinct differences between bleaching behavior of GluA1-HT vesicles from surface GluA1-HT. Did authors perform this type of bleaching experiment for all signals, categorize them, and then move on to tracking? If so, how? As is now, it is useless, it can be left out. It is indeed hard to imagine that the fluorescence declines in a stepwise fashion in a timely fashion.</p><p>versus DV is the most critical concept of this paper analyzed in the rest of the study. The authors argue that they correspond to diffusion versus active transport but they did not provide any evidence for this and it is not clear at all how they concluded in this way. It is also not clear how motion type was used to distinguish the two populations. They could for example use, nocodazole or latrunculin to see if the DV population disappears. For this parameter to be used, there must be little overlap between the motion of GluA1-HT vesicles and surface GluA1-HT. For example, in Figure 7 supplements C and D, how did the authors distinguish diffusion versus active? Authors could use surface GluA1-HT (using a membrane-impermeable tag or SEP) motion to analyze the data. The above point is very important as surface GluA1 is also known to be trapped upon LTP (Opazo et al. 2010) and we need to be sure that authors are looking at GluA1-HT vesicles.</p><p>The neurons used in some of the experiments are in poor condition. In Figure 3A, the bright spot where uncaging was performed does not look like a spine. It does not make sense that the spine would look so much brighter than the dendrite when the cell is just labeled with cytosolic GFP. Did authors really uncage at dendritic spines? I would like to see all other original images of the uncaging experiment so that I am convinced. Also, the authors need to establish a proper uncaging condition where the stimulation of a single spine elicits epsc of reasonable size in the cell body. How long was the spine enlargement maintained? In order to say LTP, the change must be maintained at least for 30 min or so but I cannot see the information. When was the image taken after uncaging? It may be hidden somewhere in the method but the authors need to make an effort to make it more clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Introduction, lane 26: There has been a lot of recent work on molecular mechanisms of LTP. Citing 2013 paper to say that there is not much known is not up to date.</p><p>2. Figure 1D: to convincingly demonstrate the colocalization please include zoom-ins or higher magnification images.</p><p>3. Figure 2E (also Figure 4): where have entries of GluA1-vesicles into dendritic spines been observed or were they removed from the analysis? I also have not found them in other given examples and videos.</p><p>4. Motility analysis: I have no critical comments here, nevertheless I would like to acknowledge that the authors did a great job, and I am sure there will be many labs who would benefit from their analysis pipeline.</p><p>5. Lane 240: term sub-diffusion is somewhat confusing. Perhaps replace by confined diffusion?</p><p>6. Figure 3A, 3C: images are not convincing. The dendrite where uncaging has been done looks aspiny and neighbouring branches are full of GFP aggregation and have varicosities. If this is a representative example as the figure legend says, I have some concerns about the quality of the experiment.</p><p>7. Figure 3, legend: what does n=9 mean? 9 spines, or 9 cells? How many independent cultures? This experiment has to be improved and redone.</p><p>8. Figure 3B: for post-LTP time should be indicated. Please include a time-lapse to show that there is a persistent change in the spine volume upon uncaging.</p><p>9. Figure 3C: What is the rationale behind defining dendritic zones? Is it based on pre-existing knowledge from the literature, ie. the length of dendrite within which synapses can cluster? Also, in Figure 2 Homer-GFP is used as a synaptic marker. What is the reason to switch to the GFP cell fill in Figure 3?</p><p>10. Figure 3: Glutamate uncaging results in elevated calcium levels. Depending on the stimulation strength it is limited to the activated spine or spreads out into a parent dendrite. I am wondering how far calcium signals spread in these experiments. This would be important to know as actin dynamics and myosin activity is controlled by calcium signalling. Is there a correlation between calcium spread with an area of increased actin polymerization and a zone with reduced AMPAR vesicle motility?</p><p>11. Figure 4, tractin experiments: I am not very convinced by the use of tractin as an F-actin probe. In the given representative images, there are very obvious actin cables in dendrites upon overexpression of F-tractin. This might be an artifact induced by overexpression. Please include another method of actin labeling. There are very nice recent tools available (i.e. CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous actin). Although they also label G-actin, when imaged at high magnification various F-actin-based structures are quite easy to visualize.</p><p>12. Figure 4A: as mentioned above, these are more like actin cables and bundles seen in dendrites. This is not typical. Can such redistribution be reproduced by staining endogenous F-actin? For example, with fluorescently labelled Phalloidin?</p><p>13. Figure 5A: please include example traces.</p><p>14. Figure 6C: please include examples.</p><p>15. To stringent the myosin part, in addition to inhibitors, myosin shRNAs or dominant negative constructs could be used.</p><p>16. Figure legends: please specify what n means in each case (number of cultures, cells, synapses…).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 4. This is the first manuscript to show that GluA1 moves near activated synapses intracellularly, as the authors acknowledged on lines 54-56. Thus, it is more appropriate to describe &quot;but whether and how AMPAR-containing vesicles……&quot; on line 4-a similar comment for Line 44.</p><p>Line 77. Some references seem incorrect. Please double-check.</p><p>One example is Hardin et al. (Line 77) because this paper does not describe PSD. A paper (PMID: 11082065) might fit better.</p><p>Line 165. &quot;79% of cells express Gria1&quot;. Does this mean that 21% of cells express truncated GluA1 due to CRISPR or are knocked out?</p><p>Line 195. The authors conclude no significant alteration in GluA1-HT function based on no significant difference in Figure 1G. However, with this comprehensive standard error, it is challenging to conclude no biological difference. The authors need to show this with a more robust system, for example, transfected HEK cells that do not express AMPARs endogenously.</p><p>Line 202. Figure 2A. It is helpful to understand the significance of this method by showing the JF646 channel for comparison of steady vs. block-chase protocol.</p><p>Line 242. I agree that neuronal activity induces GluA1 trafficking to synapses, but not sure whether the phenomenon ties with LTP. During LTP, only AMPAR but not NMDAR is increased. If the authors aim to tie the phenomena to LTP, the authors need to show AMPAR specificity. Otherwise, tone down.</p><p>Line 316. Overall, the discovery of F-actin involvement is interesting, and the result is robust. However, if the authors try to tie this to AMPAR insertion during LTP, it is critical to show the dynamic of NMDAR or other receptors that do not move upon neuronal activation.</p><p>Line 409. As the authors conclude, &quot;actin polymerization as the mechanism that mediates stimulation-dependent GluA1 vesicle confinement&quot; that is observed upon the neuronal activity, testing effects of actin polymerization as well as myosin activation on excitatory synaptic transmission broaden the impact of this study, if the authors meant to propose this as one of LTP mechanisms.</p><p>Line 467. As stated in the comment on line 195, the authors need to show the activity of GluA1-HT-SEP using heterologous cells lacking endogenous AMPARs.</p><p>Figures. Images for colocalization require high magnification of one dendrite as an inset. For example, I thought that GluA1 and GluA1-HT should colocalize perfectly in Figure 1E, but it looks not.</p><p>Discussion can be shortened to highlight the main points. Since this is the first manuscript to show a novel robust approach, it is better to discuss both pros and cons of this approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80622.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The new technology needs to be better validated.</p><p>1a: The rate of point mutations and indel formation by HITI-knockin are not validated.

We find that indels occur at a low rate (9.8% of HaloTag knock-in cells contain an indel at the 5’ end and 11.2% at the 3’ end) and that HaloTag is inserted in the correct orientation. Likewise, point mutations occurred with low frequency (2.4% of HaloTag knock-in cells contained a point mutation at the 5’ end and 2.8% at the 3’ end). We have included this information, as well as the technique used to sequence HaloTag insertions, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and in the methods (Methods, lines 2198-2212). In addition, we further address the drawbacks of using HITI in the discussion (Discussion, lines 571-578).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b: Colocalization assay of HT-GluA1 and GluA1 should be performed with better quality and other receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated co-immunofluorescence labeling experiments for HaloTag (GluA1-HT) and GluA1, and imaged samples using stimulation emission depletion (STED) microscopy with a pixel size of 20 nm (we were able to distinguish structures with a resolution of 60-75 nm depending on the emission wavelength). We have included high resolution images in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A. We demonstrate strong colocalization between HaloTag and GluA1 in edited neurons at these length scales. Moreover, we performed co-immunofluorescence labeling assays on GluA1-HT/untagged GluA1 and other postsynaptic density markers, including NMDARs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-D). The colocalization between HaloTag and GluA1 is much stronger than between HaloTag and NMDARs. We find that both HaloTag and GluA1 exhibit poor colocalization to NMDARs at length scales resolvable by STED, similar to what others have described previously (Goncalves et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c: The activity of GluA1-HT-SEP and GluA1-HT need to be characterized using heterologous cells lacking endogenous AMPARs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have characterized the activity of GluA1-HT and GluA1-HT-SEP by expressing these receptors in HEK293T cells, which do not express GluA1, and performing whole-cell patch clamping assays (Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2).

These results are consistent with our previous observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2c: The uncaging strength appeared to be not characterized.

We demonstrate that the laser strength we used for MNI-glutamate uncaging specifically induces calcium influx at the targeted spine. Moreover, we show that spine expansion is induced specifically at the targeted spine by our uncaging protocol, and not at neighboring spines. We have added additional detail to describe our photostimulation protocols in the methods (Methods, lines 2420-2449).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experiments using Tractin (Figure 4) needs to be validated with a different method, as tractin can cause an artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have performed phalloidin labeling on fixed neurons after cLTP stimulation and imaged phalloidin with STED microscopy (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). We find that neurons treated with cLTP have greater phalloidin labeling, and also exhibit more F-actin fibers. Neurons that are treated with LatA during cLTP have very poor labeling, demonstrating that cLTP stimulates actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Additional validation (Figure 5), such as shRNA or CRISPR-knockdown, is required for the involvement of myosin (currently only a single pharmacological condition is used).</p></disp-quote><p>Portions of Figure 5 describing the effect of myosin inhibition on vesicle motion have been modified and moved to the supplemental materials (now Figure 3—figure supplement 6) to improve the clarity of the main figures and text. To better validate the role of myosin, we have used dominant negative C-terminal domains of myosin Va, Vb, and VI (Correia et al., 2008) to test whether inhibiting cargo interactions between GluA1-HT vesicles and myosin disrupt cLTP-mediated reductions in motion (Figure 3—figure supplement 6). Similar to pharmacological myosin inhibition, we find that disrupting myosin did not attenuate the reduction of GluA1-HT vesicle motion in response to cLTP. In addition, we recapitulate the effect of pharmacological myosin inhibition on the directional bias of GluA1-HT vesicles by showing that expressing the dominant negative domains of myosin Va and Vb (but not VI) disrupts the change in directional bias we observe after cLTP (Figure 6—figure supplement 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The relevance of the finding with LTP should be toned down.

More specifically, we clarify that our protocols stimulate neuronal activity, and that we induce structural plasticity by MNI-glutamate uncaging. Moreover, we clarify the difference between structural and functional plasticity (Introduction, lines 51-54, and Results, lines 235-240).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>- This story relies on the fact that Halo tag protein faithfully represents the GluA1 protein localization.

By applying gaussian fits to fluorescence intensity line profiles drawn through GluA1 and HaloTag signals, we resolved spots separated by less than 100 nm, which is less than the average distance that we and others have observe between GluA1 and other postsynaptic density markers (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A; Goncalves et al., 2020). At these length scales, we find very strong colocalization between HaloTag and GluA1 in knock-in cells. As an internal control, we find weak colocalization between HaloTag/untagged GluA1 and NMDARs (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- This story also relies on the fact that the author's system can clearly distinguish GluA1-HT vesicles from surface GluA1-HT (line 208).

In HILO microscopy, the laser is applied to sample at a sharp angle to improve optical sectioning and suppress out of focus signals from outside the illuminated volume (Tokunaga et al., 2008). However, we agree it is difficult to fully exclude signal from the surface, especially because the dendrite is not always flat. We have performed additional experiments to better distinguish surface GluA1-HT from vesicular GluA1-HT (Figure 1—figure supplement 6C). First, we tracked and characterized GluA1-HT labeled with cell-membrane impermeable JF<sub>549</sub>i-HTL (i.e., only surface GluA1-HT). We find that these particles bleach in 4 steps or fewer, within 100 frames (Figure 1—figure supplement 6B, images and line graph). Importantly, almost none of these particles exhibit active transport, demonstrating that they are not in vesicles (Figure 1—figure supplement 6C, bar graph), and generally have a higher diffusion coefficient than all GluA1-HT particles (0.22 ± 0.23 μm<sup>2</sup>/s versus 0.16 ± 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s; Figure 1—figure supplement 6C, histogram). In addition, to exclude signal that might be clusters of GluA1-HT trapped in synapses (but appear in the dendritic shaft because of poor optical sectioning), we have tracked GluA1-HT particles that colocalize to GFP-Homer1c in neurons that contain GluA1-HT knock-ins and also express GFP-Homer1c. We find GluA1-HT particles that colocalize with GFP-Homer1c have significantly lower diffusion coefficients than all GluA1-HT particles (0.01 ± 0.009 μm<sup>2</sup>/s; Figure 1—figure supplement 7). Consequently, we filtered out all particles with a diffusion coefficient below 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s from our analysis. We have added greater details for how vesicles were identified into the methods (Methods, lines 2373-2389). Using our particle tracking pipeline (MatLab code available in the materials), we first manually inspected all spots to ensure tracks are accurately reconstructed. We then removed particles clearly localized inside spines for the majority of steps in their trajectories. We then filtered all particles that exhibit active transport based on HMM-Bayes analysis. After this, we examined all particles that exhibit only diffusive motion, and further filtered out particles that bleach in fewer than 100 frames. Lastly, we filtered particles based on their diffusion coefficient. We considered particles with a diffusion coefficient greater than 0.45 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (one standard deviation greater than the average diffusion coefficient for GluA1-HT on the cell surface) to be on the cell surface and below 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s to possibly be receptors inside PSDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- D versus DV is the most critical concept of this paper analyzed in the rest of the study.

For this parameter to be used, there must be little overlap between the motion of GluA1-HT vesicles and surface GluA1-HT. For example, in Figure 7 supplements C and D, how did the authors distinguish diffusion versus active? Authors could use surface GluA1-HT (using a membrane-impermeable tag or SEP) motion to analyze the data. The above point is very important as surface GluA1 is also known to be trapped upon LTP (Opazo et al. 2010) and we need to be sure that authors are looking at GluA1-HT vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>We used HMM-Bayes to infer whether a particle exhibits diffusion or active transport based on the step size and processivity of the particle (Monnier, 2015). HMM-Bayes was previously validated by applying it to infer the motion of simulated particles and particles with characterized motion (Monnier, 2015). We also tested the accuracy of HMM-Bayes by comparing parameters calculated by HMM-Bayes versus MSDanalyzer (Tarantino et al., 2014; Figure 1—figure supplement 5E).</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree that further experimental evidence is important to demonstrate inferences about motion states made by HMM-Bayes are accurate. To address this issue, we have tracked GluA1-HT particles labeled with cell-membrane impermeable JF<sub>549</sub>i-HTL as they should not exhibit active transport (i.e., GluA1-HT particles on the cell surface; Figure 1—figure supplement 6C). In these experiments, very few particles exhibit DV and on average have a higher diffusion coefficient than particles labeled with cell-membrane permeable JF<sub>549</sub>-HTL (i.e., particles both on the surface and in vesicles and the secretory pathway). GluA1-HT-JF<sub>549</sub>i particles that exhibit DV likely reflect those that have been endocytosed. Particles that colocalize with GFP-Homer1c have very low diffusion coefficients and thus were excluded from analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 7, see previous comment). To further demonstrate that particles exhibiting DV require motor-based transport, we treated neurons with Nocodazole, and find a near total loss of particles exhibiting DV parallel to the length of the dendrite (Figure 1—figure supplement 5H). Although we demonstrate that LatA treatment blocks short-ranged active transport of vesicles to their exocytic sites (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2), it does not disrupt active transport along the length of dendritic shaft and thus would not be an appropriate treatment to demonstrate that particles exhibiting DV require active transport.</p><p>In the case of Figure 7—figure supplement 1 (now called Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), we find HMM-Bayes sometimes predicts a multi-state particle exhibits diffusion despite having highly direct motion, albeit with relatively low probability. This is exclusively an issue with multi-state vesicles that appear to have directed motion but with small step sizes. In other words, HMM-Bayes can sometimes underestimate the processivity of multi-state vesicles, and assign diffusion rather than active transport. To address this issue, we segmented multi-state vesicles that exhibit ambiguity in their motion and analyzed each state separately using HMM-Bayes and MSDanalyzer (Tarantino et al., 2014; Methods, lines 2366-2370). We have reassigned these multi-state vesicles based on whether they exhibit DV. To avoid confusion, we have changed the figure to reflect multi-state vesicles that exhibit either purely diffusive motion or a combination of diffusion and active transport rather than classify vesicles based on their diffusion coefficient (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Lastly, we now abbreviate active transport as “AT” to avoid conflating DV with active transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The neurons used in some of the experiments are in poor condition. In Figure 3A, the bright spot where uncaging was performed does not look like a spine. It does not make sense that the spine would look so much brighter than the dendrite when the cell is just labeled with cytosolic GFP. Did authors really uncage at dendritic spines? I would like to see all other original images of the uncaging experiment so that I am convinced. Also, the authors need to establish a proper uncaging condition where the stimulation of a single spine elicits epsc of reasonable size in the cell body. How long was the spine enlargement maintained? In order to say LTP, the change must be maintained at least for 30 min or so but I cannot see the information. When was the image taken after uncaging? It may be hidden somewhere in the method but the authors need to make an effort to make it more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed images of unhealthy dendrites from Figure 3 (now Figure 2) and replaced them with images from a healthy, spiny dendrite. We have also removed SPT and spine expansion data from any neurons that appear unhealthy, and replaced these with data from healthy neurons. Raw images for uncaging experiments have been included for inspection.</p><p>We have toned down the relevance between our results and LTP, and instead focused on structural plasticity. Data on the duration of spine enlargement can now be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A. Spine images were taken immediately before and after sLTP stimulation. After taking an image of the post-sLTP spine, we immediately commenced particle imaging. To demonstrate that spine enlargement was persistent, we performed a series of experiments where we imaged the spine and particles 10 minutes after the cessation of sLTP (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). We have made this information more prominent in the text (Results, lines 244-246 and lines 257-260), and added greater detail describing our photostimulation methods (Methods, lines 2420-2449).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

However, we have decided to tone down the relevance of our work to LTP and focus on neuronal activity and structural plasticity, and thus this line has been removed. We have added more recent references describing AMPAR trafficking in the context of plasticity, including more recent reviews (Groc and Choquet, 2020; Choquet and Opazo, 2022; Bonnet et al., 2023; Getz et al., 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Figure 2E (also Figure 4): where have entries of GluA1-vesicles into dendritic spines been observed or were they removed from the analysis? I also have not found them in other given examples and videos.</p></disp-quote><p>We have largely removed signal in spines from analysis, as these signals are immobile and likely represent GluA1-HT particles (not vesicles) that have been captured in postsynaptic densities. We have added supplemental materials to explain this further (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). One exception to this filter is if a vesicle moves from the dendritic shaft into a spine by active transport and if the majority of steps in the trajectory are outside of the spine. Nevertheless, we find very few vesicles are transported directly into spines in our image acquisition. We believe that these events are rare (Tao-Cheng et al., 2011), and that the majority exocytic events occur in extrasynaptic space (Lin et al., 2007; Makino et al., 2009; Patterson et al., 2010). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that these events do occur, and indeed because we sparsely label GluA1-HT, we only sample a fraction of the total GluA1-HT vesicles. It would be interesting to further examine the rates of spine entry by GluA1 vesicles in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Lane 240: term sub-diffusion is somewhat confusing. Perhaps replace by confined diffusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to keep the term “subdiffusion” as it has been historically used to describe the plateauing mean square diffusion characteristic of particles with constrained motion (Figure 1—figure supplement 10). Although “confined diffusion” is also an accurate description, we wish to avoid confusing this terminology with “confinement”, which we define in our work as “the restriction of vesicle motion away from its initial position” (Results, lines 211-212). We have defined subdiffusion more clearly in the text (Results, lines 207-209) and included references with its usage (Feder et al., 1996; Saxton, 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Figure 3C: What is the rationale behind defining dendritic zones? Is it based on pre-existing knowledge from the literature, ie. the length of dendrite within which synapses can cluster? Also, in Figure 2 Homer-GFP is used as a synaptic marker. What is the reason to switch to the GFP cell fill in Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We divided the dendrites into 3 equal sections based on proximity to the stimulated spine because we felt this approach would not bias analysis in a particular region of the dendrite (Results, lines 247-250, and Methods, lines 2384-2389). We find that our uncaging protocol does not induce calcium influx or plasticity in neighboring spines (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and thus felt activity in neighboring spines would not contribute significantly to changing motion in the dendritic shaft near the uncaging site. Consequently, we did not consider the distribution of neighboring spines when segmenting the dendrite. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to further investigate how trafficking in the dendritic shaft is affected based on how synapses are clustered.</p><p>We used GFP as a neuronal fill instead of GFP-Homer1c because changes in spine morphology are not readily observed in response to stimulation in cells expressing GFP-Homer1c. This is because spine GFP-Homer1c is stably anchored in postsynaptic densities. Consequently, even as the spine expands, we do not see a dramatic change in the shape of GFP-Homer1c signal. Others have also found that scaffolding protein concentrations do not increase significantly in response to stimulation (Bosch et al., 2014). By contrast, GFP diffuses throughout the spine as it expands, allowing us to easily observe changes in spine size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 3: Glutamate uncaging results in elevated calcium levels. Depending on the stimulation strength it is limited to the activated spine or spreads out into a parent dendrite. I am wondering how far calcium signals spread in these experiments. This would be important to know as actin dynamics and myosin activity is controlled by calcium signalling. Is there a correlation between calcium spread with an area of increased actin polymerization and a zone with reduced AMPAR vesicle motility?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have added a supplemental figure to describe the calibration of MNI-glutamate uncaging (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Using GCaMP6s, we find that calcium influx is primarily limited to the targeted spine, and thus do not find a correlation between actin polymerization and the spread of calcium signaling. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that some calcium below the detection limit of GCaMP6s spreads through the dendritic shaft. Moreover, it is possible that calcium signaling is propagated through the dendritic shaft by CaMKII or other calcium-dependent signaling proteins. It would be interesting to examine the relationship between calcium signal propagation and the origin of actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure 4, tractin experiments: I am not very convinced by the use of tractin as an F-actin probe. In the given representative images, there are very obvious actin cables in dendrites upon overexpression of F-tractin. This might be an artifact induced by overexpression. Please include another method of actin labeling. There are very nice recent tools available (i.e. CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous actin). Although they also label G-actin, when imaged at high magnification various F-actin-based structures are quite easy to visualize.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this very important point to our attention.

This is not typical. Can such redistribution be reproduced by staining endogenous F-actin? For example, with fluorescently labelled Phalloidin?</p></disp-quote><p>Although, F-actin networks have been previously observed in dendrites (E D’Este et al., 2015; Lavoie-Cardinal et al., 2020), the F-actin networks we observe after cLTP appear somewhat different. These differences may be due to tractin, but also because we use a lower resolution imaging technique (Airyscan in this work versus STED in previous studies). Consequently, we have performed F-actin labeling in fixed neurons after cLTP with phalloidin and imaged with STED microscopy (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). Although the F-actin fibers in the dendritic shaft are not as pronounced, we do observe an increase in F-actin fibers and overall phalloidin labeling in the dendritic shaft after cLTP. This increase in phalloidin labeling is due to increased F-actin, as it can be blocked with LatA treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

It is unclear why some neurons express <italic>Gria1</italic> from only one allele, but it may be in part due to the stochastic nature of transcription, which occurs in bursts (Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008 for review). It is also possible for HITI to introduce indels (Suzuki et al., 2016). Consequently, we have added supplemental material demonstrating that HITI introduces indels into <italic>Gria1</italic> at low frequencies (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). We also find that the fraction of neurons with two ATS in edited cultures is similar to untransfected cultures (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), indicating that HITI does not often knock-out or truncate GluA1.

I agree that neuronal activity induces GluA1 trafficking to synapses, but not sure whether the phenomenon ties with LTP. During LTP, only AMPAR but not NMDAR is increased.

Otherwise, tone down.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the language to reflect GluA1 vesicle trafficking in the context of single spine plasticity rather than long-term potentiation (LTP). We continue to use the cLTP and sLTP as short-hands for the stimulation protocols used to induce plasticity, as these terms have historically been ascribed to these protocols. However, we clarify that cLTP and sLTP are used here to induce neuronal activity and structural plasticity, respectively, rather than LTP. We have included additional references to works which previously demonstrated that these stimulation protocols have been used to probe functional plasticity, and that structural plasticity is strongly associated with functional plasticity (Results, lines 235-240; Matsuzaki et al., 2001; Matsuzaki et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009; Patterson and Yasuda, 2011; Huganir and Nicoll, 2013; Bosch et al., 2014; Kruijssen and Wierenga, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 316.
