continuous evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) and the ability of the virus to transmit among vaccinated pigs. Studies that have simultaneously assessed the impact of vaccination on the emergence of IAV reassortment and genetic variation in pigs are limited. Here, we directly sequenced 28 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, and characterized 202 individual viral plaques recovered from 13 BALF samples. We identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, we found that prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, our results highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Swine influenza A viruses cause severe illness among pigs and financial losses on pig farms worldwide. These viruses can also infect humans and have caused deadly human pandemics in the past. Influenza A viruses are dangerous because viruses can be transferred between humans, birds and pigs.

The vaccines are regularly updated to match circulating virus strains. But the virus evolves rapidly to escape vaccine-induced immunity, and infections are common even in vaccinated pigs.

In pigs infected with both the H1N1 and H3N2 strains of influenza, the two viruses began trading genes within a week. But less genetic mixing occurred in vaccinated and boosted pigs because they spent less time infected with both viruses than in unvaccinated pigs. The vaccination status of the pig did not have much effect on how many new mutations occurred in the viruses.</p><p>The experiments show that vaccinating and boosting pigs against influenza A viruses may protect against genetic swapping among influenza viruses.

In the United States, IAV infection causes a significant disease burden on the healthcare system and society, resulting in 12,000â61,000 human deaths plus estimated losses of $11.2 billion annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centers for Disease control and Prevention, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Putri et al., 2018</xref>). IAV infections in pigs are also considered one of the top disease concerns for the US swine industry when influenza-induced respiratory disease severely reduces pig health and subsequently the pork producersâ profitability and sustainability. Human and swine share the same IAV subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ryt-Hansen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>), which have similar tangled evolutionary histories contributing to the bidirectional transmission of IAV between both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). Pigs pose a risk for generating novel IAV strains with zoonotic and pandemic potential, which represents an unpredictable threat to both the swine industry and global public health.</p><p>IAV exhibits an extraordinary ability for cross-species transmission and immune evasion by continually expanding its genetic diversity through antigenic drift and shift. This genetic diversity permits the rapid evolution of IAV, maximizing the virusâs opportunity to remain viable following significant changes in the environment and making the use of vaccines extremely difficult for disease prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin and Brooke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sandbulte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vincent et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, minimizing IAV diversity should be a key strategy for One Health purposes to efficiently control IAV transmission between humans and pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017</xref>). As swine are susceptible to avian, human, and swine-origin influenza virus, IAV introduction from multiple hosts immensely enriches the genetic pool of swine IAV and is responsible for the emergence of distinct H1 and H3 IAV lineages during the last 20 years in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). The distribution of IAV receptors in the swine respiratory tract also promotes IAV co-infections with strains from various hosts and facilitates virus reassortment that may result in new viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Van Reeth, 2007</xref>). A mathematical model estimated an overall probability of a co-infection event in a farrow-to-finish pig farm, possibly leading to reassortment, to be 16.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cador et al., 2017</xref>). This estimate seems reasonable given that the recurrent and co-circulation of distinct IAV subtypes within swine herds is quite common and that over 74 different H1 genotypes have been detected in the US pig population alone from 2009 to 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nirmala et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rose et al., 2013</xref>). With such diverse viral populations, swine should be considered one of the potential sources for novel IAV variants of zoonotic and pandemic infections. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (H1N1pdm09), a reassortant virus that originated in pigs, contained gene segments of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses that led to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garten et al., 2009</xref>). Within the first year of circulation, between 151,700 and 575,400 people died worldwide due to the 2009 H1N1 virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019</xref>). Due to the continued evolution, the H1N1pdm09 virus has generated a complex hemagglutinin (HA) clade system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h1n1pdm/ha/12y">https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h1n1pdm/ha/12y</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadfield et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the H1N1pdm09 virus has further reassorted with endemic IAV strains in pigs and has generated reassortants with distinct genetic constellations in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Charoenvisal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">RajÃ£o et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Some reassortants of specific genotypes have already become the predominant circulating strains in swine populations and have caused fatal infections in people in contact with pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resende et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Vaccination against IAV is the primary measure to prevent influenza in pigs. In the United States, influenza vaccination is implemented in over 80% of large breeding herds and more than 95% of breeding females in these herds receive at least two doses of vaccines before their first farrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">USDA, 2016</xref>). Even though live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and RNA-based influenza vaccines have recently been licensed in the United States, whole-cell inactivated vaccines with oil-based adjuvants are still the most common vaccine types in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aphis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Reeth and Ma, 2013</xref>). To maximize cross-protective immunity against multiple viruses circulating in pig herds, most commercial vaccines contain multiple antigenically distinct IAV strains. However, IAV breakthrough infections are common in pigs as the virus evolves rapidly to escape host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in the circulation of the virus in vaccinated herds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chamba Pardo et al., 2021</xref>). Besides, the mismatch between vaccine and field strains raises concerns about the vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), which has been reported in pigs vaccinated with a univalent whole inactivated vaccine (WIV) and experimentally challenged with a heterologous virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khurana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">RajÃ£o et al., 2016</xref>). VAERD is attributed to non-neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines failing to neutralize the virus and instead exacerbate virus replication and disease enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khurana et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, understanding how immunity induced by swine IAV vaccination shapes within-host virus evolution in pigs is key to controlling the disease and the emergence of novel antigenic variants. Previous studies have characterized the IAV mutational spectra within naÃ¯ve and vaccinated pigs and other mammals to simulate the impact of immune pressure on within-host diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoelzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCrone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>). However, in vivo studies that explore how vaccination impacts reassortment between multiple subtypes of IAVs in pigs are lacking. Besides, most of the knowledge on IAV within-host diversity in pigs so far is based on samples taken from nasal cavities and studies that quantified the IAV within-host variation in pig lungs are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Illingworth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that tissue tropism plays a vital role in IAV dissemination along the swine respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), with the pig lungs harboring IAV populations with the most extensive genomic variations, the effect of immune pressure on IAV within-host diversity may differ by anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takayama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, in vivo studies are needed to provide an integrated picture of how vaccine-induced immunity affects IAV evolutionary trajectories occurring in the swine lower respiratory tract by evaluating the extent of IAV reassortment and mutational spectra taking place concurrently in naÃ¯ve and vaccinated pigs.</p><p>We previously published a vaccine-challenge study assessing IAV infections in pigs vaccinated with five distinct prime-boost vaccine combinations after simultaneous infection with both an H1N1 and an H3N2 IAV strain using a seeder pig model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from the aforementioned study enabled us to evaluate, in this study, how IAV reassorts and mutates in the swine lower respiratory tract under immune pressure. We hypothesized that the dual-subtype IAV co-infection model better represents the conditions of IAV co-infection encountered in the field and that the findings could contribute to the body of knowledge of within-host virus evolution in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nirmala et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we performed next-generation sequencing directly on BALF samples and IAV plaques purified from the BALF samples to identify the virus mutations and reassortment that happened in swine lungs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specimen collection and background information</title><p>The BALF specimens utilized in this study originated from a previously published vaccine-challenge study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We used a co-infection challenge model that attempted to simulate more realistic field settings by commingling two infected seeder pigs, one inoculated with an H1N1 (A/swine/Minnesota/PAH-618/2011) and the other with an H3N2 (A/swine/Minnesota/080470/2015) influenza virus, with 10 other contact pigs in the same room to attempt simultaneous infection to both strains using a natural transmission route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 14 seeder pigs and 70 in-contact pigs were distributed into seven rooms. The two challenge viruses contained clade 1A 3.3.3 gamma (H1N1) or clade 3.2010.1 human-like (H3N2) HA, which represent the major circulating strains in the US pig industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aphis, 2022</xref>). Three licensed IAV vaccines were used in the study, including a commercial (COM) quadrivalent WIV, an autogenous (AUT) trivalent WIV, or a bivalent LAIV. The protective effect of four different WIV combinations (including COM/COM, AUT/AUT, AUT/COM, and COM/AUT) and positive control treatment (NO VAC/CHALL) was evaluated in 50 pigs that had been distributed evenly in groups of 2 pigs per treatment to each of five rooms. Another 20 pigs received two different administrations of the LAIV (LAIV/COM and LAIV/NONE), and pigs were distributed evenly in groups of 5 per treatment to each of the two rooms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagram showing the seeder pig infection model.</title><p>Fourteen naÃ¯ve pigs (seeder pigs) were either challenged using an H1N1 or an H3N2 virus and evenly distributed in pairs into seven rooms at approximately 48 hr post inoculation. Two seeder pigs (one H1N1 seeder and one H3N2 seeder) served as the infection sources and commingled with 10 treatment pigs within each room. The treatment pigs had been vaccinated using different vaccine combinations of a commercial multivalent whole inactivated vaccine (COM), an autogenous multivalent whole inactivated vaccine (AUT), or a bivalent live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from all treatment pigs were collected at necropsy (7 days post contact [DPC] with the seeder pigs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> has been adapted from Figure 1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref> created by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com/">BioRender.com</ext-link>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78618-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The four WIV administrations significantly decreased virus shedding, and details of the results can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, there were significant differences in IAV average real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) Ct values or virus titers (TCID50/ml) between the NO VAC/CHA group and the WIV treatment groups in nasal swabs and BALF samples at most time points. There were no differences in shedding between the four WIV groups except for the COM/COM group that had significantly lower Ct values in lungs compared to AUT/COM and AUT/AUT groups. In addition, delivering a COM vaccine boost to pigs following a single LAIV administration provided better protection and significantly decreased virus shedding in the nasal cavities and lungs. Even though we could not perform direct statistical comparisons on vaccine protection between WIV and LAIV treatment groups as they represented two independent parts of the study, similar IAV loads and shedding patterns were observed among all WIV and LAIV/COM groups and between NO VAC/CHALL and LAIV/NONE groups. The HA sequencing data of nasal swabs and BALF samples revealed that more contact pigs were infected with the H3 subtype than with the H1 IAV subtype for all treatment groups, except for the IAV infections reported in the lungs of NO VAC/CHALL and LAIV/NONE pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, there were 70 BALF samples from the treatment pigs collected at necropsy 7 days post contact (DPC) with the seeder pigs. Also, 28 of the BALF samples were successfully sequenced and their genomes were used to identify IAV mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To identify IAV reassortants in vaccinated and nonvaccinated pigs, we performed plaque assays on BALF samples from pigs in three rooms (two rooms containing WIV treatment pigs and one room containing LAIV treatment pigs). These rooms were selected because seeder pigs shed IAV in enough quantities to transmit it to in-contact pigs. There were 13 BALF samples that could be used for plaque isolation, yielding a total of 202 IAV plaques (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Based on the vaccination regime, treatment pigs were grouped into PRIME BOOST (with COM/COM, AUT/AUT, COM/AUT, and LAIV/COM pigs), SINGLE LAIV (LAIV/NONE pigs), and NO VAC (NO VAC/CHALL pigs) groups and used for further analysis. No matter for IAV mutation or reassortment identification, PRIME BOOST pigs had significantly higher specific antibody responses against both H1 and H3 challenge viruses than SINGLE LAIV and NO VAC pigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our overall hypothesis was that vaccination helps reduce the risk of IAV co-infection in pigs and decreases the number and diversity of genotypes of reassortant viruses generated in pig lungs. At the same time, vaccine-induced immunity may drive variant selection on IAV genomes, which could affect the within-host genetic diversity and expand the antigenic diversity of IAV populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Number of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples available for direct sequencing or plaque purification from each group.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Group</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">Vaccination</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">No. samples sequenced/ total</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Average Ct value (range)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Average coverage on H1N1 consensus genome (SD ) <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2">*</xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Average coverage on H3N2 consensus genome (SD)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">No. samples assayed to obtain purified plaques/total <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">â </xref></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Vaccination protocol <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">â¡</xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Prime</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Boost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="5">PRIME BOOST</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM/COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">22.47 (17.83â27.58)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8397 (722)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12,897 (1329)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3/4 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">AUT/AUT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AUT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AUT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">26.12<break/>(NA )</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3192<break/>(NA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7769<break/>(NA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0/4 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM/AUT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AUT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">31.10<break/>(30.88â31.31)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">18,267<break/>(NA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5784<break/>(6318)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0/4 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">LAIV/COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LAIV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">COM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">26.74<break/>(20.30â30.63)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">415<break/>(NA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">18,209<break/>(12333)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2/5 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">In total</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12/40 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">25.64<break/>(17.83â31.31)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7733<break/>(6829)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">13,069<break/>(8611)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5/17 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SINGLE LAIV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LAIV/NONE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LAIV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Saline</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">22.84<break/>(17.76â29.84)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9322<break/>(4090)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9009<break/>(5513)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4/5 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">NO VAC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NO VAC/CHA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Saline</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Saline</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7/10 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">21.17<break/>(14.97â27.73)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7699<break/>(4406)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9775<break/>(1057)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4/4 pigs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">In total</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">28/60 pigs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">23.62<break/>(14.97â31.31)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8306<break/>(4801)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11,281<break/>(6972)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">13/26 pigs</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Ct, cycle threshold;

About 4.4% (16/364) of H3N2 SNVs were presented at the consensus level, which was less than the SNVs presented for the H1N1 virus (p=0.007, chi-square test).

changes in multiple pigs even if the pigs are housed in different rooms, which would suggest a sign of convergent evolution. There were 0, 1 (PB1 V632A), and 2 (HA A242G and PB2 N562I) amino acid changes of H1N1 viruses in at least two PRIME BOOST, SINGLE LAIV, and NO VAC pigs from different rooms, respectively. For the H3N2 virus, we only identified NA G143R in NO VAC pigs from multiple rooms. We performed the permutation test for each treatment group to evaluate whether the number of shared amino acid site changes observed in pigs from multiple rooms was more than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). However, we found that the shared polymorphisms in pigs of all three treatment groups were no more than expected by chance for both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, except for the weak genome convergence of H3N2 viruses observed in NO VAC pigs (permutation in 100% IAV genome: p=0.03536, 70% IAV genome: p=0.04907). As the permutation test was based on the assumption that all the four shared amino acid changes identified in multiple pigs from different rooms were developed independently, the presence of IAV shared polymorphisms in pigs may even be more scarce if any of them was the minor variant transmitted from the seeders. Overall, we observed limited shared diversity in H1N1 and H3N2 IAV detected in vaccinated pigs, which shows a minimal effect of vaccination on the degree of IAV convergence in pigs from the different rooms for either the H1N1 or the H3N2 virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Within-pig nucleotide polymorphisms and evolutionary rates of H1N1 and H3N2 viral populations are similar regardless of vaccination status</title><p>We calculated the nucleotide diversity (Pi, average number of pairwise nucleotide differences per site) to measure the degree of genetic variation for the H1N1 and H3N2 viral populations within pigs from the different treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, neither the H1N1 nor the H3N2 viruses from any pig, regardless of treatment group, had statistically significant Pi differences at individual coding regions or in all coding regions combined (i.e., whole genome).

To better mimic field scenarios, we set up an in vivo co-infection model where we challenged naÃ¯ve pigs with either an H1N1 (gamma clade 1A.3.3.3) or an H3N2 (human-like clade 3.2010.1) virus belonging to the dominant subtypes and lineages identified during US pig surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). Pigs were co-housed in contact with nonvaccinated pigs or pigs vaccinated by licensed multivalent vaccines following multiple vaccination protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The co-infection model allowed us to simultaneously assess the IAV genetic variation and reassortment under immune pressure in pigs and provided a rare view of the full impact of vaccination on IAV evolution. The dataset includes pigs with different levels of virus shedding and immune responses that help us define factors that affect IAV evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We directly sequenced and performed the isolation of viral plaques on selected BALF samples without additional virus propagation in cells to ensure that no mutation or reassortants were developed during cell culture. Our results suggested that the pigs receiving two doses of vaccines (PRIME BOOST) had a lower proportion of IAV reassortants in fewer days when the pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses compared to nonvaccinated pigs. A significant number of mutations with abundant functional relevant amino acid changes were present within pigs in H1N1 and H3N2 viral populations regardless of vaccination status. However, we did not detect a major effect of vaccination on IAV within-host diversity as there were few antigenic variants detected in the IAV populations, and we found no differences in the number and frequency of identified SNVs, the evolutionary rates, nor in the nucleotide diversity of IAV in pigs of the different treatment groups.</p><p>Within the 7 days of the study period, we identified a large number of IAV reassortants with multiple distinct genotypes in the pigs that had been co-infected with the H1 and H3 viruses. This finding is particularly notable when considering the complex ecosystem and management practices implemented in swine farms, and the pigs with various vaccination and infection statuses present in the farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garrido-Mantilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">White et al., 2017</xref>). The fluidity of ages and immune statuses of the pigs in swine farms enable viruses to continually infect susceptible pigs and create an ideal breeding ground for IAV to reassort and circulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diaz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chamba Pardo et al., 2018</xref>). Given the background that the coexistence of viruses with distinct lineages and genotypes is common in pig populations, the frequency of IAV reassortment could be extensive, especially considering that most of the pigs need to be housed approximately for 24â26 weeks in farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nirmala et al., 2021</xref>). Our study provides initial evidence that vaccination can play a role in decreasing the generation and emergence of new reassortant viruses in pigs. These results, if confirmed in field conditions, show the significance of IAV vaccination in pig populations not only by restricting the virus circulation and clinical impact but also by reducing the IAV genotypic diversity that is important for the overall IAV control at the humanâanimal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dwyer and Kirkland, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The factors driving reassortment are complicated, and for IAV reassortment to occur two parental viruses need to reach multiple criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lowen, 2018</xref>). The co-infection of distinct IAV viruses at the cellular level is an essential prerequisite for IAV reassortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marshall et al., 2013</xref>). Numerous factors affecting IAV cellular co-infections have been elucidated in vitro or under experimental conditions, including the IAV challenge dose, the time interval between primary and secondary infection, and the location of initial virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tao et al., 2014</xref>). Our study found that pigs co-infected for a longer duration tended to generate more reassortants, which showed that vaccination could minimize IAV reassortment by reducing the possibility of pigs being co-infected by distinct viruses. It has been shown that most IAV reassortants emerge with lower fitness compared with parental viruses, and evidence suggests that the strength of negative selection on the reassortants is positively associated with the genetic distance between their parental strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Villa and LÃ¤ssig, 2017</xref>). Tissue tropism also appears to play a role in the generation of novel reassortants in pigs, with most reassortants generated in pigs being recovered in the middle and lower respiratory tissues. In contrast, fewer reassortants were identified in the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). It is likely that the high temperature and presence of various types of sialic acid receptors in the lungs benefit infection and replication of the reassortant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), which might help explain the significant number of IAV reassortants we identified in the BALF samples of this study. We observed that the IAV internal genes were exchanged fairly easily between the two challenge, that is, parental, viruses compared to the antigenic genes. Considering the nucleotide homology of internal genes between the challenge viruses was much higher (over 90%) than that of the antigenic genes (~53%), the mismatch of package signals and functional proteins could explain these results given that these restraining factors facilitate virus reassortment between similar strains rather than in distantly related viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lowen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lowen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richard et al., 2018</xref>). Besides, there are other environmental conditions and other host factors that may affect the fitness of the reassortants in a populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lowen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The high plasticity of the IAV genome and the fast-expanding nature of IAV favors the generation of progeny virions with slightly different mutation âsignaturesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lauring and Andino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MartÃ­nez et al., 2012</xref>). Although most progeny variants have a deleterious effect on the overall fitness of the viral populations, some of the beneficial mutants may go through positive selection and can quickly dominate after sudden changes in the environment thereby shifting the fitness landscape, which may maximize the possibility of IAV to replicate in harsh conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MartÃ­nez et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, IAV may increase mutation rates at the cost of fitness to enrich the genetic pool and accumulate more beneficial variants with high frequencies favored by positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elena and SanjuÃ¡n, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sprouffske et al., 2018</xref>). In a stable environment, gaining fitness is a priority for IAV rather than the accumulation of genetic variation at the consensus level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MartÃ­nez et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, purifying selection takes place as the major selective force that continually removes new variants and generates IAV populations with a high proportion of low-frequency variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncla et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have identified that host immunity could drive positive selection on the IAV antigenic proteins in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nelson and Holmes, 2007</xref>). However, in our study, we rarely observed the inference of the same selection pressures at any coding regions for the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, which is consistent with the results of within-host diversity on H5N1 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncla et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, the within-host diversity of both subtypes was dominated by low-frequency variants and exhibited similar or higher synonymous polymorphisms compared to the nonsynonymous polymorphisms. The variation patterns of IAV suggested that the viral populations may be broadly shaped by purifying selection and genetic drift within pigs regardless of vaccination statuses. In addition to the close mutational spectra we observed on H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in pigs from various treatment groups, we detected limited shared diversity, which developed independently in at least two PRIME BOOST, SINGLE LAIV, or NO VAC pigs for both viruses. Our observation suggested that vaccination did not drive the progress of IAV genome convergence, at least in the swine lower respiratory tract, when we measured the virusâs shared diversity between pigs, which in turn reflected the limited selective forces raised by vaccination on viral within-host diversity.</p><p>The HA protein is the major target of the host adaptive immune response and crucial to IAV evolution. Within our dataset, there were few amino acid changes that fell in the H1 and H3 antigenic regions. Furthermore, the nucleotide divergence of the HA segments did not correlate with the intensity of humoral and cellular immune responses induced by vaccination. These observations are concordant with the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>, which showed the limited effect of vaccination on antigenic diversity of H3N2 viruses in humans. However, other factors like host type, IAV strain, infection dose, challenge/infection model, virus passage among animals, and observation period may cause discrepancies in the results of selection of the antigenic variants between the studies that explore the influence of immune pressure on IAV within-host diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoelzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, we did not find evidence that vaccination influenced IAV genetic variation in the lower respiratory tract of pigs. The observation of our study aligns with the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>, which suggested that vaccine-induced immunity had a minimal impact on the genetic variation of IAV populations in both upper and lower respiratory tracts of pigs.</p><p>Evaluating IAV evolution in vaccinated hosts is often difficult to perform. One challenge is to obtain enough qualifying samples in pigs that are well-protected by vaccination as there may be low levels of, or even no, replicating virus. The lack of virus detection in samples from vaccinated pigs may introduce sample selection bias. That is, samples from vaccinated pigs with replicating virus may represent pigs with poor immunity that may not adequately reflect the effect of vaccination on IAV within-host evolution. However, in our study this may not be the case since samples submitted for direct sequencing or plaque assay from PRIME BOOST pigs had significantly higher H1 and H3-specific antibody titers compared to SINGLE LAIV or NO VAC pigs. Besides, our findings on IAV within-host diversity in vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs agree with those of similar studies in pigs and other hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murcia et al., 2012</xref>). Our results may have also been influenced by the degree of shedding of the seeder pigs in each of the rooms as some pigs may have shed more than others, which could influence the likelihood of co-infections to occur in the in-contact pigs, biasing the likelihood of detecting reassortants. The viruses from the seeders may also contain subgenomic variants that transmit to in-contact pigs. We found that the three super-reassortant pigs (pig #4479, #4490, and #5174) came from three different rooms, which shows that IAV reassortment did not have a âroom effect.â In addition, it was not the studyâs primary aim to detect the selection of individual IAV SNVs or reassortants specific to any vaccination protocol but rather to compare the impact of vaccination on the overall evolutionary trends of virus populations in pigs. The PRIME BOOST samples analyzed in this study included samples from pigs receiving multiple prime-boost vaccination protocols. Different vaccine combinations may introduce variability in the profiles of antibody populations raised among PRIME BOOST pigs. In our study, this did not seem to cause significant differences between groups because pigs in different groups had similar HA-specific adaptive immune responses and exhibited a comparable level of protective efficacy on pigs against the challenge viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether and how the different homology between vaccine and challenge viruses, especially in prime-boost vaccination schemes, will change the IAV evolutionary process within pigs still needs further exploration. We also had a limited number of BALF samples available for plaque purification and the number of plaques isolated from each sample was not equal. Although we acknowledge this as a limitation, the overall conclusions were supported by the statistical methods employed to assess the relationship between the percent of reassortants and the treatment group at the individual pig level, which accounted for the impact of unequal sample quantity from different treatment groups and the variability of total plaques isolated from each sample. As our statistical analysis relies on the asymptotic theory, which assesses how the estimators or tests behave as the sample size becomes larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">HÃ¶pfner, 2014</xref>), further research with a larger number of samples collected from both experimental and field settings should help validate the concept of using IAV vaccines to mitigate IAV reassortment in pigs.</p><p>Finally, understanding the association between IAV vaccination and evolution is hard but necessary. IAV within-host evolution plays a vital role in disease outcomes since mutations and reassortment events can significantly influence the biological characteristics of IAV. In this study, we conclude that pig vaccination should be explored as a way to reduce the generation and emergence of reassortant viruses, and this may be particularly important in farm animals where large populations are housed together. In contrast, we did not observe the same significant effect of vaccination on IAV genetic variation. Our research results provide insights into the complexity of IAV evolution in pigs and will help develop more effective influenza control programs to mitigate the burden of IAV infections in pigs while decreasing the risk of zoonotic infections and preserving public health. We believe our study assembles a comprehensive recognition of IAV evolutionary strategies under immune pressure but does not fully reflect the situation in the field. Therefore, more studies are needed to verify the extent of IAV mutations and reassortment in vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs and understand what factors contribute to the transmission of reassortant viruses under field conditions, which is essential for developing IAV vaccines and surveillance strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vaccine-challenge experiments in pigs</title><p>All the BALF samples analyzed in this study were obtained from pigs infected using a co-infection seeder pig model using an H1N1 and an H3N2 IAV strain to evaluate the protective efficacy of different prime-boost vaccination protocols in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

After challenge, seeder pigs were kept separated by subtype until they were confirmed to be shedding IAV at 2 days post inoculation (DPI). At that time, one seeder of each subtype was placed in seven rooms to serve as the infection source of H1 and H3 viruses to 10 other pigs from different treatment groups to attempt simultaneous in-contact exposure to both strains and subsequent co-infection. The homology of nucleotides and amino acids between the genes and protein products of H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. Whole-genome sequences of the two challenge viruses have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers from MT377710 to MT377725. These deposited sequences were obtained from the nasal swabs taken from the seeder pigs (pig #5168 H1N1 seeder and pig #4947 H3N2 seeder) at 2 DPI before commingling with the rest of the pigs and used as reference sequences for variant identification. We assumed these consensus sequences are a good representation of the genomes of the two challenge viruses at the time transmission to contact pigs started. The vaccines used for different vaccination protocols included an inactivated commercial quadrivalent vaccine (COM), an inactivated autogenous trivalent vaccine (AUT), and a live-attenuated bivalent vaccine (LAIV). The AUT contains the vaccine strains with the highest HA amino acid identity with both challenge viruses (H1N1 vaccine â H1N1 challenge: 96.5%, H1N2 vaccine â H1N1 challenge: 78.6%, H3N2 vaccine â H3N2 challenge: 99.1%). In contrast, the LAIV strains had low HA amino acid identity with the challenge strains (H1N1 vaccine â H1N1 challenge: 93.3%, H3N2 vaccine â H3N2 challenge: 89.2%). While one of the H1 COM vaccine strains had high HA amino acid homology with the H1N1 challenge virus (H1N1 vaccine â H1N1 challenge: 95.1%, H1N2 vaccine â H1N1 challenge: 78.4%), both of its two H3N2 vaccine strains had low HA homology compared to the H3N2 challenge virus (H3N2 vaccine 1 â H3N2 challenge: 87.1%, H3N2 vaccine 2 â H3N2 challenge: 88.2%). The detailed information for the vaccines used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>. Seventy pigs were randomly assigned to seven treatment groups with different vaccine combinations that included four whole inactivated vaccinated (WIV) groups (COM/COM, AUT/AUT, AUT/COM, and COM/AUT), two live-attenuated vaccinated (LAIV) groups (LAIV/NONE and LAIV/COM) and one positive unvaccinated control group (NO VAC/CHA). No samples from AUT/COM pigs were used in the current study as pigs were protected by vaccination and no IAV-positive samples were obtained. Pigs were primed with the first vaccine administration at approximately 3 weeks of age, boosted at 6 weeks of age, commingled with seeder pigs at 8 weeks of age, and euthanized at 9 weeks of age. Pigs vaccinated with inactivated vaccines (COM or AUT) and the positive control groups were housed together in the same rooms and evenly distributed in five rooms (two pigs/treatment/room). Pigs receiving the LAIV treatment were evenly distributed in two rooms (five pigs/treatment/room). Each room contained 2 seeders and 10 treatment pigs for a total of 12 pigs per room. Nasal swabs were collected daily for all the pigs from 2 to 6 DPC. BALF samples were taken at necropsy at 7 DPC with the seeder pigs. HA subtyping real-time PCR was performed in all the nasal swabs and BALF samples using the VetMAX gold SIV subtyping kit (Life Technologies, Austin, TX). The methods and results for testing the BALF samples by IAV matrix gene real-time RT-PCR, virus titration, IFN-Î³ ELISPOT cell counts on the lymph nodes and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers for the serum obtained from each pig are shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2020</xref>.

This situation allowed for sufficient IAV contact exposure from the seeders to all pigs in the room, which is the prerequisite for IAV reassortment. BALF samples from pigs that yielded virus replication by virus titration (TCID50 â¥ 1.75 /ml) were used for viral plaque purification. Thirteen BALF samples yield IAV plaques that then were used to evaluate IAV reassortment happening in the naÃ¯ve and vaccinated pigs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The PCR product was checked by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cleaned up by the QIAGEN QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, USA). Purified PCR products were fragmented and tagged with the indexed adaptors using the Nextera DNA XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The sequence library was quantified by using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The barcoded library was pooled in equimolar concentrations and multiplexed and sequenced by 2 Ã 150 bp paired-ends on Illumina Nextseq 550 Mid-Output mode platform at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (UMGC). The sequence data obtained from UMGC was analyzed using the software available at the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) platform. The raw reads were assessed for sequence quality using Fast-QC and trimmed by Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrew, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>).

The command removes the adaptors and the bases with Q-score below 3 at the beginning and end of the raw reads, trimming the sequences in sliding windows of 5 base pairs and cutting the scan bases with the average Q-scores under 30. The reads were discarded if trimmed to the length below 75 bps. The trimming of the plaque sequences was performed using the same command but with different parameters: java -jar path-to-trimmomatic-0.33.jar PE input.fastq output.fastq ILLUMINACLIP: path-to-adaptor.fasta:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:36, which trimmed the raw reads with the sliding windows of 4 base pairs and cutting the scan bases with the average Q-scores under 20.

The assembled contigs were annotated by OctoFLU for the initial inspection and sorted by IAV genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Within each sample, the same IAV geneâs contigs were omitted if the sequence length was &lt;70% of the total nucleotide bases or &lt;20% of the overall k-mer coverage on corresponding IAV segments. Occasionally, the longest contigs (~1.7% of total analyzed sequences) of any plaque isolates were preserved for genotyping if no sequences covered 70% of nucleotide sites for any of their IAV segments. The consensus sequences from isolated plaques for IAV reassortant identifications were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>, and aligned with the sequences from the curated reference package from OctoFLU, and the sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses were aligned using the MUSCLE program in Geneious (version 2021.0.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>). The plaque gene segments' sources were initially checked by comparing the genetic distance between plaque sequences with the reference sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses in Geneious (version 2021.0.3). IQ-TREE was used to construct the maximum likelihood tree of each gene segment in 1000 bootstrap replicates with the best-fit nucleotide substitution model auto-detected by its curate package â ModelFinder â to further verify the origin of plaque segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). The tree files were visualized in FigTree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rambaut, 2009</xref>). Based on the origins of the eight gene segments, a genotype was assigned to each plaque isolate. A viral plaque was considered a reassortant if there were one or more gene segment substitutions of both parental H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses. A mixed genotype denomination was assigned to those reassortants from plaques that in a given gene segment had complete gene segments from both of the parental viral strains. We labeled the reassortants differently whether they had a substitution with a single gene in a given gene segment (R01âR17) or had more than one (mixed genotypes, M01âM16). The maximum likelihood tree for the sequences of each gene segment is displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Identification of within-host variants</title><p>The variant calling pipeline has been described previously elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncla et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we only identified the H1N1 (A/swine/Minnesota/PAH-618/2011) and H3N2 (A/swine/Minnesota/080470/2015) within-host variants on the gene reads directly sequenced from the BALF samples.

We excluded the consensus sequences from any IAV segments whose average coverages were less than 100 reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncla et al., 2020</xref>). The mapped reads were exported in SAM format, sorted by Picard Sortsam (command: java -jar picard.jar SortSam INPUT=input_file.sam OUTPUT=output_file.sam SORT_ORDER=coordinate), and duplicate reads removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (command: java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true INPUT=input_file.sam OUTPUT=output_file.sam METRICS_FILE=test.sam.metrics) to avoid PCR bias (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).

The reported variants were filtered with a minimum depth of 100 reads, the minimum frequency of 1%, mean PHRED quality score of 30, and with the variant detected in both forward and reverse reads by performing the command: java -jar VarScan.v2.3.9.jar filter input_file.vcf <monospace>--min-coverage</monospace> 100 <monospace>--min-avg-qual</monospace> 30 <monospace>--min-var-freq 0.01</monospace> --min-strands2 2 <monospace>--output-vcf 1&gt;output_file.vcf</monospace>. For the samples that contained both challenge viruses, the generated variant report was checked and corrected using a custom Python script to ensure no variants were mistakenly recorded in the report due to nucleotide differences between the challenge viruses, given that mis-mapping of the reads against the reference templates could occur due to the close genetic distance of internal gene segments between H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. For the called SNVs that were located in the same nucleotide sites of H1N1 and H3N2 genomes from the same sample, we checked the original mapping reads and withdraw the false-positive SNVs from the variant report. The final identified variants listed in vcf files were parsed and annotated based on their effect of amino acid changes on reference sequences by the custom Python script. The SNVs identified in H1N1 and H3N2 coding regions were reported based on the H1 and H3 numbering schemes, respectively, including the signal peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Evolutionary analysis</title><p>The within-host evolutionary rates were calculated separately for synonymous, nonsynonymous, and stop-gained mutations at the whole-genome and individual protein level based on methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xue and Bloom, 2020</xref>). The evolutionary rate was calculated for each sample by summing the frequencies of SNVs by their mutation type and divided by available sites and the number of days post-challenge. All BALF samples were collected at 7 days post-contact with the seeder pigs, and the available sites for synonymous, nonsynonymous, and stop-gained mutations were normalized by multiplying the total length of nucleotide sequences for each coding region or all sequenced coding regions combined together (whole genome) by 25, 72, and 3%, respectively. These proportions of sites in IAV genome available for different mutation types were calculated in previous published research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xue and Bloom, 2020</xref>), based on counting the proportion of available sites for each mutation type on the genome of A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) by the Nei and Gojobori method (stop-gained mutations are split from the nonsynonymous mutations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nei and Gojobori, 1986</xref>), and assuming the frequency of transitions is threefold higher than transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">SanjuÃ¡n et al., 2010</xref>). The efficacy of selection for the IAV populations was estimated by calculating the nucleotide diversity (Pi), synonymous nucleotide diversity (piS), and nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (piN) at the individual coding region or whole-genome (all sequenced coding regions combined together) level based on the identified within-host variants for each sample by SNPGenie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nelson and Hughes, 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chasewnelson/SNPGenie">https://github.com/chasewnelson/SNPGenie</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelson, 2021</xref>).</p><p>To identify the variants located in functional relevant sites, the data of all currently available functional annotations in H1, H3, N1, N2, and the other internal segments were downloaded from the Sequence Feature Variant Types tool available in the Influenza Research Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noronha et al., 2012</xref>). The nonsynonymous variants were annotated if they fell into the annotated region or sites. The annotated functional relevant variants were further categorized based on antiviral drug resistance; determinant of pathogenicity, virulence, and disease progression; hostâvirus interaction machinery; virus assembly, budding, and release; viral genome transportation, transcription, and replication; viral genome/protein interaction; cross-species transmission and adaption.</p><p>The permutation test on shared variant sites was performed at the amino acid level to identify whether the BALF samples from each treatment group shared more polymorphic sites than random chance by the custom Python script adapted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/blab/h5n1-cambodia/blob/master/figures/figure-5b-shared-sites-permutation-test.ipynb">https://github.com/blab/h5n1-cambodia/blob/master/figures/figure-5b-shared-sites-permutation-test.ipynb</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moncla, 2019</xref>). The permutation test was performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncla et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, for each treatment group, we counted the number of variable amino acid sites, n, on each coding region for each sample. We started the permutation test for each group by randomly simulating n variable amino acid sites at each coding region for each sample. Within each iteration, we count the total number of shared polymorphic amino acid sites from all IAV coding regions for each group after removing the amino acid sites shared between pigs from the same room. The null distribution was generated by calculating the total number of polymorphic amino acid sites shared by at least two pigs from different rooms for each treatment group through 100,000 simulations of each gene segment and BALF sample. The p-value was calculated for each treatment group as the total number of iterations in which an equal or larger number of polymorphic sites were shared compared to those observed in actual data, divided by the number of simulations, which was 100,000. Since previously published work indicates that the IAV genome is highly constrained with about 30% of mutations being lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Visher et al., 2016</xref>), we assumed that only 70% of the IAV genome could tolerate mutations. Therefore, we ran the permutation test on both 70 and 100% of each coding regionâs amino acid sites.

The percentage of IAV reassortants by treatment groups or vaccination status was compared using a binomial logistic regression model, allowing for overdispersion. The pairwise differences between groups were compared using the chi-squared deviance test, and the p-value was adjusted for multiple comparisons using the BonferroniâHolm method. This model accounted for the unequal number of pigs from different treatment groups and different number of plaques isolated from each individual pig. The significant results represent the statistical differences at the individual pig level. KruskalâWallis rank-sum test was utilized to compare the means of SNV quantity and frequency, nucleotide diversity (Pi), and evolutionary rates by synonymous mutation, nonsynonymous mutation, and stop-gained mutation between treatment groups. The Dunnâs test was performed for the pairwise comparisons, and the p-values were adjusted using the BenjaminiâHochberg method. The paired <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to assess the significant differences between the mean piNs and mean piSs within each treatment group for each coding region. The Spearmanâs rank-order correlation test was performed to evaluate the strength and direction of associations between the percentage of IAV reassortants and co-infection days in pigs. The same statistical analysis also was computed to compare the correlation between HI titers (log2 transformed) and ELISPOT cell counts versus the values of nucleotide divergence, Pi, PiN, and PiS of the HA segment in H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw sequence reads generated in this study have been deposited in SRA (NCBI) under BioProject accession number PRJNA813974.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ron AM Fouchier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly in US swine, generating novel reassortants that also occasionally infect humans (e.g., H3N2v). The virus is not well controlled in US swine herds, because of the difficulty of designing vaccines that protect against the full diversity of strains. This research group and others have done prior work examining different prime-boost strategies to improve the effectiveness of swine influenza vaccines. Here, the authors extend that work by examining the potential for vaccination to blunt the evolution of the virus. A strength of the paper is that the challenge was done via a more or less natural route, by comingling seeder pigs infected with H1N1 and H3N2 virus with the vaccinated groups. On the other hand, despite relatively large numbers of animals in the original study, this still does not allow a very robust assessment (statistically) of the impact of vaccination on reassortment generation at the level of individuals pigs.</p><p>The study finds that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses readily coinfect pigs, generating a large number of reassortants over a relatively short time period, and possibly fewer reassortants in animals administered the prime-boost regimen. This is an important conclusion, as it seems that vaccination provides an ability to reduce the genetic diversification of swine influenza viruses. This is important also because novel viruses emerging from animal hosts have the ability to spark the next influenza pandemic. However, as it stands, it is unclear if the sample collection was biased and to what extent the results are related to vaccine match or vaccine effectiveness.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It would be helpful in the introduction to have more background on vaccine use in US swine â ie, how commonly vaccines are used, what types, known efficacy, ongoing challenges, etc. There is a great onus to have a balanced discussion, including vaccine risks and mention of VAERD.</p><p>2. The study is using samples generated in a previous study (doi.org/10.1186/s13567-020-00810-z). It is unclear how the samples that were used in the present study were selected from the previous study, which introduces significant concerns about selection bias. The authors should describe the many potential biases that are likely in play.</p><p>3. The present study does not discuss the homology between vaccine and challenge strains. Readers have to refer to Table 2 in the parent paper to find the data. Upon closer examination, at least one of the components of every prime-boost treatment had a vaccine with &gt;95% amino acid homology to a challenge virus. Furthermore, it appears that 25% of the sequenced BALF samples were collected from animals that received at least one dose of an autogenous vaccine that was 99.1% homologous to the H3 challenge virus. With estimation of antigenic distance, it is hard to predict exactly how protective each vaccine would have been. It is very hard to know if the prime-boost strategy or similarity between the vaccine strains and challenge virus the is truly responsible for the observed results. To connect the dots between vaccination and evolution it would help to first document how well the vaccines in this trial perform. It is unclear how well the strains in the commercial vaccines match the H1N1 and H3N2 challenge strains, which has a large effect on protection. It is unclear how well the vaccines reduce the attack rate in vaccinated versus unvaccinated animals. Did the attack rate differ between H1 and H3? It is unclear if the vaccines reduce viral shedding in vaccinated versus unvaccinated animals (volume of shedding (Ct) as well as duration of shedding in days). The Results section needs an opening paragraph that describes how well these vaccines protect the animals in general, using multiple measures, before launching into the details of how they impact evolution.</p><p>4. Vaccination had limited effect on natural selection of other genetic variants (SNVs). There are many within-host studies showing that immune selection does not occur for influenza during these short active infections. As the Results section on nucleotide variation (L178-L336) is very long, it should be condensed considerably.</p><p>5. The definition of &quot;reassortant&quot; in lines 137-139 is confusing. You say 54 were reassortants, but of those 18 were mixed infections. Shouldn't you categorize the mixed infections as their own separate category, not as reassortant? When you refer to &quot;reassortants&quot; in the rest of the paper are you including this mixed infection category? Please define precisely.</p><p>6. Given that the proportion of identified reassortants was rather high, perhaps higher than expected from the number of reassortants detected in pigs in real life situations, a discussion about this apparent discrepancy is warranted. It is likely that this is related to lower &quot;fitness&quot; of most reassortants as compared to the ancestral viruses. Were the reassortants generated in this experiment similar to the dominant reassortants commonly identified through surveillance in the field? The authors should discuss the relative fitness of the identified reassortants. Also, given the short time interval between vaccination and seed infection, did you observe any LAIV reassortants? Did you observe any pig-to-pig transmission of reassortants generated in this experiment?</p><p>7. What can be said about the 3 super-reassortant pigs? Is there anything distinguishing about them? Viral load, etc.? Is the infection history of the pigs used in these experiments known?</p><p>8. The authors conclude that vaccination decreases the risk of reassortment. This may be true at the level of the pooled numbers of analyzed plaques, but is this also true at the level of individual pigs? We see reassortants in 3/4 unvaccinated pigs, in 2/4 single LAIV pigs (with only 2 plaques tested for 1 pig) and in 1/5 prime boost pigs (with one 1 or 3 plaques tested for 2 pigs). Is this a statistically robust conclusion? This statistical analysis should be presented and discussed better.</p><p>9. The Results section L96-L128 is the same as in the methods section. It can be deleted in the Results section to save space in favor of the rebuttal to this review.</p><p>10. Authors could consider a cartoon that clearly spells out the hypotheses (Vaccination -&gt; immune response -&gt; less coinfection -&gt; less reassortment, less genomic diversity. Vaccination -&gt; immune response -&gt; more selection for new antigenic variants -&gt; more antigenic diversity), perhaps along with the experimental set-up (Figure 1).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78618.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We divided the reassortants in two groups, (a) reassortants R01-R17 which contained a single complete gene sequence in a given gene segment, and (b) reassortants M01-M16 that contained complete gene sequences of both parental viruses in a given gene segment. Therefore, instead of naming the âmixed infectionâ reassortants, we prefer just to use the word âmixed genotypesâ for reassortants with genotypes M01 â M16. When we refer to âreassortantsâ throughout the paper we include the mixed genotypes as part of the reassortants. We have added the clarifications on the reassortant definition in lines 182 â 184, 668 â 670, 1065 â 1066, and 1076 â 1077.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Did you observe any pig-to-pig transmission of reassortants generated in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point regarding the much higher proportion of reassortants identified in this study than the pigs from âreal-lifeâ situations. One factor that may contribute to this is that all our reassortants are from lungs (BALF samples) and that the transmissibility of IAV reassortants may be influenced by tissue tropism (Zhang et al., 2018). In Zhang et al., reassortant viruses were more abundant in the middle and lower respiratory tract rather than the upper respiratory tract in the nasal cavities (Zhang et al., 2018). This may be related to the high temperature and affluent presence of various types of sialic acid receptors present in the lower respiratory tract (Nelli et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018; Graaf &amp; Fouchier., 2014). Thus, is possible that not all the reassortants that are generated in the pigs are likely to transmit which could explain the differences observed under field conditions. In addition, other host and environmental factors could also affect the fitness and circulation of IAV reassortants (Lowen., 2018). We have added this discussion in the manuscript in lines 406 â 413 and 419 â 420.</p><p>Regarding the question on whether we observed any reassortant related to the LAIV vaccine, the answer is no, we didnât. We collected nasal swabs every day from all LAIV vaccinated pigs after LAIV vaccine administration and performed the RRT-PCR which targets the LAIV vaccine strains to evaluate LAIV shedding. The shedding period for pigs receiving the LAIV vaccine was from 1 to 9 days post vaccination. At 10 days post LAIV vaccination, there was no LAIV detected in the vaccinated pigs. Then, there were five weeks between pigs receiving the LAIV vaccine and contact with the seeder pigs, so LAIV vaccinated pigs did not have the vaccine virus by the time they were mixed with the seeder pigs. Therefore, the conditions to generate reassortant viruses for the LAIV group were not met and as a result we didnât detect any reassortant with sequences from the LAIV vaccines. We have added information on this in the Results section in lines 188 â 189.</p><p>Our study was not set up to assess transmissibility of the reassortants. However, within the limitations of our study, we did not find convincing evidence of pig-to-pig transmission of the reassortants generated in this study. Even though we found specific reassortants (R01, R10, M01, M06) in the lungs of multiple pigs, only M01 reassortants were detected in pigs that were co-housed in the same room. However, whether the M01 reassortant was the result of pig-to-pig transmission or it was generated in two pigs independently is hard to tell. Additional studies are needed to better understand the factors that contribute to the transmissibility of the reassortant viruses.</p><p>In terms of understanding how the reassortants generated in this study relate to the dominant viruses circulating in the field, the hemagglutinin (HA) of the challenge viruses and generated reassortants in this study belong to major circulating lineages of the swine influenza viruses in US farms. This information is based on the influenza A virus swine surveillance quarterly reports (USDA-APHIS). Except for the PA and NP genes, the internal genes of the two challenge viruses belong to the same lineages (based on the IAV evolutionary lineage classification tool â OctoFLU). Therefore, many reassortants generated in this study kept the same genotype with one of their parental viruses. We have downloaded all the available whole genome data of 325 H1N1 and 434 H3N2 IAV strains isolated from US swine populations since 2017 from the Influenza Research Database (IRD) and performed the analysis to identify their genotypes. We found that about 43.4% (141/325) of analyzed H1N1 viruses have the same genotype as the R13, R14, and M14 viruses generated in this study. Among the H3N2 reassortants generated in this study, the R02 and R16 viruses are most commonly identified in the field. About 9.2% (40/434) of analyzed H3N2 viruses have the same genotype as these viruses. No H3N2 reassortants in this study have the same genotype as the dominant H3N2 viruses recently described in US pig populations. That is because the N2 gene of the H3N2 parental virus belongs to the N2-2002A lineage, which is not a major N2 lineage. If this H3N2 parental virus replaces an N2-2002B N2 gene, it will have the same genotype as about 58.5% (254/434) of the analyzed H3N2 viruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What can be said about the 3 super-reassortant pigs? Is there anything distinguishing about them? Viral load, etc.? Is the infection history of the pigs used in these experiments known?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very important observation, and we are also intrigued by the finding that some pigs appeared to be âsuper-reassortant pigsâ. The three super-reassortant pigs didnât exhibit notable clinical differences, except for the fact that these three pigs had longer simultaneous shedding duration of both challenge viruses (figure 3 â source data 1). These three super-reassortant pigs (one SINGLE LAIV pig and two NO VAC pigs), like the other NO VAC and SINGLE LAIV pigs, had no detectable humoral response specific to the H1N1 and H3N2 challenge viruses prior to the challenge. The IAV infection dynamics of pigs enrolled in the analysis of reassortant identifications is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Even though we found that two of three super-reassortant pigs had higher virus shedding quantity than most pigs after 5 dpc, the difference in virus load was not remarkable, especially in BALF samples collected at 7 dpc. Besides, all pigs showed mild gross lung lesions (0.5% â 10%). Lastly, the three super-reassortant pigs were housed in three different rooms which indicates that there wasnât a âroom effectâ. Whether there were other host factors responsible for creating super reassortant pigs is unknown at this time.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of overall influenza shedding in pigs that were part of the reassortant analysis.</title><p>The quantity of virus shedding in nasal swabs and BALF samples were measured by influenza matrix gene real-time PCR (A) and virus titrations (B).

The authors conclude that vaccination decreases the risk of reassortment. This may be true at the level of the pooled numbers of analyzed plaques, but is this also true at the level of individual pigs? We see reassortants in 3/4 unvaccinated pigs, in 2/4 single LAIV pigs (with only 2 plaques tested for 1 pig) and in 1/5 prime boost pigs (with one 1 or 3 plaques tested for 2 pigs). Is this a statistically robust conclusion? This statistical analysis should be presented and discussed better.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this valuable point. To compare the percent of influenza reassortant plaques between pigs from different treatment groups, we applied a binomial logistic regression model, allowing for overdispersion, and tested all pairwise differences between treatments using the chi-squared deviance test, and adjusted the p-values for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Holm method. This model accounted for the unequal number of pigs from different treatment groups and different number of plaques isolated from each individual pig. Therefore, the significant results represent the statistical differences at the individual pig level. However, our statistical model is based on the asymptotic theory (ie, what happens when the sample size gets large), and we agree with the reviewer that the results are still based on a limited number of pigs. Therefore, we provided more detail in the statistical analysis and addressed the result and discussion in lines 199 â 201, 497 â 503, 763 â 766, and 1077 â 1081.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
