remain unclear. We present novel experiments in which two micropipette-held somatic cells of <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>, with distinct intrinsic beating frequencies, are studied by high-speed imaging as a function of their separation and orientation. Analysis of time series shows that the interflagellar coupling, constrained by lack of connections between cells to be hydrodynamical, exhibits a spatial dependence consistent with theory. At close spacings it produces robust synchrony for thousands of beats, while at increasing separations synchrony is degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation of the relative flagellar orientation reveals in-phase and antiphase states, consistent with dynamical theories. Flagellar tracking with exquisite precision reveals waveform changes that result from hydrodynamic coupling. This study proves unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid can achieve robust synchrony despite differences in their intrinsic properties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02750.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02750.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02750.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sperm cells, as well as many bacteria and algae, propel themselves using whip-like appendages called flagella. Similar, shorter structures called cilia are also found on the surface of many cells, where they perform roles such as moving liquids over the cell.</p><p>Each cilium or flagellum beats at its own characteristic rhythm, but there are many situations where cilia or flagella must synchronize their beating with other nearby cells. For example, an egg cell is swept along the Fallopian tube by the coordinated beating of the cilia lining the tube. Bull sperm cells are also known to synchronize the beating of their flagella when swimming close to each other.</p><p>It has been suggested that the movement of the fluid surrounding the beating flagella could be the source of this synchronization. Experiments have produced results that match up with mathematical models describing this fluid movement. However, these experiments have often been designed in ways that didn’t fully exclude other possible sources of synchronization, such as chemical signalling, or—for flagella located on the same cell—a physical connection between the flagella.</p><p>To overcome this shortcoming, Brumley et al. used high-speed imaging to watch the flagella of cells of <italic>Volvox carteri</italic>—a species of green alga—that were separated so that they could only communicate through the movement of the fluid around them. The flagella were still able to synchronize their beating, even when the two flagella naturally beat at substantially different rates.</p><p>The distance between the flagella affects how well the beating synchronizes. When close together, the flagella can lock into the same rhythm for thousands of beats. However, as they move further apart, random biochemical fluctuations within the cells reduce the extent to which the flagella can synchronize.</p><p>The flagella can also synchronize so that they move in the same direction at the same time, or in opposite directions, depending on how they are oriented relative to each other. Moreover, the results confirm that the fluid flow produced by a beating flagellum is sufficient to synchronize the beating of other nearby flagella.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02750.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02750.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd><kwd>Volvox</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Investigator Grant 247333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brumley</surname><given-names>Douglas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Kirsty Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Polin</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brumley</surname><given-names>Douglas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Kirsty Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Kirsty Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Polin</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brumley</surname><given-names>Douglas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of experiment and theory shows that pairs of eukaryotic flagella can achieve robust synchronization solely through the action of the fluid that surrounds them.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the elegance and apparent simplicity of the eukaryotic flagellum and its shorter ciliary version, the collective motions exhibited by groups of these organelles and the resultant fluid flows are far from trivial. For example, the unicellular biflagellate alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> executes diffusive ‘run-and-turn’ locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Polin et al., 2009</xref>) through stochastic switching between synchronized and unsynchronized swimming gaits—a process which could enhance searching efficiency and assist in the avoidance of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stocker and Durham, 2009</xref>). Ensembles of cilia and flagella exhibit stunning temporal coordination, generating flows that transport mucus and expel pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Button et al., 2012</xref>), establish the left-right asymmetry in developing mammalian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>), and transport ova in human fallopian tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lyons et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The origin of flagellar synchronization has been the subject of intense theoretical investigation for many decades. One of the earliest experimental results was Rothschild's qualitative observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rothschild, 1949</xref>) that the flagella of bull spermatozoa tend to synchronize when they swim close to one another, coupled only through the fluid surrounding them. Much more recent observations of self-organised vortex arrays of swimming sea urchin spermatazoa near surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Riedel et al., 2005</xref>) provide further evidence for synchrony mediated purely by hydrodynamic coupling. Motivated by Rothschild's observation, Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor, 1951</xref>) developed a mathematical model in which two laterally infinite, inextensible sheets with prescribed sinusoidal travelling waves of transverse deformation interact with each other through a viscous fluid. He found that the rate of viscous dissipation is minimised when the two sheets are in phase. While minimisation of dissipation often holds in real physical systems, it is not in general a fundamental principle from which to deduce dynamical processes. Rather, an explanation for synchronization should capture the forces and torques associated with the underlying molecular motors that drive flagella, their elasticity, as well as the viscosity of the surrounding fluid.</p><p>Since Taylor's work a myriad of increasingly complex models of flagellar synchronization have been proposed. Hydrodynamically coupled filaments or chains with various internal driving forces exhibit a general tendency towards synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Machin, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gueron et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>). At the same time, minimal models of coupled oscillators in viscous fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vilfan and Jülicher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Niedermayer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uchida and Golestanian, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brumley et al., 2012</xref>) offer great insight into the emergence of metachronal coordination. Such models have been investigated experimentally with light driven microrotors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Di Leonardo et al., 2012</xref>), rotating paddles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qian et al., 2009</xref>) and colloids in optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kotar et al., 2010</xref>), and have also given rise to interpretations of the synchrony and coupling interactions between pairs of flagella of the model alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although experimentally-derived coupling strengths between micropipette-held <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella are consistent with predictions based on direct hydrodynamic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldstein et al., 2011</xref>), it has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friedrich and Jülicher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geyer et al., 2013</xref>) instead that this coupling is too weak to overcome noise, and that residual motion of elastically-clamped cells could play a role in synchronization. The recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leptos et al., 2013</xref>) of antiphase synchronization in a non-phototactic mutant of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> points as well to the possible role of <italic>internal</italic> mechanical coupling between flagella. Clearly, examining the synchronization between flagella on a single cell it is difficult to establish with certainty the origins of the coupling mechanism due to the likely presence of biochemical and elastic couplings of as yet unquantified strength between flagella.</p><p>In order to disentangle the hydrodynamic from the intracellular contributions to flagellar synchronization we conducted a series of experiments in which two physically separated flagellated cells, which exhibit distinct intrinsic beating frequencies in isolation, are coupled solely and directly through the surrounding fluid. These experiments can be viewed as natural generalisations of earlier work in which vibrating microneedles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Okuno and Hiramoto, 1976</xref>) or micropipettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eshel and Gibbons, 1989</xref>) are used to modulate and entrain the beating of a single sperm flagellum. Owing to the natural distribution of beating frequencies of the flagella of its surface somatic cells, the colonial alga <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> is ideally suited to this purpose. Each somatic cell possesses two flagella which beat in perfect synchrony, facilitating their treatment as a single entity, henceforth referred to as the <italic>flagellum</italic>. Somatic cells were isolated from adult <italic>Volvox</italic> colonies and held with micropipettes at a controllable separation <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The spatial and orientational degrees of freedom associated with this configuration enabled comprehensive analysis over a wide range of hydrodynamic coupling strengths. We found that closely-separated pairs of cells can exhibit robust phase-locking for thousands of beats at a time, despite a discrepancy in their intrinsic frequencies of as much as 10%. Both in-phase and antiphase configurations were observed, depending on the alignment of the directions of flagellar propulsion. Furthermore, with increasing interflagellar spacing we observed for each flagellum a marked change in the beating waveform, a key finding that lends support to models of synchronization that rely on waveform compliance to achieve phase-locking.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02750.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synchronized pairs of beating flagella.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental apparatus and (<bold>B</bold>) cell configuration.

Despite the fact that a flagellum is a spatially-extended object with considerable internal dynamics, it has become clear in recent years that the flow fields generated by its beating may be described, on suitable length scales, in terms of geometrically simpler force distributions. In the simplest case, often used in models of synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vilfan and Jülicher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Niedermayer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uchida and Golestanian, 2011</xref>), that would be just a single sphere tracing out a closed orbit in space under the action of internal driving forces. The time-averaged flow around the flagellum would then be approximated by the flow from a point force at a suitable average location.

For sufficiently strong coupling, different cells can adopt a common phase-locked frequency through perturbing one another from their intrinsic limit cycles. Indeed, models of coupled flagella involving hydrodynamically coupled semiflexible filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gueron et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) show a tendency towards metachronal coordination, though the precise role that flexibility plays in facilitating synchrony is unknown. Minimal models in which spheres are driven along flexible trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brumley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Niedermayer et al., 2008</xref>) reveal that deformation-induced changes in the phase speed can facilitate synchrony. However, functional variations in the intrinsic flagellar driving forces could lead to synchrony even for fixed beating patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uchida and Golestanian, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2012</xref>).</p><p>Through dynamic tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wan et al., 2014</xref>), we followed the evolution of the flagellar waveforms for several thousand consecutive beats. One example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> where the extracted waveform is shown at various stages through the beating cycle, overlaid onto logarithmically-scaled residence time plots. The same pair of flagella is compared at close and far cell–cell separations (7.3 μm and 72.2 μm respectively). In order to characterise flagellar waveform changes as the cells are brought closer together, we define three angles <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (radians) with respect to the cell body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the temporal evolution of these angles for the right flagellum, corresponding to the close (red), intermediate (green) and wide (blue) separations.

At the same time, the synchronization properties of immobilised <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells are generally consistent with models in which the flagella interact purely hydrodynamically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Polin et al., 2009</xref>), although the observed antiphase synchronization of the <italic>ptx1</italic> mutant has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leptos et al., 2013</xref>) to implicate intracellular coupling such as through elastic filaments at the basal bodies.

Indeed, Machemer showed that membrane voltage affects the metachronal wave direction in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Machemer, 1972</xref>).</p><p>In the present experiment, cells are held with micropipettes in order to preclude all chemical coupling of the two flagella other than the possible advection of molecules by the flow. The fact that the coupling strength for IP and AP pairs is almost identical despite the pronounced difference between the associated flows rules out coupling via chemical means. In these experiments hydrodynamics alone is responsible for the interflagellar coupling. Yet, this may be direct interaction between the flagella or indirect, through some residual motion of the cell bodies. If such motion does play a role in the observed synchronization, it is useful to estimate the effective spring constant associated with angular displacements of the cell. This can be done by estimating the hydrodynamical torques at one cell due to the flagellar beating of a nearby cell and using an experimental bound on the observed angular displacement. The fluid speed <italic>u</italic> at a distance <italic>r</italic> from the origin due to a second cell whose flagellum exerts a (point) force of magnitude <italic>F</italic> varies as <italic>u</italic> ∼ <italic>F</italic>/8<italic>πμr</italic>, and when acting on the flagellum of the first cell will produce a torque scaling as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>⊥</mml:mo></mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>l</italic> is the length of the flagellum. If we set this equal to the torque <italic>kα</italic> of a rotational spring, where <italic>k</italic> is the spring constant and <italic>α</italic> the angular displacement, we obtain an estimate for <italic>k</italic> from an upper bound <italic>α</italic><sup>*</sup> for the rotation.

A similar argument can be constructed by considering the vorticity at the central cell due to the flow from another, and yields the same result.

Physical separation of the cells precludes any form of chemical or direct mechanical coupling, leaving hydrodynamic interactions as the only mechanism through which synchronization can occur. The process of phase-locking is extremely robust, with cells sufficiently close to one another exhibiting uninterrupted synchrony for thousands of consecutive beats. Accompanying this synchrony is a characteristic shift in the flagellar waveform. The extracted interflagellar coupling strength is consistent with hydrodynamic predictions and the measured flow fields generated by individual flagella.

Although its flagellum is shorter and its waveform is different to that of <italic>Volvox</italic>, we also observed hydrodynamic phase-locking in these experiments. Owing to the ubiquity and uniformity in the structure and function of flagella in various eukaryotic species, the results of the present study are expected to generalise to other systems, and may be of significant value for a wide range of theoretical models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell growth and imaging</title><p><italic>Volvox carteri</italic> f. <italic>nagariensis</italic> (strain EVE) were grown axenically in Standard <italic>Volvox</italic> Medium (SVM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kirk and Kirk, 1983</xref>) with sterile air bubbling, in a growth chamber (Binder, Germany) set to a cycle of 16 hr light (100 μEm<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, Fluora, OSRAM) at 28<sup>∘</sup>C and 8 hr dark at 26<sup>∘</sup>C.

This geometry allowed us to investigate both in-phase and antiphase configurations for the same pair of cells, through the simple rotation of one pipette. At the same time, however, this meant that the two cells were held from different directions with respect to their flagella, and that one of the two pipettes was oriented along the direction of the flagellar power stroke, which is the main flow direction. This can cause two problems. Firstly, the flow field of a cell held by the side could be significantly different from that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Secondly, the holding pipettes could distort the scaling of the flagellar flow with cell–cell separation from the ∼1/<italic>r</italic> scaling presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We investigated these problems with the series of experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. One cell was held at its posterior pole by a pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and the flow field measured. A second micropipette was then moved progressively closer, eventually to the point of contact with the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). It is clear that the second pipette affects the flow, but mostly in the region between the two pipettes.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02750.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Effect of nearby pipette.</title><p>The time-averaged flow field associated with one captured cell is measured as a second pipette slowly approaches.

For a cell held from the side, this is the region where the other cell will be. Here the flow is only minimally affected, with an average relative change between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,A</xref> below 8%. A large contribution is represented simply by a ∼7% decrease in flow speed. Taking this decrease into account, the average relative change is about 5%. As a result, these experiments allow us to consider the flow generated by a cell held from the side as identical to that generated by a cell held from the back, at least in the region of interest to our experiments. By comparing the flows for different positions of the second pipette, we can also quantify its effect on the flow field that would be experienced by the second cell. For each configuration of pipettes, this can be estimated as the relative difference between the unperturbed and the perturbed flows in the region where the flagella of the second cell would be, here considered to be a 10 × 10 μm<sup>2</sup> region 20 μm to the left of the tip of the incoming pipette. The difference ranges from ∼5% to ∼10% and ∼13% for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref> respectively (in the last case we choose a position approximately 10 μm below and 20 μm to the left of the pipette tip).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Brumley et al. reveals mechanisms of beat synchronization in pairs of flagella. This is biologically relevant as pairs of flagella serve as a minimal model system for synchronization in collections of flagella such as ciliary carpets in mammalian airways, oviduct epithelium, etc. whose coordinated beating in metachronal waves is important for efficient fluid transport. Secondly, this minimal system allows to link biology and physics in a quantitative way to generate mechanistic insight.</p><p>The work reports a key experiment; in fact this experiment should have been conducted long ago. By use of two spatially separated cells, any means of chemical coupling or direct mechanical coupling is effectively ruled out. This sets this particular experiment apart from previous studies.</p><p>The 3 reviewers and the Reviewing editor agreed that the manuscript is well-crafted and contributes to a timely topic. However, the authors should address the following significant points:</p><p>1) The analysis of waveform is elegant, but there is a lack of statistics or a way to compare results from multiple cell pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which just shows one example of a pair of cells. At the very least, several other examples need to be shown, perhaps as figure supplements, to show that the effect of distance on waveform isn't just some idiosyncrasy of this particular cell pair. What would be more ideal is if there is some way to parameterize the limit cycles so that their shape could be described by a single number or some small number of parameters. The cycles look teardrop shaped so maybe one could use a Pyriform (“pear shaped quartic”), or the Lemniscate of Bernoulli. Regardless of how it is accomplished, having some ability to compare results from different cells statistically is very important.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether there is a true bifurcation in the stochastic case. If delta_omega is defined as the expectation value of dphi1/dt-dphi2/dt, then delta_omega likely varies smoothly with epsilon, although it may indeed display a steep change beyond a certain value. A more stringent terminology is required.</p><p>3) Were different stages used for the two micropipettes to rule out any direct mechanical coupling between them? Otherwise, there is a concern that potential oscillations of the micropipettes caused by the flagellar oscillations could by relayed by such a coupling. One cilium is certainly too weak to generate such a strong vibration to excite the manipulator and then back to the other cilium. There is of course the potential that the stage itself is vibrating and then causes both of them to oscillate. Sperm cells have been held on vibrating micro needles, and vibrating micro needles were brought close to flagella (Eshel 1989 and Okuno 1976); from there the authors could potentially estimate how strongly the manipulator would have to vibrate.</p><p>4) Referencing previous published work: the authors should do a better job in giving credit to previous relevant work (which goes far back and another detailed literature search is advised). Giving corresponding credit to this previous work does not diminish the relevance of the present paper given its experimental execution and analysis.</p><p>a) A clear statement in the paper should be made that (pure) hydrodynamic synchronization between cilia/flagella has been demonstrated previously. The authors cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor 1951</xref> in a manner that suggests that Taylor made pure theoretical arguments (which is actually true), but Taylor himself cites earlier experiments that describe the synchronization of sperm flagella.</p><p>b) It would be worth commenting on the dominating synchronization mechanism of the flagellar pair in single clamped Chlamydomonas One group (Goldstein et al. PRL 2009) proposed direct hydrodynamic interactions between the two flagella of Chlamydomonas as main synchronization mechanism, while others have argued that this synchronization mechanism might be too weak to overcome flagellar noise and that instead a residual motion of elastically clamped cells could accelerate flagellar synchronization: VF Geyer, F Jülicher, J Howard, BM Friedrich, PNAS 110, 18058–18063 (2013).</p><p>c) Riedel 2005 showed synchronization of sperm flagella, with a similar conclusion on the hydrodynamic origin of the coordination.</p><p>d) There have been also multiple papers where sperm cells have been held on vibrating micro needles, or vibrating micro needles were brought close to flagella, see for example Eshel 1989 and Okuno 1976 – and there are likely more.</p><p>e) The cited reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geyer et al 2013</xref> combines theory and experiments, which should be mentioned. Also, the discussion of elastic contributions to flagellar synchronization should make reference to this cited reference, which first introduced alternative mechanisms of flagellar synchronization independent of direct hydrodynamic interactions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02750.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The analysis of waveform is elegant, but there is a lack of statistics or a way to compare results from multiple cell pairs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, which just shows one example of a pair of cells.

Ideally, we would like to project out limit cycles on some basis set of curves, which could then be used to quantify the limit cycles’ deformations. We believe that it is the extent of these deformations that should be compared between cells, rather than the limit cycles themselves. Unfortunately, we did not find any convincing way to put this idea into practice. In particular it was not obvious to us what would constitute a good metric in this space of curves. We decided, therefore, to present only the raw deformations. It is our hope that with time these results will inspire the development of a technique to quantify the deformations.</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear whether there is a true bifurcation in the stochastic case.

Sperm cells have been held on vibrating micro needles, and vibrating micro needles were brought close to flagella (Eshel 1989 and Okuno 1976); from there the authors could potentially estimate how strongly the manipulator would have to vibrate</italic>.</p><p>The microscope used in these studies sits on a very high quality floating vibration isolation table in the quietest room of our microscopy suite, with the room air supply silenced and delivered through tiny perforations in the ceiling tiles, preventing any vibration-inducing jets of air. The two micropipettes were held on physically separated supports in either of two ways. In one, each micropipette is mounted on a separate multi-axis translation stage supported on a vibrationally-damped rod attached to the optical table but with having no physical contact with the microscope. In the second approach, one of those micropipettes is instead supported on a miniature translation stage mounted directly on the microscope body, while the other is still mounted on a separate manipulator. With all these pre-cautions we are very confident the observed flagellar dynamics is indeed intrinsic to the cells. We thank the referee for highlighting the earlier works on sperm cells and vibrating micro needles, which we have now referenced in the introduction.</p><p><italic>4) Referencing previous published work: The authors should do a better job in giving credit to previous relevant work (which goes far back and another detailed literature search is advised). Giving corresponding credit to this previous work does not diminish the relevance of the present paper given its experimental execution and analysis</italic>.</p><p><italic>a) A clear statement in the paper should be made that (pure) hydrodynamic synchronization between cilia/flagella has been demonstrated previously. The authors cite</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"><italic>Taylor 1951</italic></xref> <italic>in a manner that suggests that Taylor made pure theoretical arguments (which is actually true), but Taylor himself cites earlier experiments that describe the synchronization of sperm flagella</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We are aware that Taylor’s work was indeed motivated by an observation of Rothschild that the flagella of closely-separated bull spermatozoa tend to be synchronized, and have now included this reference in the Introduction. We have further taken this opportunity to expand the Discussion in the Introduction about hydrodynamic mechanisms. It is important to note that neither Rothschild’s observations nor those of the more recent work we cite provided unequivocal proof of purely hydrodynamic synchronization. For example, a mechanism akin to cell body rocking may have played a role there as well.</p><p><italic>b) It would be worth commenting on the dominating synchronization mechanism of the flagellar pair in single clamped Chlamydomonas One group (Goldstein et al. PRL 2009) proposed direct hydrodynamic interactions between the two flagella of Chlamydomonas as main synchronization mechanism, while others have argued that this synchronization mechanism might be too weak to overcome flagellar noise and that instead a residual motion of elastically clamped cells could accelerate flagellar synchronization: VF Geyer, F Jülicher, J Howard, BM Friedrich, PNAS 110, 18058–18063 (2013)</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion as requested.</p><p><italic>c) Riedel 2005 showed synchronization of sperm flagella, with a similar conclusion on the hydrodynamic origin of the coordination</italic>.</p><p>We have now included this reference in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>d) There have been also multiple papers where sperm cells have been held on vibrating micro needles, or vibrating micro needles were brought close to flagella, see for example Eshel 1989 and Okuno 1976 – and there are likely more</italic>.</p><p>These references have also been included in the revised Introduction.</p><p><italic>e) The cited reference</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Geyer et al 2013</italic></xref> <italic>combines theory and experiments, which should be mentioned.
