specific task influence sensory neural processing. To isolate effects of these state variables in the auditory system, we recorded single-unit activity from primary auditory cortex (A1) and inferior colliculus (IC) of ferrets during a tone detection task, while monitoring arousal via changes in pupil size. We used a generalized linear model to assess the influence of task engagement and pupil size on sound-evoked activity. In both areas, these two variables affected independent neural populations. Pupil size effects were more prominent in IC, while pupil and task engagement effects were equally likely in A1. Task engagement was correlated with larger pupil; thus, some apparent effects of task engagement should in fact be attributed to fluctuations in pupil size. These results indicate a hierarchy of auditory processing, where generalized arousal enhances activity in midbrain, and effects specific to task engagement become more prominent in cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>encoding</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>midbrain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 DC014888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saderi</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC04950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Stephen V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EB028155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Stephen V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 DC016204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Zachary P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GVPRS0015A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Charles R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006668</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tartar Trust Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saderi</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Data collected from two important auditory brain areas distinguish effects of generalized arousal and specific task engagement on neural sensory coding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hearing is a dynamic process that requires integration of the sensory evidence provided by physical attributes of sound with information about the behavioral context in which auditory perception occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fritz et al., 2007</xref>). As sound information passes through the brain, coordinated activity in auditory areas extracts information necessary to guide behavior. Compared to passive listening, engaging in a task that requires auditory discrimination leads to changes in neural excitability, as well as in spectral and spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Downer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knudsen and Gentner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Middlebrooks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan and Miller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). These changes are often attributed to the specific task demands, enhancing the representation of important sound features by selectively increasing or decreasing the activity across neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>). In some studies, changes have been reported to persist for several minutes after the active behavior, while in others, activity and tuning changes were observed to rapidly return to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The substantial variability of effects across studies suggests that task engagement activates a constellation of non-auditory signals that comprise a complex internal state. Task-related changes in the activity of auditory neurons have been attributed to temporal expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaramillo and Zador, 2011</xref>), reward associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beaton and Miller, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>), self-generated sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>), and non-sound related variables, such as motor planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), degree of engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carcea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knyazeva et al., 2020</xref>), and behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>). Even in the absence of explicit behavior, fluctuations in neural activity are observed throughout the forebrain, including primary sensory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ringach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). This activity is related to cognitive states such as arousal and may also modulate sensitivity to sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, attempting to interpret changes in neuronal activity solely in light of a single binary variable, such as being engaged in a task or not, will lead to an incomplete and even incorrect understanding of how sensory information is processed.</p><p>A straightforward way to monitor some task-independent changes in behavioral state is by measuring pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kahneman and Beatty, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zekveld et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, luminance independence changes in pupil size have been shown to correlate with mental effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beatty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winn et al., 2015</xref>), changes in states of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kahneman and Beatty, 1966</xref>), aspects of decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>), and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schriver et al., 2018</xref>). In animals, fluctuations in pupil size closely track locomotion and neural activity throughout the mouse forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Pupil size also tracks the degree of neural synchronization observed in local field potentials, which is commonly used to measure arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while this single variable is unlikely to completely characterize such a complex phenomenon as arousal, pupil provides a window into a global brain state that is activated during demanding behaviors.</p><p>The degree to which pupil size co-varies with task engagement, and whether these variables account for independent changes in neural activity, remains to be determined. To study the interaction of task engagement and pupil size on auditory neural coding, we recorded extracellular spiking activity and pupil size of ferrets during an auditory task and during passive presentation of task stimuli. Single- and multiunit activity was recorded from the primary auditory cortex (A1) and midbrain inferior colliculus (IC). We used a generalized linear model to quantify the unique contributions of task engagement and pupil size to neural activity. Using this approach, we found that independent subpopulations of neurons were modulated uniquely by task or by pupil size, suggesting that these effects are mediated by distinct inputs. Our analysis also revealed that in many neurons, pupil size could account for variability in firing rate that might otherwise be attributed to task engagement. Thus, some previously reported effects of task engagement may in fact be explained by changes in pupil-indexed arousal. In addition, the relative effects of task engagement and pupil size varied between cortex and midbrain. Pupil-related changes occurred in both areas, but task engagement effects were more prominent in A1. This work highlights the value of accounting for multiple state variables in studies of sensory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), both in identifying the source of task-related effects and in locating where in the sensory processing hierarchy they emerge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in pupil size track task engagement</title><p>To study interactions between pupil-indexed arousal and task engagement, we trained four adult ferrets on a go/no-go auditory detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yin et al., 2010</xref>).

Pupil was recorded continuously as animals passively listened to the task stimuli and actively performed the task. The distribution of pupil size differed between passive and active conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mean pupil size (measured by the major axis diameter) was consistently larger during the active condition (<italic>n</italic> = 35 sites total, ferret L: <italic>n</italic> = 13, B: <italic>n</italic> = 5, R: <italic>n</italic> = 16, T: <italic>n</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0133, hierarchical bootstrap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Average pupil size was similar for false alarm (FA) and hit trials, but it was smaller during miss trials, more closely resembling passive trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, the short-term dynamics of pupil depended strongly on task condition. During behavior, trial onset evoked a rapid increase in pupil size, which was consistently larger than any evoked change during the passive condition (<italic>p </italic>= 4.00 x 10<sup>−6</sup>, hierarchical bootstrap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Results from the IC are presented jointly between the two sub-regions, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>To study how behavior state modulated auditory neural activity over time, we recorded activity in the same units over multiple passive and active blocks and recorded pupil size throughout each experiment as a measure of the animal’s state of arousal. For analysis, the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to the reference stimuli was averaged across passive and correct (hit) active trials, and data from target periods were excluded. On hit trials, animals did not lick during the reference stimuli; thus this approach reduced the possibility that lick-related motor signals confounded our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brosch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For many units, activity appeared to be modulated by changes in task engagement, as would be expected from previous behavioral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>). During active behavior, responses to the noise stimuli either increased or decreased, and then returned to their baseline passive state during subsequent passive periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). For other units, however, no consistent change in activity was observed between active and passive conditions. In these cases, firing rate could change between behavioral blocks, but the effect was not consistent across engagement conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Thus, despite our controls for sound acoustics and motor activity, the firing rates of some units varied over time in a way that did not appear to be related to task engagement.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simultaneously recorded units showing task versus pupil-related changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Firing rate (gray) of one unit in primary auditory cortex (A1) and time-aligned pupil size (green) during reference stimuli over one entire experiment (total recording time ~1 hr, inter-trial and target periods removed).

A simple way to investigate if pupil size predicts changes in neural firing rate is to divide all trials (pooled across active and passive) into two groups, based on the mean pupil size, and compute a separate PSTH for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>).

Therefore, to test our hypothesis that pupil size accounted for changes in neural activity following task engagement, we fit a generalized linear model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) in which the response to each presentation of the reference stimuli was modulated by task engagement and pupil size. Each of these variables could additively modulate the baseline (mean) firing rate or multiplicatively modulate response gain. Task engagement was modeled as a discrete regressor (active or passive) and pupil size as a continuous regressor. This approach allowed us to dissociate effects of pupil size and task engagement on firing rate.</p><p>Model performance was measured by the fraction variance explained (squared correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) between the predicted and actual single-trial spike rates, using nested cross-validation. To test for significant contributions of each regressor, we introduced these variables stepwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>). The full model included both task engagement and pupil size variables. We compared performance of the full model to the performance of a state-independent model, for which both task and pupil variables were shuffled in time (null model), and of two partial models, which accounted for effects of a single state variable while shuffling the values of the other variable in time (task- or pupil partial models).</p><p>The regression analysis revealed substantial variability in effects of task engagement and pupil size on auditory responses. For one example A1 unit, the modulation of firing rate between active and passive blocks was almost completely accounted for by the task variable, with little contribution of pupil size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). When we incorporated the task variable, predictions significantly improved with respect to the state-independent null model (null model, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.12; task partial model, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.30; jackknifed <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top). Pupil size was also able to account for some changes in firing rate (pupil partial model, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, middle), but the full model incorporating both task engagement and pupil size showed no additional improvement over the task partial model (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.30, <italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom). Thus, all behavior-dependent changes for this unit were accounted for by task engagement. The apparent pupil-related effects were in fact explained by correlations between pupil size and task engagement.</p><p>Conversely, for other units, changes in firing rate were uniquely accounted for by pupil size. For a second example A1 unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), the task partial model (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.39) indicated a small improvement over the null model (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.40, <italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05, jackknifed <italic>t</italic>-test). However, the pupil partial model showed a significant improvement over the null model, and it was able to account for changes in the PSTH between passive and active conditions (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.51, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, middle). The full model showed no additional improvement over the pupil partial model (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup><italic> =</italic> 0.53, <italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom). Thus, we found evidence for A1 units whose activity could be modulated either by task engagement or by pupil size.</p><p>Next, we investigated the prevalence of task- and pupil-related modulation across the population of A1 and IC units. To quantify the relative contribution of each variable to model performance, we compared the variance in single-trial spike rate explained by each of the four models (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). Across the entire data set, 66/129 (51%) A1 units and 37/66 (56%) IC units showed a significant increase in <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> for the full model over the null model, indicating an effect of either task engagement or pupil size (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05, jackknife <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By computing the difference between the cross-validated <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> for the full model and for the two partial models separately, we determined the variance that could be uniquely explained by either pupil size or task engagement in each unit. This produced four categories of state-modulated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>): units for which both task and pupil uniquely contributed to the modulation (black); units for which only one variable, task (purple, example unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or pupil (green, example unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), contributed uniquely; and units for which changes in activity could not be uniquely attributed to either task or pupil (dark gray).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Task and pupil-related modulation of firing rates in primary auditory cortex (A1) and inferior colliculus (IC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Doughnut plots indicate number of units significantly modulated by task engagement, pupil size, or both in A1 (left) and IC (right, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05, jackknifed <italic>t</italic>-test).

Although the proportion of units with any significant state-related modulation was comparable between A1 and IC, only about a quarter of those A1 units showed unique pupil-dependent modulation (15/66), compared to about a half for IC (20/37). The average variance uniquely explained by each state variable also differed between areas. In A1, the variance explained by task (mean <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> task-unique: 0.017) was significantly greater than variance explained by pupil (mean <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> pupil-unique: 0.007, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0335, hierarchical bootstrap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

These effects were not significantly different between single- and multiunit data in either area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that in A1, both the magnitude and prevalence of modulation by task engagement are more pronounced than by pupil size. In IC, modulation is equal between the two state variables.</p><p>The analysis above treated task engagement as a discrete, binary variable, switching between active and passive states. However, behavioral performance, measured by <italic>d</italic>’, varied substantially between animals and behavior blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We reasoned that performance represents a more graded measure of task engagement and thus may explain variability in task-related changes across experiments.

Therefore, we asked to what extent pupil-related modulation could explain changes in activity between active and passive blocks that would otherwise be attributed to task engagement alone.</p><p>To quantify the magnitude and sign of the modulation by task engagement, we used a modulation index (<italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic>), which measured the fraction change in mean predicted firing rate between active and passive conditions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwartz and David, 2018</xref>). In previous work, <italic>MI</italic> was measured directly from differences in the raw firing rate. However, pupil size was correlated with task engagement, and both could contribute to changes in firing rate. To tease apart their respective contributions, we used logic similar to the calculation of unique variance explained (above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Based on this observation, we wondered if effects of task engagement and pupil size operated via functionally distinct or common pathways. While identifying specific anatomical circuits was outside the scope of this work, we reasoned that if the two modulations were mediated by the same inputs to A1 and IC, a unit modulated by task engagement would also tend to be modulated by pupil size. To test this prediction, we measured the correlation between modulation that could be uniquely attributed either to task engagement or pupil. To measure modulation by pupil, we computed changes in spike rate associated with pupil size by measuring <italic>MI<sub>LS</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>), analogous to <italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic>, but dividing trials according to whether pupil size was larger or smaller than the median for the experiment, respectively.

In the current study, we were able to use pupil size to explain changes in neural activity across both passive and active conditions. Changes in neural activity explained by pupil size are likely to account for some differences previously reported between task conditions, where different levels of arousal are required (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carcea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knyazeva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>). The effects of task engagement reported here are specific to the tone detection task and are likely to differ if task structure is changed. In contrast, pupil size explains changes in activity throughout active and passive states, and its effects are likely to be similar in different task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz et al., 2020</xref>). By isolating aspects of behavioral state that can be explicitly attributed to changes in pupil, this study moves toward a coherent theory of how a constellation of variables interact to influence sensory coding during behavior.</p><p>Aspects of behavioral state, such as arousal, locomotion, and whisking rate, have been shown to change gradually over the course of an experiment, tracking changes in cortical spiking and performance on operant tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>). A major obstacle to understanding the relationship between behavioral state and neural activity is that state variables often covary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>).

In about half of A1 and IC units, some combination of task engagement and/or pupil size explained changes in spiking activity between blocks of active engagement and passive listening. These behavioral state variables were correlated; that is, pupil size tended to increase during task engagement. However, these changes affected independent neural populations, suggesting that effects of pupil-indexed arousal and other aspects of task engagement operate via distinct feedback circuits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Defining meaningful state variables</title><p>The correlation between pupil size and task engagement demonstrates the importance of accounting for interactions between state variables when measuring their effects on neural activity. This observation also leads to a more fundamental question: what constitutes a meaningful measure of behavioral state? Concepts like task engagement and arousal make intuitive sense, but they become slippery when one attempts to pin them to distinct physiological processes. The current results illustrate that a commonly used binary task engagement variable is better described by a combination of pupil size and accuracy of behavioral performance. Other characterizations of task engagement have argued similarly that the degree of engagement can vary, even when relevant acoustic stimuli are held fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carcea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knyazeva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Larger data sets that track continuous fluctuations in performance are likely to be able to measure fluctuations of engagement effects within behavior blocks. It remains unclear how smoothly internal state can vary. Theories of network attractors suggest that there may in fact be discrete changes in brain state associated with different behavioral contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">La Camera et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, while task engagement is clearly not binary, it could still comprise multiple metastable states.</p><p>As a behavioral state variable, arousal also has multiple definitions, including the transition from wakefulness to sleep, the response to emotionally salient stimuli, and a generalized activation of the autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Satpute et al., 2019</xref>). This relatively nonspecific behavioral concept contrasts with pupil size, which has a clear link to neurophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zekveld et al., 2018</xref>). The detailed circuits that link pupil size to cognitive state are not fully understood, but a connection to behavioral state has been demonstrated repeatedly. Thus, while pupil size may not map trivially onto the concept of arousal, it has a clear link to brain mechanisms.</p><p>A clearer understanding of the relationship between behavioral state and sensory processing may be achieved with models that incorporate additional well-defined variables like pupil size, which can be linked to well-defined neurophysiological processes. For example, motor- and reward-related activity are associated with specific neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakin and Weinberger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knyazeva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>).

These variables may not be directly related to an experimentally imposed task structure, but they capture processes involved in the behavior and can be quantified more concretely than abstract variables based on experimentally imposed task conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reinterpreting previous studies of auditory behavior</title><p>Our findings indicate that changes in firing rate previously attributed to task engagement might instead reflect fluctuations in pupil-indexed arousal, particularly in IC, where pupil-related changes predominate. Changes in pupil size can also explain some modulation that persists after behavior ceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>). However, pupil size does not account for all the modulation between active and passive blocks; instead, it appears that both pupil-indexed arousal and task engagement act on independent neural populations to shape sound processing.</p><p>Previous studies that measured the effects of task engagement on auditory neuronal activity described different effects on overall excitability between A1 and IC. In A1 the effects of task engagement were shown to be enhancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>), while in IC these changes were predominantly suppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>). Separate studies have shown that pupil size is positively correlated with excitability in both A1 and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz et al., 2020</xref>). Here we also found that increased pupil size enhanced excitability in both areas. However, after accounting for pupil-related changes, task-engagement effects were no longer enhancing in A1, and they were more suppressive in IC. Pupil-related changes did not depend on tuning for the target tone. These nonspecific effects of pupil size contrasted with the effects of task engagement, which can be selective for task-relevant features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, significant state-dependent A1 units were equally likely to be modulated by task engagement, by pupil size, or by both. In IC, however, we found that a larger portion of state-dependent changes could be explained by pupil size. Furthermore, in IC but not in A1, units with less reliable auditory responsiveness were those with a stronger state-modulation component. This result is perhaps not surprising given that the majority of IC units in our sample were recorded from non-central regions of the IC (NCIC). These are dorsal and lateral regions of IC that receive feedback from cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winer, 2006</xref>), input from neuromodulatory nuclei such as the pedunculopontine and latero-dorsal tegmental nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Motts and Schofield, 2009</xref>), as well as multisensory information from somatosensory, visual, and oculomotor centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gruters and Groh, 2012</xref>). These results suggest that the auditory midbrain is not a passive sound processor. Instead, the network of midbrain nuclei in the IC plays an active role enhancing behaviorally relevant signals. Experiments that sample more units across the different subregions would be needed to confirm the interplay of behavioral and sensory signals across IC.</p><p>Multiple regression has been used previously to dissociate effects of pupil size and movement on neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). This study used this approach to dissociate the effects of state-related variables and differentiate where effects emerge. Several other variables have been shown to impact auditory responses during behavior, including selective attention, temporal expectation, reward value, and motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaramillo and Zador, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakatos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>). The same method can be adopted to explore the contribution of other state variables measured in normal conditions as well as in perturbation experiments to identify the circuits through which such variables operate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of neuromodulation in effects of task engagement and pupil-indexed arousal in A1 and IC</title><p>The correlation between task engagement and pupil size may help explain a number of results related to neuromodulation in the auditory system. It is well established that neuromodulators can induce short-term changes in activity and sensory tuning in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakin and Weinberger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goard and Dan, 2009</xref>) and midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gittelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Habbicht and Vater, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hurley and Pollak, 2005</xref>). Cholinergic fibers projecting to A1 from the nucleus basalis play a key role in rapid switching between passive listening and active engagement by modulating the activity of different populations of cortical inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the activity of cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals in A1 was found to be elevated during pupil dilation and reduced during pupil constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, these neuromodulatory systems have been implicated in effects of both task engagement and pupil-indexed arousal. The correlation between these state variables could be explained by shared cholinergic and noradrenergic signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol IP1561) and conform to National Institutes of Health standards.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Animal care and procedures were similar to those described previously for neurophysiological recordings from awake behaving ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>). Four young adult male ferrets were obtained from an animal supplier (Marshall Farms, North Rose, NY). After a 2-week quarantine, a sterile surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia to mount two head-posts for head fixation and to permit access to auditory brain regions for recordings. A UV light-cured composite (Charisma, Heraeus Kulzer International) was used to mount two custom-made stainless-steel head-posts spaced approximately 1 cm apart along the sagittal crest of the skull. The stability of the implant was achieved using 8–10 stainless steel bone screws mounted in the skull (Depuy Synthes, Raynham, MA), which were covered along with the headpost in additional Charisma and acrylic denture material (Co-oral-ite Dental, Diamond Springs. CA). Two 1.2 × 1.2 cm wells over A1 in the implant were covered with only a thin layer of Charisma to allow access to auditory regions.</p><p>Following surgery, animals were treated with prophylactic antibiotics (Baytril 10 mg/kg) and analgesics (Buprenorphin 0.02 mg/kg) under the supervision of University veterinary staff. For the first 2 weeks the wound was cleaned with antiseptics (Betadine 1:4 in saline and Chlorhexidine 0.2%) and bandaged daily with application of topic antibiotic ointment (Bacitracin). After the wound margin was healed, cleaning and bandaging occurred every 2–3 days throughout the life of the animals. This method revealed to be very effective in minimizing infections of the wound margin. After recovery (~2 weeks), animals were habituated to a head-fixed posture inside the sound-booth chamber for about 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral paradigm and training</title><p>The animals were trained by instrumental conditioning to perform a positively reinforced, tone versus noise discrimination task (ferret L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>) or tone-in-noise detection task (ferrets R, B, and T). During training, animals were provided access to water ad libitum on weekends, but were placed on water restriction during the weekdays (Monday through Friday), allowing them to maintain &gt;90% of their baseline body weight long term. On weekdays, they were given the opportunity to receive liquid reward during behavioral training. Each behavioral trial consisted of a sequence of two to five broadband noise reference sounds (TORCs; 30 samples, five octaves, 0.75 s duration, 0.7 s inter-stimulus interval) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 2000</xref>), followed by a target tone, either alone (tone versus noise task) or overlapping with another TORC (tone-in-noise task). Animals reported the occurrence of the target by licking a water spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Licks were detected by a piezoelectric sensor glued to the spout. Licks occurring within the target window, 0.1–1.5 s after target onset, were rewarded with one to three drops of a 2:1 solution of water and a high-protein, high-calorie dietary supplement (Ensure). FAs, licks occurring before the target window, and misses, a failure to lick during the target window, resulted in a 5–8 s timeout. Regardless of trial outcome, the next trial began only after animals did not lick for a random period (2.5 ± 0.5 s), reducing the prevalence of accidental, short-latency FAs. The number of TORCs per trial was distributed randomly with a flat hazard function to prevent behavioral timing strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heffner and Heffner, 1995</xref>). Behavioral performance was measured using <italic>d’</italic>, the z-scored difference between hit rate (HR) and FA rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>).</p><p>A behavioral block consisted of 60–100 trials with the same target tone frequency (100–20,000 Hz) and same distribution of target SNR. Animals completed one to three behavioral blocks per day, between which target frequency and/or SNR could change. During training, target frequency was chosen at random to span the audiogram of a ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 1986</xref>). During electrophysiological recordings, target tone frequency was selected to match the BF of the recording site.</p><p>During the training on the tone-in-noise variant of the task, the TORC sample masking the target varied randomly in each trial to prevent animals from using TORCs’ spectro-temporal features to identify targets. At the beginning of training, the tone was presented at +40 dB SNR (ratio of peak-to-peak amplitude) relative to the TORCs. This difference was gradually reduced over the course of 2–3 weeks until the animal consistently performed above chance (three behavioral blocks with performance yielding <italic>d</italic>’&gt;1, see below) at 0 dB SNR.</p><p>For the tone-in-noise task, the SNR of the tone with respect to the overall level of the TORCs (fixed at 55 or 60 dB SPL depending on the animal) varied between +5 and −20 dB SNR, in 5 dB steps. Each session included five target/noise SNRs. To manipulate task difficulty within each session, the probability of each of the five target/noise SNRs varied, yielding two difficulty conditions: a high SNR (‘easy’) condition in which 60% of the trials the target/noise SNR was either the highest or the second to the highest SNR within the target/noise SNR distribution; and a low SNR (‘hard’) condition in which the two lowest target/noise SNRs occurred in 60% of the trials. For example, for ferret B, the distribution after training was completed and kept between 0 and −20 dB SNR, so that in the easy condition 0 and −5 dB SNR targets would appear 60% of the time, −10 dB SNR 20% of the time, and the remaining −15 and −20 dB SNR would be presented another 20% of the trials. During electrophysiological tone-in-noise experiments, the tone was embedded in a single TORC sample, which also occurred in the reference period. We confirmed that animals were not biased to respond to this TORC exemplar in the reference phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sound presentation</title><p>Behavioral training and subsequent neurophysiological recording took place in a sound-attenuating chamber (Gretch-Ken) with a custom double-wall insert.

Digital acoustic signals were transformed to analog (National Instruments), amplified (Crown), and delivered through two free-field speakers (Manger, 50–35 000 Hz flat gain) positioned ±30° azimuth and 80 cm distant from the animal. Stimuli were presented either from the left or the right speaker, contralaterally to the recording site. Sound level was equalized and calibrated against a standard reference (Brüel and Kjær).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pupil recording</title><p>During experiments, infrared video of one eye was collected for offline measurement of pupil size as an index of arousal (pupil-indexed arousal). Ambient light was maintained at a constant level to prevent light-evoked changes in pupil and to maximize the dynamic range of pupil-related changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz et al., 2020</xref>). Recordings were collected using a CCD camera (Adafruit TTL Serial Camera 397) fitted with a lens (M12 Lenses PT-2514BMP 25.0 mm) whose focal length allowed placement of the camera 10 cm from the eye. To improve contrast, the imaged eye was illuminated by a bank of infrared LEDs. Ambient luminance was provided using a ring light (AmScope LED-144S). At the start of each recording day, the intensity of the ring light was set to a level (~1500 lux measured at the recorded eye) chosen to give a maximum dynamic range of pupil sizes. Light intensity remained fixed across the recording session. Pupil size was measured from the video signal offline using custom MATLAB software, which is detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz et al., 2020</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neurophysiology</title><p>Data were recorded during behavior and pupillometry from 129 units in A1 and 66 units in IC.

After animals demonstrated consistent above-chance performance (target versus reference <italic>d</italic>’ &gt; 1, see below), a small craniotomy was opened to access either A1 or IC. Extracellular neuronal activity was recorded in non-anesthetized ferrets either using a tetrode (Thomas Recording Inc) or a linear 64-channel silicon probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shobe et al., 2015</xref>). The impedance of the tetrode was measured to be 1–2 MOhm, and the 64-channel probe was electroplated to reach a 0.7-MOhm impedance in each channel. The tetrode and probe were inserted using a motorized electrode positioning system (Alpha-Omega).</p><p>Amplified (tetrodes, AM Systems; arrays, Intan) and digitized (National Instruments) electrophysiological signals were stored using the open-source data acquisition software MANTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Englitz et al., 2013</xref>) or Open Ephys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Black et al., 2017</xref>).

Sites in A1 were confirmed based on tonotopy—which changes from high to low BF as one moves from dorso-medial to ventro-lateral regions—and relatively reliable and simple frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shamma et al., 1993</xref>). Recording sites in the IC were classified based on tonotopy and response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitkin et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 1983</xref>). Neurons in the central nucleus of the IC (here referred to as ICC) receive input from the auditory brainstem, and have a characteristic short response latency, dorsal-ventral tonotopy, and narrow bandwidth tuning. Conversely, regions around the central nucleus do not receive direct ascending input and present longer response latencies, considerably less sharp tuning, lack consistent tonotopic organization; these areas were grouped together as NCIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slee and David, 2015</xref>).</p><p>For tetrode recordings, upon unit isolation, a series of brief (100 ms duration, 200–400 ms inter-stimulus interval, 50 dB SPL) tones and/or narrowband noise bursts were used to determine the range of frequencies that evoked the strongest response, the BF of the unit(s). If a unit(s) in the site did not respond to the sound stimuli (an evoked increase or decrease in activity compared to spontaneous activity either during or after sound presentation), the electrode was moved to a new recording depth with small, 5 µm incremental steps. For the 64-channel recordings, we lowered the probe so that its entire extent (1 mm) spanned the target region (A1 or IC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>Putative spikes were sorted offline by band-pass filtering the raw trace (300–6000 Hz) and extracting events from the continuous signal that deviated ≥4 standard deviations from zero.

colliculus and auditory cortex of ferrets as they engaged in a tone detection task while monitoring arousal via pupillometry. The authors found that arousal effects were more prominent in IC, while arousal and engagement effects were equally likely in A1. Task engagement was correlated with increased arousal. The authors propose that there is a hierarchy such that generalized arousal enhances activity in the midbrain, and task engagement effects are more prominent in cortex, showing that the effects of brain state and behavioral context are area specific.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissociation of task engagement and arousal effects in auditory cortex and midbrain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Saderi and her colleagues have attempted to determine whether and how two behavior-related variables – arousal and task engagement – differently influence activity in two stages of the auditory neuraxis, IC and A1. They define arousal as pupil diameter and task-engagement as a binary variable determined by the experimental block design. They find that although these two parameters often co-vary, they sometimes do not. They find that IC was more influenced by arousal and A1 was modulated by both arousal and engagement. One of their main findings is that previous reports of task-engagement effects may in fact be attributed to arousal state.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The major concern is the use of a continuous readout of arousal (i.e. pupil diameter) with a binary readout of task-engagement (i.e. the block the animal is in at any moment). The reviewers would like to know if task engagement be explained more rigorously as a continuous rather than binary variable. One notes that when training and testing animals on appetitive behaviors, task engagement can wax and wane within a single block, across an experimental recording session, or across days of behavioral testing. Such changes in engagement can be inferred, for example, as strings of (seemingly) easy trials in which the animal does not answer correctly. The authors should attempt to quantify through behavioral analysis (running lapse rate, lick latency, etc) whether and how task engagement may be changing within and across task blocks. Alternatively, the authors could clearly explain that their binary encoding of engagement has limitations and may not actually describe the animal's engagement at any given moment.</p><p>2) Can a continuous readout of task engagement better explain neural activity? For many neurons, task-engagement does not provide unique predictive information, yet for others it does (e.g. Figure 3C). If task engagement can be modeled as a continuous rather than binary variable, is it still true that &quot;some apparent effects of task engagement should in fact be attributed to fluctuations in arousal&quot; (Abstract)? There is a concern that the current analysis maybe a floor on task-related modulations since it assumes constant engagement throughout a task block.</p><p>3) Can neural heterogeneity be attributed to animal-to-animal behavioral variability? Even if task engagement does not vary within a task block for any one animal, it may indeed vary across animals. In theory, the actual task engagement of some animals might more closely mirror the block design that the experimenters are imposing, and some animals may simply have a higher level of engagement than others. This could mean that some results that are currently attributed to population-level heterogeneity (e.g. some A1 neurons do this, while others do that) might actually be attributed to animal-to-animal heterogeneity as opposed to distinct neural populations. For example, the authors state that for a subset of neurons, persistent task-like activity after a block change can be accounted for by pupil size, whereas for other neurons this effect cannot (Figure 7). The authors should confirm that key findings are consistent across animals and not related to degrees of task engagement (see point #1). If the findings are not consistent across animals but can be explained by each animals' unique behavior, this would also be really cool.</p><p>4) With respect to recordings, the authors should clearly distinguish single units from multi-units. This is described in the Materials and methods, but referred to later in the manuscript.</p><p>5) With respect to analyses, there are questions regarding the independence of many of the data points (e.g. neurons recorded simultaneously or from the same animals, same sessions, etc.), and how this interdependence might contribute to some of the findings. Relatedly, could some neural effects can be accounted for by the animals from which they were recorded (and from that particular animal's behavior)?</p><p>6) With respect to novelty, some of the ground covered in this report has been covered before. Using a different experimental approach, the study of Knyazeva et al., 2020, Front Neurosci. 14: 306 already suggested that the discharges of many neurons in AC are affected by arousal, that task effects can disappear if effects of arousal have been accounted for, and that there is no systematic difference in response modulation between neurons tuned, or not tuned, to task-relevant sounds. Dissociations of the effects of different non-auditory factors on sound responses in AC have also been described by Zhou et al., 2014, and by Carcea et al., 2017. This work should be discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Dissociation of task engagement and arousal effects in auditory cortex and midbrain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor.</p><p>A concern remains. One reviewer noted “it appears that data from only about 20 behavioral sessions entered analyses”. The reviewer was concerned that neurons simultaneously recorded in the same session were statistically more dependent than neurons recorded in different sessions. In your revised manuscript please include the number of animals from which the pupil data and the neuronal data were obtained, state why one animal was not considered for neuronal data (it appears that there were four animals in total of which three provided neuronal data) and include the total number of sessions for pupil data and the total number of sessions for neuronal data in each animal. The reviewer was concerned about what can be inferred from these sample sizes. Please also include a statement that the results on the effects of task engagement may not apply to all auditory tasks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60153.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The major concern is the use of a continuous readout of arousal (i.e. pupil diameter) with a binary readout of task-engagement (i.e. the block the animal is in at any moment).

In fact, this concern was a key motivation for the current study, which determined how much of a canonical “task engagement” effect (reported in many studies—Downer et al., 2015; Fritz et al., 2005, 2003; Knudsen and Gentner, 2013; Kuchibhotla et al., 2017; Lee and Middlebrooks, 2011; Otazu et al., 2009; Ryan and Miller, 1977; Yin et al., 2014) can be explained by pupil-indexed arousal. A change in pupil size may itself also not reflect a single neural process, but we argue in the Discussion that it is closer constituent of a behavioral state than the binary task engagement variable.</p><p>More to the reviewer’s point, the effects of task engagement that cannot be explained by pupil size are still likely not to reflect a single, binary variable. Early in the project, we explored several more fine-grained models that broke down engagement based on behavioral performance, but these were not pursued because they did not provide additional explanatory power in our initial dataset. However, we revisited this question for the full dataset and identified an effect of task performance that was not apparent earlier.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we compared the magnitude of task engagement effects on neural activity to behavioral performance (measured by sensitivity, <italic>d</italic>’) on each behavioral block. <italic>d</italic>’ is higher when animals tend to respond correctly (high hit rate, low false alarm rate). When we tested the relationship between <italic>d</italic>’ and engagement effects, we found a correlation in A1 but not IC. We also found no relationship between behavioral performance and pupil-related changes in neural activity in either area.</p><p>To study performance-dependent variability on a finer timescale, we formulated a more complex model with two additional regressors—the moving average of hit rate and false alarm rate over a 3 minute window (~25 trials). A model including these new regressors explained some additional neural variability over the original binary engagement model. However, it did not improve accuracy over the block-wise performance-dependent model described in the previous paragraph. We elected to not include this model in the revision because of its complexity and the fact that the block-wise performance model demonstrated the critical result that some task-related effects depend on behavioral performance.</p><p>In sum, our new analysis confirms that, even after accounting for pupil-related effects on neural activity, task engagement is in fact not a binary variable. This result also provides additional evidence for functional differences between A1 and IC. We now include the analysis of performance dependence in a new Figure (Figure 4):</p><p>These results are also described in the text:</p><p>“The analysis above treated task engagement as a discrete, binary variable, switching between active and passive states. However, behavioral performance, measured by d’, varied substantially between animals and behavior blocks (Figure 1C). We reasoned that performance represents a more graded measure of task engagement and thus may explain variability in task-related changes across experiments. Indeed, we found a significant correlation between d’ and the unique variance explained by task in A1 (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> task unique; <italic>r</italic> = 0.303, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00019; Figure 4A, left). The same relationship was not observed in IC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.069, <italic>p</italic> = 0.580; Figure 4A, right), nor was there a relationship between d’ and unique variance explained by pupil in either area (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> pupil unique; A1: <italic>r</italic> = 0.113, <italic>p</italic> = 0.139; IC: r = -0.017, <italic>p</italic> = 0.892, Figure 4B). Thus, in A1, effects of task engagement cannot be described by a binary variable, even after dissociating effects of pupil. Instead, effects of task engagement are comprised of at least one process that varies continuously between more and less accurate behavior.”</p><p>To emphasize that finer timescale analysis such as the moving average model might be valuable when adequate data are available, we highlight this as a valuable future direction for identifying important task-related state variables:</p><p>“Larger datasets that track continuous fluctuations in performance are likely to be able to measure fluctuations of task engagement effects within behavior blocks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can a continuous readout of task engagement better explain neural activity? For many neurons, task-engagement does not provide unique predictive information, yet for others it does (e.g. Figure 3C). If task engagement can be modeled as a continuous rather than binary variable, is it still true that &quot;some apparent effects of task engagement should in fact be attributed to fluctuations in arousal&quot; (Abstract)? There is a concern that the current analysis maybe a floor on task-related modulations since it assumes constant engagement throughout a task block.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “task engagement” is not a discrete, binary variable. Our formulation was a simplification, motivated by the limited statistical power available in the experimental data. However, the analysis described above demonstrates an additional dependence on task performance that we have added in a new figure in the revised manuscript. See reply to #1 for details.</p><p>We would also like to point out that theories have been developed around network attractor states, and that engaging in a task could actually produce a stable shift in neural network dynamics (Le Camera et al. 2019). Thus, while unlikely to be the whole story, the idea of a discrete (if not binary) variable is not completely far-fetched. We have also clarified issues around the meaning of “task engagement” in the Discussion.</p><p>“It remains unclear how smoothly internal state can vary. Theories of network attractors suggest that there may in fact be discrete changes in brain state associated with different behavioral context (La Camera et al., 2019). Thus, while clearly task engagement is not binary, it could still comprise multiple metastable states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can neural heterogeneity be attributed to animal-to-animal behavioral variability? Even if task engagement does not vary within a task block for any one animal, it may indeed vary across animals. In theory, the actual task engagement of some animals might more closely mirror the block design that the experimenters are imposing, and some animals may simply have a higher level of engagement than others.

If the findings are not consistent across animals but can be explained by each animals' unique behavior, this would also be really cool.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point. When we went back to the data to look at the relationship between performance and task effects, we also observed differences in both the size of task engagement effects in A1 and behavioral performance (<italic>d</italic>’) between animals. These were correlated, and when we performed multiple regression, we found that the differences in neural activity between animals could be explained completely by <italic>d</italic>’. So indeed, as the reviewer suggests, there are differences between animals, which are reflected in <italic>d</italic>’. These analyses are detailed in new figures and in the Results (Figure 4):</p><p>“We also observed that both <italic>d</italic>’ and task engagement effects in A1 differed between animals (Figures 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We wondered if the differences in neural modulation could be fully explained by behavioral performance or if they reflected additional between-animal differences. To answer this question, we performed a multiple regression with both <italic>d</italic>’ and animal identity as independent variables. This analysis revealed that in A1 <italic>d</italic>’ could fully explain the differences in modulation for task engagement (<italic>d</italic>’: <italic>F</italic> = 16.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000093; animal: <italic>F</italic> = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.52). Neither <italic>d</italic>’ or animal significantly predicted task engagement effects in IC (<italic>d</italic>’: <italic>F</italic> = 1.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29; animal: <italic>F</italic> = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.80). A similar analysis of pupil-related effects revealed that <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> pupil unique did not depend on <italic>d</italic>’, although it did depend on the amount of pupil variability within an experiment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Thus, differences in task engagement effects between animals could be explained by differences in the accuracy with which they performed the task.”</p><p>As suggested, we also compared changes in post- versus pre-passive responses across animals and found no significant difference. This is reported in the revision:</p><p>“This change was not significantly different between animals in A1 (<italic>F</italic> = 0.669, <italic>p</italic> = 0.516, one-way ANOVA) or in IC (<italic>F</italic> = 0.446, <italic>p</italic> = 0.643).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With respect to recordings, the authors should clearly distinguish single units from multi-units. This is described in the Materials and methods, but referred to later in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. We compared multi- and single-unit data and didn’t find significant differences between arousal or engagement effects in either A1 or IC. We include this analysis in a new supplemental figure.</p><p>“These effects were not significantly different between single- and multi-unit data in either area (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With respect to analyses, there are questions regarding the independence of many of the data points (e.g. neurons recorded simultaneously or from the same animals, same sessions, etc.), and how this interdependence might contribute to some of the findings. Relatedly, could some neural effects can be accounted for by the animals from which they were recorded (and from that particular animal's behavior)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, it is important to consider potential differences between animals. Our new analysis finds that there are in fact differences in behavioral performance (<italic>d</italic>’) between animals. While there are no significant differences in task engagement effects between animals, there is a relationship between performance (<italic>d</italic>’) and neural effects (see reply to #1 and #3 above). We have added figures describing these results (Figures 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). See quoted figure/text in the reply to #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) With respect to novelty, some of the ground covered in this report has been covered before. Using a different experimental approach, the study of Knyazeva et al., 2020 already suggested that the discharges of many neurons in AC are affected by arousal, that task effects can disappear if effects of arousal have been accounted for, and that there is no systematic difference in response modulation between neurons tuned, or not tuned, to task-relevant sounds. Dissociations of the effects of different non-auditory factors on sound responses in AC have also been described by Zhou et al., 2014, and by Carcea et al., 2017. This work should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The studies cited by the reviewer are quite relevant to the current study, in having demonstrated effects of behavioral state that are distinct from task engagement. In the case of Zhou et al., the motor activation is likely to be closely related to pupil-indexed arousal measured in our study. In the case of Knyazeva et al. and Carea et al., it is clear that changing the rules of behavior impacts neural coding and further amplifies the points that “task engagement” is not a binary variable. While none of these studies measured pupil, it is likely that some of the changes they report could be explained by pupil-indexed arousal while others may be explained by mechanisms that produce performance-dependent changes during task engagement.</p><p>In the spirit of the task structure effects (Knyazeva and Carea studies), we tested for a dependence on task difficulty in the original manuscript (now Figure 6—figure supplement 2). We now cite these previous studies in our description of this analysis in the Results, as well as incorporate all of this literature into more general points in the Introduction and Discussion:</p><p>“Introduction: Task-related changes in the activity of auditory neurons have been attributed to temporal expectation (Jaramillo and Zador, 2011), reward associations (Beaton and Miller, 1975; David et al., 2012), self-generated sound (Eliades and Wang, 2008), and non-sound related variables, such as motor planning (Bizley et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019), motor activity (Schneider et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014), degree of engagement (Carcea et al., 2017; Knyazeva et al., 2020), and behavioral choice (Tsunada et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Results: Task engagement effects could also depend on the difficulty or other structural elements of the task (Carcea et al., 2017; Knyazeva et al., 2020). We considered whether state-dependent effects varied with task difficulty but found no differences between pure tone, high SNR tone-in-noise (easy), and low SNR tone-in-noise (hard) conditions (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>“Discussion: The current results illustrate that a binary task engagement variable is better described by a combination of pupil size and accuracy of behavioral performance. Other characterizations of task engagement have argued similarly that the degree of engagement can vary, even when relevant acoustic stimuli are held fixed (Atiani et al., 2009; Carcea et al., 2017; Knyazeva et al., 2020; McGinley et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014). Larger datasets that track continuous fluctuations in performance are likely to be able to measure fluctuations of task engagement effects within behavior blocks. It remains unclear how smoothly internal state can vary. Theories of network attractors suggest that there may in fact be discrete changes in brain state associated with different behavioral contexts (La Camera et al., 2019). Thus, while task engagement is clearly not binary, it could still comprise multiple metastable states.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A concern remains. One reviewer noted “it appears that data from only about 20 behavioral sessions entered analyses”. The reviewer was concerned that neurons simultaneously recorded in the same session were statistically more dependent than neurons recorded in different sessions. In your revised manuscript please include the number of animals from which the pupil data and the neuronal data were obtained, state why one animal was not considered for neuronal data (it appears that there were four animals in total of which three provided neuronal data) and include the total number of sessions for pupil data and the total number of sessions for neuronal data in each animal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing these questions to light. Some of this information was implicit in the text, but we agree, it is much clearer to report it explicitly, as suggested. A total of four animals were included in the study (as shown in Figure 1). Neurophysiological data was collected from both A1 and IC in two animals (animals B and R) and only from A1 or IC in the remaining two (animals T and L, respectively). We have added information about animal and site count to the Results:</p><p>Pupil data sessions: “Mean pupil size (measured by the major axis diameter) was consistently larger during the active condition (n=35 sites total, animal L: n=13, B: n=5, R: n=16, T: n=1, p = 0.0133, hierarchical bootstrap, Figure 1D).”</p><p>Neural data sessions: “We recorded extracellular spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1, n = 129 units total, animal B: 6 sites/88 units, R: 1 site/13 units, T: 1 site/28 units) and the inferior colliculus (IC, n = 66 units total, animal B: 4 sites/7 units, L: 13 sites/46 units, R: 10 sites/13 units) of ferrets, while they switched between active engagement and passive listening.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewer was concerned about what can be inferred from these sample sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>General observations in the current data alleviated concerns about the main results, namely the large variability of effects within a single array recording (e.g., Figure 4), exemplified by the examples in Figure 2, where two neurons recorded simultaneously show very different effects of behavioral state.</p><p>However, this comment did motivate us to investigate a more rigorous statistical approach. We implemented a hierarchical bootstrap analysis developed explicitly to control for the type of bias that can arise in array recordings (Saravanan et al., 2020 <italic>arXiv</italic>), and we used it to assess significance of differences across populations in different experimental conditions. Because of this, reports of statistical tests have been updated in several places. Note that the hierarchical bootstrap method allows us to directly calculate the probability of the tested hypothesis being true. With 10000 bootstrap resamples, the minimum possible probability (or p-value) is 10<sup>-5</sup>, and therefore we report “p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>” when zero bootstrap samples provide evidence supporting the null hypothesis.</p><p>We have revised the presentation of statistical tests to highlight the new approach:</p><p>“Several analyses assessed changes in the median of repeatedly sampled data, <italic>e.g.</italic>, average pupil size measured across multiple behavior blocks (Figure 1) or average state-dependent modulation measured across multiple units (Figures 3, 5-8). In this case, significant differences were assessed using a hierarchical bootstrap test (Saravanan et al., 2020). The hierarchical bootstrap is nonparametric, like the more traditional Wilcoxon signed-rank test. However, a traditional test that treats each unit as an independent measure could potentially be biased if a single array recording produced spuriously large effects. The hierarchical bootstrap controls for this possibility by resampling first across recording sessions and then within each of those sessions. The bootstrap analysis was run for 10,000 iterations, so that the minimum measurable p-value was 10<sup>-5</sup>. Results that returned <italic>p</italic>=0 after this many iterations are reported as <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>.”</p><p>We made numerous small changes to report the new test. Rather than detailing all the changes, following is a list of analyses where a Wilcoxon signed-rank test or permutation test (for correlation coefficient) was replaced by a hierarchical bootstrap. In these cases, the basic result (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 or p&gt;0.05) was unchanged:</p><p>There were two instances where the hierarchical bootstrap test produced a different result than the previous version of the manuscript. Neither of these analyses is critical to the main findings in the study:</p><p>Figure 5: In IC, the average change in spike rate uniquely attributable to task engagement (<italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic> task-unique) was previously reported to be significantly less than zero but now tests at p = 0.062. We have revised the text: “In IC, average <italic>MIAP task-only</italic> was not different from zero (<italic>MIAP task-only</italic> median: -0.010, <italic>p</italic> = 0.310), but <italic>MI<sub>AP</sub> task-unique</italic> showed a trend toward being negative (17/49 positive, median: -0.037; <italic>p</italic> = 0.062).”</p><p>We did find that accounting for effects of pupil consistently decreased <italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic> (i.e., <italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic> task unique &lt; <italic>MI<sub>AP</sub></italic> task-only) in both A1 and IC.
