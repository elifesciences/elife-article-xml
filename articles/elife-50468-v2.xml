pneumoniae</italic> is an increasing cause of infant mortality in developing countries. We aimed to develop a quantitative understanding of the drivers of this epidemic by estimating the effects of antibiotics on nosocomial transmission risk, comparing competing hypotheses about mechanisms of spread, and quantifying the impact of potential interventions. Using a sequence of dynamic models, we analysed data from a one-year prospective carriage study in a Cambodian neonatal intensive care unit with hyperendemic third-generation cephalosporin-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. All widely-used antibiotics except imipenem were associated with an increased daily acquisition risk, with an odds ratio for the most common combination (ampicillin + gentamicin) of 1.96 (95% CrI 1.18, 3.36). Models incorporating genomic data found that colonisation pressure was associated with a higher transmission risk, indicated sequence type heterogeneity in transmissibility, and showed that within-ward transmission was insufficient to maintain endemicity. Simulations indicated that increasing the nurse-patient ratio could be an effective intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>pathogen genomics</kwd><kwd>cohort study</kwd><kwd>neonates</kwd><kwd>South East Asia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106698/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Nicholas PJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K006924/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Ben S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Colonisation with resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> in a Cambodian neonatal unit is driven by person-to-person transmission, transmissibility varies by sequence type, and antibiotic consumption generally increases the risk of acquisition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infections with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae constitute a major threat to public health in all regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwaber and Carmeli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Theuretzbacher, 2017</xref>) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have been prioritised by the World Health Organization as pathogenic bacteria in need of novel therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">World Health Organization, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). These organisms pose the highest risk to subgroups of patients such as those undergoing surgery, requiring invasive devices, and neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peleg and Hooper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldmann, 1981</xref>). Antimicrobial resistance is of particular concern in developing (lower and middle-income) countries where the estimated per capita mortality from drug-resistant bacteraemia is far greater than in high-income countries and where last-line antibiotics may be unavailable or unaffordable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zaidi et al., 2005</xref>). The high risk of difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections threatens to undermine patient confidence in developing world hospitals and health systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dondorp et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we focus on <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, which is amongst the most clinically important multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in developing country settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox-Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zellweger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musicha et al., 2017</xref>). Genomic studies characterising the population structure of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> have revealed a complex consisting of three separate species (<italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>K. quasipneumoniae</italic>, <italic>K. variicola</italic>) that are indistinguishable by culture or standard biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holt et al., 2015</xref>). Where these isolates remain undifferentiated by molecular assay, we refer to them as <italic>K. pneumoniae sensu lato</italic> (in the broad sense).</p><p>While there is currently widespread concern about Gram-negative bacteria as an emerging threat due to high levels of plasmid-borne resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordmann et al., 2011</xref>), pathogens such as <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> have been considered a major problem in nosocomial settings for over half a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yow, 1955</xref>). Research during the 1960s identified a number of drivers of <italic>Klebsiella</italic> colonisation and infection in hospital settings including invasive devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mertz et al., 1967</xref>), environmental contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kresky, 1964</xref>), introduction from the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kessner and Lepper, 1967</xref>), person-to-person transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weil et al., 1966</xref>), endogenous selection from antibiotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selden et al., 1971</xref>) and transient carriage on the hands of health-care workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1970</xref>). In a comprehensive review of this body of work, Montgomerie concluded that ‘The likely means of transmission of <italic>Klebsiella</italic> is via the hands of hospital staff members’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montgomerie, 1979</xref>).</p><p>More recently, carriage studies in high-income hospital settings in temperate regions have used whole-genome sequencing to show the critical importance of asymptomatic carriage for understanding the epidemiology of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, establishing a firm link between gastrointestinal carriage and clinical infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gorrie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorrie et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to studies in high-income countries where multidrug-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is typically rare, prospective carriage studies in hospitalised paediatric populations in developing countries in Africa and Asia have reported hyperendemic levels of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae including <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andriatahina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Founou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 2016</xref>) consistent with the greater burden of disease due to these organisms in lower income settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musicha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite their clinical importance, there are major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. First, while a number of recent investigations of localised hospital outbreaks in high-income settings have provided evidence that long-term environmental contamination of sinks and other sites may play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarivet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decraene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathers et al., 2018</xref>), the relative importance of persistently contaminated point sources versus patient-to-patient transmission in endemic settings remains unclear. Second, though it is widely assumed that antibiotic exposures play an important role in selecting for multidrug-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2018</xref>), such effects have not previously been quantified at the patient level in a way that disentangles antibiotic effects from general exposure to the hospital environment. Third, attempts to quantify transmissibility and how this varies by sequence type (ST) are lacking. Fourth, the impacts of other factors that might plausibly affect transmission including staffing levels, infant breast feeding and use of probiotics have not been explored.</p><p>To address these knowledge gaps, we used data collected from a year-long prospective observational carriage study in a Cambodian neonatal intensive care unit and analysis methods which build upon a previously described data-driven stochastic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forrester and Pettitt, 2005</xref>). We fit four models with logit link functions to estimate the impact of covariates on the daily risk of acquisition of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic>. As these models are unable to identify the force of infection, and genomic data show the ward 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> to be a highly heterogeneous bacterial community, we then fit five linear transmission models to estimate the force of infection for acquisition of each ST. Finally, we use the estimated parameters to provide model-based assessments of the potential impact of hypothetical control measures. We define &quot;acquisition&quot; as the first detection of the organism within an infant following an initial negative swab on admission, which may indicate transmission from other colonised infants or hospital staff, or endogenous selection as a result of antibiotic pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Descriptive epidemiological data</title><p>Over the year-long observation period, there were consistently high rates of patient carriage of third generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) <italic>K. pneumoniae sensu lato</italic>. Of 333 infants admitted to the neonatal unit, 121 of 289 (42%) were found to be colonised on the first swab taken within 48 hours of ward admission. A further 21 out of 44 (48%) were positive on the first swab that was taken more than 48 hours after admission. Overall, 109/191 (57%) infants who initially screened negative for 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> became positive during their stay in the neonatal unit.

Model assessment was performed with a posterior predictive check; we estimated the probability of acquisition for each of the 400 swabbing intervals and binned these probabilities into groups defined by the quintiles. We then calculated the expected number of colonisation events in each of the five groups and compared these with the observed number of acquisitions. Within each of these groups, the posterior median of the predicted number of acquisitions was close to the observed number of events, and the observed values were always within the 80% CrI of the model estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The results from fitting risk factor model A with alternative prior distributions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; substantially reducing the variance of the priors for the model intercept and covariates had a negligible effect on the posterior parameter estimates.</p><p>When the intercept was permitted to vary by study month in a hierarchical model (risk factor model D; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), little variation was observed between months; the median posterior baseline probability ranged from 0.20 to 0.23 with wide credible intervals. As these models did not include a colonisation pressure term, the intercept incorporated time-varying changes in the underlying intensity of transmission. The low variance in the monthly intercepts therefore suggests a relatively constant force of infection over the 12-month study period. In models where we included a colonisation pressure term (risk factor model C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) this was found to have a slightly negative slope for acquisition of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> (OR 0.96 [95% CrI 0.86, 1.09]). This is surprising, as if patient-to-patient transmission was occurring, we would usually expect the force of infection to increase with the colonisation pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonten, 2012</xref>). The finding therefore suggested that one of the following three possibilities was true: i) patient-to-patient transmission was not occurring at a high frequency in this ward; ii) patient-to-patient transmission was occurring but, because of the continually high ward-level prevalence, variations in the force of infection could not be identified; iii) patient-to-patient transmission was occurring but exposure to the presence of two or more colonised patients presented a similar risk for acquisition as exposure to one.

We compared the support for competing hypotheses about modes of spread, quantified effects of antibiotic exposures as drivers of the epidemic, evaluated risk factors for transmission, and forward simulated to evaluate the potential benefits of interventions.</p><p>We found that carriage strains of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> among neonates constituted a highly diverse population, with considerable intra-host variation within STs. There were frequent acquisitions or detection of resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> that were closely related to strains carried by other infants on the ward at the time of acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Within-host diversity of these lineages was similar to between-host diversity in potentially linked cases. Moreover, once genomic information was considered, models incorporating colonisation pressure as a risk factor for acquisition showed substantially better fits to data than models without colonisation pressure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Taken together with the lack of persistent environmental contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smit et al., 2018</xref>) and the lack of improvement in model fit when long-term environmental contamination was considered, these findings add support to the view that patient-to-patient transmission (much of which is likely to be mediated by contacts with healthcare workers) is the main driver of resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> acquisition, and that colonised patients represent the primary reservoir. Notably, this result was only apparent when we incorporated genomic data into our models to estimate transmission parameters by ST.</p><p>We are aware of one other prospective study of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonisation dynamics from a developing country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonneault et al., 2019</xref>). This study considered ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonisation in a neonatal unit in Madagascar over a period of six months, and found similar rates of acquisition with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to those seen here. Though sequencing data were not used, fitting transmission models to data provided evidence of patient-to-patient and healthcare worker-patient transmission, particularly for ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and the estimated daily transmission parameter (0.05; 0.008, 0.14) is similar to our estimates for the most common STs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Two other prospective carriage studies of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> have used whole genome sequencing to identify possible transmission events: while a one year study in an adult intensive care unit in Australia found five epidemiologically plausible intra-hospital transmission chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gorrie et al., 2017</xref>), a one year carriage study in two geriatric wards (also in Australia) found no evidence of patient-to-patient transmission chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorrie et al., 2018</xref>). Other studies using genomic epidemiology to study resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> transmission have been performed in adult wards in high-income settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snitkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snitkin et al., 2017</xref>). While such studies have also provided support for patient-to-patient transmission playing an important role, such retrospective investigations made in response to reported outbreaks of multidrug-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> might not reflect typical patterns of transmission. A study using proximity sensors to investigate transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae over four months in a long term care facility in France found stronger support for person-to-person transmission as the main route of acquisition for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, though the evidence for person-to-person transmission of ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> was weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duval et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that separate mechanisms may drive the transmission of different ESBL-producing organisms and that this should be considered when analysing carriage data from multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae.</p><p>Under the assumption that patient-to-patient transmission was driving the epidemic, we calculated that the rates of transmission within the ward were insufficient to maintain endemic transmission (i.e. the ward-level reproduction number, R<sub><italic>A</italic></sub>&lt;1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2004</xref>). These findings are comparable to a study which determined the relative force of infection between ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> and other ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in 13 European intensive care units, finding that the latter (mainly <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>) had a transmission rate almost three times greater than the former, and that the single-admission reproduction number for both classes of organisms were well below one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gurieva et al., 2018</xref>). Our central estimate of R<sub>A</sub> is, however, substantially higher (0.65 compared with 0.17); this difference in estimated transmission potential may reflect differences in staff-to-patient ratios, different standards of hygiene and infection control, different patterns of antibiotic use, and differences in the patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dondorp et al., 2018</xref>). The findings from both studies indicate that repeated importation into the unit is needed to maintain endemicity of resistant <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. Imported cases may be acquired from other wards within the same hospital, other hospitals within the referral network, or community transmission. When rates of importation are high, as observed in this setting where up to 43% of infants may have been colonised on initial ward admission (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), even effective interventions are limited in how many acquisition events they can prevent due to a high underlying colonisation pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The public health implications are therefore that control measures should be coordinated regionally and targeted to the wider hospital patient referral network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciccolini et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Amongst the most important findings was the consistent association between a patient’s antibiotic exposure and an increased risk of acquiring 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> or detection of the organism due to within-host selection. To our knowledge, the role of antibiotics as drivers of carriage dynamics has not previously been explored with appropriate methods to account for time-dependent antibiotic exposures in Gram-negative bacteria, but there are reasons for believing it is likely to be a key mechanism through which antibiotics select for ESBL <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tedijanto et al., 2018</xref>). With the exception of imipenem, for which there was no association with the risk of acquisition for these predominantly carbapenem-susceptible bacteria (1418/1423 <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> isolates sensitive to imipemen; 99.6%), effect sizes were similar for different antibiotic combinations (median posterior OR ~2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The narrower credible interval for the ampicillin + gentamicin combination (OR 1.96, 95% CrI 1.18, 3.36) reflects the much higher usage of this antibiotic combination compared to others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These effects are consistent with hypotheses about antibiotic therapy leading to reduced microbiome diversity and subsequently increasing the risk of colonisation with drug-resistant bacteria, which face less competition from fitter, sensitive strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipsitch et al., 2000</xref>). Microbiome analysis has shown that the greatest dysbiosis following antibiotic therapy in healthy adults is four days after treatment starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palleja et al., 2018</xref>), lending confidence to our model comparison selecting a 96 hour exposure period over a 48 hour period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). While we cannot differentiate the effects of antibiotics on i) increasing the susceptibility of an infant to acquisition from another infant, versus ii) endogenous selection for resistant bacteria within that infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lipsitch and Samore, 2002</xref>) in the risk factor models, the small estimate for α relative to β in transmission model two suggests that background selection plays a relatively small role in acqusition compared with person-to-person transmission (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Breast milk feeding was associated with a reduced risk of colonisation with 3GC-R <italic>K.pneumoniae s.l.</italic> though uncertainty was large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This accords with our understanding of the development of a healthy gut microbiome in the early stages of life, which can be adversely affected by the replacement of breast milk by formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2015</xref>), and the protective effect of a diverse microbiome that competes against potentially pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langdon et al., 2016</xref>). In this population, breastfeeding rates were high (90%) though our simulations showed that dropping the proportion to 50% or 25%, as seen in other developing world populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lauer et al., 2004</xref>), could increase the proportion becoming colonised during admission by around 5% and 8% respectively.</p><p>The finding that the oral probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> was not strongly protective against acquisition was disappointing in light of earlier results that suggested a possible effect in slowing rates of acquisition of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). This negative result was shown by the odds ratio, which was located close to zero in the risk factor models for acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and supported by the forward simulations which showed only a 4% median decrease in infant colonisation rates when 100% of infants were prescribed probiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Evidence is still limited about the value of probiotics for neonates. One large randomised trial in rural India reported a beneficial effect from a symbiotic preparation (combining a probiotic, <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, with fructooligosaccharide) in preventing sepsis in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panigrahi et al., 2017</xref>). Another randomised trial in pre-term infants in England found no benefit from the probiotic <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> BBG-001 in preventing necrotising enterocolitis, blood culture positive sepsis or death before hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costeloe et al., 2016</xref>). There is also evidence that some probiotics given after antibiotic consumption can impair and delay the recovery of normal gut flora in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An increased number of nurses on the ward was negatively associated with the risk of acquiring 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic>. Our simulation studies using a dynamic agent-based model showed that increasing the nurse:infant ratio from 1:3 to 1:1 could reduce the number of infants becoming colonised in both high and low importation settings by about a quarter. These findings are consistent with results from large observational studies. For example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rogowski et al., 2013</xref>), in a retrospective cohort study in 67 neonatal units in the USA found a strong association between neonatal unit understaffing and an increased nosocomial infection rate (where understaffing was defined as a nurse-patient ratio below US guidelines for the patient acuity level). Two distinct mechanisms might account for such an association. First, an imbalance between workload and staffing levels may lead to reduced attention to basic infection control measures such as hand hygiene, as has been reported in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pittet et al., 2006</xref>). Second, as nurse:patient ratios decrease a lower proportion of patient contacts will be cohorted as each nurse will need to contact more patients in a shift, substantially increasing the potential for cross-transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archibald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hugonnet et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>From our model estimates, we observed considerable variation in the risk of acquisition per patient day, with the median posterior probability varying nearly eight-fold from 0.047 to 0.35, showing that even neonates within a single hospital ward constitute a highly heterogeneous population. This challenges the assumptions of compartmental models for nosocomial transmission that treat patients as broadly homogeneous in their risk of acquiring drug-resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grundmann and Hellriegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Kleef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Domenech de Cellès et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The effect of colonisation pressure was not identifiable when we considered the total number of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> isolates on a given day, but became identifiable when we considered transmission by ST. From our analysis of the <italic>Klebsiella</italic> carriage population, we observed three species (<italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>K. quasipneumoniae</italic> and <italic>K. variicola</italic>) along with a considerable number (62) of STs. This indicates that <italic>Klebsiella</italic> in carriage did not reflect a single population, but rather repeated introductions of diverse isolates which were then either spread around the ward over a number of weeks or were not transmitted and became locally extinct.</p><p>Comparison of different transmission models strongly supported the inclusion of a colonisation pressure term to account for patient-to-patient transmission. There was also support for a hierarchical model where transmissibility varied by ST, though the STs we estimated to have the highest transmissibility have not been highlighted as dominant in other settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wyres and Holt, 2016</xref>) suggesting that the ST composition within a region may reflect adaptation to local pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stoesser et al., 2015b</xref>). The pairwise SNP diversity in two of the major STs (ST45 and ST101) was greater than expected, but the within-host and between-host diversity was similar in both cases, suggesting that transmission within these STs is biologically plausible. Within-host diversity has the potential to hinder the reconstruction of transmission networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Didelot et al., 2016</xref>), and our results here highlight the importance of capturing within-host diversity in sequencing studies. While within-host diversity was particularly high in ST45, all acquisitions of this ST occurred within a 19 day window (over a possible four month period when carriage isolates were sequenced) with overlapping colonised patient stays, strongly suggesting that cases were epidemiologically related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A previous analysis of a subset of the genomic data identified closely related clusters suggestive of transmission, though with a smaller number of pairwise SNPs than we observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smit et al., 2018</xref>). This discrepancy is likely due to differences in methodology as we mapped isolates to ST-specific reference genomes, which results in a greater proportion of the genome being callable compared with mapping very diverse isolates to a single reference. We cannot entirely rule out less parsimonious explanations for the temporal clustering of STs, such as a transient increase of certain STs in the water supply, though the person-to-person transmission route, mediated by healthcare workers, is most strongly supported by our models.</p><p>An important strength of the study is that we considered asymptomatic carriage, rather than clinical isolates, and collected detailed patient-level data from infants who became colonised as well as from infants who remained uncolonised. This allowed us to quantify the factors driving the epidemic, which would not have been possible if we had considered only clinical isolates. Also, by using a prospective design rather than a reactive exploration of an outbreak or unusual cluster of cases our findings should be more representative of typical patterns of transmission. The use of an inferrential approach that accounted for the interval-censored nature of the data and the use of whole genome sequencing were also key factors in developing a quantitative understanding of the transmission dynamics.</p><p>Our study has limitations. We sequenced isolates of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> from a four month period (rather than the full 12 months of the carriage study) due to resource constraints. Such constraints also prevented us from sampling mothers and other family members of infants, and healthcare workers in close contact with infants. Greater density of within-host sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stoesser et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wymant et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lees et al., 2019</xref>), and inclusion of long-read sequencing to investigate plasmid transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conlan et al., 2014</xref>) would have also provided a more complete epidemiological picture. Although our analysis accounts for patient heterogeneity and interval censoring, it assumes that a positive culture taken within 48 hours of admission indicates that the patient was colonised on admission, and that cultures had 100% sensitivity for detecting carriage. Such restrictions could all be relaxed using a data augmentation framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2008</xref>), but validated implementations of such an approach allowing inclusion of an arbitrary number of covariates are not currently available. Antibiotics were not prescribed randomly, but according to the clinical judgement of the clinicians and in response to the pathology of the patient. It is therefore possible that the effects of antibiotics in the model estimates may be confounded by the clinical severity of the infant. We did attempt to mitigate this by including a covariate for clinical severity, which links to the use of invasive devices and we note that, with the exception of imipenem, all antibiotics show similar effects to each other on the risk of first acquisition.</p><p>In summary, this study provides strong evidence for person-to-person within ward transmission of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> mediated by healthcare workers, estimates key epidemiological parameters, quantifies the role of different antibiotics in driving the epidemic, and highlights interventions with the potential to contribute to control efforts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Epidemiological and microbiological data</title><p>We used data collected prospectively from a neonatal intensive care unit in a children’s hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia between September 2013 (when the neonatal unit newly opened) and September 2014.

We assumed that any patient testing positive on their first swab taken within 48 hours of admission was positive on arrival. Patients who had their first swab taken &gt;48 hours from admission but tested negative were included in the analysis, while those that tested positive were omitted.

As we used 2000 posterior samples from each parameter estimated by model fitting, this resulted in a total of 200,000 model runs for each simulated scenario.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff and patients’ families at the Angkor Hospital for Children for their participation in the study.

It analyses a dataset of children regularly swabbed for <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumoniae after admission to an intensive care unit in Cambodia. Such data is inherently complex and difficult to interpret. The authors use mathematical modelling approach to investigate the role of a number of factors such as colonization pressure, antibiotic treatment, and breastfeeding. The results provide insights into the spread of drug resistant bacteria in an important setting for the development and transmission of drug resistant bacteria.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transmission dynamics and control of multidrug-resistant <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumoniae in neonates in a developing country&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Miles P Davenport as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jon Zelner; Edward J Feil.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript uses a modelling approach to investigate acquisition of drug resistant bacteria in a hospital setting. The authors study various risk factors for 'acquisition', and find that antibiotic use was the only significant effect. The strength of this study is that it looks at a very clinically important organism in the exact setting in which it is problematic. The value of the study is tempered by the fact that much of the screening data was already published, along with more coarse-grained analysis of the role of antibiotic on acquisition. The modelling and analysis is therefore a central factor in the study, but also falls short in several ways that need to be addressed. The reviewers expressed that there are several possibilities to improve the analysis that need to be explored.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) the Bayesian approach to model fitting of the risk factor and the transmission models, uses arbitrary priors, that do not truly reflect prior probability. Despite the authors claim that they were selected to be weakly informative, most prior distributions cover a range that make it possible that they are significantly influencing the posterior. A straightforward way of conveying this to the reader is to plot the prior and the posteriors together. This is a key shortcoming because if the model estimates are driven by these arbitrary choices, much of the remaining paper comes into question. This is certainly a criticism that can be addressed by changing the fitting approach to remove the influence of the priors, or by switching to another approach, maximum likelihood or proportional hazard models.</p><p>2) the results of the model are not presented carefully, many of the risk factors have credibility intervals that would not generally be considered significant, yet are presented as if they are (e.g.: &quot;covariates associated with reduced daily risk of acquisition,&quot; but nothing in this paragraph is significant; &quot;suggests that contamination left by previously colonized infants decays rapidly to background levels&quot;, when there is no support for the model with this parameter and the λ estimate is heavily influenced by the prior with mean 1 and variance 2). This is also true for the results presented in Figure 4B, C, D and the lengthy discussion in Discussion section, which fails to accurately convey the possibility that these factors play no role in colonization is also consistent with the data. The large uncertainty in most parameter estimates likely reflects the challenge of fitting 109 observations with a 14-parameter model. This needs to be stated and the limitations emphasized.</p><p>3) the analysis of the transmission models appears to have a bias toward finding model 4 to be the best because there is a single value of α for all the sequence types, but there are different average colonization probabilities across the sequence types (because some had many more observed colonization events than others). This variability it likely to be picked up, at least to some extent, in the ST specific betas. A fairer test is whether ST specific β fits better than a ST specific alphas. The temporal clustering of ST in Figure 3F suggest this may be true, but the approach seem to have been biased to find an effect of β. Are there explanations for the temporal clustering of the ST other than transmission in the NU, such a transient increased in the community or in the water supply etc.</p><p>4) A concern with this analysis relate to the way the different infection models are described. Specifically, the differentiation between a 'risk factor model' and a 'transmission model'. It is not clear from the main text that the transmission models considered are essentially hierarchical regression models in which the impact of an increasing number of colonized patients is considered to have an additive rather than a multiplicative effect on individual risk. This is not a critique of the modeling, which is generally appropriate and well-done. But it is difficult to read the manuscript and understand the distinction between these two sets of analyses. In addition, the authors should clarify earlier that the non-significant, negative OR for colonization pressure may be due to this fact as a way of framing the need for an additive model that more able to directly account for the impact of transmission on daily infection risk.</p><p>5) It is not clear to me why the transmission models could not incorporate some of the covariates used in the first set of risk factor models. For example, age at admission or the number of nurses on the unit could be used to modulate infection risk, i.e. be used to calculate an individual risk ratio that is then multiplied by the hazard of infection, e.g. exp(\ζ X<sub>i</sub>)*(\α +\β n<sub>i</sub>), where X<sub>i</sub> is a set of individual or day-specific risk factors, and \ζ is a vector of log-risk ratios. This would seem to make the most of the data and incorporate both the additive effect of colonization pressure with the risk-modulation of individual level factors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50468.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript uses a modelling approach to investigate acquisition of drug resistant bacteria in a hospital setting.

We have taken these points into consideration and conducted a number of additional analyses to confirm the robustness of our results to different modelling decisions (e.g. prior distributions). For other criticisms we consider it more appropriate to include these as study limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>While the individual points are dealt with below, we would like to respectfully challenge the reviewers’ reference to statistical significance, e.g. in the Summary and Essential revisions 2 and 4. The limitations and misuse of significance testing has been widely discussed by the statistical community, please see “American Statistical Association [ASA] statement on Statistical Significance and p-values”<sup>1</sup>, and discussions by Gelman<sup>2,3</sup>, McElreath<sup>4,5</sup> and Spiegelhalter<sup>6</sup>. In line with current statistical thinking which recommends that statistical “bright lines” (such as p&lt;0.05) are avoided, we make no reference to “significant” or “non-significant” results in our article. Rather we consider the full posterior distribution to be informative about parameter estimates, in addition to interpreting our results in the context of the existing literature. In this analysis we are not setting up null models to be refuted, but rather estimating bio-medically relevant parameters based on our data and the model structure. We do not consider any of our models to be correct, but instead provide a number of possible models and use an information criterion (and our background biological knowledge) as a guide for the most appropriate model. This is in line with best practices in ecological modelling that have been established for some time<sup>7,8</sup>. We hope therefore that the reviewers will consider our analyses and the response to their comments in this light.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) the Bayesian approach to model fitting of the risk factor and the transmission models, uses arbitrary priors, that do not truly reflect prior probability. Despite the authors claim that they were selected to be weakly informative, most prior distributions cover a range that make it possible that they are significantly influencing the posterior. A straightforward way of conveying this to the reader is to plot the prior and the posteriors together. This is a key shortcoming because if the model estimates are driven by these arbitrary choices, much of the remaining paper comes into question. This is certainly a criticism that can be addressed by changing the fitting approach to remove the influence of the priors, or by switching to another approach, maximum likelihood or proportional hazard models.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that plotting the prior and posterior distributions together is a useful method to visualise the effect of the prior distribution on the result, and we have done this as suggested (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Our priors were chosen on the basis of best practice guidelines provided by leading statisticians, including the creators of the STAN fitting software<sup>9</sup>. The most important validation of our model is the posterior predictive distribution (Figure 2D), which shows that the Risk Factor Model closely predicts the observed number of colonisation events.</p><p>While the choice of prior distributions remains an area of active debate, it is important to note that the prior will always influence the posterior. Prior distributions are an important tool for i) incorporating prior beliefs or information into the model, ii) preventing the model from exploring regions of parameter space that are biologically implausible, and iii) avoiding overfitting. Indeed, the use of weakly informative priors is directly analogous to the use of standard regularisation methods in frequentist analysis. Methods from frequentist analysis mentioned by the reviewers (maximum likelihood, proportional hazards models) are not somehow “more objective” and contain their own, although often less explicitly stated, assumptions. Using diffuse or uniform (“flat”) priors with a large range in Bayesian inference will typically give similar results to maximum likelihood. However, the use of “flat” or uniform priors is not generally recommended<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>We do, however, fully agree that there is value in exploring sensitivity of results to the choice of prior distributions. Following this criticism of the reviewers, we have therefore explored different prior distributions for Risk Factor Model A to test the sensitivity of the result to the prior. Varying the priors for Risk Factor Model A to normal distributions with much lower variance, as suggested, results in only small changes to the posterior distributions (in Figure 2—figure supplement 2); WAIC is also unaffected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) the results of the model are not presented carefully, many of the risk factors have credibility intervals that would not generally be considered significant, yet are presented as if they are (e.g.: &quot;covariates associated with reduced daily risk of acquisition,&quot; but nothing in this paragraph is significant; &quot;suggests that contamination left by previously colonized infants decays rapidly to background levels&quot;, when there is no support for the model with this parameter and the λ estimate is heavily influenced by the prior with mean 1 and variance 2).

This needs to be stated and the limitations emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>In line with current statistical thinking we think it is inappropriate to dichotomise results into significant/ non-significant (see comment above and statement from American Statistical Association<sup>1</sup>), and so consider our presentation and discussion of the posterior odds ratio distributions appropriate. We disagree that there is “no support” for transmission model 3; there is less support according to WAIC, but due to the interest in colonisation with resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> resulting from contact with contaminated surfaces in hospitals<sup>11</sup>, we consider it is appropriate to discuss the estimates from this model. The results from our analysis should not be interpreted from a frequentist perspective; posterior distributions inherently account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. For instance if 6% of the posterior odds distribution for a covariate is &lt;1, then there is a 94% probability that the covariate increases the risk of acquisition / detection. We have made this clearer in the text; in the Materials and methods subsection “Statistical Model Fitting” we add “Uncertainty in parameter estimates is represented by the posterior distributions, and the estimated probability that a particular parameter is within a certain range is given by the area under the curve of that parameter’s marginal posterior distribution within that range.”</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns that the estimate of λ in transmission model 3 is heavily influenced by the prior distribution, we have re-fit the model using a less informative prior (Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The model estimate of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> half-life on surfaces changes from 3.6 hours with our initial prior distribution (normal(1,2)) to 2.5 hours with a less informative prior (normal(0,5)). Our interpretation of the results from these models is qualitatively the same (“<italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> surface contamination decays quickly to background levels”), and altering the prior distribution had no effect on WAIC. The only published value from experimental studies for resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> half-life on surfaces gave a value of ~12 hours<sup>12</sup>, which is equivalent to a parameter estimate of 1.39 in our model. Our initial prior distribution (normal(1,2)) therefore gives more weight to biologically plausible areas of parameter space, and we continue to use the result from this model in the main text. We have expanded the text to better explain our prior choice for this model– see Materials and methods subsection “Transmission Models Incorporating Sequence Type Data”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) the analysis of the transmission models appears to have a bias toward finding model 4 to be the best because there is a single value of α for all the sequence types, but there are different average colonization probabilities across the sequence types (because some had many more observed colonization events than others).

The temporal clustering of ST in Figure 3F suggest this may be true, but the approach seem to have been biased to find an effect of β. Are there explanations for the temporal clustering of the ST other than transmission in the NU, such a transient increased in the community or in the water supply etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to explore variance in the α parameter and if this results in a better fit to data by WAIC than variance in β. We have therefore added a model which allows α to vary by sequence type (transmission model 5, described in Materials and methods). The WAIC from this model is much higher than from transmission models 2-4 (1793, compared with 1739, 1740 and 1733), indicating a poor fit to data (shown in Table 3).</p><p>We agree that other explanations for the temporal clustering of STs are possible, though less parsimonious. Overall the estimate of α (background contamination in the absence of colonised infants in the ward) is very low in all models, suggesting that effects other than person-to-person transmission are minimal in spreading resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> around the ward. Transmission from the community may be driving imported cases into the ward, and the variability of the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> population that we observe in the sequence data (Figure 3A) may reflect a large, diverse population of community <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> that has not yet been investigated. We have added a sentence to the Discussion that “We cannot entirely rule out less parsimonious explanations for the temporal clustering of STs, such as a transient increase of certain STs in the water supply, though the person-to-person transmission route is most strongly supported by our models.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A concern with this analysis relate to the way the different infection models are described. Specifically, the differentiation between a 'risk factor model' and a 'transmission model'. It is not clear from the main text that the transmission models considered are essentially hierarchical regression models in which the impact of an increasing number of colonized patients is considered to have an additive rather than a multiplicative effect on individual risk.

In addition, the authors should clarify earlier that the non-significant, negative OR for colonization pressure may be due to this fact as a way of framing the need for an additive model that more able to directly account for the impact of transmission on daily infection risk.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a need to clarify the analysis earlier in the manuscript and frame the reasoning for our additive transmission models. We have amended the text at the end of the Introduction to better introduce the different types of statistical models that follow in the analysis; “We fit four models with logit link functions to estimate the impact of covariates on the daily risk of acquisition or detection of 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic>. As these models are unable to identify the force of infection, and genomic data show the ward 3GC-R <italic>K. pneumoniae s.l.</italic> to be a highly heterogeneous bacterial community, we then fit five linear transmission models to estimate the force of infection for acquisition or detection of each ST.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear to me why the transmission models could not incorporate some of the covariates used in the first set of risk factor models. For example, age at admission or the number of nurses on the unit could be used to modulate infection risk, i.e. be used to calculate an individual risk ratio that is then multiplied by the hazard of infection, e.g. exp(ζ X<sub>i</sub>)*(α +β n<sub>i</sub>), where X<sub>i</sub> is a set of individual or day-specific risk factors, and ζ is a vector of log-risk ratios. This would seem to make the most of the data and incorporate both the additive effect of colonization pressure with the risk-modulation of individual level factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include additional covariates when fitting the transmission models, as the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> sequence data was only taken within a four month window of the year-long study. In this period there were 171 first acquisition/detection events for different STs, however given the number of ST at-risk patient days was &gt;48,000, the events were much sparser than the 109 acquisition events over 864 patient days in the risk factor model and are likely to have wider uncertainty intervals. As the underlying data are different in the risk factor and transmission models and as the models use different link-functions, the estimates of covariates will not be exactly the same and we considered that presenting two sets of odds ratios for the risk factors might confuse the reader.</p><p>We performed analysis similar to that described by the reviewer above to obtain the parameters for the individual-based model; we varied the force of infection inferred from the transmission models with the effect of covariates inferred from the risk factor models, by converting all parameters onto the log-odds scale to create a combined linear function and then using the inverse-logit function to obtain a probability of acquisition. This is described in the Materials and methods as “For simulations that explored the impact of interventions, the effect of each of the covariates of interest (probiotic consumption, breast milk feeding and number of nurses on the ward) were obtained from risk factor model A (Table 2 and Figure 2A). The marginal effects of each risk factor were transformed into a log-odds ratio and used to modify the daily risk of acquisition sampled from a β distribution with shape hyper-parameters α<sub>s</sub> and β<sub>s</sub>.”</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1) Ronald L.
