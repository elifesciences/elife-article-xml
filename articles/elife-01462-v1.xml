which elevates striatal dopamine (DA) release. While the post-ingestive rewarding effect, which artificial sweeteners do not have, signals the nutrient value of sugar and influences food preference, the neural circuitry that mediates the rewarding effect of glucose is unknown. In this study, we show that optogenetic activation of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons during intake of the artificial sweetener sucralose increases striatal dopamine levels and inverts the normal preference for sucrose vs sucralose. Conversely, animals with ablation of MCH neurons no longer prefer sucrose to sucralose and show reduced striatal DA release upon sucrose ingestion. We further show that MCH neurons project to reward areas and are required for the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose in sweet-blind <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. These studies identify an essential component of the neural pathways linking nutrient sensing and food reward.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01462.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01462.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01462.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sales of full-sugar fizzy drinks are almost triple those of diet versions, providing real-world confirmation of the laboratory finding that humans, as well as animals, prefer sugar to artificial sweeteners. However, it is not simply that sugary things taste better. Mice with a mutation that prevents them from perceiving sweet tastes still prefer the natural sugar sucrose over the artificial sweetener sucralose.</p><p>This is because sugar, unlike artificial sweeteners, has nutritional value, and both humans and animals find it rewarding to consume foods with a high caloric content. Consuming sugar has been known to cause certain parts of the brain to release more of the chemical transmitter dopamine, which is used to signal reward, but exactly how this process produces a preference for sugar has been unclear.</p><p>Now, Domingos et al. have revealed that a brain region called the lateral hypothalamus is responsible for this effect. This region of the brain—which helps to control appetite and which is also connected to the brain’s reward system—normally contains cells called MCH neurons. Domingos et al. show that the natural preference for sucrose over sucralose can be reversed by stimulating the MCH neurons with light, which in turn stimulates dopamine release in reward centers in the brain. Moreover, mutant mice that do not have any MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus show a reduced preference for sucrose over sucralose, compared to normal mice, and they release less dopamine than normal mice when they consume sucrose.</p><p>By demonstrating that MCH neurons are both necessary and sufficient for sensing the nutritional value of sugar, these results provide new insights into the biological basis of sugar cravings. However, given the health implications of excessive sugar consumption, they may ultimately be used to find ways to make sugar less desirable, or to make artificial sweeteners more closely mimic the real thing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01462.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01462.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>nutrient</kwd><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>neuronal circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Klarman Family Foundation for Eating Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domingos</surname><given-names>Ana I</given-names></name><name><surname>Sordillo</surname><given-names>Aylesse</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaynshteyn</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Rockefeller Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domingos</surname><given-names>Ana I</given-names></name><name><surname>Ekstrand</surname><given-names>Mats I</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Foundation- Portugal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domingos</surname><given-names>Ana I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CNPq–Brazil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Marcelo O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC009997, DK085579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Araujo</surname><given-names>Ivan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 DK006850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Natural sugars are preferred over artificial sweeteners because of their nutritional content, which is sensed by MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals and humans generally prefer sugars containing glucose, such as sucrose, compared to non-nutritive sweeteners such as sucralose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Smiciklas-Wright et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jacobson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sicher, 2011</xref>) as a result of the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>). This post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose was first described by showing that non-nutritive liquids that are paired to glucose administration either in the intra-gastric tract or in plasma, are greatly preferred over liquids that are not paired with nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Araujo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oliveira-Maia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sclafani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernstrom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Araujo et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, sweet-blind <italic>Trpm5</italic> knockout mice can still sense the nutrient value of sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>). These studies have indicated that the nutrient value of sucrose is sensed and in turn establishes a preference for nutritive sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Araujo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sclafani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernstrom et al., 2012</xref>). These data further indicate that the post-ingestive rewarding effect plays an important role in driving nutrient choice (in addition to sweet taste). However, despite the substantial evidence that they play a major, perhaps dominant, role in driving food intake and sweetener preference, the neural pathways that sense glucose and mediate the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose have not been identified.</p><p>Rodent studies have further shown that sucrose but not artificial sweeteners such as sucralose can drive dopamine (DA) release in the midbrain even in the absence of taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Araujo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oliveira-Maia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sclafani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernstrom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Araujo et al., 2013</xref>). The combination of sweet taste plus an increase of dopamine accounts for the preference for natural vs artificial sweeteners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>). We previously reported that the artificial sweetener sucralose is preferred to sucrose only if supplemented by a proxy for this post-ingestive reward in the form of optogenetic activation of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>). However, the elements of the neural circuit that convey the post-ingestive rewarding effect of sucrose and activate DA neurons are unknown.</p><p>Melanin-concentrating hormone-expressing neurons (<italic>Pmch</italic> or, MCH neurons; in accordance with previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shimada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Friedman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2010</xref>], we adopt the later nomenclature throughout this report) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are glucose sensitive, and show increased activity when extracellular glucose levels increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Pmch</italic> knockout and MCH neuronal ablation lead to reduced body weight, indicating a critical role of these neurons in the regulation of energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shimada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whiddon and Palmiter, 2013</xref>). In addition, MCH neurons send dense projections to reward centers in the striatum and midbrain where dopaminergic neurons are located (current report). This strong anatomical connection between MCH neurons and reward nuclei, as well as the fact that MCH neurons sense glucose levels, led us to hypothesize that these hypothalamic neurons could play a role in conveying the reward value of sucrose.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first tested whether optogenetic activation of MCH neurons could alter an animal’s preference for sucrose vs sucralose using a BAC transgenic <italic>Pmch</italic>-CRE mouse line that we generated (see ‘Materials and methods’). <italic>Pmch</italic>-CRE mice were crossed to the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) reporter mouse line B6;129S-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze</italic>/J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>), herein abbreviated Rosa26-LSL-ChR2-YFP, to generate <italic>Pmch</italic>-ChR2 mice. We characterized <italic>Pmch</italic>-CRE mice and thus confirmed tissue- and cell-specific expression of ChR2-YFP in MCH neurons as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The YFP signal was seen in the LH with the characteristic appearance of MCH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and there was a 92 ± 8% overlap of YFP and MCH. In addition, 97 ± 3% of MCH neurons expressed ChR2-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slice preparations confirmed light-evoked spiking at 5, 10, and 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as during continuous light pulses of one second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The spike rate of MCH neurons was higher with light pulses of 20 Hz vs 5 Hz. Note, glucose has been shown to evoke similar high-frequency bursting of MCH neurons (see inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>).

ChR2(+) and ChR2(–) mice had equal preference for water+laser vs water alone at all stimulation frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We next compared an animal’s preference for sucrose vs sucralose plus optogenetic activation of MCH neurons (see ‘Materials and methods’ for the rationale of concentrations chosen). In the absence of ChR2 (gray bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or at a low stimulation frequency of 5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), animals still preferred sucrose to sucralose. However, consistent with the greater effect of 20 Hz on spiking of MCH neurons in slice preparation, a light frequency of 20 Hz, as well as continuous light, inverted an animal’s preference with a strong preference for sucralose plus MCH activation relative to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

After signal stabilization, samples were collected during a 30-min period when the animals had access to sucralose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). As previously reported, animals drinking sucralose (without light stimulation) displayed negligible changes in striatal DA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Animals drinking sucralose when the laser was set to OFF displayed an overall 8.2 ± 2.6% change from baseline DA (average across all S1–S5 samples); this change was not significantly different from baseline (gray bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> p&gt;0.05, one sample T-test against 100% baseline).

When laser was set to ON during ingestion of sucralose, DA levels increased 68.7 ± 9% vs baseline DA (average across all S1–S5 samples, blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

MCH neurons serve as an essential link between glucose sensing and sugar reward, and these data thus identify a key component of the neural circuit that establishes the preference for natural vs artificial sweeteners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Smiciklas-Wright et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jacobson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sicher, 2011</xref>).</p><p>MCH neurons have previously been shown to be excited by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that direct glucose sensing by these neurons regulates reward. However, it is also possible that glucose is sensed elsewhere, such as by putative gastric/intestinal sensors or other nutrient sensors, which inform the brain and MCH neurons about the nutrient content of ingested food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sclafani et al., 2011</xref>). Glucose sensing in MCH neurons or elsewhere would explain why, even in the absence of taste (such as in <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice), sucrose is able to drive significant increase of striatal DA. This increase, in turn, conveys reward and conditions behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>). We note, however, that optogenetic stimulation of MCH neurons alone is not sufficient to alter behavior in the absence of taste. The data thus suggest that MCH neurons are components of a reward-encoding network that integrates information from multiple sources, including the nutrients themselves, lingual taste buds and, possibly, other sites of glucose sensing like the gut. Consistent with this possibility, viral tracing from lingual taste buds shows that MCH neurons are part of a circuit processing gustatory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pérez et al., 2011</xref>). This finding is also consistent with the optogenetic data reported here, showing a requirement for both sweet taste and activation of MCH neurons to drive reward. The role of MCH neurons uncovered here contrasts with that of DA neurons, which upon optogenetic stimulation have been shown to be rewarding when paired to water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A synergy between taste and the post-ingestive rewarding effect would explain why sucrose and other fructose/glucose disaccharides, which are more potent stimulators of sweet-taste receptors than glucose alone, are generally preferred to glucose alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sclafani and Mann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>). This synergy would also explain why our optogenetic gain of function experiments lead to an inversion of preference, rather than an isopreference, which could perhaps have been achieved by decreasing the concentration of sucralose. Likewise, the loss of function of MCH neurons leads to isopreference, but this could perhaps be biased toward sucralose by increasing its concentration. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relevant sites of glucose sensing, identify additional elements of the neural circuit integrating gustatory perception with nutrient sensing and reward, as well as elucidating the neural mechanisms by which MCH neurons regulate striatal DA release. Several methods including viral tracing can be used to identify monosynaptic or polysynaptic inputs onto MCH and DA neurons.</p><p>As mentioned, the activity of MCH neurons is increased by glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>). Glucose-activated MCH neurons and pancreatic β cells share signal transduction components necessary for glucose sensing, and both Kir6.2 and UCP2 regulate glucose excitability of MCH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a loss of function of Kir6.1 in MCH neurons leads to alterations in results of a glucose tolerance test with increased plasma glucose at later times, establishing a role for these neurons in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). Further studies are required to establish whether these or other components of glucose sensing pathways are also required for the ability of MCH neurons to influence sucrose preference. It is possible, however, that additional neural populations are components of this nutrient sensing circuit. For example, orexin/hypocretin-containing neurons can also sense glucose and it is thus possible that these or other neural populations in the mesolimbic system, or higher order centers can also influence the reward value of sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karnani and Burdakov, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports have also explored the relationship between MCH neurons and reward: both MCH knockout and MCH ablated mice show augmented locomotor responses to psychostimulant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pissios et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whiddon and Palmiter, 2013</xref>). These augmented locomotor phenotypes contrast with the behavioral effect we see with a loss of sucrose preference in MCH ablated mice. It is possible that the locomotor phenotypes in response to stimulants result from actions in the ventral striatum, where the MCH receptor (MCHR-1) is expressed, and that sucrose preference relies on other brain areas. Further experiments will be required to ascertain which brain areas and MCH projections are relevant for sucrose preference. Loss of function of MCHR-1 recreates the locomotor phenotypes seen in <italic>Pmch</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice: <italic>Mchr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are super-sensitive to the locomotor activating effects of d-amphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). These studies do not establish whether it is MCH or another neurotransmitter expressed in these neurons that is responsible for the observed phenotypes, and further experiments will also be required to ascertain whether the MCH neuropeptide itself is relevant for sucrose preference.</p><p>We assayed dopamine release using microdialysis to show that MCH neural activation increases dopamine release in the striatum and that the increase of dopamine in response to sucrose is lost after ablation of MCH neurons. Consistent with this, the levels of cFos in dopaminergic neurons of the VTA are reduced in MCH-ablated, sweet-blind <italic>Trpm5</italic> KO mice given sucrose. These assays of taste-blind mice confirm that MCH neurons regulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons, though the data do not establish whether this effect of dopaminergic neural activity and dopamine release is direct and/or indirect. Further studies will be necessary to establish how MCH neurons regulate dopaminergic signaling. The delineation of this neural circuit may also provide a basis for understanding how leptin modulates reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>). The effects of leptin on reward are unlikely to be a result of a direct effect on MCH neurons as they do not appear to express the leptin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leinninger et al., 2011</xref>). However, a distinct neural population in the LH expressing neurotensin respond to leptin, and further studies may reveal whether or not leptin reduces MCH activity indirectly by activating these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leinninger et al., 2011</xref>). Ablation of MCH neurons attenuates the obese phenotype of leptin deficient ob/ob mice indicating that MCH neurons are downstream of leptin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Friedman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Ablation of MCH neurons causes hypophagia and leanness, and it is possible that the reduced food intake is a result of a loss of the reward value of nutrient in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Friedman, 2006</xref>). The reward value of sugar is also regulated by leptin, which has been recently reported to have a presynaptic action to suppress excitatory synaptic input onto VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thompson and Borgland, 2013</xref>). Further studies will reveal whether leptin modulates excitatory output to the VTA via MCH neurons or influences nutrient preference by a direct effect on DA neurons in the VTA. The importance of brain nutrient sensing for behavior has also been studied in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dus et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2013</xref>). Future studies will likely elucidate the extent to which the cellular mechanisms and neural pathways that regulate nutrient preference are shared between invertebrates and mammals. Brain nutrient sensing may represent an evolutionary adaptation to avoid starvation, by expediting decisions about which foods to consume.</p><p>In summary, these results confirm that MCH neurons are both necessary and sufficient for sensing the nutrient value of sucrose and suggest that these neurons play a critical role in establishing nutrient preference.

The following day mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of an aqueous solution of 10% glucose (10 ml/Kg body weight) and blood glucose was measured from the tail vein at 0 and 10 min using an Ascensia Elite XL glucometer (Bayer Health-Care, Tarrytown, NY).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Conditioning to post-ingestive rewarding effects of sucrose, in the absence of taste</title><p>Once acclimated to the behavioral chamber, sweet blind <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup><bold>−/−</bold></sup> mice were resented with one bottle containing sucrose or sucralose. The drinking behavior is quantified by monitoring licks with contact lickometers (MedAssociates) and the number of licks for each bottle was used to calculate the preference ratio for sucrose, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos et al. (2011)</xref>. To verify whether <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup><bold>−/−</bold></sup> mice with dysfunctional MCH neurons could detect the post-ingestive effects of sucrose, we adapted a conditioning protocol as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Araujo et al. (2008)</xref>, that allows the animal to manifest taste-independent preferences (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). All experiments were conducted with naive animals under a 16–23 hr water deprivation schedule. Animals were conditioned for 4 days with daily 30 min sessions of free access to either 1.5 mM sucralose or 0.4 M sucrose in one-bottle forced-choice training sessions. Either solution was presented on the opposite sides of the chamber on intercalated days. After training, on the 5th day, side bias was tested in 10-min two-bottle water versus water tests. This procedure was executed in <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup><bold>−/−</bold></sup> mice with ablated MCH neurons and control <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup><bold>−/−</bold></sup> mice with normal MCH neurons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Charles Zuker for providing the <italic>Trpm5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse line.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Seth Blackshaw, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an elegant and important piece of work, and the manuscript is well constructed and written. It convincingly establishes that the activation of MCH neurons is both necessary and sufficient for the post-ingestive hedonic effects of sucrose. Specifically, the authors start with the paradigm that glucose-containing sugars, such as sucrose, are generally preferred to artificial sweeteners and that the molecular underpinnings of that phenomenon are largely represented by post-ingestive striatal dopamine release. The authors uncover what appears to be the backbone of the neurocircuitry that is responsible for that mechanism. Using optogenetic activation as well as genetically targeted ablation in mice, Domingos and colleagues prove convincingly that neurons identified by production of the neuropeptide MCH are responsible for the differential reward value of sucrose versus sucralose. In addition, they show that MCH neurons indeed project to brain areas involved in reward control and that MCH neurons are required for detection of reward value in mice where sweet perception has been deleted by gene disruption of the TRPM5 receptor. The data are convincing and of high quality.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The main target of MCH neuron action in regulating sucrose vs sucralose preference are unclear, as all photostimulation in the study was directly applied to MCH neuronal cell bodies in the LH. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate that MCH efferents are found in proximity to TH-expressing cells in the striatum and midbrain, but only in the VTA are MCH axons and TH-positive cell bodies really intermingled. Since it is also known that MCH neurons project directly to orexinergic neurons, which in turn regulate activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, this raises the possibility that indirect effects of MCH activity may control sugar preference. Have the authors tried applying photostimulation directly to the VTA, and does it produce behavioral effects similar to those seen in LH? Alternatively, have they shown that MCH neuron activation directly stimulates TH-positive neurons in the VTA or other regions in the central reward circuit?</p><p>2) In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingos, et al., 2011</xref>), the authors convincingly showed that leptin negatively regulates sucrose vs sucralose preference, while fasting (presumably coupled with reduction in leptin signaling) enhanced this preference. A key unresolved question here is whether these effects of fasting and leptin on sucrose vs sucralose preference require the action of MCH neurons. It would be highly desirable if the investigators addressed this question using the MCH-Cre;R26-lsl-DTR animals described here.</p><p>3) The study does not address whether sucrose vs sucralose preference requires MCH itself. The authors allude to this possibility, noting that <italic>Pmch</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice show lower body weight, but this should be easy to test directly, using either genetic or pharmacological approaches. This also addresses the question of whether it is activity of MCH neurons, rather than simply the presence of these cells, that is necessary for sucrose vs sucralose preference. Also, does fructose contribute anything to the “metabolic signal” or is its action simply to increase palatability above that of glucose?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01462.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This is an elegant and important piece of work and the manuscript is well constructed and written.

Dr. Blackshaw suggests a series of rational and interesting experiments, but in several instances we believe that they may be outside the scope of this paper. Indeed, as outlined below, the studies that Dr Blackshaw suggests are all part of ongoing efforts to further dissect the neural circuit regulating sucrose and reward.</p><p><italic>1) The main target of MCH neuron action in regulating sucrose vs sucralose preference are unclear, as all photostimulation in the study was directly applied to MCH neuronal cell bodies in the LH.

Alternatively, have they shown that MCH neuron activation directly stimulates TH-positive neurons in the VTA or other regions in the central reward circuit</italic>?</p><p>We show in the paper that MCH activation can increase dopamine release in striatum using microdialysis, thus confirming that these neurons directly or indirectly activate of VTA neurons. In response to Dr Blackshaw’s comment, we have also generated new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref> showing that ablation of MCH neurons results in a decreased level of cFos expression in VTA dopamine neurons in response to sucrose ingestion by taste blind TRPM5 knockout mice. These data add further evidence to our conclusion that MCH neurons regulate the activity of DA neurons in the VTA but do not address whether the ability of MCH neurons to activate these neurons is direct or indirect (Dr Blackshaw correctly points out that this could possibly be mediated via orexin neurons or another neural population). This important point is emphasized in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) In previous work (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><italic>Domingos,</italic> e<italic>t al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>), the authors convincingly showed that leptin negatively regulates sucrose vs sucralose preference, while fasting (presumably coupled with reduction in leptin signaling) enhanced this preference. A key unresolved question here is whether these effects of fasting and leptin on sucrose vs sucralose preference require the action of MCH neurons. It would be highly desirable if the investigators addressed this question using the MCH-Cre;R26-lsl-DTR animals described here</italic>.</p><p>The issue of whether leptin alters reward via effects on MCH neurons, or a different neural population(s), is a very important question. We had initially viewed further studies of the precise neural mechanism by which leptin reduces the reward value of sucrose as the subject of a future and comprehensive paper on this topic as the mechanism may or may not involve effects on MCH neurons. In addition, we will have to adopt an alternative strategy to address this question since both MCH neuronal ablation and leptin treatment diminish the reward value of sucrose. Rather, we are planning to assess whether leptin treatment alters the preference of animals for sucralose plus MCH activation vs sucrose. In the revised Discussion, we emphasize the importance of defining the mechanism by which leptin modulates this circuit and because MCH neurons do not express leptin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leinninger, et al., 2011</xref>), we also discuss the possible role of other neural populations in LH.</p><p><italic>3) The study does not address whether sucrose vs sucralose preference requires MCH itself.

Also, does fructose contribute anything to the “metabolic signal” or is its action simply to increase palatability above that of glucose</italic>?</p><p>We agree that studies of MCH knockout mice will be important as are analyses of mutations of other neurotransmitters expressed in MCH neurons. This point, as highlighted in the revised Discussion, is also the subject of ongoing studies. We used sucrose in our studies because previous papers on this topic used this nutrient and we did not think that repeating these studies using either fructose or glucose alone would influence our conclusions with respect to our demonstration that MCH neurons are critical for sensing the nutrient value of sucrose. Thus it was our view that studies of either monosaccharide alone were outside the scope of this paper as including these data would essentially require that we repeat all of the studies reported in our paper with both of these sugars.</p></body></sub-article></article>
