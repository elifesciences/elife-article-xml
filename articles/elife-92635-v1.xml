Classical P4 signaling operates through nuclear receptors that regulate transcription. In addition, P4 signals through membrane P4 receptors (mPRs) in a rapid nongenomic modality. Despite the established physiological importance of P4 nongenomic signaling, the details of its signal transduction cascade remain elusive. Here, using <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation as a well-established physiological readout of nongenomic P4 signaling, we identify the lipid hydrolase ABHD2 (Î±/Î² hydrolase domain-containing protein 2) as an essential mPRÎ² co-receptor to trigger meiosis. We show using functional assays coupled to unbiased and targeted cell-based lipidomics that ABHD2 possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity that requires mPRÎ². This PLA2 activity bifurcates P4 signaling by inducing clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRÎ², resulting in the production of lipid messengers that are G-protein coupled receptor agonists. Therefore, P4 drives meiosis by inducing an ABHD2 PLA2 activity that requires both mPRÎ² and ABHD2 as obligate co-receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>progesterone</kwd><kwd>membrane progesterone receptor beta</kwd><kwd>ABHD2</kwd><kwd>nongenomic signaling</kwd><kwd>PLA2</kwd><kwd>lipid messengers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007458</institution-id><institution>Qatar Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMRP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machaca</surname><given-names>Khaled</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008982</institution-id><institution>Qatar National Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NPRP13S-0206-200274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name><name><surname>Machaca</surname><given-names>Khaled</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR076029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qiuying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21ES032347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qiuying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Progesterone mediates nongenomic signaling in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte meiosis by activating a PLA2 activity that requires two membrane receptors ABDH2 and mPRÃ.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>P4 signaling is critical for the regulation of female reproduction, sperm activation, neuronal function, and modulation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dressing et al., 2011</xref>). The classical mode of P4 signaling is through nuclear receptors (nPRs) that act as transcription factors and modulate gene expression, resulting in cellular responses on a relatively slow time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rekawiecki et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, P4 mediates rapid signal transduction that is independent of transcription and has thus been referred to as nongenomic. This signaling modality can be mediated by mPRs that are members of the progestin and AdipoQ receptors family (PAQR), and consist of 11 receptors with 5 being specific to P4: PAQR5 (mPRÎ³), PAQR6 (mPRÎ´), PAQR7 (mPRÎ±), PAQR8 (mPRÎ²), and PAQR9 (mPRÏµ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2005</xref>). Several lines of evidence support the importance of nongenomic mPR-dependent signaling, including results from studies of nPR knockout mouse lines, the speed of the signal transmission following P4 treatments, and the observed activity of membrane impermeant BSA-coupled P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dressing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lydon et al., 1995</xref>). Currently, mPR-mediated signaling is recognized as an important regulator of many biological functions in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, female and male reproductive tissues, intestine, immune and cancer cells, and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dressing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussatche and Lyons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dosiou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flock et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, mPRs are emerging as potential clinical targets for hypertension, reproductive disorders, and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wendler and Wehling, 2022</xref>). However, their downstream signaling events are not well defined.</p><p>mPRs are integral membrane proteins with predicted 7-transmembrane domains, a cytoplasmic N-terminus, and an extracellular C-terminus, which were first identified in fish ovaries almost two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>). This topology is opposite to that of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), yet there is an abundance of evidence for G protein activation downstream of mPRs, primarily GÎ±<sub>i</sub> and also GÎ²Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas, 2022</xref>). However, there are conflicting reports as to whether mPRs signal through trimeric G-proteins or other modalities that remain to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussatche and Lyons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The anuran <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> is a particularly suitable model to study P4 nongenomic signaling for two reasons: (1) the oocyte is transcriptionally silent, so signaling can only occur through the nongenomic arm; (2) P4 is known to trigger <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation through the activation of mPRÎ² (PAQR8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua et al., 2007</xref>). Fully grown vertebrate oocytes arrest at prophase I of meiosis for prolonged periods before undergoing maturation in preparation for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nader et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, P4 triggers re-entry into meiosis as well as a series of cytoplasmic differentiation steps that allow the egg to become fertilization-competent, able to activate in response to sperm entry, and to support early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Machaca, 2007</xref>). Signaling downstream of mPRÎ² ultimately leads to activation of maturation promoting factor (MPF), composed of Cdk1 and cyclin B, that serves as the primary kinase which triggers oocyte entry into M-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). MPF is activated non-reversibly through two signaling cascades, Plk-Cdc25C and the MAPK cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Î±/Î² hydrolase domain-containing protein 2 (ABHD2) is required for P4-induced oocyte maturation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Signaling events downstream of mPRÎ² after progesterone (P4), leading to oocyte maturation.

The fact that many of those changes are observed early on after P4 addition (5 min) argues that they represent the initial signaling step downstream of P4 to commit the oocyte to meiosis.</p><p>We were initially puzzled by the global lipidomics profiles as they showed mostly downregulation of both GPL and sphingolipid species. If the cells are indeed in broad lipid catabolism mode, one would expect enrichment in some lipid end products. However, because oocyte maturation is asynchronous, changes in individual lipid species may be masked when several oocytes are pooled as in our lipidomics analyses. To get better insights into changes at the single oocyte level, we developed approaches (see Methods) to extract and analyze metabolites at the single oocyte level at the 30 min post-P4 time point. Single oocyte data showed a threefold increase in LPA and replicated the downregulation of GPL and sphingolipid species observed in the pooled analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The lipidomics changes observed in response to P4 are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> along both the GPL and sphingolipid pathways by an arrow up (red) or down (green) next to each detected lipid species.</p><p>Some end products of GPL and SL metabolism such as eicosanoids and sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) are not well suited to the standard extraction protocols used for our global metabolomics studies.

AA is a precursor for eicosanoids, which are produced through three main enzymatic pathways: (1) cyclooxygenases (cox1/cox2) action results in the formation of prostaglandins; (2) lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes; and (3) cytochrome P450 enzymes, Ï-hydrolases and epoxygenases, yield hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We could not detect any leukotrienes in the oocyte samples despite testing for multiple species (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, 20-hydroxy LTB4, 20-carboxy LTB4) but could observe a downregulation in their precursor hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We did, however, detect a decrease in LTB4 derivatives in the single oocyte MS analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also observed decreases in two epoxyeicosatrienoids (EET) from single oocyte samples (20 oocytes at 30 min post-P4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast to leukotrienes and lipoxins, the trend in prostaglandins (PG) was the opposite with increases observed in multiple species, including PGI2, PGF1a, PGE2/PGD2, and PGF2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows the relative changes of PG species from different donor females.

We, therefore, directly tested S1P levels in the oocyte in response to P4 at 5 and 30 min but did not detect any significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This implies that either S1P does not change in response to P4, or alternatively that the S1P produced in response to P4 diffuses out of the oocyte. This is possible as S1P is membrane-permeant and acts on cell surface receptors from the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brindley and Pilquil, 2009</xref>).

ACA completely inhibited maturation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.8Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in line with its reported PLA2 IC<sub>50</sub> value (5Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). ACA treatment blocked Plk1, MAPK, and MPF activation explaining the maturation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the robust inhibition with ACA, we tested other PLA2 inhibitors, including AACOF3, bromoenol lactone (BEL), and pyrrophenone to get insights into the PLA2 isoform involved. BEL inhibited oocyte maturation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.9Ã10<sup>â5</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), by mainly blocking the Plk1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The BEL IC<sub>50</sub> was about fivefold higher than its reported inhibitory potency of 8Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The other two PLA2 inhibitors were ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It is difficult to pinpoint a particular PLA2 isoform based on the isoform-specific profile of these inhibitorâs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/QA/en/technical-documents/technical-article/protein-biology/protein-expression/phospholipase-a2">https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/QA/en/technical-documents/technical-article/protein-biology/protein-expression/phospholipase-a2</ext-link>), arguing that the oocyteâs PLA2 activity required for maturation does not match known PLA2 isoforms. Nonetheless, the inhibitors data support a central role for PLA2 in inducing oocyte maturation downstream of P4. In line with this, pre-treatment of oocytes with mastoparan, a peptide toxin from wasp venom known to activate PLA2, enhanced oocyte maturation by ~50% in response to low P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pharmacological validation of the metabolomics findings.</title><p>(<bold>A, E, I</bold>) Dose-response of inhibition of oocyte maturation for the drugs tested.

None of these inhibitors had a significant inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation at high P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). However, because pristimerin showed a trend toward inhibition at the highest concentration, we tested its effect at low P4 concentration where it inhibited oocyte maturation but required a concentration of 10<sup>â5</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), which is two orders of magnitude higher than its documented IC<sub>50</sub> in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mannowetz et al., 2017</xref>). These results argue against an important role for a monoacylglycerol enzymatic activity, whether ABHD2-dependent or not, in inducing oocyte maturation. We further tested a reported specific ABHD2 inhibitor, compound 183 (10<sup>â4</sup> M), which inhibited oocyte maturation at low and high P4 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), arguing for a role for ABHD2 in oocyte maturation.</p><p>We next focused on enzymes that generate PGs and LPA as the enriched lipid metabolites in response to P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We, therefore, tested the effects of HA130 at low P4, where it significantly inhibited maturation by ~80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, this inhibition of maturation required high concentrations of HA130 -at least three orders of magnitude higher than the reported HA130 IC<sub>50</sub>, arguing against a major role for the autotaxin pathway in generating LPA in response to P4, and rather supporting LPA production primarily through PLA2 activity.</p><p>We then tested the effect of inhibiting cyclooxygenases responsible for PGs production on oocyte maturation. Inhibition of Cox enzymes with ibuprofen effectively blocked maturation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.7Ã10<sup>â4</sup> M consistent with its IC<sub>50</sub> against Cox2 (3.7Ã10<sup>â4</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As expected from its effect on maturation, ibuprofen treatment blocked both Plk1 and MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Specific inhibition of Cox2 using NS398 blocked maturation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10<sup>â4</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is higher than its documented IC<sub>50</sub> against Cox2 (3.8Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consistently, NS398 at high concentrations had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation (~85%) at limiting P4 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The Cox1-specific inhibitor SC-560 had no effect on oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Leukotrienes are decreased in response to P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so presumably inhibition of lipoxygenases diverts AA metabolism toward cyclooxygenase hydrolysis thus increasing PGs production, which would explain the observed effect on oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>S1P signaling supports oocyte maturation</title><p>The lipidomics data show the downregulation of most metabolites along the sphingolipid arm of the metabolic pathway with a presumed enrichment of S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We were, however, unable to detect an increase of S1P in the oocyte in response to P4 even when using a targeted mass spectrometry-based assay for S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This may be because S1P is readily secreted and signals extracellularly. However, activation of ceramidases could be involved in the sphingolipid changes. mPRs share sequence and structural homology with adiponectin receptors, which have been shown to possess ceramidase activity that requires Zn in the active site that acts on the ceramide amide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holland et al., 2011</xref>). We have previously shown that an mPRÎ² mutant with all four zinc coordinating residues mutated to Ala to abrogate Zn binding (H129, D146, H281, H285A) is functional in inducing oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>). This argues that mPRÎ² does not require ceramidase activity to release oocyte meiotic arrest. To confirm this finding, we mutated Ser125 in the conserved SxxxH motif in mPRÎ², which matches the ceramidase domain in PAQR and AdipoQ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelder et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanabe et al., 2015</xref>). The mPRÎ²-S125A mutant expresses and traffics normally to the cell membrane to similar levels as WT mPRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, it signals effectively downstream of progesterone as its overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) rescues mPRÎ² knockdown with similar efficiency as WT mPRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), and activates Plk1, MAPK, and MPF to induce oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively these results argue against a role for mPRÎ²-dependent ceramidase activity in inducing oocyte maturation. Hence, changes in sphingolipids might be a consequence of the alterations in other lipid metabolic pathways, especially that the metabolism of GPLs is linked to that of sphingolipids through the activity of SM synthase.</p><p>If indeed S1P is the end product of sphingolipid metabolism in response to P4, then one would predict the activation of sphingosine kinases and concurrently ceramidases to support the metabolic flux. We tested this hypothesis using broad-spectrum sphingosine kinase and ceramidase inhibitors. Inhibition of ceramidase activity using D-e-MAPP had little effect on oocyte maturation at high P4 (10<sup>â5</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In contrast, at limiting P4 (10<sup>â7</sup> M) MAPP inhibited oocyte maturation by ~55% compared to untreated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Note that at low P4 (10<sup>â7</sup> M) oocyte maturation is not complete as only the most primed oocytes respond, and this response varies from frog to frog (10â50% of the maturation observed with high P4). Inhibition of sphingosine kinases using MP-A08 inhibited oocyte maturation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.3Ã10<sup>â5</sup> Mat high P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). At low P4, MP-A08 blocked maturation by 87.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), supporting a role for S1P in oocyte maturation.

Plk1 induces maturation by activating the dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25C, which dephosphorylates Cdc2 to activate MPF and is considered a rate-limiting step in MPF activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perdiguero and Nebreda, 2004</xref>). We, therefore, tested the effects of S1PR3 knockdown on Cdc25C activation and showed that despite the induction of both Plk1 and MAPK, Cdc25C was not activated in response to P4 in S1PR3 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We followed Cdc25C activation by assessing its dephosphorylation at Ser287 (Ser216 in humans), which is required for its activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perdiguero and Nebreda, 2004</xref>). The partial oocyte maturation block in S1PR3 KD oocytes argues for a modulatory role for S1P signaling. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the requirement for S1PR3 at increasing P4 dosages that would incrementally induce the multiple arms of the maturation signaling pathways. S1P3R knockdown oocytes matured with significantly less efficiency and with a slower time course at low P4 (10<sup>â7</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), but interestingly this effect was gradually lost with increased P4 concentrations (10<sup>â5</sup> and 10<sup>â4</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These data argue that the S1P/S1PR3 pathway modulates oocyte maturation, but that by itself it is not essential for maturation as it can be bypassed when other pathways are hyper activated at high P4 concentrations. This is consistent with the production of multiple lipid messengers to induce maturation through several GPCR pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Role of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in mediating lipid messenger action</title><p>All the enriched lipid metabolites detected from our lipidomics analyses - PGs, LPA, and possibly S1P - act through GPCRs.

This is an attractive possibility as GPCRs have been implicated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation for decades without conclusive evidence for their involvement, and they have been shown to mediate mPR nongenomic signaling. Therefore, we tested the effects of broad inhibitors of trimeric G-proteins.

This argues for a supporting role for GÎ²Î³ signaling as well in oocyte maturation.

Mutating the ABHD2 lipid hydrolase domain (S/D/H mutant) resulted in a loss of PLA2 activity when the protein was expressed with mPRÎ² in the presence of P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results argue that ABHD2 has PLA2 catalytic activity but only in the presence of mPRÎ².</p><p>To cross-validate our findings from the reticulocyte experiments, we tested in vitro and cell-based expression systems to increase protein yield. We settled on the coupled in vitro transcription/translation tobacco lysates system (ALiCE) that produces high protein yields and targets expressed proteins to microsomes directly using a melittin signal peptide. This is an advantage for our proteins of interest as they are both integral membrane proteins. The tobacco lysates expression system produced significantly higher yields of both mPR and ABHD2 expression where both proteins were readily detected on Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar to the reticulocyte system, tobacco lysates expressing ABHD2 or mPRÎ² alone were not associated with increased PLA2 activity whether in the presence or absence of P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Of note tobacco lysates have endogenous PLA2 activity, which was inhibited by expression of mPRÎ² alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The PLA2 activity data from tobacco lysates are reported as the rate of increase over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Co-expression of mPRÎ² and ABHD2 in the tobacco lysates produced significant PLA2 activity that was not only higher than that detected from the reticulocyte lysates but also stable over extended periods of time allowing recordings for over 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly in this case, however, the PLA2 activity of the co-receptor complex was independent of P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Both the reticulocyte and tobacco expression system show that mPRÎ² is a necessary partner for ABHD2 to mediate its PLA2 activities. However, the reticulocyte co-expression results argue that mPRÎ² and ABHD2 need P4 to assemble and form a complex to be able to mediate the ABHD2 PLA2 activity. In contrast, when the two proteins are expressed at high levels and more importantly targeted specifically to the same microsomal compartment their PLA2 activity becomes P4 independent. We were thus interested in testing whether the two receptors interact in vivo. We expressed mPRÎ²-GFP in oocytes and tested whether it forms a complex with ABHD2. Immunoprecipitation of mPRÎ²-GFP pulls down ABHD2 at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and importantly this interaction is significantly enhanced (1.9Â±0.2 fold, p=0.002) following P4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This argues that P4 enhances the assembly of the co-receptor complex. Furthermore, co-expression and pull-down experiments show that the non-functional ABHD2 mutants: S/D/H and ABHD2.L interact with mPRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the interaction between ABHD2 and mPRÎ² does not require a functional lipase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ABHD2 and PLA2 activity are required for mPRÎ² endocytosis and signaling</title><p>We have previously shown that mPRÎ² induces oocyte maturation at the level of the signaling endosome following its clathrin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, mPRÎ² endocytosis is sufficient to induce maturation in the absence of P4. Since changes in plasma membrane lipid composition are known to modulate endocytosis and membrane component activities, we suspected a role for ABHD2/PLA2 in mPRÎ² endocytosis in response to P4. Therefore, we quantified mPRÎ² endocytosis following ABHD2 knockdown. P4 leads to the enrichment of mPRÎ² positive intracellular vesicles, and this enrichment requires ABHD2 as it was lost in ABHD2 knockdown oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). PLA2 activity was also critical for P4-induced mPRÎ² endocytosis, which was completely blocked in ACA-treated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, ACA also inhibited basal endocytosis of mPRÎ² in the absence of P4, which is apparent as lower vesicular mPRÎ² in oocytes treated with ACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, no P4).

This prevented us from imaging the trafficking and distribution of ABHD2 during oocyte maturation.</p><p>The requirement for ABHD2 to mediate P4-dependent mPRÎ² endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) suggests that this may be the primary function of ABHD2 in response to P4. Under that scenario, P4 activates ABHD2 enzymatic activity which induces mPRÎ² endocytosis leading to oocyte maturation. To test this hypothesis, we were interested in inducing mPRÎ² endocytosis in the absence of P4. We have previously shown that a dominant negative SNAP25 mutant missing the last 20 residues (SNAP25Î20), effectively blocks exocytosis in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>); leading to mPRÎ² enrichment intracellularly and inducing maturation in the absence of P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Jouni et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to P4, SNAP25Î20-induced oocyte maturation requires clathrin-dependent endocytosis as it was blocked by a clathrin blocker pitstop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). As expected, SNAP25Î20-induced oocyte maturation requires mPRÎ² as it was inhibited in oocytes where mPRÎ² was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Surprisingly, SNAP25Î20-induced maturation also requires ABHD2, since oocytes where ABHD2 is knocked down were unable to mature in response to SNAP25Î20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), despite high expression of SNAP25Î20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We further tested whether mPRÎ² overexpression allows ABHD2 KD oocytes to mature in response to SNAP25Î20, but this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This argues that even in the presence of excess mPRÎ², its forced internalization using SNAP25Î20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) in the absence of ABHD2 is not sufficient to induce maturation. Therefore, ABHD2 activity is not only required for mPRÎ² internalization but it is also required at the level of the signaling endosome following mPRÎ² endocytosis to induce maturation.</p><p>Like P4, SNAP25Î20 activates Plk1, MAPK, and MPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and this induction was significantly inhibited following the knockdown of either ABHD2 or mPRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), showing that both proteins signal through the canonical kinase cascades to induce maturation following internalization even in the absence of P4. Furthermore, in addition to the PLA2 inhibitor ACA, inhibition of Cox2, or sphingosine kinase partially blocked SNAP25Î20 induced maturation with ACA being the most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), similar to what we observe with P4. ACA blocks basal mPRÎ² recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and as such would inhibit its internalization in response to SNAP25Î20 expression. However, the Cox2 (NS398) and the SphK (MPA08) inhibitors should not interfere with mPRÎ² internalization in response to SNAP25Î20, although experimentally it is difficult to ascertain this. Collectively these results argue that PLA2 activity is required for mPRÎ² internalization and that furthermore, both Cox2 and SphK activities are important to modulate oocyte maturation following mPRÎ² internalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>mPR-dependent nongenomic signaling is an important regulator of many physiological processes in female and male reproduction, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, neurological, and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dressing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moussatche and Lyons, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wendler and Wehling, 2022</xref>).

Therefore, understanding mPR signaling is important to assess their physiological and pathological contributions.

As such it represents the initial step in multicellular organismal development that precedes fertilization. It is, therefore, not surprising that oocyte maturation involves multiple signaling cascades to mediate both the completion of meiosis -the so-called nuclear maturation- to generate a haploid gamete, and the extensive cellular differentiation of the oocyte that is needed to support development, and includes protein synthesis, membrane remodeling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling differentiation that supports the block of polyspermy and resumption of meiosis at fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Machaca, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, the release of the long-term meiotic arrest can be triggered by P4. In fact, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation is one of the most studied examples of nongenomic P4 signaling and represents a well characterized system to define the signaling cascade downstream of P4. It is well-established that P4 in the oocyte activates two parallel and interdependent kinase cascades that ultimately culminate in MPF activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). Despite many studies over the past decades, the earliest signaling steps downstream of mPR have remained elusive. An interesting recent development shows that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mPRÎ² is necessary and sufficient for its signaling and the induction of oocyte maturation even in the absence of P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>). It, therefore, appears that the signaling endosome acts as a hub to activate the multiple pathways required to release meiotic arrest, resume meiosis, and prepare the egg for fertilization.</p><p>An untested assumption is that P4 induces oocyte maturation primarily through mPRÎ² since its knockdown or anti-mPRÎ² antibodies block maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua et al., 2007</xref>). However, the oocyte expresses other P4 receptors including ABHD2 that may contribute to P4 signaling. Here, we show that knockdown of ABHD2 blocks oocyte maturation and that this is rescued effectively by ABHD2 overexpression but not by mPRÎ² overexpression. ABHD2 contains a lipase and an acyltransferase motif. The lipase domain is required for oocyte maturation but not the acyltransferase domain. Based on this finding, we undertook an unbiased lipidomics approach to better define metabolic alterations driven by ABHD2 lipase activity. P4 resulted in a broad decrease in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid species, with the enrichment of a few lipid messenger end products, namely prostaglandins, LPA, and S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). This is intriguing as all these lipid messengers act through GPCRs. We in fact validate S1P action through the S1P receptor, which is a GPCR, to support oocyte maturation. These findings argue that P4 activates ABHD2 lipase activity to generate lipid messengers that in turn stimulate various GPCRs that regulate the multiple aspects of oocyte maturation. This would nicely explain the standing controversy in the field as to whether mPRs are GPCRs or not. Should the findings from the oocyte hold in other systems, it would be argued that P4 activates lipid catabolism to generate lipid messenger that then acts through GPCRs. Thus, nongenomic P4 signaling would involve both non-GPCR and GPCR signaling modalities in series.</p><p>An intriguing finding of the current study is that the PLA2 activity of ABHD2 is activated through its interaction with mPRÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Although ABHD2 and mPRÎ² interact at rest, this interaction is enhanced following P4 treatment. This is the first report showing that ABHD2 possesses PLA2 activity and that this PLA2 activity requires interaction with mPRÎ². The PLA2 family is large and complex with over 50 members that have been classified based on enzymatic activity, co-factor dependence, subcellular distribution, and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dennis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>); and include the secreted, cytosolic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, lysosomal, platelet-activating factor acyl hydrolase, and some members of the Î±/Î² hydrolase domain (ABHD) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lord et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>ABHD2 has been shown to act as a 2-AG lipase to activate sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mannowetz et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we find no evidence for such an activity in response to P4 based on our lipidomics analyses in the oocyte. This raises the interesting possibility that ABHD2 lipase specificity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions in a cell-specific fashion, but this remains to be tested.</p><p>In addition to the generation of lipid messengers that branch out P4 signaling at its onset into multiple signaling cascades through GPCRs, the ABHD2 PLA2 activity hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate AA that is then metabolized to PGs through the activity of Cox2. The hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids generates lysophospholipids with a single acyl chain that tends to have a conical shape. Such conical phospholipids are prone to inducing membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>) as the latter is determined by the size of the lipid headgroups and hydrophobic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernst et al., 2016</xref>). Conical lipids have been shown to play important roles in membrane fusion events both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pagliuso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irie et al., 2017</xref>). It is, therefore, tempting to postulate that enrichment in lysophospholipids following ABHD2-PLA2 activation generates spontaneous membrane curvature, which can be sensed by the clathrin endocytic machinery to induce mPRÎ² endocytosis and initiate signaling and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p>Collectively our findings define the earliest steps in nongenomic P4 signaling to release the oocyte meiotic arrest and prepare the egg for fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Furthermore, they show for the first time that two heterologous receptors previously implicated in nongenomic signaling, mPRÎ² and ABHD2, function as coreceptors to induce PLA2 activity that is required for both endocytosis and further downstream signaling. Nongenomic P4 signaling is widespread and mediates reproductive, neurological, and other functions. Therefore, these findings are likely to have broad implications throughout biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and primers</title><p>A list of the antibodies, siRNA, chemicals, and other reagents used is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>.

The research has been conducted extensively and is presented clearly.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>While the interaction between membranous PR and ABHD2 is not a novel concept, this present study exhibits several strengths:</p><p>(1) mPRbeta, a member of the PAQR family, has been elusive in terms of detailed signal transduction. Through mutation studies involving the Zn binding domain, the authors discovered that the hydrolase activity of mPRbeta is not essential for meiosis and oocyte maturation.

In addition, the extremely short half-life of PGI2 necessitates the measurement of its stable metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1a, instead. The authors also need to clarify why they measured PGF1a but not PGF2a.

In fish and frog oocytes it seems clear that mPR proteins are involved, but exactly how they relay signals is less clear. In human sperm, the lipid hydrolase ABHD2 has been identified as a receptor for progesterone, and so the authors here examine whether ABHD2 might contribute to progesterone-induced oocyte maturation as well. The main results are:</p><p>(1) Knocking down ABHD2 makes oocytes less responsive to progesterone, and ectopically expressing ABHD2.S (but not the shorter ABHD2.L gene product) partially rescues responsiveness. The rescue depends upon the presence of critical residues in the protein's conserved lipid hydrolase domain, but not upon the presence of critical residues in its acyltransferase domain.</p><p>(2) Treatment of oocytes with progesterone causes a decrease in sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid content within 5 min. This is accompanied by an increase in LPA content and arachidonic acid metabolites. These species may contribute to signaling through GPCRs. Perhaps surprisingly, there was no detectable increase in sphingosine-1-phosphate, which might have been expected given the apparent substantial hydrolysis of sphingolipids. The authors speculate that S1P is formed and contributes to signaling but diffuses away.</p><p>(3) Pharmacological inhibitors of lipid-metabolizing enzymes support, for the most part, the inferences from the lipidomics studies, although there are some puzzling findings. The puzzling findings may be due to uncertainty about whether the inhbitors are working as advertised.</p><p>(4) Pharmacological inhibitors of G-protein signaling support a role for G-proteins and GPCRs in this signaling, although again there are some puzzling findings.</p><p>(5) Reticulocyte expression supports the idea that mPRÎ² and ABHD2 function together to generate a progesterone-regulated PLA2 activity.</p><p>(6) Knocking down or inhibiting ABHD2 inhibited progesterone-induced mPRÎ² internalization, and knocking down ABHD2 inhibited SNAP25â20-induced maturation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>All in all, this could be a very interesting paper and a nice contribution. The data add a lot to our understanding of the process, and, given how ubiquitous mPR and AdipoQ receptor signaling appear to be, something like this may be happening in many other physiological contexts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I have several suggestions for how to make the main points more convincing.</p><p>Main criticisms:</p><p>(1) The ABHD2 knockdown and rescue, presented in Fig 1, is one of the most important findings. It can and should be presented in more detail to allow the reader to understand the experiments better. E.g.: the antisense oligos hybridize to both ABHD2.S and ABHD2.L, and they knock down both (ectopically expressed) proteins. Do they hybridize to either or both of the rescue constructs? If so, wouldn't you expect that both rescue constructs would rescue the phenotype, since they both should sequester the AS oligo? Maybe I'm missing something here.</p><p>In addition, it is critical to know whether the partial rescue (Fig 1E, I, and K) is accomplished by expressing reasonable levels of the ABHD2 protein, or only by greatly overexpressing the protein. The author's antibodies do not appear to be sensitive enough to detect the endogenous levels of ABHD2.S or .L, but they do detect the overexpressed proteins (Fig 1D). The authors could thus start by microinjecting enough of the rescue mRNAs to get detectable protein levels, and then titer down, assessing how low one can go and still get rescue. And/or compare the mRNA levels achieved with the rescue construct to the endogenous mRNAs.</p><p>Finally, please make it clear what is meant by n = 7 or n = 3 for these experiments. Does n = 7 mean 7 independently lysed oocytes from the same frog? Or 7 groups of, say, 10 oocytes from the same frog? Or different frogs on different days? I could not tell from the figure legends, the methods, or the supplementary methods. Ideally one wants to be sure that the knockdown and rescue can be demonstrated in different batches of oocytes, and that the experimental variability is substantially smaller than the effect size.</p><p>(2) The lipidomics results should be presented more clearly. First, please drop the heat map presentations (Fig 2A-C) and instead show individual time course results, like those shown in Fig 2E, which make it easy to see the magnitude of the change and the experiment-to-experiment variability. As it stands, the lipidomics data really cannot be critically assessed.</p><p>[Even as heat map data go, panels A-C are hard to understand. The labels are too small, especially on the heat map on the right side of panel B. And the 25 rows in panel C are not defined (the legend makes me think the panel is data from 10 individual oocytes, so are the 25 rows 25 metabolites? If so, are the individual oocyte data being collapsed into an average? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of assessing individual oocytes?) And those readers with red-green colorblindness (8% of men) will not be able to tell an increase from a decrease. But please don't bother improving the heat maps; they should just be replaced with more-informative bar graphs or scatter plots.]</p><p>(3) The reticulocyte lysate co-expression data are quite important, and are both intriguing and puzzling. My impression had been that to express functional membrane proteins, one needed to add some membrane source, like microsomes, to the standard kits. Yet it seems like co-expression of mPR and ABHD2 proteins in a standard kit is sufficient to yield progesterone-regulated PLA2 activity. I could be wrong here-I'm not a protein expression expert-but I was surprised by this result, and I think it is critical that the authors make absolutely certain that it is correct. Do you get much greater activities if microsomes are added? Are the specific activities of the putative mPR-ABHD2 complexes reasonable?</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have satisfied my concerns with their response letter and revisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92635.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report two P4 receptors, ABHD2 and mPRÎ² that function as co-receptors to induce PLA2 activity and thus drive meiosis. In their experimental studies, the authors knock down ABHD2 and demonstrated inhibition of oocyte maturation and inactivation of Plk1, MAPK, and MPF, which indicated that ABHD2 is required for P4-induced oocyte maturation. Next, they showed three residues (S207, D345, H376) in the lipase domain that are crucial for ABHD2 P4-mediated oocyte maturation in functional assays. They performed global lipidomics analysis on mPRÎ² or ABHD2 knockdown oocytes, among which the downregulation of GPL and sphingolipid species were observed and enrichment in LPA was also detected using their metabolomics method. Furthermore, they investigated pharmacological profiles of enzymes predicted to be important for maturation based on their metabolomic analyses and ascertained the central role for PLA2 in inducing oocyte maturation downstream of P4. They showed the modulation of S1P/S1PR3 pathway on oocyte maturation and potential role for or GÎ±s signaling and potentially GÎ²Î³ downstream of P4.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors make a very interesting finding that ABHD2 has PLA2 catalytic activity but only in the presence of mPRÎ² and P4. Finally, they provided supporting data for a relationship between ABHD2/PLA2 activity and mPRÎ² endocytosis and further downstream signaling. Collectively, this research report defines early steps in nongenomic P4 signaling, which is of broad physiological implications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There were concerns with the pharmacological studies presented. Many of these inhibitors are used at high (double digit micromolar) concentrations that could result in non-specific pharmacological effects and the authors have provided very little data in support of target engagement and selectivity under the multiple experimental paradigms. In addition, the use of an available ABHD2 small molecule inhibitor was lacking in these studies.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed my major concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92635.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nader</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Assaf</surname><given-names>Lama</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hamad bin Khalifa University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zarif</surname><given-names>Lubna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Halama</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Sharan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dib</surname><given-names>Maya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Attarwala</surname><given-names>Nabeel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qiuying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Suhre</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Machaca</surname><given-names>Khaled</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Doha</named-content></addr-line><country>Qatar</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment:</bold></p><p>ââ¦However, the findings are reliant on high concentrations of inhibitor drugs, and mechanistic details about the molecular interaction and respective functions of ABHD2 and mPRb are incomplete.â</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed below in the response to Reviewers the drug concentrations used span the full dose response of the active range of each drug. In cases where the drug concentrations required to block oocyte maturation where significantly higher than those reported in the literature, we considered those drugs ineffective. In terms of the molecular details of the mechanistic interaction between mPRb and ABHD2, we now provide additional data confirming their molecular interaction to produce PLA2 activity where each protein alone is insufficient. Although these new studies provide more mechanistic insights, there remains details of the ABHD2-mPR interactions that would need to be addressed in future studies which are beyond the scope of the current already extensive study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p><p>(1) The mechanism governing the molecular assembly of mPRbeta and ABHD2 remains unclear. Are they constitutively associated or is their association ligand-dependent? Does P4 bind not only to mPRbeta but also to ABHD2, as indicated in Figure 6J? In the latter case, the reviewer suggests that the authors conduct a binding experiment using labeled P4 with ABHD2 to confirm this interaction and assess any potential positive or negative cooperativity with a partner receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>The co-IP experiments presented in Figure 5E argue that the two receptors are constitutively associated at rest before exposure to P4; but at low levels since addition of P4 increases the association between mPRÎ² and ABHD2 by ~2 folds. Importantly, we know from previous work (Nader et al., 2020) and from imaging experiments in this study that mPR recycles in immature oocytes between the PM and the endosomal compartment. It is not clear at this point within which subcellular compartment the basal association of mPR and ABHD2 occurs. We have tried to elucidate this point but have not been able to generate a functional tagged ABHD2. We generated GFP-tagged ABHD2 at both the N- and C-terminus but these constructs where not functional in terms of their ability to rescue ABHD2 knockdown. This prevented us from testing the association dynamics between ABHD2 and mPR.</p><p>Regarding whether ABHD2 in the oocyte directly binds P4 or not, we had in the initial submission no data directly supporting this rather we based the cartoon in Fig. 6J on the findings from Miller et al. (Science 2016) who showed that ABHD2 in sperm binds biotinylated P4. With the use of a new expression system to produce ABHD2 in vitro (please see below) we were able to try the experiment suggested by the Reviewer. In vitro expressed ABHD2 was incubated with biotinylated P4, and binding tested on a streptavidin column. Under these conditions we could not detect any specific binding of P4 to ABHD2, however, these experiments remain somewhat preliminary and would require validation using additional approaches to conclusively test whether <italic>Xenopus</italic> ABHD2 binds P4 or not. The discrepancy with the Miller et al. findings could be species specific as they tested mammalian ABHD2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors have diligently determined the metabolite profile using numerous egg cells.

In addition, the extremely short half-life of PGI2 necessitates the measurement of its stable metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1a, instead. The authors also need to clarify why they measured PGF1a but not PGF2a.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the Reviewer meant to indicate discrepancies between Fig. 2E (not 2B) and Supp. Fig. 2C. Indeed, the Reviewer is correct, and this is because Fig. 2E shows pooled normalized data on a per PG species and frog, whereas Supp. Fig. 2E shows and example of absolute raw levels from a single frog to illustrate the relative basal abundance of the different PG species. We had failed to clarify this in the Supp. Fig. 2E figure legend, which we have now added in the revised manuscript. So, the discrepancies are due to variation between different donor animals which is highlighted in Supp. Fig. 2A. Furthermore, to minimize confusion, in the revised manuscript we revised Supp. Fig. 2C to show only PG levels at rest, to illustrate basal levels of the different PG species relative to each other, which is the goal of this supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although they propose PGs, LPA, and S1P are important downstream mediators, the exact roles of the identified lipid mediators have not been clearly demonstrated, as receptor expression and activation were not demonstrated. While the authors showed S1PR3 expression and its importance by genetic manipulation, there was no observed change in S1P levels following P4 treatment (Supplementary Figure 2D). It is essential to identify which receptors (subtypes) are expressed and how downstream signaling pathways (PKA, Ca, MAPK, etc.) relate to oocyte phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree conceptually with the Reviewer that identifying the details of the signaling of the different GPCRs involved in oocyte maturation would be interesting. However, our lipidomic data argue that the activation of a PLA2 early in the maturation process in response to P4 leads to the production of multiple lipid messengers that would activate GPCRs and branch out the signaling pathway to activate various pathways required for the proper and timely progression of oocyte maturation. Preparing the egg for fertilization is complex; so, it is not surprising that a variety of pathways are activated simultaneously to properly initiate both cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation to transition the egg from its meiotic arrest state to be ready to support the rapid growth during early embryogenesis. We focus on the S1P signaling pathway specifically because, as pointed out by the Reviewer, we could not detect an increase in S1P even though our metabolomic data collectively argued for an increase. Our results on the S1P pathway -as well as a plethora of other studies historically in the literature that we allude to in the manuscript- argue that these different GPCRs support and regulate oocyte maturation, but they are not essential for the early maturation signaling pathway. For example, for S1P, as shown in Figure 4, the delay/inhibition of oocyte maturation due to S1PR3 knockdown can be reversed at high levels of P4, which presumably leads to higher levels of other lipid mediators that would bypass the need for signaling through S1PR3. This is reminiscent of the kinase cascade driving oocyte maturation where there is significant redundancy and feedback regulation. Therefore, analyzing each receptor subtype that may regulate the different PG species, LPA, and S1P would be a tedious and time-consuming undertaking that goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript. More importantly based on the above arguments, we suggest that findings from such an analysis, similar to the conclusions from the S1PR3 studies (Fig. 4), would show a modulatory role on oocyte maturation rather than a core requirement for the maturation process as observed with mPR and ABHD2. Thus they would provide relatively little insights into the core signaling pathway driving P4-mediated oocyte maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>(1) The ABHD2 knockdown and rescue, presented in Fig 1, is one of the most important findings. It can and should be presented in more detail to allow the reader to understand the experiments better. E.g.: the antisense oligos hybridize to both ABHD2.S and ABHD2.L, and they knock down both (ectopically expressed) proteins. Do they hybridize to either or both of the rescue constructs? If so, wouldn't you expect that both rescue constructs would rescue the phenotype since they both should sequester the AS oligo? Maybe I'm missing something here.</p></disp-quote><p>For the ABHD2 rescue experiment, the ABHD2 constructs (S or L) were expressed 48 hrs before the antisense was injected. The experiment was conducted in this way to avoid the potential confounding issue of both constructs sequestering the antisense. The assumption is that the injected RNA after protein expression would be degraded thus allowing the injected antisense to target endogenous ABHD2. The idea is to confirm that ABHD2.S expression alone is sufficient to rescue the antisense knockdown as confirmed experimentally.</p><p>However, to further confirm the rescue, we performed the experiment in a different chronological order, where we started with injecting the antisense to knock down endogenous ABHD2 and this was followed 24 hrs later by expressing wild type ABHD2.S. As shown in Author response image 1 this also rescues the knockdown.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ABHD2 knockdown and rescue.</title><p>Oocytes were injected with control antisense (Ctrl AS) or specific ABHD2 antisense (AS) oligonucleotides and incubated at 18 oC for 24 hr.

The author's antibodies do not appear to be sensitive enough to detect the endogenous levels of ABHD2.S or .L, but they do detect the overexpressed proteins (Fig 1D). The authors could thus start by microinjecting enough of the rescue mRNAs to get detectable protein levels, and then titer down, assessing how low one can go and still get rescue. And/or compare the mRNA levels achieved with the rescue construct to the endogenous mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>The dose response of ABHD2 protein expression in correlation with rescue of the ABHD2 knockdown is shown indirectly in Figure 1I and 1J. In experiments ABHD2 knockdown was rescued using either the WT protein or two mutants (H120A and N125A). All three constructs rescued ABHD2 KD with equal efficiency (Fig. 1I), eventhough their expression levels varied (Fig. 1J). The WT protein was expressed at significantly higher levels than both mutants, and N125A was expressed at higher levels than H120A (Fig. 1J), note the similar tubulin loading control. Crude estimation of the WBs argues for the WT protein expression being ~3x that of H120A and ~2x that of N125A, yet all three have similar rescue of the ABHD2 knockdown (Fig. 1I). This argues that low levels of ABHD2 expression is sufficient to rescue the knockdown, consistent with the catalytic enzymatic nature of the ABHD2 PLA2 activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, please make it clear what is meant by n = 7 or n = 3 for these experiments. Does n = 7 mean 7 independently lysed oocytes from the same frog? Or 7 groups of, say, 10 oocytes from the same frog? Or different frogs on different days? I could not tell from the figure legends, the methods, or the supplementary methods. Ideally one wants to be sure that the knockdown and rescue can be demonstrated in different batches of oocytes, and that the experimental variability is substantially smaller than the effect size.</p></disp-quote><p>The n reflects the number of independent female frogs.

First, please drop the heat map presentations (Fig 2A-C) and instead show individual time course results, like those shown in Fig 2E, which make it easy to see the magnitude of the change and the experiment-to-experiment variability. As it stands, the lipidomics data really cannot be critically assessed.</p><p>[Even as heat map data go, panels A-C are hard to understand. The labels are too small, especially on the heat map on the right side of panel B. The 25 rows in panel C are not defined (the legend makes me think the panel is data from 10 individual oocytes, so are the 25 rows 25 metabolites? If so, are the individual oocyte data being collapsed into an average? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of assessing individual oocytes?) And those readers with red-green colorblindness (8% of men) will not be able to tell an increase from a decrease. But please don't bother improving the heat maps; they should just be replaced with more informative bar graphs or scatter plots.]</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the lipidomics data as requested by the Reviewer. The Reviewer asked that we show the data as a time course with each individual frog as in Fig. 2E.

This allows for a quick visual overview of the data that clearly shows the decrease in the lipid species following P4 treatment in the control oocytes and not in the mPR-KD or ABHD2-KD cells (Fig. 2B). The individual species are listed in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. We also revised the Supplemental Tables to include the values for the non-significant changes, which were omitted from the previous submission.</p><p>We revised the metabolomics data from the HD4 platform in a similar fashion but because the lipid data were complimentary and less extensive than those from the CLP platform, we moved that heatmap to Supplemental Fig. 2B.</p><p>For the single oocyte metabolomics, we now show the data as the correlation between FC and p value, which clearly shows the upregulated (including LPA) and downregulated metabolites at T30 relative to T0 (Fig. 2C).

My impression had been that to express functional membrane proteins, one needed to add some membrane source, like microsomes, to the standard kits. Yet it seems like co-expression of mPR and ABHD2 proteins in a standard kit is sufficient to yield progesterone-regulated PLA2 activity. I could be wrong here - I'm not a protein expression expert - but I was surprised by this result, and I think it is critical that the authors make absolutely certain that it is correct. Do you get much greater activities if microsomes are added? Are the specific activities of the putative mPR-ABHD2 complexes reasonable?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this insightful comment. We agree that this is a critical result that would benefit from cross validation, especially given the low level of PLA2 activity detected in the reticulocyte lysate expression system. We have therefore expanded these studies using another in vitro expression system with microsomal membranes based on tobacco extracts (ALiCECell-Free Protein Synthesis System, Sigma Aldrich) to enhance production and stability of the expressed receptors as suggested by the Reviewer. We further prepared virus-like particles (VLPs) from cells expressing each receptor individually or both receptors together. We however could not detect any PLA2 activity from the VLPs. We thus focused on the coupled in vitro transcription/translation tobacco extracts that allow the expression of difficult-to-produce membrane proteins in microsomes. This kit targets membrane protein directly to microsomes using a microsome targeting melittin signal peptide. This system took significant time and effort to troubleshoot and adapt to mPR and ABHD2 expression. We were however ultimately able to produce significantly higher amounts of both ABHD2 and mPRb, which were readily detected by WBs (Supplemental Fig. 4I). In contrast, we could not reliably detect mPR or ABHD2 using WBs from reticulocyte lysates given the limited amounts produced.</p><p>Similarly to our previous findings with proteins produced in reticulocytes, expression of ABHD2 or mPRÎ² alone was not associated with an increase in PLA2 activity over a two-hour incubation period (Fig. 5C). It is worth noting here that the tobacco lysates had high endogenous PLA2 activity. However, co-expression of both mPRb and ABHD2 produced robust PLA2 activity that was significantly higher than that detected in reticulocyte lysate system (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, however this PLA2 activity was P4 independent as it was observed when both receptors are co-expressed in the absence of P4.</p><p>These results validate our earlier conclusion that PLA2 activity requires both mPR and ABHD2, so their interaction in needed for enzymatic activity. It is interesting however that in the tobacco expression system this mPR-ABHD2 PLA2 activity becomes for the most part P4 independent. As the tobacco expression system forces both ABHD2 and mPR into microsomes using a signal sequence, the two receptors are enriched in the same vesicular compartment. As they can interact independently of P4 as shown in the co-IP experiments in immature oocytes (Fig. 5D), their forced co-expression in the same microsomal compartment could lead to their association and thus PLA2 activity. This is an attractive possibility that fits the current data, but would need independent validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p><p><italic>There were concerns with the pharmacological studies presented. Many of these inhibitors are used at high (double-digit micromolar) concentrations that could result in non-specific pharmacological effects and the authors have provided very little data in support of target engagement and selectivity under the multiple experimental paradigms. In addition, the use of an available ABHD2 small molecule inhibitor was lacking in these studies.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>For the inhibitors used we performed a full dose response to define the active concentrations. So, inhibitors were not used at one high dose. We then compared the EC50 for each active inhibitor to the reported EC50 in the literature (Table 1). The inhibitors were deemed effective only if they inhibited oocyte maturation within the range reported in the literature. This despite the fact that frog oocytes are notorious in requiring higher concentrations of drug given their high lipophilic yolk content, which acts as a sponge for drugs. So our criteria for an effective inhibitor are rather stringent.</p><p>Based on these criteria, only 3 inhibitors were âeffectiveâ in inhibiting oocyte maturation: Ibuprofen, ACA and MP-A08 with relative IC50s to those reported in the literature of 0.7, 1.1, and 1.6 respectively. Ibuprofen targets Cox enzymes, which produce prostaglandins. We independently confirmed an increase in PGs in response to P4 in oocytes thus validating the drug inhibitory effect. ACA blocks PLA2 and inhibits maturation, a role supported by the metabolomics analyses that shows decrease in the PE/PE/LPE/LPC species; and by the ABHD2-mPR PLA2 activity following in vitro expression. Finally, MP-A08 blocks sphingosine kinase activity, which role is supported by the metabolomics showing a decrease in sphingosine levels in response to P4; and our functional studies validating a role for the S1P receptor 3 in oocyte maturation.</p><p>As pointed out by the Reviewer, other inhibitors did block maturation at very high concentration, but we do not consider these as effective and have not implicated the blocked enzymes in the early steps of oocyte maturation. To clarify this point, we edited the summary panel (now Fig. 2D) to simplify it and highlight the inhibitors with an effect in the reported range in red and those that donât inhibit based on the above criteria in grey. Those with intermediate effects are shown in pink. We hope these edits clarify the inhibitors studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For the Authors</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>(1) Introduction, para 1.

The RNAseq data from Xenbase in Supp Fig 1 supports the idea that the ABHD2 and mPRÎ² mRNAs are expressed at similar levels at the message level, although of course mRNA levels and protein levels do not correlate well when different gene products are compared (Wuhr's 2014 Curr Biol paper reported correlation coefficients of about 0.3).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the text as follow to specifically point out to RNA: âwe confirmed that ABHD2 RNA is expressed in the oocyte at levels similar to those of mPRÎ² RNA (Fig. 1B).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Results, para 2.

So, the fact that the drugs that are effective in inhibiting oocyte maturation (ACA, MP-A08, and Ibuprofen) work in a similar or lower concentration range to the published IC&lt;sub50 gives us confidence as to the specificity of their effect.
