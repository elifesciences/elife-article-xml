The PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), inhibits agonist responses of the pLGIC, ELIC, more effectively than palmitic acid, similar to the effects observed in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Using photo-affinity labeling and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identified two fatty acid binding sites in the outer transmembrane domain (TMD) of ELIC. Fatty acid binding to the photolabeled sites is selective for DHA over palmitic acid, and specific for an agonist-bound state. Hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate modification of one of the two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD recapitulates the inhibitory effect of PUFAs in ELIC. The results demonstrate that DHA selectively binds to multiple sites in the outer TMD of ELIC, but that state-dependent binding to a single intrasubunit site mediates DHA inhibition of ELIC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ligand-gated ion channel</kwd><kwd>docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>polyunsaturated fatty acid</kwd><kwd>photoaffinity labeling</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM137957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Wayland WL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM139351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petroff</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL067773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Covey</surname><given-names>Douglas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Covey</surname><given-names>Douglas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits ELIC through state-dependent binding to a single site.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fatty acids are major components of the cell membrane, and modulators of many ion channels including pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antollini and Barrantes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández Nievas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabekura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minota and Watanabe, 1997</xref>). Fatty acids inhibit neuronal pLGICs including the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabekura et al., 1998</xref>) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández Nievas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minota and Watanabe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouzat and Barrantes, 1993</xref>), by reducing peak channel responses to agonist. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a stronger inhibitory effect than mono- or saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minota and Watanabe, 1997</xref>). While the physiologic significance of PUFA inhibition of pLGICs is not fully understood, neuronal PUFAs affect neurologic processes in which pLGIC function is critical such as neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNamara and Carlson, 2006</xref>) and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 2017</xref>). Neuronal PUFA content can change dramatically in pathologic conditions such as stroke and seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taha et al., 2009</xref>), and PUFA inhibition of pLGICs under these conditions is likely an important determinant of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antollini and Barrantes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Fatty acids modulate ion channel function allosterically by one of two general mechanisms: by direct binding to specific sites in the protein, or by altering the physical properties of the lipid bilayer and thereby indirectly impacting protein structure. There is evidence to support both mechanisms in different ion channels including pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cordero-Morales and Vásquez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sogaard et al., 2006</xref>). A direct mechanism is thought to be important in pLGICs based on a crystal structure of <italic>Gloeobacter</italic> ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) in complex with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which showed a single binding site for DHA in the outer portion of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of this channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether fatty acids bind to other sites in pLGICs, and whether these sites are specific for PUFAs and mediate PUFA inhibition of channel activity are not established. It is possible that fatty acids bind to other sites in GLIC that were not resolved in the crystal structure due to greater flexibility of the fatty acid within those sites. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations also support a direct mechanism of fatty acid modulation of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tian et al., 2016</xref>) and voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yazdi et al., 2016</xref>), but biochemical identification of fatty acid binding sites in these and other ion channels remains a challenge.</p><p>Photo-affinity labeling is an alternative approach to identify lipid and small molecule binding sites in membrane proteins. Fatty acid photolabeling reagents have been used previously to identify fatty acid binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haberkant and Holthuis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haberkant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capone et al., 1983</xref>), but not to map binding sites at the residue level. We introduce a new photolabeling reagent with optimal photochemistry coupled with intact protein and middle-down mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budelier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budelier et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>) to identify fatty acid binding sites in the pLGIC, <italic>Erwinia</italic> ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilf and Dutzler, 2008</xref>). Combining this approach with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, we determine two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD of ELIC that are specific for DHA over palmitic acid when agonist is bound to the channel. Occupancy of one of these sites mediates the inhibitory effect of DHA on ELIC channel responses. The results argue for a direct mechanism of DHA inhibition of ELIC through state-dependent binding to a single site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DHA inhibits ELIC channel function</title><p>ELIC has been a useful model channel for investigating the structural determinants of lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hénault et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>) and anesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spurny et al., 2013</xref>) modulation of pLGICs. We sought to determine if ELIC is a suitable model for examining the mechanism of fatty acid inhibition of pLGICs. ELIC was reconstituted in giant liposomes composed of a 2:1:1 ratio of POPC:POPE:POPG for excised patch voltage-clamp recordings and channel responses were evaluated by rapid application of the agonist, cysteamine, at 30 mM for 1 min. ELIC responses showed fast activation followed by a slower current decay or desensitization, consistent with previous reports of ELIC function in liposomes or HEK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laha et al., 2013</xref>). The effect of fatty acids such as DHA (22:6) was determined by pre-applying fatty acid to the patch for 3 min followed by rapid application of cysteamine with the same concentration of fatty acid used in the pre-application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Longer pre-application times with fatty acid did not yield a greater effect, indicating that 3 min was sufficient time to equilibrate the patch membrane with DHA from solution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fatty acid inhibition of ELIC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample currents from excised patch-clamp (–60 mV) of WT ELIC in 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG giant liposomes.

DHA also caused a ~ 50% reduction in steady state current relative to the peak current in the absence of DHA (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.8 μM) and a similar percent reduction in the rate of current decay (IC<sub>50</sub> = 10.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the EC<sub>50</sub> of cysteamine activation showed no significant change with the pre-application of 10 μM DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, pre-application with the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA, 16:0), significantly reduced ELIC peak responses to 30 mM cysteamine, but to a much lesser degree than DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). 2, 5 and 20 μM PA yielded the same effect indicating that saturating concentrations of PA were used. Interestingly, the methyl ester of DHA (DHA ME) strongly inhibited ELIC similar to DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that the carboxylate DHA headgroup is not required for this inhibitory effect. The effects of fatty acids on ELIC are qualitatively similar to the effects reported in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabekura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sogaard et al., 2006</xref>) and nAchR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minota and Watanabe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vijayaraghavan et al., 1995</xref>). PUFAs inhibit gating efficacy without shifting agonist potency, and DHA ME is just as effective as DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taha et al., 2013</xref>). The results suggest that the mechanism of fatty acid inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R and nAchR is also present in ELIC.</p><p>One possibility for why DHA is a stronger inhibitor of ELIC than PA is that PA has a lower affinity for DHA binding sites in ELIC. Alternatively, the two fatty acids may bind to the same sites with similar affinity but different efficacy. To begin examining the interaction of fatty acids with ELIC, we performed CGMD on a single ELIC pentamer in a 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG membrane containing either 4 mol% PA or DHA. Here, we used the MARTINI coarse-grained model, originally developed as a coarse-grained model for lipids, which represents four non-hydrogen atoms as a single coarse-grained bead with well-described properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marrink and Tieleman, 2013</xref>). This coarse-graining reduces the number of particles and associated calculations of intermolecular potential, and eliminates fast interatomic vibrational modes allowing larger timesteps. Together this leads to simulations at longer timescales. The cost of these modifications, however, is a lack of atomic resolution and limited sampling of protein conformational changes due to structural restraints required for protein models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessandri et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, CGMD has been useful for sampling protein-lipid interactions by permitting more lipid diffusion over the simulation time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dämgen and Biggin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharp et al., 2019</xref>). We first quantified lipid sorting using the boundary lipid metric, <italic>B</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>), where B &gt; 1 indicates enrichment compared to bulk membrane and <italic>B</italic> &lt; 1 indicates relative depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharp et al., 2019</xref>). DHA shows significant enrichment in the lipids surrounding ELIC (B = 2.43 ± 0.16,± SEM, n = 4), while PA shows a relative depletion (B = 0.51 ± 0.02,± SEM, n = 4). To identify localized density that would indicate specific binding, we calculated the two-dimensional radial enhancement for each fatty acid species with ELIC centered at the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

It is immediately apparent that DHA shows several localized areas of high enrichment indicating specific sites of binding to ELIC, whereas PA shows areas of minimal enrichment that are more diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Binding of DHA is observed mainly in two intrasubunit grooves located between M3 and M4 or M1 and M4. Moreover, these areas of localized binding are noted mostly in the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top right), suggesting DHA acts through a specific binding site in the outer leaflet of the membrane. These results are consistently demonstrated over multiple simulation replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that in 2:1:1 POPC:POPE:POPG lipid membranes in which ELIC responses were measured, DHA binds to specific intrasubunit sites in the outer leaflet, which PA is not seen to strongly interact with. This supports the notion that DHA inhibits ELIC by binding to specific sites, while PA has low affinity for ELIC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of PA and DHA in ELIC.</title><p>Two-dimensional enrichment plots for the 4 mol% PA (left column) and 4 mol% DHA (right column) simulation conditions are shown for fatty acid species within 70 Å of the ELIC pore.

Since the alkyl tail of pacFA, where the photo-reactive diazirine is located, is expected to interact with the hydrophobic regions of the ELIC TMD, one might expect that pacFA will not photolabel ELIC as there are no strong nucleophiles in the TMD facing the hydrophobic core of the membrane. In contrast to an aliphatic diazirine, a trifluoromethylphenyl-diazirine (TPD) shows less selectivity between amino acid side chains and offers favorable photochemistry for photolabeling studies with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budelier et al., 2017b</xref>). Thus, we synthesized a fatty acid analogue photolabeling reagent, KK-242, which contains an ether-linked TPD group in the fatty acid alkyl tail and approximates the molecular dimensions of PA (~20 Å in length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Intact protein MS of ELIC photolabeled with 100 μM KK-242 showed two additional peaks corresponding to the mass of an ELIC subunit with one and two KK-242 labels (labeling efficiency ~15%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The maximal efficacy of KK-242 could not be determined confidently because higher concentrations were insoluble in the aqueous solutions used for patch-clamp measurements. However, these results suggest that the efficacy of KK-242 is slightly higher than PA and lower than DHA. KK-242 also modestly decreased relative steady state current and the time constant of current decay, although these differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

No photolabeled peptides were identified in the extracellular domain, M1 or M2.</p><p>The labeling efficiencies of ELIC subunits at 100 μM KK-242 with and without 30 mM cysteamine were indistinguishable by intact protein MS (~15%). Labeling efficiencies of M4 and M3 were also measured from the middle-down MS data. This was defined as the ratio of MS intensities of the labeled peptide to the sum of labeled and unlabeled peptides. MS intensities depend on peptide abundance and ionization efficiency. Since the ionization efficiency may differ between unlabeled and labeled peptides, we call these measured values apparent labeling efficiencies. KK-242 apparent labeling efficiencies of M4 and M3 with and without cysteamine, and the corresponding fragmentation spectra were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, we focused on the fragmentation spectra of photolabeled ELIC in the presence of cysteamine. Manual analysis of the MS2 spectra of both photolabeled peptides revealed fragment ions containing the KK-242 mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). For the M3 peptide, three <italic>b</italic> ions localize the photolabeled residue to Q264 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For the M4 peptide, a series of <italic>b</italic> and <italic>y</italic> ions indicate two photolabeled residues: C313 and R318 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In both peptides, the same fragment ions with and without the KK-242 mass are frequently present most likely representing partial neutral loss of KK-242. While the possibility of 100% neutral loss raises some uncertainty about the residues that are photolabeled, the spectra are most consistent with photolabeling of Q264 in M3, and C313 and R318 in M4. Q264 is in M3 on one side of M4, while C313 is facing the other side of M4 adjacent to M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Most structures of ELIC do not resolve R318 at the C-terminal end of M4; however, a recent cryo-EM structure of ELIC shows this residue facing M3 adjacent to Q264 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). To test the plausibility that KK-242 can photolabel these residues, we docked KK-242 in two volumes that encompass the photolabeled residues and the outer interfacial region of the ELIC TMD. The docked poses were examined after clustering at 5 Å RMSD. While many distinct binding poses were obtained (KK-242 has 13 rotatable bonds), only a single cluster from each site show poses where the diazirine is closest to the photolabeled residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). When this is the case, the carboxylate group of KK-242 is approximately at the interfacial region of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Other clusters were obtained at each site showing poses that are less plausible for a fatty acid analogue in a lipid bilayer or detergent micelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref> and B). Thus, KK-242 photolabels two distinct sites, and the photolabeled residues and docking results suggest that these sites are on either side of the outer portion of M4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These sites are analogous to the sites identified in the GLIC crystal structure where a phospholipid was bound to the side of M4 facing M1 and DHA was bound to the side of M4 facing M3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>KK-242 photolabels two DHA binding sites in the outer TMD of ELIC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left:</italic> Fragmentation spectrum (MS2) of a M3 peptide photolabeled with KK-242 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

A decrease in apparent labeling efficiency of M4 in the presence of DHA or PA would suggest that these fatty acids are competing for KK-242 at the photolabeled sites. While DHA caused a dose-dependent reduction in KK-242 apparent labeling efficiency of M4, PA caused a small, statistically insignificant reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result indicates that DHA binds to KK-242 photolabeled sites with higher affinity than PA and is consistent with the inhibitory effects of DHA and PA on ELIC and the CGMD results. While we do not know the relative contribution of each site to M4 photolabeling, the large decrease in M4 apparent labeling efficiency in the presence of DHA (~90% with 30 μM DHA) suggests that both photolabeled sites are occupied by DHA. Consistent with the specificity of these binding sites for DHA over PA, the potency of DHA inhibition of ELIC peak responses by giant liposome patch-clamping was not altered in the presence of 2 μM PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>DHA inhibits ELIC peak responses but has minimal effect on the EC<sub>50</sub> of cysteamine activation; this suggests that DHA inhibits ELIC by stabilizing an agonist-bound non-conducting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>; see Discussion). To test this possibility, we examined the effect of DHA on KK-242 apparent labeling efficiency of M4 in the absence of cysteamine. Indeed, DHA did not reduce KK-242 apparent labeling efficiency in the absence of cysteamine, in stark contrast to its effect in the presence of cysteamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, DHA preferentially binds to KK-242 photolabeled sites when ELIC is in the agonist-bound state. It is worth noting that the apparent labeling efficiency of 10 μM KK-242 in the presence of cysteamine was only modestly higher than in the absence of cysteamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Possible reasons for this include: (1) KK-242, being a weak inhibitor of ELIC, does not show the same state-dependence of binding as DHA, (2) the irreversible nature of photolabeling precludes detection of state-dependent photolabeling, and (3) apparent labeling efficiencies vary significantly between experiments due to factors mentioned above related to the LC-MS/MS. Nevertheless, the results clearly demonstrate that DHA preferentially binds to the photolabeled sites in an agonist-bound state.</p><p>Having identified two DHA binding sites on each face of M4 by photolabeling, we compared these results to the CGMD simulation data. We measured the contact probability of DHA with each amino acid in ELIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), to determine if DHA preferentially interacts with M1 or M3. While DHA has a non-zero contact probability with all lipid-facing transmembrane helices (i.e. M1, M3, and M4), residues on M3 have the highest cumulative contact probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the residues with the highest contact probability between DHA and ELIC (A268, G271, and A275) are located on a single face of M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), namely the face oriented toward M4, suggesting a specific DHA binding site in the groove between M3 and M4. R117 and Q264 (Q264 is photolabeled by KK-242) are located on the same face of M3 and interact with DHA, especially the carboxylate headgroup throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The remaining residues on the binding face of M3 (A268, G271, S272, and A275) interact extensively with the polyunsaturated tail. These results reinforce the photolabeling data and identify the M3-M4 intrasubunit groove as a specific binding site for DHA. While M3 is noted to have the highest averaged contact probability (7.8% in M3 vs 5.3% in M1 and 4.7% in M4), a lower, but non-trivial, amount of contact is noted between DHA and M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with KK-242 photolabeling of C313.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Favorable DHA binding sites from coarse-grained molecular dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An ELIC monomer is colored according to contact probabilities.

The density threshold affinity ΔG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharp and Brannigan, 2021</xref>) represents the relative free-energy difference between a lipid species in the bulk membrane and in a specified, well-defined region near the protein, and is calculated using density ratios. Here, we define four sites per subunit, the ‘M1 site’ (dashed sectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in each of the two leaflets, and the ‘M3 site’ (solid sectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in each of the two leaflets. The site boundaries are inspired by the 2D density distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, have fivefold symmetry, and encompass non-overlapping regions around each respective helix. The calculated values of ΔG for PA and DHA for each of the four sites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Consistent with radial enrichment results described earlier, DHA has higher affinity across all sites compared to PA. Indeed, PA has unfavorable interaction with all sites measured, having the lowest affinity for the outer leaflet M3 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Comparing affinity of DHA between different sites, there is a clear preference for outer leaflet sites versus inner leaflet sites, with both outer leaflet sites having favorable energy change and both inner leaflet sites having unfavorable energy change. This is consistent with the radial enhancement data and the fact that KK-242 was not observed to label inner leaflet sites. Although not statistically significant, there is slightly higher affinity of DHA for the outer membrane M3 site than the outer membrane M1 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) in agreement with the contact probability analysis. Overall, the results from these analyses support the notion that DHA binds to outer leaflet intrasubunit sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DHA inhibits ELIC through one high-affinity site</title><p>To investigate the functional significance of the M1 and M3 DHA binding sites, we modified each site with hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate (hMTS); the hexadecyl group is identical to a PA alkyl tail. Although it does not mimic the polyunsaturated tail of DHA, we reasoned that covalent attachment of a hexadecyl group to these sites may produce an inhibitory effect, since PA is a weak inhibitor of ELIC. Based on the photolabeling, docking and CGMD results, we also reasoned that the fatty acid headgroup is near R117 and R123 when occupying either binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Thus, we modified these positions with hMTS to mimic binding of a fatty acid. On a cysteine-less background (C300S/C313S mutant), we introduced R117C and R123C mutations. These triple mutants produced stable purified protein, and were incubated with 100 μM hMTS for 1 hr and analyzed by intact protein MS. Both mutants were completely modified by one hMTS per subunit consistent with specific modification of the introduced cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We previously showed that a cluster of three arginines in the inner interfacial region (R286, R299, R301) of the ELIC TMD form charged interactions with anionic phospholipids, which influence channel agonist responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we also generated cysteine mutations of these arginines; interestingly, these mutants were not modified by hMTS indicating decreased accessibility at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This finding is consistent with CGMD results showing reduced binding of DHA and PA in the inner leaflet compared to the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). Moreover, analysis of the diacylated lipids species in the CGMD system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) shows that POPG has a favorable affinity for this site, suggesting that higher occupancy of this site by POPG leads to the relative exclusion of fatty acids or hMTS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>hMTS modification of R117C/C300S/C313S inhibits ELIC agonist response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Top left:</italic> Structure of ELIC showing photolabeled residues (Q264 and C313), and arginines at the outer (R117, R123) and inner (R286, R299, R301) interfacial regions of the TMD. <italic>Right:</italic> Deconvoluted intact protein mass spectra of the indicated arginine to cysteine mutants on a C300S/C313S background.

While this approach worked for R123C-M, R117C-M in DDM was partially aggregated by SEC. To enable liposome reconstitution of R117C-M, we first equilibrated unmodified R117C/C300S/C313S with DDM-destabilized liposomes, and then modified with hMTS such that R117C-M was maintained in a lipid environment (see Experimental Procedures).

To further verify that hMTS modification of R117C inhibits channel responses, we performed recordings from R117C-M proteoliposomes incubated in 2 mM DTT, which may remove the disulfide-mediated hMTS modification.

The striking agreement between photolabeling and simulation results provides a compelling molecular description of the selectivity of fatty acid interactions with a pLGIC. Along with site-directed hMTS modification to interrogate the functional significance of these sites, the results strongly suggest that DHA inhibits ELIC through a single site, an intrasubunit groove between the top of M3 and M4. This site is analogous to the DHA binding site in a GLIC crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2017</xref>). That this fatty acid binding site is present in both ELIC and GLIC suggests that it may also be conserved in eukaryotic pLGICs. Indeed, the equivalent site in the β3 subunit of the α1β3 GABA<sub>A</sub>R was found to be a neurosteroid binding site that mediates neurosteroid inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub>R responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sugasawa et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, this site may be a conserved lipid binding site by which fatty acids and neurosteroids inhibit pLGICs.</p><p>Compared to the GLIC crystal structure, our photolabeling and CGMD results provide additional and contrasting information on DHA binding at the M3/M4 site. We illustrate this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> by aligning the GLIC-DHA crystal structure with the color-coded DHA contact probabilities in ELIC from the CGMD results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. In the GLIC structure, the DHA carboxylate headgroup interacts with R118 in the β6-β7 loop, but the polyunsaturated tail is not interacting significantly with the TMD and is mostly unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, we find that the polyunsaturated tail of DHA, more so than the headgroup, strongly interacts with the M3/M4 groove of ELIC making high probability contacts with small hydrophobic residues such as A268 and G271 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, DHA binds to this site with much higher affinity than PA. Since both DHA and PA have an anionic carboxylate headgroup, this indicates that the polyunsaturated tail is the primary determinant of DHA binding affinity. Consistent with the nature of DHA binding to the M3/M4 site, we find that:(1) DHA methyl ester inhibits ELIC with similar potency and efficacy as DHA, and(2) DHA inhibits R117C/C300S/C314S and C300S/C314S similarly. Thus, a charged interaction between the carboxylate headgroup of DHA and R117 (equivalent to R118 in GLIC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) is not critical for DHA binding and effect in ELIC. Both DHA and DHA methyl ester modulate hippocampal excitability through the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taha et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that this mechanism of PUFA inhibition is conserved in mammalian pLGICs. The discrepancy between our findings and the GLIC structure may be a consequence of different methodologies or a difference in DHA interactions between ELIC and GLIC.</p><p>DHA binding to KK-242 photolabeled sites was specific for the agonist-bound state. This result supports a direct binding mechanism in which DHA allosterically inhibits ELIC responses by binding to and stabilizing an agonist-bound non-conducting state. Our patch-clamp data show that fatty acids inhibit ELIC peak responses when applied prior to agonist similar to previous reports in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R and nAchR. This is in contrast to the effect of DHA described in GLIC, in which DHA was co-applied with agonist resulting in no change in peak responses but faster and greater current decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2017</xref>). This apparent increase in the rate and extent of current decay was interpreted as fatty acid stabilization of a desensitized state. However, a different hypothesis was recently proposed by Gielen and Corringer for understanding the(1) increase in desensitization rate with fatty acid co-application and(2) decrease in peak response with fatty acid pre-application; both of these findings can be predicted by a model in which a pre-active state is stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>). Our results with ELIC show that pre-application of DHA not only inhibits peak current, but also results in faster and more profound current decay. We have repeated the simulations performed by Gielen and Corringer using the same gating model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>), and found that the qualitative effects of fatty acid inhibition observed in ELIC (i.e. both a decrease in peak current and increase in the rate/extent of current decay with fatty acid pre-application) can be produced by stabilizing either a pre-active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) or desensitized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). The model predicts that stabilization of a pre-active or desensitized state, to the extent that peak responses are completed inhibited, will lead to most channels occupying these respective states at steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Thus, more structures of pLGICs with fatty acids in the presence of agonist may reveal whether fatty acids stabilize pre-active or desensitized conformations of the channel.</p><p>By introducing a hexadecyl group to fatty acid binding sites using hMTS, we sought to mimic occupancy of these sites by PA. Alkyl-MTS modification has been previously used to examine the effects of phospholipids at specific sites in inward rectifying potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enkvetchakul et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we combined hMTS modification with intact protein MS to measure modification efficiency. This proved useful in showing that hMTS has limited access to a cluster of arginine residues in the inner TMD of ELIC, shown previously to be a binding site for the anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hénault et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sridhar et al., 2021</xref>). Since ELIC in DDM co-purifies with PG from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tong et al., 2019</xref>), it is plausible that hMTS cannot access these sites due to the presence of tightly bound PG. KK-242 may have not photolabeled sites in the inner TMD for the same reason. Indeed, the coarse-grained simulations with membranes containing 25% POPG showed significant reduction in the binding of DHA to the inner TMD of ELIC due to enrichment of POPG at this site. It is interesting to note that fatty acids are thought to modulate Kv channels by interacting with positively charged residues also in the extracellular side of the voltage-sensor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farag et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, fatty acids may be excluded from sites in the inner TMD of many ion channels due to the presence of anionic phospholipids, which are localized in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane and bind with relatively high affinity to sites in the inner TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, lipids in the outer leaflet may compete for binding of fatty acids to the M3/M4 groove. Indeed, a recent structure of ELIC in SMA nanodiscs extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes showed cardiolipin bound to approximately this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). In another study, MD simulations suggest that zwitterionic phospholipids such as PC occupy this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sridhar et al., 2021</xref>). It is plausible that cardiolipin, or other lipids in mammalian pLGICs, could compete for DHA binding to this site and alter the potency of DHA inhibition.</p><p>The strong inhibitory effect of alkylation of R117C is similar to the maximal effect of DHA or DHA methyl ester, but different from PA which has a much weaker effect. A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that PA has lower occupancy of this site compared to DHA or a covalently attached hMTS, resulting in a lower apparent efficacy. Indeed, PA was much less effective in reducing KK-242 photolabeling compared to DHA and was depleted around ELIC in the coarse-grained simulations. Thus, the difference in inhibition between DHA and PA appears to be entirely related to different binding affinities for this site. If a hexadecyl group resembling PA is covalently introduced to this site (i.e. 100% occupancy of this site), it appears as effective as DHA at inhibiting ELIC responses.</p><p>If hMTS modification of R117C occupies a DHA binding site, it may occlude the inhibitory effect of DHA; this was not the case with R117C-M. Since the small currents observed in R117C-M (~10% of control) remained sensitive to DHA, it is possible that these currents arise from ~10% of R117C/C300S/C313S that was not modified. This unmodified protein may have been missed by intact protein MS due to the high noise in the spectrum. We also cannot exclude the possibilities that: (1) DHA can still partially displace a covalently attached hMTS from this site, or (2) DHA also acts through an entirely different mechanism. Regardless of what accounts for these small DHA-sensitive currents, the strong inhibitory effect of R117C-M and the reversal of this effect by DTT support the hypothesis that this site mediates fatty acid inhibition of ELIC.</p><p>The photolabeling results with ELIC indicate that KK-242 is a useful fatty acid analogue photolabeling reagent. KK-242, which features a TPD, is advantageous compared to pacFA, which features an aliphatic diazirine, for the identification of fatty acid binding proteins and binding sites. This is likely because the TPD can label any amino acid including aliphatic and aromatic side chains, which usually line the binding pockets of fatty acid alkyl tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simard et al., 2005</xref>). This limitation of pacFA (i.e. preferential labeling of nucleophilic residues by aliphatic diazirines) likely applies to other lipid analogue photolabeling reagents that feature an aliphatic diazirine in the hydrophobic regions of the molecule (e.g. PhotoClick-Cholesterol, pacFA ceramide) potentially reducing the utility of these reagents for identifying lipid binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haberkant et al., 2013</xref>;

Briefly, this analysis determines the relative free-energy difference for a lipid species between the bulk membrane and a particular binding site by comparing the probability distribution of finding <italic>n</italic> coarse-grained fatty acid beads in the binding site, <italic>P<sub>site</sub>(n</italic>), versus the same probability distribution for bulk membrane, <italic>P<sub>bulk</sub>(n</italic>). In this study, we defined two new binding sites, termed ‘M1’ and ‘M3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). For the M1 site, one angular boundary was determined to be the M4 helix and the other angular boundary to be midway between the M1 helix of the same subunit and the M3 helix of the adjacent subunit. For the M3 site, one angular boundary was determined to be the M4 helix and the other angular boundary to be midway between the M3 helix of the same subunit and the M1 helix of the adjacent subunit. The radial boundaries for both sites were 10&lt; <italic>r</italic> &lt; 40 Å. <italic>P<sub>site</sub>(n</italic>) was determined by counting the number of coarse-grained fatty acid beads within the boundaries of each binding site described above (i.e. M1 and M3) for each frame and normalizing to the number of frames in the simulation. As <italic>P<sub>bulk</sub>(n</italic>) needs to be corrected for the area of <italic>P<sub>site</sub>(n</italic>), a separate simulation was conducted to determine the area of the M1 and M3 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharp and Brannigan, 2021</xref>). Exploiting the relationship that <italic>P<sub>site</sub>(n</italic>) is given for each individual CGMD simulation run underneath the two-dimension = <italic>P<sub>bulk</sub>(n</italic>) in a unitary membrane, a coarse-grained system containing ELIC (PDB 6V03) in a POPC membrane was simulated under the same conditions described above for 10 μs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Macroscopic current simulations with Channelab</title><p>Simulations of current responses were performed using Channelab utilizing a pLGIC gating model as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Marcel P Goldschen-Ohm as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pierre-Jean Corringer (Reviewer #2); Michaela Jansen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For all plots with mean +/- SEM including dose-response relations and bar plots, please show all of the individual data points. Also report all statistical tests used in the figure legends.</p><p>2) Regarding KK-242, similar chemistry and compounds have been described previously (for review see Chemical Reviews 2013 113 (10), 7880-7929). It should be clarified whether the compound described herein is a new chemical entity or whether it has been generated previously (Beilstein search?).</p><p>3) Given that ultimately the authors suggest that the DHA site in ELIC is similar to that in GLIC, a figure that compares the observed binding site in the GLIC structural model and the proposed binding site(s) in ELIC would be very helpful to orient readers.</p><p>4) The observation that DHA inhibition depends on agonist site occupancy is very interesting. However, please address the following concerns regarding this data: i) At the concentrations used the authors are looking for a reduction in a signal that is already only ~1%. If these concentrations were necessary to observe the effect, please comment on why that is. ii) It is not clear that there is any reason to normalize the data shown in Figure 4C to the 0 PUFA conditions (in any event, it is not clear how they were normalized as the data don't seem to be from paired experiments). Unless there is a compelling reason otherwise, the data in Figure 4C should be plotted as raw labeling efficiencies (no normalization) and all data points in the absence of PUFA should be shown. iii) Given the variation in labeling efficiency reported in Figure 4-S3, n=3 data points is on the low side. If feasible, another couple of data points would likely help greatly to solidify this dataset, although we appreciate that these may be difficult experiments. iv) How were the data in Figure 4C analyzed? ANOVA?</p><p>5) The suggestion of two possible docking sites based on observed photolabeling at Q264 in M3 and C313 in M4 seems entirely dependent on the choice of docked conformations. However, it is not clear how representative the docked poses shown in Figure 4A and B are to the collection of docked poses obtained. Do the vast majority of docked poses cluster tightly around these two poses, or not? A figure illustrating this would be very useful. Also, it is difficult to judge how close the two docked orientations are as they are presented in separate images with different viewpoints. A single image showing both proposed sites on either side of M4 would be very helpful for visualizing what is being proposed in a larger context (e.g. something along the lines of how DHA and PLC are shown in Basak et al. Figure 3A).</p><p>6) Were peak responses of R117C-M before and after DTT incubation obtained from the same liposomes? If not, there is no control for expression, and controls to see whether DTT itself increases peak responses in control or in R123C-M are needed.</p><p>7) The logic by which the authors conclude that DHA modulates via a single site needs to be spelled out much more clearly. Presumably, because R117C-M has a PUFA like effect, this must be the site? But then why does DHA still modulate R117C-M to a similar extend as control and all other mutants? Also, why would the R118A substitution abolish DHA modification but not the methylester? Both remove essentially a single charge in this interacting pair that seems to be in salt bridge distance?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use photolabeling in combination with mass spectrometry to identify a binding site for the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) DHA in the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC. The identified site is similar to a structure of DHA bound to the homolog GLIC. Most strikingly, the authors show that DHA binding in ELIC is dependent on the agonist-bound state of the channel, which is an important observation that informs on molecular motions in the transmembrane domains in response to agonist binding. However, the data for the state-dependence of DHA binding, although suggestive, could benefit from either a clearer presentation or some additional investigation.</p><p>The authors use a powerful combination of photolabeling and MS to probe polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) binding site locations in the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) ELIC.

Most strikingly, the authors provide evidence that DHA binding depends on the occupancy of the agonist site, which is an important observation that informs on molecular motions in the transmembrane domains in response to agonist binding. For me, this was the most interesting aspect of the paper. However, I also have some concerns about the evidence that is provided for this which need addressing (see below).</p><p>1. For all plots with mean +/- SEM including dose-response relations and bar plots, please show all of the individual data points. Also report all statistical tests used in the figure legends.</p><p>2. Given that ultimately the authors suggest that the DHA site in ELIC is similar to that in GLIC, a figure that shows this is a glaring omission. Please show a figure that compares the observed binding site in the GLIC structural model and the proposed binding site(s) in ELIC for comparison. In GLIC, DHA appears to not really extend much into the transmembrane domain. Thus, the similarity to KK-242 whose tail does extend down between M4 and M3 is not completely clear. This should be discussed.</p><p>3. The most striking advance for me is the observation that DHA binding depends on occupancy of the agonist site. Although the data presented for this are suggestive, I have some concerns:</p><p>i) Why was 10uM KK-242 used for DHA competition experiments? At this low concentration the labeling efficiency is really low to begin with. I am concerned about the reliability of measuring a reduction of a signal that is already only 1-2%, and that furthermore displays a fairly large range of deviation (Figure 4-S3). Does a higher K-242 concentration outcompete DHA?</p><p>ii) Perhaps I am misunderstanding the experiment, but I don't understand why the data in Figure 4C are normalized. I think they should simply be plotted as the observed labeling efficiencies in each condition and all data points in the absence of PUFA need to be shown. After the MS it's not like you can take that same sample and test it on another PUFA condition.</p><p>iii) Given the variation in labeling efficiency reported in Figure 4-S3, I am not completely convinced that 10uM DHA has much effect on labeling. Even though the effect at 30uM DHA looks fairly clear, I am still a bit concerned about having only three data points given such variability and low initial signals. I suggest obtaining at least another couple of data points as this is a crucial experiment regarding the state-dependent action of DHA.</p><p>iv) What is the statistical test indicated in Figure 4C? Probably should be ANOVA with some posthoc test.</p><p>4. The suggestion of two possible docking sites based on observed photolabeling at Q264 in M3 and C313 in M4 seems entirely dependent on the choice of docked conformations. However, it is not clear how representative the docked poses shown in Figure 4A and B are to the collection of docked poses obtained. Do the vast majority of docked poses cluster tightly around these two poses, or not? A figure illustrating this would be useful. In GLIC, DHA falls between two arginines that are similarly oriented to R117 and R123, so how unlikely is such an orientation in ELIC? Also, it is difficult to judge how close the two docked orientations are as they are presented in separate images with different viewpoints. A single image showing both proposed sites on either side of M4 would be very helpful for visualizing what is being proposed in a larger context (e.g. something along the lines of how DHA and PLC are shown in Basak et al. Figure 3A). Along these same lines, it is unclear to me that the photolabeling is not consistent with some flexibility in the tail position at a single site given that the photolabeled positions are quite close. If the photolabeling is truly strong evidence for two distinct sites, this needs to be explained further. Otherwise, I suggest presenting the data as consistent with two possible sites on either side of M4 analogous to DHA and PLC as observed in GLIC rather than direct evidence for two sites.</p><p>5. The logic of the final Results section on hMTS was a bit hard for me to follow. Firstly, hMTS mimics the PA tail (line 449), but PA does not bind here specifically? Second, no differences in peak current were observed between control and unmodified or modified cysteine mutants as assayed by ANOVA. Although I do agree that modification of R117C-M does seem like it exhibits smaller peak currents, I am a bit shaky on the idea of falling back to t-Test when ANOVA does not indicate a difference. More importantly, were peak responses of R117C-M before and after DTT incubation obtained from the same liposomes? If not, there is no control for expression, and DTT itself was not checked to see if it increases peak responses in control or in R123C-M. Thus, the evidence that hMTS inhibits ELIC currents analogous to a PUFA, although suggestive, is lacking controls. Regardless, the logic that DHA modulates via a single site is not spelled out sufficiently for me. Presumably, because R117C-M has a PUFA like effect, this must be the site? But then why does DHA still modulate R117C-M to a similar extend as control and all other mutants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very compelling study identifying a fatty acid binding site mediating allosteric inhibition of ELIC. The study implements several complementary techniques that are all relevant to the demonstration:</p><p>1. Purification of ELIC and reconstitution in giant liposomes for excised patch voltage-clamp, showing that DHA inhibits ELIC channel function.</p><p>2. Design and synthesis of a new photolabeling reagent, KK-242, with optimal photochemistry with a structure resembling a fatty acid. Middle-down mass spectrometry show that KK-242 photolabels two distinct sites on both sides of the outer portion of M4, one at the interface with M3 (M3Q264 and M4R318), and one at the interface with M1 (M4C313). Importantly, KK-242 labelling is inhibited by DHA in a dose-dependent manner and only in the presence of the agonist. Thus, DHA preferentially binds to both KK-242 photolabeled sites when ELIC is in the agonist-bound state.</p><p>3. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, authors determine two fatty acid binding sites in the outer TMD of ELIC that are specific for DHA over PA when agonist is bound to the channel, and that are overlapping with the one identified by photolabelling.</p><p>4. To investigate the functional significance of the M1 and M3 DHA binding sites, each site was covalently modified with hexadecyl-methanethiosulfonate (hMTS), mimicking the binding of a fatty acid, using the accessible arginines above the M1M4 and M3M4 groves. Electrophysiological analysis of ELIC cysteine mutants clearly show that the M3M4 site specifically mediates inhibition.</p><p>Overall, the study is carefully designed and conducted, very clearly presented and discussed, and the demonstration complete. It is a beautiful piece of work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Dietzen et al. investigated the interaction site/s and mechanism of the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with the prokaryotic pentameric ion channel ELIC using a novel fatty acid photolabeling reagent with broad amino acid reactivity coupled with mass spectrometry, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) calculations, as well as covalent modification using a methane thiosulfonate (MTS) reagent with a lipid-like tail of engineered Cys at identified sites. The results are further probed using a DHA methylester derivative (DHA-ME), using competition photolabeling with palmitic acid (PA), and current simulations based on a previously published gating model.</p><p>The authors show that DHA or DHA-ME preapplication for 3 minutes reduces the peak current obtained with the agonist cysteamine. The cysteamine EC50 is unaltered. PA has a significant but much smaller effect. CGMD was used to calculate lipid diffusion, and identified localized areas of high enrichment for DHA in two intrasubunit groves between M4 and M1 or M3, respectively, mostly in the outer membrane leaflet. The distribution of PA was also calculated with the same method and found to be more diffuse, indicating that PA's functional effect is associated with unspecific rather than specific interactions.</p><p>In the next set of experiments the goal was to use photoaffinity labeling with suitable fatty acids and subsequent mass spectrometric identification to characterize PUFA binding sites. Initially, a commercially available bifunctional photoreactive reagent (pacFA) with an aliphatic diazirine was used. The authors find that PacFA did not label ELIC, likely because the hydrophobic transmembrane environment does not contain nucleophilic amino acid sidechains like glutamate or aspartate that are reactive towards the aliphatic diazirine. The authors subsequently design and synthesize the novel trifluoromethylphenyl diazirine compound, KK-242, that is expected to be more broadly reactive towards different amino acid side chains. KK-242 has a similar alkyl chain length compared to PA. In photolabeling experiments with KK-242 this compound labeled a single position in M3 (Q264), and two positions in M4 (C313 and R318). Docked in chemically meaningful poses KK-242 seems to bind to two distinct sites on either side of the outer portion of M4. The KK-242 carboxylate reaches to R117 when docked to Q264, and to R123 when docked to C313.</p><p>Previously, a co-crystal structure of GLIC with DHA was published (Basak et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017). Both GLIC and ELIC contain an Arg at the position corresponding to ELIC-R117. GLIC contains an additional Arg, R118, whereas ELIC contains an Arg at position 123, R123. Interestingly, the GLIC structure had the DHA carboxylate in close proximity to R118. The prior GLIC study showed that a R118A mutation is not inhibited by DHA, indicating that the R118, and consequently potentially a salt bridge between the DHA carboxylate and the R118 positive charge was required for DHA inhibition. On the contrary, the present study indicates that the methyl ester of DHA, DHA-ME, is able to inhibit ELIC. In this case, there would be no salt bridge between DHA-ME and Arg. The photolabeling was further interrogated with competition experiments with DHA and PA. These showed that photolabeling efficiency by KK-242 was dose dependently reduced for the M4 site with DHA but only insignificantly reduced with PA. CGMD simulation data confirms specific binding at M3/M4 intrasubunit grove for DHA, same site as R117, Q264. Additional binding with the M1/C313 is also identified. In summary, the photolabeling results are supported by the CGMD simulations.</p><p>In a separate set of experiments, in a Cys-less background R117C and R123C were modified with a MTS reagent with a lipid-like tail for investigation of the functional significance of sites. R117C modification with MTS reagent inhibited peak currents and the effect was reversed with reducing agent application (dithiothreitol, DTT) which will remove the covalently linked disulfide introduced by the MTS reagent. There was no effect of the covalent modification of R123C with the same reagent. Mass spectrometry for both positions indicated that both R117C and R123C were indeed modified at a comparable high level. This leads to the conclusion that while both positions are modified, only the R117C modification has a functional impact that can be observed with the electrophysiological experiments described here.</p><p>The authors further show that photolabeling was specific for the agonist bound state.</p><p>Simulations previously published by others and the present study also indicate that fatty acids in the presence of agonist may stabilize a pre-active or desensitized state of the channel.</p><p>In summary, the present study uses complementary approaches that identify two binding sites for the PUFA DHA within the extracellular leaflet on either side of the M4 transmembrane segment, with only a single site per subunit being responsible for the inhibitory effect.</p><p>Overall, the results recapitulate what has been described and published in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2017 with regard to DHA modulation of the closely related pentameric channel homologue GLIC using X-ray co crystallography, EPR and electrophysiology. The present paper uses a different set of approaches that are elegantly complementary to one another and overall corroborate the same findings. Of note, the GLIC co-crystal structure did show two lipid binding sites as well, one was occupied by DHA, the other by &quot;PLC&quot;, a lipid carried with the purification. The newly-synthesized compound KK-242 is a promising tool likely attractive for the study of additional transmembrane proteins that are modulated by PUFAs.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Similar chemistry and compounds have been described previously (for review see Chemical Reviews 2013 113 (10), 7880-7929), it should be clarified whether the compound described herein is a new chemical entity or whether it has been generated previously (Beilstein search?).</p><p>Statistics: the detailed results should be provided.</p><p>Why would the R118A substitution abolish DHA modification but not the methylester?

Also report all statistical tests used in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given that ultimately the authors suggest that the DHA site in ELIC is similar to that in GLIC, a figure that shows this is a glaring omission. Please show a figure that compares the observed binding site in the GLIC structural model and the proposed binding site(s) in ELIC for comparison. In GLIC, DHA appears to not really extend much into the transmembrane domain. Thus, the similarity to KK-242 whose tail does extend down between M4 and M3 is not completely clear. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not adequately discuss the similarities and differences between our assessment of DHA binding in the M3/M4 site and the GLIC structure. We have added Figure 6—figure supplement 3 to provide a comparison of the M3/M4 DHA binding site in ELIC and the GLIC structure complexed with DHA. Our assessment of DHA binding in ELIC is coarse-grained and the simulations do not provide just a single binding mode. Therefore, to achieve the most accurate comparison between our results and the GLIC structure, we have overlaid the atomic structure of ELIC, color-coded with the highest DHA contact probabilities, with the structure of GLIC complexed with DHA. We also provide a sequence alignment of high contact probability residues in ELIC and the analogous residues in GLIC. As noted by the reviewer, the interaction of DHA in the M3/M4 site in ELIC is similar to the site identified in the crystal structure but not the same. The polyunsaturated tail of DHA in the GLIC structure is not fully resolved and appears to be extending into the membrane. In contrast, our simulations show that the highest contact probabilities are of the polyunsaturated tail interacting with hydrophobic residues such as A268 and G271 in the M3/M4 groove. The reason for this discrepancy with the GLIC crystal structure is unclear. It may be a consequence of the two contrasting methodologies or a real difference in DHA interactions between these two pLGICs. Nevertheless, we argue that the DHA binding site we describe is plausible and functionally relevant because the polyunsaturated tail is critical for DHA binding affinity and efficacy (see discussion below regarding this specific issue). We have added content in the Discussion to emphasize the similarities and differences between the interactions of DHA with ELIC and the GLIC-DHA crystal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The most striking advance for me is the observation that DHA binding depends on occupancy of the agonist site. Although the data presented for this are suggestive, I have some concerns:</p><p>i) Why was 10uM KK-242 used for DHA competition experiments? At this low concentration the labeling efficiency is really low to begin with. I am concerned about the reliability of measuring a reduction of a signal that is already only 1-2%, and that furthermore displays a fairly large range of deviation (Figure 4-S3). Does a higher K-242 concentration outcompete DHA?</p></disp-quote><p>By raising the issue of KK-242 concentration, the reviewer has identified the primary challenge associated with performing competition photolabeling experiments. It is necessary to use a low concentration of photolabeling reagent, typically lower than the concentration of the competitor (unless the competitor has a much higher affinity). This is because photolabeling is an irreversible reaction, and the photolabeling reagent must have a relatively low occupancy of the binding site for a competitor to significantly reduce the labeling efficiency. We have empirically found from our studies with neurosteroids and other lipids that 10uM or less of photolabeling reagent is necessary to observe competition with equivalent or higher concentrations of competitor. This is the rationale for the concentration of KK-242 used.</p><p>Regarding the issue of low labeling efficiency, the mass spectrometer has a large dynamic range (~1E6). Therefore, what matters to achieve an accurate measurement, with sufficient signal to noise, is not the labeling efficiency per se but the absolute signal of labeled and unlabeled peptides. To show the signal that we are obtaining, we have included the source data for Figure 4C (Figure 4- source data 2), which shows the exact MS peptide (MS1) intensities for each replicate from the competition experiments. For the Orbitrap mass spectrometer, signals in the e3 range are approaching the noise threshold of the instrument and may yield inaccurate measurements. Note that the lowest intensities obtained for labeled peptides (replicate 1) in the competition experiment are still in the mid-e4 range well above instrument noise. Also note that the intensities for unlabeled peptides are in the e6-e8 range, thus yielding efficiencies even below 1%. In other studies, we have accurately measured labeling efficiency as low as 0.1% when the signal for the unlabeled peptide is very high.</p><p>Indeed, the labeling efficiencies in Figure 4-S3 display high variability. We have now plotted the un-normalized labeling efficiencies for each replicate of the competition experiments in Figure 4-S5. Note that these labeling efficiencies, which are from three separate replicates, show even greater variability. We will discuss the interpretation of these data and the reason for the variability below, in response to whether the competition data should be normalized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Perhaps I am misunderstanding the experiment, but I don't understand why the data in Figure 4C are normalized. I think they should simply be plotted as the observed labeling efficiencies in each condition and all data points in the absence of PUFA need to be shown. After the MS it's not like you can take that same sample and test it on another PUFA condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 4C should be normalized because these are indeed groups/replicates of samples. Each replicate of samples is analyzed in a single queue by LC-MS/MS. Importantly, a single queue (continuous run of samples) uses the same reverse phase column and electrospray ionization emitter tip. The column and emitter tip are frequently replaced (the emitter tip is replaced after almost each queue), and we have found that differences between columns or emitter tips (which are both made in-house) lead to significant differences in peptide intensities and labeling efficiencies. This may be because the unlabeled and labeled peptides elute at different times in the acetonitrile gradient and the ionization efficiencies vary dramatically at different acetonitrile concentrations with different emitter tips. However, within a single queue of samples (i.e. a single replicate) using the same column and emitter, the data are very consistent. To illustrate this, we plot the unnormalized labeling efficiencies of each of the three replicates from Figure 4C in Figure 4-S5. We have also included the MS peptide intensities in Figure 4- source data 2 for full transparency. While the absolute labeling efficiencies from one replicate to another vary significantly (Figure 4-S5), the relative labeling efficiencies within a single replicate are comparable (Figure 4C). Therefore, we believe the data is best visualized when normalized within a single replicate.</p><p>While we define “labeling efficiency” as the ratio of labeled peptide to total peptide, this value is a specific construct the middle-down MS approach rather than a true labeling efficiency, since we are not obtaining absolute measurements of peptide abundance from the MS data (i.e. MS intensity is a function of peptide abundance and ionization efficiency). Therefore, we do not ascribe significant meaning to absolute labeling efficiency values. Of note, the intact protein MS measurements should provide a more accurate measurement of labeling efficiency at the subunit level, since unlabeled and labeled ELIC intact subunits are expected to have similar ionization efficiencies and the entire sample is sprayed simultaneously through direct injection. To clarify this, we have changed “labeling efficiency” to “apparent labeling efficiency” for the middle-down MS data in the Results section and added content regarding the origin of the variability in apparent labeling efficiencies from one replicate to another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Given the variation in labeling efficiency reported in Figure 4-S3, I am not completely convinced that 10uM DHA has much effect on labeling. Even though the effect at 30uM DHA looks fairly clear, I am still a bit concerned about having only three data points given such variability and low initial signals. I suggest obtaining at least another couple of data points as this is a crucial experiment regarding the state-dependent action of DHA.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering the above discussion about replicates, we have plotted normalized data in Figure 4C to clearly illustrate the effect of DHA on labeling efficiency in the presence of agonist. We cannot perform a one-way ANOVA when the data is normalized. To test for differences between conditions, we analyzed the unnormalized data using a linear mixed effects model (Figure 4- source data 3). By accounting for fixed effects (i.e. adding DHA or PA, and cysteamine) and the random effect of variation between replicates, we find that, when cysteamine is present, the effect of 10 and 30 μm DHA in competitively preventing KK-242 labeling is statistically significant (p = 0.016). The results of this analysis are now shown in Figure 4-S5 and Figure 4- source data 3. With three replicates, this result is robust, and we argue that additional replicates are not necessary. Previous studies using such competition experiments routinely conduct three replicates (Li et al. 2010. JBC. 285(12):8615-8620; Jayakar. 2019. Mol Pharm. 95(6): 615-628). By using two different concentrations of DHA or PA and performing three replicates, the design of our experiment meets the standard within the field for this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) What is the statistical test indicated in Figure 4C? Probably should be ANOVA with some posthoc test.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indicated in the legend for Figure 4 that the data were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. The results for this analysis are shown in Figure 4-S5 and Figure 4- source data 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The suggestion of two possible docking sites based on observed photolabeling at Q264 in M3 and C313 in M4 seems entirely dependent on the choice of docked conformations. However, it is not clear how representative the docked poses shown in Figure 4A and B are to the collection of docked poses obtained. Do the vast majority of docked poses cluster tightly around these two poses, or not? A figure illustrating this would be useful. In GLIC, DHA falls between two arginines that are similarly oriented to R117 and R123, so how unlikely is such an orientation in ELIC? Also, it is difficult to judge how close the two docked orientations are as they are presented in separate images with different viewpoints. A single image showing both proposed sites on either side of M4 would be very helpful for visualizing what is being proposed in a larger context (e.g. something along the lines of how DHA and PLC are shown in Basak et al. Figure 3A). Along these same lines, it is unclear to me that the photolabeling is not consistent with some flexibility in the tail position at a single site given that the photolabeled positions are quite close. If the photolabeling is truly strong evidence for two distinct sites, this needs to be explained further. Otherwise, I suggest presenting the data as consistent with two possible sites on either side of M4 analogous to DHA and PLC as observed in GLIC rather than direct evidence for two sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest that two “sites” are photolabeled based on two findings: (1) labeling of ELIC by KK-242 shows both singly and doubly-labeled subunits as assessed by intact protein mass spectrometer (Figure 3B), and (2) multiple residues in M4 facing either M1 or M3 are labeled. The intact protein MS experiment, which shows ELIC subunits photolabeled with two KK-242, indicates that there are at least two non-overlapping sites that are labeled per subunit. However, we agree that we cannot rule out the possibility that this labeling is occurring from two KK-242 molecules binding to just one side of M4. We have modified the language in the Results section to convey that the data is suggestive of two sites similar to what was observed in GLIC.</p><p>Regarding the docking results, the primary purpose of this work was to demonstrate that it is geometrically plausible that KK-242 label the identified residues via the photoreactive diazirine group, when oriented as expected in the amphipathic environment of the lipid bilayer. Therefore, we intentionally showed just one pose in Figure 4A and 4B to make this point. We rely instead on the coarse-grained MD simulations to examine fatty acid binding sites more rigorously in the context of a lipid bilayer. Molecular docking has limited utility in identifying binding poses for long flexible lipid-like molecules, especially since the lipid bilayer is not considered. Not surprisingly, the docking results yielded multiple distinct poses, some of which are less plausible in a lipid bilayer. To illustrate the diversity of poses obtained, we clustered the docking poses using an RMSD of 5 Å and displayed representative poses from the top 5 most abundant clusters (Figure 4- S4A and S4B). As requested, we have also included a perspective of both putative KK-242 binding poses illustrating the two sites on either side of M4 (Figure 4- S4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The logic of the final Results section on hMTS was a bit hard for me to follow. Firstly, hMTS mimics the PA tail (line 449), but PA does not bind here specifically? Second, no differences in peak current were observed between control and unmodified or modified cysteine mutants as assayed by ANOVA. Although I do agree that modification of R117C-M does seem like it exhibits smaller peak currents, I am a bit shaky on the idea of falling back to t-Test when ANOVA does not indicate a difference. More importantly, were peak responses of R117C-M before and after DTT incubation obtained from the same liposomes? If not, there is no control for expression, and DTT itself was not checked to see if it increases peak responses in control or in R123C-M. Thus, the evidence that hMTS inhibits ELIC currents analogous to a PUFA, although suggestive, is lacking controls. Regardless, the logic that DHA modulates via a single site is not spelled out sufficiently for me. Presumably, because R117C-M has a PUFA like effect, this must be the site? But then why does DHA still modulate R117C-M to a similar extend as control and all other mutants?Before explaining the logic of these experiments, here are a few points of clarification about the results.</p></disp-quote><p>1) Control (C300S/C313S), R117C (C300S/C313S/R117C), R117C-M (C300S/C313S/R117C modified with hMTS), and R123C-M (C300S/C313S/R123C modified with hMTS) data are collected from different liposome preps containing the indicated ELIC proteins. However, the R117C-M and R117C-M DTT data are obtained from the same liposomes- that is, liposomes made with R117C-M. These recordings were performed either in the absence or presence of DTT. Therefore, while we performed an ANOVA analysis to compare all conditions, it is also valid to perform a T-test between these two samples only. Indeed, we believe that this comparison is the most critical one, which demonstrates that the presence of the hexadecyl group significantly inhibits ELIC responses. We have deleted content for T-test analyses of sample pairs other than R117C-M and R117C-M DTT, which we acknowledge are inappropriate.</p><p>2) DHA inhibits R117C-M currents to the same extent as R117C, R123C-M and control. However, as we note in the Discussion, R117C-M currents were very small; on average, &lt;10% of R117C currents. We suggest in the Discussion section that these residual currents may arise from a small amount of unmodified R117C within the R117C-M prep. This small amount of unmodified R117C may have been undetected in the intact protein MS experiment because of the high amount of lipid and other adducts that increase the noise in the intact protein mass spectrum (Figure 6- S1A). The other intact protein MS analyses of hexadecyl-MTS modified proteins were of DDM samples that contained much less lipid and had minimal noise. Other possible explanations for this result are stated in the Discussion. Importantly, the fact that R117C is inhibited by DHA to the same extent as control indicates that R117 is not critical for the affinity or efficacy of DHA (we will compare this result with the GLIC study below, in response to Reviewer #3).</p><p>Considering the above points, the logic of the hMTS experiment is as follows. Since the alkyl tail of DHA is likely the most important determinant of its inhibitory effect, we reasoned that introducing a long aliphatic group at the identified sites may mimic this inhibitory effect. We recognize that a saturated hexadecyl group mimics PA but is not the same as the polyunsaturated tail of DHA. However, we are limited to what is commercially available for MTS reagents. Since PA weakly inhibits ELIC, it is still reasonable to expect that a hexadecyl group at this site will inhibit the channel to some extent. Indeed, modification of R117C but not R123C with hexadecyl-MTS inhibits ELIC responses significantly. Why does the hexadecyl group at residue position 117 inhibit ELIC responses to a greater extent than PA alone? We suggest in the Discussion section that the weak effect of PA is due to its low binding affinity. However, if a PA-like molecule (hexadecyl MTS) is introduced at the inhibitory site with 100% occupancy (i.e. chemical modification), it strongly inhibits channel responses. Overall, the results suggest that occupancy of the M3/M4 groove mediates the inhibitory effect of fatty acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Similar chemistry and compounds have been described previously (for review see Chemical Reviews 2013 113 (10), 7880-7929), it should be clarified whether the compound described herein is a new chemical entity or whether it has been generated previously (Beilstein search?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have searched for this compound in Chemical Abstracts and confirmed that it has not been previously reported.

Both remove essentially a single charge in this interacting pair that seems to be in salt bridge distance?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested an R117C mutant (R117C/C300S/C313S) in ELIC and found that it had no effect on DHA inhibition compared to C300S/C313S (control) or WT (i.e. DHA still inhibits this mutant). In contrast, modification of R117C with hexadecyl-MTS (R117C-M) inhibits channel responses. As discussed above in response to Reviewer #1, we observed very small residual currents in R117C-M that are still sensitive to DHA leading us to tentatively conclude that these come from a small amount of unmodified R117C. See the above response for more details regarding this.</p><p>Irrespective of the R117C-M results, the fact that unmodified R117C is still sensitive to DHA and that DHA methyl ester also inhibits ELIC strongly suggest that a salt bridge interaction between DHA and a basic amino acid is not critical for DHA binding or effect. This is consistent with the CGMD simulations, which show that DHA has a much higher affinity than PA even though both molecules are modeled to have an anionic carboxylate headgroup. This indicates that the polyunsaturated tail is the primary determinant of binding affinity. We have added content in the Discussion to elaborate on this .</p><p>The reviewer may also be referring to the R118A mutation, which was made in GLIC, and shown to reduce the effect of DHA on desensitization (Basak et al. 2017. <italic>eLife</italic>. 6:e23886). Some differences between the GLIC experiment and the present study are: (1) recordings were made by two-electrode voltage clamp in whole oocytes with co-application of DHA with agonist, (2) the effect of DHA was assessed using steady-state current relative to peak, and (3) the arginine was mutated to an alanine instead of a cysteine. With the GLIC experiments, it is possible that a relatively slow solution change in oocytes led to sub-optimal measurements of the effect of DHA on steady-state:peak currents. In addition, co-application of agonist and DHA may differentially affect peak currents in WT versus mutant. In contrast, we monitored the effect of pre-application of DHA on peak currents in excised patches with rapid application of agonist (the primary effect of DHA previously reported in other pLGICs) and find that R117 in ELIC (equivalent to R118 in GLIC) is not important for the inhibitory effect of DHA. In addition to differences in methodology between the GLIC study and the present work, it is also possible that the mechanism of DHA inhibition in GLIC differs from ELIC. However, the characteristics of PUFA inhibition in many pLGICs appears to be generally conserved. We argue against the importance of a salt bridge interaction in mediating PUFA binding and inhibition of pLGICs , although this remains to be tested in pLGICs other than ELIC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
