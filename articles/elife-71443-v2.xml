As key effectors of intracellular calcium signaling, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) can bridge neural activation with the many regulatory processes needed to orchestrate sensory adaptation, including by relaying signals to the nucleus. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling the cell activation-dependent nuclear translocation of CMK-1, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog of mammalian CaMKI/IV, in thermosensory neurons in vivo. We show that an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration elevation is necessary and sufficient to favor CMK-1 nuclear import. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to CMK-1 increases its affinity for IMA-3 importin, causing a redistribution with a relatively slow kinetics, matching the timescale of sensory adaptation. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism enables the encoding of opposite nuclear signals in neuron types with opposite calcium-responses and that it is essential for experience-dependent behavioral plasticity and gene transcription control in vivo. Since CaMKI/IV are conserved regulators of adaptable behaviors, similar mechanisms could exist in other organisms and for other sensory modalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral plasticity</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>thermosensation</kwd><kwd>protein subcellular localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSSGI0_155764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_150681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_197607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nuclear entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-1 in sensory neurons, taking place with a relatively slow kinetics, contributes to couple long-lasting sensory stimulations with signaling in the nucleus over a timescale relevant for sensory history-dependent plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Behavioral adaptation is essential for animal survival in a continuously changing natural environment. Any type of action that animals actuate as protection from external conditions, potentially harmful for their welfare, are part of behavioral adaptation strategies. These defensive behaviors primarily rely on specific sensory neurons, called nociceptors, which detect noxious stimuli and relay the information downstream in the nervous system to direct animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woolf and Ma, 2007</xref>). Not every stimulus is able to activate nociceptive pathways, but only those with an intensity overcoming a certain activation threshold, which is not fixed and can be modulated under different circumstances. The presence of other type of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit and Galina, 1986</xref>), as well as previous, prolonged or repeated exposures to a noxious stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>), is able to shift the threshold up, inducing a desensitization, or down, inducing a sensitization. In humans, the development of some health problems, like chronic pain, can be related to maladaptive sensory plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pace et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold and Gebhart, 2010</xref>). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms implicated in the modulation of sensory plasticity, in particular in nociceptive pathways, could lead to potential therapeutic applications in the long term. Mammalian research models display some limitations, notably with respect to the size of the nervous system, the complexity and heterogeneity in nociceptor neuron populations, and animal suffering-related ethical concerns, which are particularly salient for studies on nociception and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold and Gebhart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</xref>). As a complementary model, the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a powerful and tractable genetic model, which exhibits considerable sensory plasticity. Worms are able to remember many types of environmental stimuli and display remarkable associative learning capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardiel and Rankin, 2010</xref>). Avoidance behaviors, which <italic>C. elegans</italic> executes in response to noxious stimuli, constitute useful paradigms to study nociceptive plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bono and Maricq, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Komuniecki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> engages multiple thermosensory behaviors in order to stay away or escape from noxious heat, when placed in different regions of a spatial thermogradient reaching harmful temperatures (&gt;26°C for the worm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schild and Glauser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glauser, 2013</xref>). When acutely stimulated with heat, worms produce a robust, stereotyped thermal avoidance behavior, consisting in a worm reversal with a short backward movement, followed by a reorientation maneuver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>). This withdrawal behavior relies on two pairs of head primary thermosensory neurons named AFDs and FLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). AFD neuron also plays a major role in controlling thermotaxis in the innocuous temperature range, being both an exquisitely sensitive thermal detector and an essential memory and plasticity locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman and Sengupta, 2018</xref>). Indeed, AFD can detect tiny changes in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramot et al., 2008b</xref>) and produce intracellular calcium transients in response to temperature elevations above a certain threshold, which depends on past thermosensory experience and which is determined by cell-autonomous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>). FLP neurons are thermosensors responding over a broad thermal range, from 8 to 38°C, with a steeper sensitivity in the noxious heat range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saro et al., 2020</xref>). Temperature is encoded in FLP via a tonic signaling mode, with the activity level and steady-state intracellular calcium concentration reflecting the currently experienced temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saro et al., 2020</xref>). The primary FLP thermosensory response to short-lasting heat stimuli seems largely nonadaptable, remaining unaffected by past thermal history. However, many lines of evidence indicate that FLP outputs can be modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saro et al., 2020</xref>), taking part in the experience-dependent plasticity of the nociceptive response. Indeed, upon prolonged or repeated exposure to noxious heat, worms increase their thermal threshold for heat responsiveness through a desensitization, analgesia-like effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lia and Glauser, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In both AFD and FLP, as well as additional sensory neurons, experience-dependent plasticity involves the cell-autonomous activity of the calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase-1 (CMK-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satterlee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moss et al., 2016</xref>). CMK-1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase widely expressed throughout the nervous system. It is the only homologue of the mammalian CaM kinases I and IV (CaMKI and CaMKIV) both functioning as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling effector in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soderling, 1999</xref>). CaM kinases play a role in processes including gene transcription, signal transduction, synaptic development and plasticity, memory and experience-dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satterlee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hook and Means, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wayman et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>). CMK-1 signaling pathway is functionally conserved from nematodes to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eto et al., 1999</xref>). CMK-1 protein topology is also well-conserved. It comprises an extended N-terminal kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain, which includes an autoinhibitory domain that partially overlaps with a CaM binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hook and Means, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, the regulatory domain maintains the catalytic domain in an inactive state. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM causes a conformational change in the protein that releases the autoinhibition. The subcellular localization of CaM kinases is subject to dynamic regulation. Hence, the nuclear localization of δCaMKI, γCaMKI, and some CaMKII isoforms depends on the cell-activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakagami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulman, 2004</xref>). Whereas the mechanisms causing the translocation of CaMKII in a cell-activation dependent manner are well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zalcman et al., 2018</xref>), those controlling CaMKI nuclear translocation and their physiological relevance in vivo are less well understood.</p><p>In FLP, CMK-1 plays a dual role in the heat-avoidance behavior. At innocuous temperatures, CMK-1 is localized principally in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintain a low behavioral response threshold to promote heat avoidance. Within 1 hr of acclimation at 28°C (moderately noxious temperature), CMK-1 progressively translocates into the nucleus, where it produces the opposite effect, raising the noxious heat threshold to reduce avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). In AFD, CMK-1 also changes its subcellular localization upon temperature shifts, during which cultivation temperature memory is reset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The subcellular redistribution of CMK-1 thus appears to have a major role in adjusting neuron outputs according to past sensory experience. However, the molecular mechanisms through which sensory experience controls CMK-1 subcellular localization are largely unknown.</p><p>Here, we show how long-term cell-autonomous calcium activity is integrated to regulate CMK-1 localization in FLP and AFD thermosensory neurons and demonstrate the functional importance of this translocation mechanism in vivo. The proposed mechanism involves the dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CMK-1 via an active transport, based on functional nuclear export sequence (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) and their differential recruitment according to intracellular calcium levels. In particular, high intracellular calcium and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to CMK-1 unmask an NLS localized in the N-terminal lobe of CMK-1 and increase the affinity for IMA-3 importin to favor progressive nuclear accumulation. Interestingly, long-term growth temperature has an opposite impact on CMK-1 localization in FLP as compared to AFD, in which CMK-1 is excluded from the nucleus at high temperatures (25°C). This opposite CMK-1 behavior is linked to an inverted long-term impact of temperature on intracellular calcium concentration in the two neuron types. We furthermore substantiate the physiological relevance of this mechanism in genome-edited lines with altered NLS and NES sequences, showing that they are essential for proper behavioral adaptation and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CMK-1 translocates in the nucleus of FLP upon prolonged exposure to heat</title><p>In order to evaluate how CMK-1 subcellular localization is regulated prior to and during adaptation, we focused on the FLP thermonociceptor neurons, in which a robust change in localization is easily monitored with a CMK-1::mNeonGreen (mNG) protein fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hostettler et al., 2017</xref>).

To test this general working model, we started by addressing the mechanisms that promote the cytosolic accumulation of CMK-1 in FLP at 20°C. Two candidates NES were identified thanks to the NESSential prediction tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>): NES<sup>288-294</sup> and NES<sup>315-323</sup> (superscript indexes indicate the residue positions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We expressed CMK-1 mutant proteins affecting each of these NES candidates and examined the impact on CMK-1 localization in FLP at 20°C. Disrupting the NES<sup>288-294</sup> candidate sequence with a V292A/V294A double mutation or a Δ288–294 deletion prevented the cytoplasmic expression of CMK-1 and even yielded a nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, NES<sup>315-323</sup> candidate mutants displayed a cytoplasmic enrichment similar to that of wild-type CMK-1. These included I315A single mutant, V321A/V323A double mutant, I315A/V321A/V323A triple mutant, as well as Δ318–324 and Δ315–323 mutants, in which the NES candidate region is deleted in part or in full (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the NES<sup>288-294</sup>, but not the NES<sup>314-323</sup>, is a key determinant of CMK-1 cytoplasmic localization in FLP at 20°C.</p><p>Because NES<sup>288-294</sup> sequence matches the binding consensus for exportins, we further tested whether CMK-1 is actively transported out of the nucleus at 20°C in FLP via this canonical pathway.

Introducing mutations in the NLS<sup>297-307</sup> candidate region (K307Q single mutant or a R302S/K307Q double mutant) also produced a partial reduction in CMK-1 nuclear accumulation.

We used <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) gain-of-function mutants in which cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are chronically elevated in FLP due to the expression of a deregulated ryanodine receptor/UNC-68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marques et al., 2019</xref>). In comparison to wild-type, CMK-1 nuclear expression was stronger at 20°C in <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top). These data suggest that a chronic elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutants is sufficient to favor CMK-1 accumulation in the nucleus.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the impact of impairing the elevation of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> intracellular concentration in transgenic animals overexpressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer protein Calbindin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schumacher et al., 2012</xref>). We generated a [<italic>mec-3p::Calbindin</italic>] transgene to express Calbindin in FLP and confirmed that it could reduce intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, as evidenced by a blunted heat-evoked YFP/CFP ratio increase in transgenic animals coexpressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor cameleon YC2.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we evaluated CMK-1 localization and found that, whereas the localization of CMK-1 at 20°C was indistinguishable from that in wild-type, Calbindin overexpression in FLP significantly impaired its accumulation in the nucleus at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Overexpressing another Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, Parvalbumin, also significantly reduced the nuclear accumulation of CMK-1 at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, a mutant Parvalbumin with mutations affecting all its calcium binding sites did not impair CMK-1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the effect of Parvalbumin involves its Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding activity. Collectively, the results of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering experiments suggest that an elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in FLP is required for CMK-1 nuclear translocation upon prolonged thermal stimulation.</p><p>In an attempt to identify specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels involved, we evaluated the impact of reduction-of-function mutations in the genes coding for the L- and N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC; <italic>egl-19(n582), unc-2(gk355</italic>), <italic>unc-2(ra612</italic>)), for transient receptor potential channels (<italic>ocr-2(ak47); osm-9(ky5</italic>) double mutants) and for the ryanodine receptor (<italic>unc-68(r1161</italic>)). These mutations had previously been shown to affect FLP Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to short stimuli lasting between 30 s and 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saro et al., 2020</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, none of these mutations caused a significant alteration of CMK-1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These observations prompted us to examine if these mutations could actually impair steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations over a longer time frame matching that of CMK-1 translocation kinetics. Interestingly, none of the mutations significantly affected the Ca<sup>2+</sup>elevation caused by a 60 min incubation at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest either that other channels/transporters are involved or that at least some of these channels work in a redundant manner in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> steady-state levels and temperature-dependent CMK-1 nuclear accumulation.</p><p>Finally, reasoning that the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to CMK-1 could be directly involved in the relocalization mechanism, we examined the impact of a CMK-1(W305S) mutation, affecting a key residue necessary for the initiation of the CaM binding to CaM Kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsushita and Nairn, 1998</xref>). This CMK-1 mutation had a similar effect to the buffering of calcium with exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>buffers, preventing CMK-1 nuclear translocation into the nucleus upon prolonged heat stimulation (28°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, the W305S mutation was also able to counteract the CMK-1 nuclear accumulation observed in <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutant with permanently elevated calcium levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results are consistent with a model in which prolonged thermal stimulation causes prolonged cell-autonomous FLP thermosensory activity, long-lasting changes in intracellular calcium concentration and binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM on CMK-1 to promote CMK-1 nuclear translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding promotes CMK-1 nuclear localization independently of the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element</title><p>Our next goal was to understand how the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM on CMK-1 can favor CMK-1 nuclear accumulation. One possible mechanism would consist in the masking of the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element by the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Indeed, the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element is adjacent to the CaM binding domain and components of the export machinery might potentially compete with CaM for CMK-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>NES masking model</italic>). If this model is true, one would expect that the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element would be required to prevent CMK-1 nuclear accumulation at 28°C when the CaM-binding is disrupted by the W305S mutation. We therefore examined the localization of CMK-1(V292A/V294A/W305S) mutant proteins, in which both CaM binding and the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element are disrupted. Contrary to the predication made according to the <italic>NES masking model</italic>, we found that the triple mutant protein expression was cytoplasmic at 28°C, indistinguishable from that of the single W305S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, a functional NES<sup>288-294</sup> element is dispensable for the cytosolic retention at 28°C of CaM binding-disruption mutant CMK-1.

Binding of importins would thereby be favored under high calcium conditions at 28°C, but not at 20°C when calcium levels are lower. The effect of mutations in the CMK-1 NLS<sup>71-78</sup> element is consistent with this model as they selectively impact CMK-1 localization at 28°C, but not at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As presented in the next paragraphs, we further confirmed this <italic>NLS unmasking model</italic> by testing additional predictions regarding the localization of CMK-1 in vivo and directly quantifying protein affinities in vitro.</p><p>A first prediction of the <italic>NLS unmasking</italic> model is that the increased nuclear expression of CMK-1, triggered by <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), will require a functional NLS<sup>71-78</sup> element. This was indeed the case as the expression of the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutant CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S) was significantly more cytoplasmic than CMK-1(wt) in the <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>), high-calcium background at both 20 and 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We note that the nuclear accumulation is not fully blocked, which might suggest the existence of a NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-independent pathway. A second prediction of the model is that, because the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> element is masked at 20°C, the cytoplasmic exclusion observed in the NES<sup>288-294</sup> mutant at this temperature will not require the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> element. We therefore evaluated the localization of a CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S/V292A/V294) mutant combining NLS<sup>71-78</sup>- and NES<sup>288-294</sup>-disrupting mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). According to our prediction, this mutant protein was excluded from the cytoplasm similarly to CMK-1(V292A/V294) mutant protein lacking only the functional NES<sup>288-294</sup> element. Therefore, at 20°C, when calcium levels are low and there is little CaM binding to CMK-1, the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> element is not engaged to regulate CMK-1 localization.</p><p>Next, we sought to more directly test the <italic>NLS unmasking model</italic> by quantifying the affinity between purified recombinant CMK-1 and importin-α in vitro. Indeed, importin-α are known to make direct interactions with NLS elements and CaM kinase IV was previously shown to interact with importin-α, even if the relevant NLS remained undefined in that case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kotera et al., 2005</xref>). Three importin-α are encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (IMA-1, -2, and -3). Previous data suggest that IMA-3 is the only isoform expressed in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geles and Adam, 2001</xref>). We confirmed the broad somatic expression of <italic>ima-3</italic> using an [<italic>ima-3p::NLS::wrmScarlet</italic>] reporter. Expressing cells included FLP neurons, as judged with the green/red co-labeling with the <italic>mec-3p::CMK-1::mNG</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore decided to conduct the in vitro protein-protein interaction analysis with IMA-3. HisTag::IMA-3, CMK-1(wt), and CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S) were then produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified and protein-protein interactions quantified using the MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2011</xref>). Interaction plots are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, dissociation constants (Kd) summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and a schematic interpretation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>. In control experiments, we could not detect any affinity between CaM and IMA-3, nor between CaM and CMK-1 in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, CMK-1 had a relatively low but detectable affinity for IMA-3 (Kd ≈ 1.54 μM). In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 8 µM CaM), the affinity for IMA-3 raised by about approximately threefold (Kd ≈ 0.45 μM). No significant increase in affinity was seen with Ca<sup>2+</sup> only (2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, no CaM). These data suggest that the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to CMK-1 is sufficient to increase its affinity to IMA-3. This increased affinity effect was significantly reduced in CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S) triple mutant, furthermore suggesting that the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> of CMK-1 mediates a major part of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding-dependent IMA-3 affinity increase.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to CMK-1 enhances the affinity for IMA-3 importin-α in a NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>ima-3</italic> expression analysis with a transcriptional reporter.

At first glance, this model looks counterintuitive because heat stimuli trigger intracellular calcium elevations in AFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>). However, AFD is fast-adapting and these elevations are transients, lasting at most for a few minutes when the stimulus is held constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2006</xref>). Calcium levels over a longer time frame are more likely to be relevant for CMK-1 localization. We therefore compared AFD intracellular calcium levels between animals grown overnight at 15 and 25°C, respectively. We expressed the ratiometric YC2.3 cameleon sensor in AFD and compared the baseline YFP/CFP ratio across unstimulated animals. Remarkably, the baseline YFP/CFP ratio in worms grown and recorded at 15°C (mean = 1.09; sem = 0.03) was significantly higher than that measured in worms grown and recorded at 25°C (mean = 0.93; sem = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The magnitude of the YFP/CFP ratio difference caused by differences in the overnight growth temperature (ΔR ≈ 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) was of the same order of magnitude as those caused by acute thermal up-steps (15°C to 25°C, ΔR ≈ 0.13) or down-steps (25°C to 15°C, ΔR ≈ 0.13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). We conclude that baseline intracellular calcium level in AFD inversely correlates with growth temperature, a situation opposite to that in FLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>NLS<sup>71-78</sup> and NES<sup>288-294</sup> regulate CMK-1 subcellular localization in AFD neurons</title><p>Our findings about AFD indicate that an intracellular calcium elevation (at 15°C) is linked to an accumulation of CMK-1 in the nucleus, whereas an intracellular calcium reduction (at 25°C) is linked to a cytoplasmic expression. It seemed therefore plausible that CMK-1 subcellular localization could be controlled in AFD via the same calcium-dependent mechanism as in FLP. We made a series of observations confirming this hypothesis. First, the nuclear accumulation at 15°C was significantly impaired in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding mutant CMK-1(W305S) and the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutant CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Second, the UNC-68/ryanodine receptor <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) gain-of-function mutation caused a nuclear accumulation at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom), suggesting that an elevation in calcium is sufficient to promote CMK-1 nuclear expression in AFD. Third, the nuclear accumulation in <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutant was completely abolished for CMK-1(W305S) mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom), further pointing to the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding. Fourth, disrupting the NES<sup>288-294</sup> in CMK-1(V292A/V294A) mutants leads to a constitutive nuclear expression in AFD irrespective of the temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, we also confirmed that <italic>ima-3</italic> is expressed in AFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

CaM kinases are ubiquitous signaling molecules able to convert intracellular calcium signals into specific phosphorylation patterns on target proteins and playing an important role in neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soderling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wayman et al., 2008a</xref>). In particular, CMK-1 plays antagonistic roles in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of FLP thermonociceptors, contributing to adjust the output from these cells and to modulate avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). While the importance of this subcellular compartment-specific signaling is well appreciated, little was known on how CMK-1 could operate localization switch according to recent sensory experience on a minute-to-hour timescale. Our work provides insight on the molecular factors governing CMK-1 subcellular localization in vivo and allows us to propose a new mechanism through which CMK-1 subcellular localization is coupled to cell activation and ensuing long-term calcium-level modulation. We furthermore show that this mechanism is not restricted to FLP neurons and is essential for proper behavioral plasticity and gene expression.</p><p>The proposed mechanism for controlled CMK-1 localization relies on three main features. First, the presence of two key localization signals on the CMK-1 protein: NLS<sup>71-78</sup> and NES<sup>288-294</sup>, with sequences matching the consensus for recognition by importins and exportins, respectively. Considering our findings with exportin pharmacological inhibition and in vitro binding to the IMA-3 importin, these two sequence elements are likely to function via their respective canonical pathways. Second, the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding to CMK-1, which is sufficient to promote the interaction with IMA-3, via the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> sequence. Therefore, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ensuing conformational changes have a dual impact by (i) favoring CMK-1 catalytic activity and (ii) unmasking NLS<sup>71-78</sup> for nuclear import. Third, the long-term modulation of steady-state intracellular calcium levels in sensory neurons, which will produce relatively slow-developing effects on CMK-1 localization.</p><p>There are several precedents for activity-dependent nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins in neurons in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ch’ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chawla et al., 2003</xref>). In these cases, the key mechanism is the phosphorylation status of the target protein, which is modulated in a cell activity-dependent manner by phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</xref>) and kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chawla et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we reveal a novel mechanism for activity-dependent control of CaM kinase signaling, allowing to couple intracellular calcium elevation and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to CMK-1 with its redistribution into the nucleus via the importin pathway. Based on in vitro analysis of permeabilized cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweitzer and Hanover, 1996</xref> proposed that some protein cargos could be imported into the nucleus directly via a ‘CaM-dependent nuclear protein import’ mechanism, not requiring Ran-GTP, nor the canonical importin pathway. The exact mechanism through which CaM could promote cargo translocation in this pathway remains elusive. The mechanism that we propose here is different because the translocation of CMK-1 not only requires CaM binding, but also the presence of an intact NLS<sup>71-78</sup> sequence, which we showed to be a functional binding site for the IMA-3 importin-α. We consider that the most likely explanation for our data would be that the CaM-binding-induced conformational change, which is well-documented in CaM kinase, could cause CMK-1 to expose the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> sequence in order to make it more accessible to the importin pathways, via a direct interaction with IMA-3.</p><p>In addition to the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-dependent mechanism, several lines of evidence suggest the existence of one or more additional mechanisms able to promote CMK-1 nuclear entry or retention. Indeed, we noted that the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutation reduced but did not abolish the interaction with IMA-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutation could not fully prevent the CMK-1 nuclear accumulation caused by the <italic>unc-68(dom13</italic>) mutation in FLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or by overnight cultivation at 15°C in AFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-independent pathways may not play a major role in FLP when calcium is elevated by a 90 min incubation at 28°C (full penetrance of the NLS mutation in FLP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further studies will be needed to delineate the exact nature of NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-independent mechanisms, and notably if they also involve IMA-3-dependent nuclear import and alternative NLS such as NLS<sup>297-308</sup>.</p><p>The presence of functional NLS and NES suggests that CMK-1 localization results from a dynamic influx/efflux equilibrium. The kinetics of CMK-1 nuclear entry is rather slow, needing about 1 hr in FLP to abolish the cytoplasmic enrichment of the protein. Whereas our data do not exclude additional mechanisms, the threefold increase in IMA-3/CMK-1 affinity upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding is likely to contribute to shift this equilibrium. A previous study addressing the localization of cargo proteins with systematic NLS variations showed that varying the affinity for importins was sufficient to modify the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of these cargos and defined the upper and lower <italic>Kd</italic> value limits for active import in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodel et al., 2001</xref>). Based on this reference <italic>Kd</italic> scale, the CMK-1-/IMA-3 affinity would correspond to an undetectable import in the absence of CaM and to a moderately active import in the presence of CaM, which is in line with the relatively low CMK-1 nuclear enrichment observed, even when the NES is disrupted. Considering the relatively slow kinetics of the system, we speculate that it may actually serve to filter out the influence of local, short-lasting calcium peaks, in order for CMK-1 localization to reflect mostly the global changes occurring over longer timescales. This seems to be an appropriate strategy to modulate cellular outputs and gene expression during behavioral adaptations, which typically occur over longer timescales than calcium activity peaks in response to acute stimuli. The situation is particularly interesting in AFD, where acute calcium elevations caused by short thermal fluctuation could potentially be ‘ignored,’ to focus on the long-lasting, global impact that temperature has on resting calcium levels: in the case of AFD, a decrease in calcium favoring CMK-1 nuclear exclusion at higher temperatures.</p><p>AFD is an extensively studied thermosensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman and Sengupta, 2018</xref>). To our knowledge, however, the long-term impact of temperature on resting intracellular calcium levels was not known. Previous calcium imaging studies considered shorter time frames and focused on relative calcium changes over a baseline, but did not address how this baseline was affected in different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuhara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2007</xref>). Here, by using a cameleon ratiometric indicator, we evaluated the impact of overnight temperature shifts and showed that high temperature (25°C) unexpectedly causes a decrease in resting calcium level as compared to animals at 15°C. This effect is the inverse of that seen in FLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, AFD calcium responses include both the well-described short-term response to acute thermal change and the newly described resting calcium drift component, where temperature has the opposite impact and which serves as a major determinant for CMK-1 localization. We speculate that long-term drifts in resting calcium levels could play a role in the way the thermal response threshold is encoded and/or decoded to shape thermotactic plasticity. Additional studies will be required to better understand the role of AFD global calcium signaling and to identify the molecular machinery enabling AFD to produce both increase and decrease in calcium in response to temperature over different timescales.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism, which controls the intracellular locus of CaM kinase signaling, and which operates on longer time frames than the well-known kinase autoinhibitory control, in order to adjust gene expression and neuron function during adaptation. We speculate that this mechanism may be relevant for other sensory modalities, in particular for those neurons subject to long-term calcium changes, such as tonically signaling sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it may be instrumental for plasticity mechanisms in other species due to the high conservation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling throughout the evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was calculated as (Nucleus – Background)/(Cytoplasm – Background). A ratio &gt;1 indicates a nuclear accumulation of CMK-1, while a value &lt;1 a cytoplasmic biased ratio. All three ROIs were ellipses of the same area. The Background ROI was defined in a worm region close to the neuron to take autofluorescence into account. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic ROIs were defined based on the mNG green signal and the shape of the neuron, via a procedure that was first validated with the use of a second fluorescent nuclear marker (nuclear ceBFP::NLS). We noticed that the nucleus was always laying very centrally, occupying a large part of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). There is actually no possibility for the nucleus to fit in any narrower region of the cell. So even in situations where the green fluorescence signal is diffuse and does not itself reveal the localization of the nucleus, it is possible to make reliable predictions. The nuclear ROI was defined in the middle of the cell body (where it is the widest) and the cytoplasmic ROI decentered to a narrower region of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We validated this approach by a blind test, in which we acquired a series of images with diffuse mNG (homogenously distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm) and nuclear BFP, and defined the ROI solely based on the green channel. After an a posteriori verification with the blue channel, we found that &gt;98% of the ROI pairs (69/70) were correctly defined. Of note, when working with CMK-1::mNG, a nuclear accumulation or depletion of signal is often seen and further ascertains the localization of the nucleus. Therefore, the very rare errors caused by the mis-definition of ROIs will occur only when the nuclear and the cytoplasmic signals are similar; a situation where the ratio value will anyway be very close to 1, regardless of where the ROIs are defined. Based on this assessment, we concluded that our method is valid to score CMK-1:.mNG subcellular localization, without the need for a systematic use of a nuclear co-marker.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>gcy-8p</italic> reporter imaging and quantification</title><p>AFD images to measure <italic>gcy-8p::GFP</italic> transcriptional reporter expression were acquired and processed like described above for FLP, except that only two ROIs were defined (Cell and Background).

Protein concentration was determined by Pierce Microplate BCA protein assay Kit-Reducing Agent Compatible (Thermo Scientific) using BSA as protein standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Binding affinity quantification by MST</title><p>MST experiments were performed using a Monolith NT.115 from NanoTemper Technologies to assess the affinity between IMA-3 and CMK-1(wt) or CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S). IMA-3-HIS6 was labeled using the RED-tris-NTA His tag protein labeling kit, resuspended in HEPES 15 mM, 0.05% Tween 20. Labeled IMA-3-HIS6 protein (at a concentration of 100 nM) was added to a serial dilution of unlabeled CMK-1 prepared in binding buffer (1× PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Samples were loaded into MST standard capillaries Monolith NT.115 MO-k022 (NanoTemper) and MST measurements were performed using 40% laser power setting. For the assays in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, we added 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 8 µM CaM (from bovine brain; high purity; Sigma).</p><p>The dissociation constants <italic>Kd</italic> were obtained by plotting the normalized fluorescence (Fnorm) against the logarithm of ligand concentration and fitting using the <italic>Kd</italic> model with the MO-Affinity Analysis software (NanoTemper Technologies).

Adult worms were either synchronized by standard hypochlorite treatment or picked as L4 larvae on NGM plates 1 day before the experiments.</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Heat-evoked reversal</title><p>Worm populations (n ≥ 50 animals) crawling on food-free NGM-plates were exposed to two 4 s heat pulses with a 20 s recovery period in between. The first pulse was at a heating power of 0.3 W/m<sup>2</sup> and the second one at a heating power of 0.6 W/m<sup>2</sup>. We used a previously described system for heat delivery, worm movie recording, and reversal flagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lia and Glauser, 2020</xref>). The genotype effects were the same at both heating power levels, and the data were pooled for the reversal analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Thermotaxis</title><p>Well-fed animals were tested in thermotaxis assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramot et al., 2008a</xref>). Briefly, worms were grown at 20°C, recovered from the plate in distilled water, washed twice and spread at the center of a rectangular plate pre-equilibrated to form a linear thermogradient gradient (~1°C/cm). The starting temperature was 23°C. We ensured homogenous developmental and feeding states across cultivation plates by adjusting animal density such that food was constantly available during their development.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Noxious heat thermogradient assays</title><p>The noxious heat thermogradient assays, in which we scored the worm dispersal in a temperature gradient from 29 to 37°C, were performed as previously reported. Like in previous studies, assays were performed with animals who had been starved for 5–7 hr in order to eliminate the contribution of the thermotaxis circuit. For the heat-evoked desensitization experiments, we incubated the plates at 28°C during the last 1.5 hr of starvation. Instead of using a heat-avoidance index as in previous studies, we calculated the temperature of the third quartile of the worm distribution because we found that it was a more robust indicator of the worm spreading on the thermal gradient. Indeed, over the conditions considered for the present study, the relative error of the heat-avoidance index was 22% on average (range 15–32%) versus 8% on average (range 4–14%) for the third quartile-based metrics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Optogenetic analysis was carried out in a previously described <italic>[FLP::CoChR]</italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schild and Glauser, 2015</xref>), in which blue light stimuli of low intensities can activate FLP and trigger reversal responses.</p><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Light-evoked reversal assay</title><p>Single forward-moving animals were illuminated with blue light during 0.5 s. Scoring was done manually and any backward movement taking place during the stimulation was counted as a positive response, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marques et al., 2019</xref>). Animals were stimulated three times in a row, leaving enough time for forward locomotion to restart in between stimuli. We did not observe a significant habituation effect over the three trials and the whole pool of trials was used for statistical analyses. Controls run in the absence of ATR, as well as with red light stimuli, showed no light dose–response effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Heat adaptation prior to light-evoked reversal assays</title><p>Young adults were washed from ‘+ ATR’ NGM plates like described for CMK-1 imaging, and incubated for 90 min in a thermocycler at 20°C (naïve) and 28°C (adapted).

The recording and calcium imaging analysis were performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saro et al., 2020</xref>. Data are reported as YFP/CFP ratios with no baseline normalization in order to enable the comparison between resting calcium levels across animals and conditions. Animals were selected based on the overall fluorescence level of the reporter in order to have similar expression levels across conditions, which we verified a posteriori. This verification was made by summing the CFP and YFP emission signals (after excitation at 405 nm) in order to obtain a metrics representing the total fluorescence independently of varying FRET levels. This metrics was not significantly different between the sets of traces recorded at 15 and 25°C, respectively (15°C: average = 517, sem = 93; 25°C, average = 552, sem = 80; arbitrary units; p=0.73 by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>Calcium imaging in FLP</title><p>To assess intracellular calcium in the calbindin-expressing transgenic animals and in the mutants affecting different calcium channels, we incubated synchronized [<italic>egl-46p::YC2.3</italic>] adult worms at 20 or 28°C for 1.5 hr.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Comparisons were made with one-way and two-way ANOVAs using Jamovi (The jamovi project (2021), jamovi (Version 1.6) [Computer Software]; retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jamovi.org">https://www.jamovi.org</ext-link>). A visual inspection of Q-Q plots and nonsignificant Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (p&gt;0.01) suggested that all datasets could be considered to follow a normal distribution. However, some datasets returned significant results with the Shapiro–Wilk test (p&lt;0.01). For that reason, we conducted and reported the results of both regular ANOVAs and robust ANOVAs. Of note, the two methods gave similar results.

This does not look convincing to me, and I wonder whether the transgene gets strongly upregulated at 28°C (often seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) and that the bright dotty speckle pattern could be aggregates. This concern could be easily diluted if the authors showed higher quality, higher resolution confocal scans together with a nuclear red marker showing that the CMK-1 clusters are indeed restricted to the nucleus. Alternatively, high quality DIC images could be used to outline the nucleus (though perhaps very challenging in adult worms; a fluorescent marker might be more straight forward). It could then be discussed what these sub-nuclear structures might be, could be even very interesting.</p><p>(2) In the same vein, I wonder how objectively the authors outlined cytoplasm and nucleus in their image analyses since, they seemed to have done this manually. Moreover, the reporter strain only expresses CMK-1::mNG and no other independent nuclear reference marker is used. Therefore, they seemed to have used the CMK-1::mNG itself to define cytoplasm and nucleus, a strategy that could mislead the authors if the CMK-1 transgene upregulates and/or aggregates at 28°C. Again, this can be easily addressed. I think they need to validate the assays with the additional high-res scans and a nuclear reference marker. Show in higher zoom images how cytoplasm and nucleus ROIs were defined for the standard assays as well.</p><p>(2) Figures 2 and 3 – some data appears on Figure 3 that appears also in Figure 2. For example, the nuclear localization of CMK-1(wt) with and without the unc-68¬ background at 20 and 28 degrees (Figure 2B, Figure 3D). Is it the same experiment or independent data? This should be clarified and if data are re-used in different figure this should be clearly stated in legends.</p><p>(3) Figure 2 and 3 – Some genetic backgrounds are used that are claimed to change the intracellular Ca++ levels in the FLP neuron with reference to the literature. Since the authors have the capacity to conduct Ca+ imaging in the FLP neuron, using a radiometric indicator, validating the expected effect of unc-68(dom13) (increased) and mec-3p::Calbindin (decreased) on intracellular free Ca++ levels in FLP would strengthen the claims of the authors. In the same vein, the various Ca++ channels mutants that do not affect localization should therefore not affect intracellular free Ca++ levels, which might be surprising. I think the correlation of CMK-1 localization with free Ca++ should be further validated in this way.</p><p>(4) Figure 6H-I and Page 24 lines 570-573: The authors refer to the result that cmk-1 mutants fail to express gcy-8 in the AFD neuron. Both cmk-1 NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutants and cmk-1 NES<sup>288-294</sup> mutants did not increase the expression level of gcy-8 when grown at 25deg. However, these results do not fit the other results presented in the manuscript. In figure 6A-F the AFD neuron is shown to exhibit higher Ca+ levels and nuclear localization of CMK-1, when worms are cultivated at lower temperatures and that mutating the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> lead to cytoplasmic localization of CMK-1. Figure 6H shows that at lower temperatures where CMK-1 is nuclear, the expression of gcy-8 is reduced. Therefore, one would expect that NES<sup>288-294</sup> (cmk(syb1375)) mutants that increase nuclear localization of CMK-1 would have lower gcy-8 but the results show the opposite. The authors should discuss a detailed model of cmk-1 dependent gcy-8 expression to address this conflict.</p><p>(5) Figure 4 in vitro assay of IMA-3 and CMK-1 binding are comparing the effect adding Ca++ plus CaM, but I miss a Ca++ only control.</p><p>(6) Pages 9-10 and Figure 2. The authors show that CMK-1 nuclear localization is unaffected in mutants backgrounds of the genes unc-13 and unc-31 required for synaptic transmission and neuropeptide signaling. Indeed, these are classical genetic backgrounds used to test whether an effect is cell autonomous. The authors then claim at several occasions, including in the headline of this chapter that the intra-cellular calcium control of CMK-1 localization in FLP neuron is cell autonomous. This claim is not fully supported by the data since: 1. The double mutant unc-13;unc-31 was not tested. 2. The FLP and neuron make gap junction connections to other neurons that may affect their Ca+ levels and CMK-1 localization, however this possibility was not tested (for example by testing mutants in the innexins expressed by FLP). I don't think that new experiments are necessary here but the authors should accommodate for these possibilities in their conclusions and discussions.</p><p>(7) Several results described in the work suggest that there is a Ca-dependent but NLS<sup>71-78</sup> -independent pathway that is involved in the nuclear localization of CMK-1 in FLP and AFD neurons: A. in Figure 3D – the addition of the unc-86(dom13) background seem to increase nuclear localization of NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutated CMK-1 (although the effect sizes are small.). Similarly, in Figure 2B, unc-86(dom13) could also increase the nuclear localization of CMK-1 in the Ca+ binding domain mutated CMK(WS305S). B. Figure 6B – the effect of mutating the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> on CMK-1 localization in AFD is not fully penetrant. This is in contrast with the effect of CMK(WS305S). I suggest the authors to test whether these effects are significant and if so discuss this more clearly.</p><p>(8) Figure 5D – negative controls of no ATR or worms without the optogenetic construct are lacking. It is possible the response is a general avoidance to light. The control is mentioned in the methods section but should be shown. It is hard to imagine that there was &quot;no response&quot; as worms always exert spontaneous reversal behaviors.</p><p>(9) Figure 5G and H and Pages 23 and 24 – The authors should cite the work of Satterlee et al., Curr. Biol. (2004) also here when describing the effect of cmk-1 mutants on thermosensation responses and on gcy-8 expression pattern in the AFD neuron, both examined in this work (Table 1 and Figure 4).</p><p>(10) Figure 5C – instead of doing the regular thermotaxis experiment they use their own variant on it observing the third quartile of worm distribution&quot; and claiming in the methods section that this is a more robust readout to previous methods. This statement should be validated quantitatively.</p><p>(11) Please also report absolute YFP and CFP fluorescent levels of the ratiometric Ca++ indicator; are expression levels affected in 15deg vs 25deg, which can be often observed ion transgenes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I am happy to support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I only have a few comments.</p><p>(12) Can the authors explain why cmk-1(syb1375) mutants did not effectively spread on the assay plates?</p><p>(13) The authors may want to include raw data points in the bar graphs such that readers will get a chance to observe the data distribution patterns and sample sizes (n numbers). This has now become an increasingly common practice. Currently, all bar graphs only show error bars without raw data points or n numbers.</p><p>(14) For FLP CMK-1::GFP translocation data, the authors only showed sample images in one place: Figure 1B. All such data were presented as bar graphs without sample images. Images are easier for readers to comprehend. It is not necessary to show sample images for all bar graphs in the main figures, as this will take up too much space, though the rest may go to supplemental figures.</p><p>(15) typos: &quot;addressed&quot; (line 418) and &quot;serves&quot; (line 625).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well written and follows a clear experimental logic with well-designed and supportive experiments and data presentation. The data support well the conclusions and claims.

As CMK-1 nuclear entry is a well-documented phenomenon, which was previously published (Schild et al. 2014), we initially designed Figure 1 to only include quantitative data and it was a last-minute decision to include the representative picture. We apologize for the bad quality and poor resolution of the chosen illustration, in particular as it appeared in the assembled pdf. We have made numerous observations with epifluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy, and we found that the signal is much more homogenous than what the previously presented picture suggested. We actually lack any evidence of clear structures in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. We have inserted a better picture set to illustrate the nuclear entry in the revised Figure 1B.</p><p>Thanks for bringing up the point regarding the definition of nucleus and cytoplasm. We realize that the description of our methodology was not clear enough regarding how we defined the regions of interest (ROI) in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, in order to calculate the signal ratio. To address this concern, we have extended the method section in the revised manuscript, (including a novel supplementary figure to illustrate our method). When developing our assay, we initially used a two-color labeling with the blue channel for a BFP nuclear marker and the green channel for CMK-1::GFP. A precise definition of the nucleus was possible, but the approach was extremely tedious and would not have been compatible with the volume of data acquisition involved in the project, given the natural variability CMK-1 localization across animals in vivo and the need for scoring thousands of animals<italic>.</italic> This is why we developed a procedure in which we focused solely on the green channel to define a Nuclear ROI and a Cytoplasmic ROI. These ROI were not covering the whole area of the cytoplasm or the nucleus, but were smaller ellipses (of the same area) defined in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. The FLP cell body has a slightly elongated morphology, and we noticed that the nucleus was always laying very centrally, occupying a large part of the cell body. There is actually no room to fit the nucleus toward the ‘corners’ of the cell. So even when the GFP signal is diffuse and does not reveal the localization of the nucleus, it is possible to make excellent guesses as to where one should define the ROI for the analysis: nuclear ROI in the middle of the cell body where it is the widest; cytoplasmic ROI decentered to a narrower region of the cell. We validated this approach by a blind test, in which we acquired a series of images with diffuse mNG (homogenously distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm) and nuclear BFP, and defined the ROI solely based on the green channel. After an a posteriori verification with the blue channel, we found that &gt;98% of the ROI pairs (69/70) were correctly set. Of note, when working with CMK-1::mNG, a nuclear accumulation or depletion of signal is often seen and further ascertains the localization of the nucleus. Therefore, the very rare errors caused by the mis-definition of ROIs will occur only when the Nuclear/Cytoplasmic signal ratio is very close to 1; regardless of where the ROIs are defined. Based on this assessment, we conclude that our method is valid to score CMK-1:.mNG subcellular localization, without the need for a systematic use of a nuclear co-marker.</p><p>A third point raised by this reviewer relates to the potential impact of temperature on reporter expression/aggregation. We did not notice temperature-dependent aggregation, nor a flagrant increase in transgene expression after 90 min incubation at 28°C. To look in more details in a potential change in expression levels, we quantified the total green fluorescence signal over the whole FLP cell body in animals at 20°C versus 28°C (<italic>n</italic>=110 animals at each temperature). We found no significant expression changes in fluorescent level (20°C: average=33.3, sem=0.9; 28°C: average=35.3; sem=0.8; arbitrary units; <italic>p</italic> value by Student <italic>T-</italic>test = .11). We therefore interpret the change in fluorescence ratio reported throughout the manuscript as the result of a subcellular re-localization of CMK-1::mNG reporters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figures 2 and 3 – some data appears on Figure 3 that appears also in Figure 2. For example, the nuclear localization of CMK-1(wt) with and without the unc-68¬ background at 20 and 28 degrees (Figure 2B, Figure 3D). Is it the same experiment or independent data? This should be clarified and if data are re-used in different figure this should be clearly stated in legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Some data were indeed presented in multiple Figure panels for comparison purpose. This was the case for control conditions when experiments were run in parallel and shared the control (across panels B, D, and F in Figure 1, as well as between Figure 2B and 3D). We have clarified this in the respective Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2 and 3 – Some genetic backgrounds are used that are claimed to change the intracellular Ca++ levels in the FLP neuron with reference to the literature. Since the authors have the capacity to conduct Ca+ imaging in the FLP neuron, using a radiometric indicator, validating the expected effect of unc-68(dom13) (increased) and mec-3p::Calbindin (decreased) on intracellular free Ca++ levels in FLP would strengthen the claims of the authors. In the same vein, the various Ca++ channels mutants that do not affect localization should therefore not affect intracellular free Ca++ levels, which might be surprising. I think the correlation of CMK-1 localization with free Ca++ should be further validated in this way.</p></disp-quote><p>These are indeed interesting points/suggestions and we have articulated our answer along three lines:</p><p>i) UNC-68 gain-of-function: Regarding <italic>unc-68(dom13)</italic>, the published observations we are referring in the manuscript are results from our group (Marques et al. 2019) where we directly addressed the FLP baseline calcium level in this mutant with a ratiometric indicator and found it was indeed elevated as compared to wild type (see Marques et al. Figure 5). The elevated calcium level in FLP is therefore not inferred from the mutation, but a previously established empirically observation.</p><p>ii) Calcium buffering: Regarding <italic>mec-3p::Calbindin</italic> impact on intracellular calcium, this is indeed a very important point in order to interpret its impact on CMK-1 subcellular localization. We therefore conducted additional experiments. First, we conducted the suggested direct calcium measurements. To that end, we generated new transgenic animals co-expressing YC2.3 and Calbindin in FLP and compared them to control animals devoid of Calbindin transgene. We observed that Calbindin expression was linked to decreased YFP/CFP values in animal incubated at 28°C (Figure 2 Supplement 2A). These data are in line with a model in which Calbindin may affect CMK-1 subcellular localization by buffering calcium. Next, because calcium buffering in vivo is a central experiment in our study, we though to expand our work beyond the suggestion by the reviewer. We therefore expressed an alternative calcium buffer, Parvalbumin, in a new set of transgenic animals. Like Calbindin, Parvalbumin was previously used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to buffer calcium (PMID: 23093425). The reason why we initially focused on Calbindin was that a preliminary assessment comparing a <italic>[mec-3p::Calbindin::GFP]</italic> and a <italic>[mec-3p::Parvalbumin::GFP]</italic> fusion constructs had shown a stronger expression for the Calbindin construct. In the new experiments (Figure 2 Supplement 3), we found that Parvalbumin expression in FLP with a <italic>[mec-3p::Parvalbumin]</italic> transgene was sufficient to significantly reduce CMK-1 nuclear accumulation at 28°C, even though the effect was milder than with Calbindin. More importantly, we expressed, in parallel experiments, a</p><p>mutant Parvalbumin unable to bind calcium (K92V, D93A, D95A, K97V and E100V), and found that it had no impact on CMK-1 localization. These results indicate that the impact of the Parvalbumin transgene requires its ability to bind calcium and confirm a model in which the nuclear re-localization of CMK-1 in vivo relies on an unrestrained elevation in free intracellular calcium concentration. The Result section was modified to present these new results.</p><p>iii) Impact of mutations in candidate calcium channels. In our previous article (Saro et al.2020), we reported that reduction-of-function mutations in the TRP channels OSM-9;OCR-2, the voltage gated channels UNC-2 and EGL-19, as well as the Ryanodine receptor UNC-68 could all partially impair the response to heat stimuli lasting between 30 s and 5 min. However, this timescale is significantly shorter than the 30-90 min required for temperature elevations to cause CMK-1 nuclear accumulation. The question of whether these calcium channel mutations can impact calcium over longer timescale was still open. We conducted the suggested experiments and recorded YC2.3 YFP/CFP ratio across these different genotypes in animals maintained at 20°C or exposed to 28°C for 60 min, using the same transgenic lines previously used for the work in Saro et al.<italic>,</italic> 2020. Interestingly, we found that, despite the mutations could all impair acute stimulus-evoked response, and unlike <italic>unc-68(dom13)</italic> gain-of-function mutation, the YFP/CFP ratio was not significantly reduced in these different animals at baseline or upon prolonged (1 hour) stimulation with heat (Figure 2 Supplement 2B). These observations are in line with the literature about the robustness of calcium homeostasis and the regulation of resting intracellular calcium level (PMID: 12879862 or PMID: 22453936 for a review), showing that key determinants of the long term free-calcium concentration relate more to an “equilibrium” involving the activity of calcium transporter/exchanger and endogenous calcium buffers, and much less on the activity stimulus-dependent calcium channels, which operate by triggering “disequilibriums” one a shorter timeframe. Collectively, our new data indicate that the candidate calcium channel mutations do not significantly impact calcium level on a timeframe relevant for CMK-1 nuclear entry, which might explain their inability to impair this phenomenon. The Result section was modified to present these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 6H-I and Page 24 lines 570-573: The authors refer to the result that cmk-1 mutants fail to express gcy-8 in the AFD neuron. Both cmk-1 NLS<sup>71-78</sup> mutants and cmk-1 NES<sup>288-294</sup> mutants did not increase the expression level of gcy-8 when grown at 25deg. However, these results do not fit the other results presented in the manuscript. In figure 6A-F the AFD neuron is shown to exhibit higher Ca+ levels and nuclear localization of CMK-1, when worms are cultivated at lower temperatures and that mutating the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> lead to cytoplasmic localization of CMK-1. Figure 6H shows that at lower temperatures where CMK-1 is nuclear, the expression of gcy-8 is reduced. Therefore, one would expect that NES<sup>288-294</sup> (cmk(syb1375)) mutants that increase nuclear localization of CMK-1 would have lower gcy-8 but the results show the opposite. The authors should discuss a detailed model of cmk-1 dependent gcy-8 expression to address this conflict.</p></disp-quote><p>Like this reviewer, we would have anticipated a different result, following a simple model in which calcium levels would be directly translated into gene transcription output, via CMK-1 nuclear entry. However, as correctly emphasized by this reviewer, the <italic>gcy-8</italic> reporter expression level does not follow a one-to-one relationship between the CMK-1 localization pattern that one would assume based on this model. An alternative model could be that <italic>gcy-8</italic> transcription regulation does not simply need CMK-1 to enter the nucleus, but CMK-1 ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Because <italic>gcy-8</italic> gene regulation is the only well-characterize transcriptional target known to be regulated by CMK-1, we still think that these data are important to illustrate the consequences that the CMK-1 localization mis-regulation has on gene expression. We therefore decided to keep these data, but expanded the corresponding text in the revised manuscript to clarify that these data suggest a more complex model.</p><p>“The growth-temperature effect was abolished in both <italic>cmk-1(syb1435)</italic> and <italic>cmk-1(syb1375)</italic> mutants, leaving expression levels closer to the situation in <italic>cmk-1(wt)</italic> animals grown at 25°C.

The authors show that CMK-1 nuclear localization is unaffected in mutants backgrounds of the genes unc-13 and unc-31 required for synaptic transmission and neuropeptide signaling. Indeed, these are classical genetic backgrounds used to test whether an effect is cell autonomous. The authors then claim at several occasions, including in the headline of this chapter that the intra-cellular calcium control of CMK-1 localization in FLP neuron is cell autonomous. This claim is not fully supported by the data since: 1. The double mutant unc-13;unc-31 was not tested. 2. The FLP and neuron make gap junction connections to other neurons that may affect their Ca+ levels and CMK-1 localization, however this possibility was not tested (for example by testing mutants in the innexins expressed by FLP). I don't think that new experiments are necessary here but the authors should accommodate for these possibilities in their conclusions and discussions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a legitimate concern. We have revised the text to remove unsupported claims about the cell-autonomous effect (we notably modified the paragraph sub-title).

Similarly, in Figure 2B, unc-86(dom13) could also increase the nuclear localization of CMK-1 in the Ca+ binding domain mutated CMK(WS305S). B. Figure 6B – the effect of mutating the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> on CMK-1 localization in AFD is not fully penetrant. This is in contrast with the effect of CMK(WS305S). I suggest the authors to test whether these effects are significant and if so discuss this more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for emphasizing these relevant observations suggesting that an additional mechanism might exist in parallel to the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-dependent mechanism under some circumstances.

This second pathway does not seem to be engaged in FLP when calcium is elevated by a 90 min incubation at 28°C (full penetrance of the NLS mutation in FLP, Figure 1F). However, this NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-independent pathway may be engaged as a secondary mechanism, in FLP, when calcium is permanently elevated via the <italic>unc-68(dom13)</italic> mutation and, in AFD, when temperature is maintained at 15°C for an overnight. Further studies will be needed to further delineate the exact nature of NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-independent mechanisms.</p><p>We have revised the Results section and expanded the Discussion section to address this aspect in a new paragraph:</p><p>“In addition to the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>-dependent mechanism, several lines of evidence suggest the existence of one or more additional mechanisms able to promote CMK-1 nuclear entry or retention.

This statement should be validated quantitatively.</p></disp-quote><p>Regular thermotaxis assays under conditions where AFD has a major role are reported in Figure 6G. The assay in Figure 5C is not a classical thermotaxis assay, but a specific thermogradient-based assay, which we developed some time ago to focus on Noxious heat avoidance (Glauser et al. 2011). The main points are (i) to use starved worms in which the “classical” AFD-dependent innocuous response is inhibited and (ii) to focus on thermal nociception by making worm navigate in a noxious-temperature range. This assay comes with its own set of limitations (which were partially discussed in the original paper). One limitation which we realized later, after performing many more assays and exploring more genotypes, was that the original scoring metrics (heat avoidance index) was not ideal. This index was relying on a ratio between animal counts in two regions defined with a fixed temperature threshold. This threshold was working well to highlighting differences in wild type and with mutants with strong phenotypes. But there are situations where this index lacks granularity and robustness. This is the case when we look at mutants that produce a relatively mild effect and when the worm distribution is marked by a sharp boundary on the high temperature side of the gradient. In the latter case, small differences in the temperature gradients from assay to assay will cause abrupt change in the index values and increase the variability of the score. This is why we decided to revise the way to score the distribution in this assay by using another distribution index: the third quartile of the distribution. Over the dataset considered in this article, the relative error on the third quartile-based index was 8% on average (range 4-14%), whereas that obtained on the Heat avoidance index was 22% on average (range: 15-32%). In the revised manuscript, we have extended the justification of this methodological choice in the Method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Please also report absolute YFP and CFP fluorescent levels of the ratiometric Ca++ indicator; are expression levels affected in 15deg vs 25deg, which can be often observed ion transgenes?</p></disp-quote><p>Systematic Cameleon expression difference between conditions could indeed bias the analysis. We used extrachromosomal array-containing transgenic animals and paid special attention to pick animals with similar expression levels. Based on our subjective observations, we feel that the fluorescent signals varied much more from animal to animal than across temperature conditions. As quantitative control, we confirmed that the Cameleon expression was not significantly different between recording sets made at 15 and 25°C. To get a metrics reflecting the Cameleon expression level, we summed the CFP and YFP emission signals (after excitation at 405 nm), representing the total fluorescence independently of varying FRET levels. This metrics was not significantly different between the sets of traces recorded at 15°C and 25°C, respectively (15°C: average=517, sem=93; 25°C, average=552, sem=80; arbitrary units; <italic>p=</italic>.73 by Student’s <italic>T</italic>-test).

It was not a major issue for classical thermotaxis assay, because they are symmetrical and a significant fraction of animals nevertheless end up “choosing” one side. It was more of an issue in the noxious heat avoidance assay, where the readout relates to the animal’s ability to disperse unidirectionally. We have modified the text to mention the reason why the animals were not spreading well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The authors may want to include raw data points in the bar graphs such that readers will get a chance to observe the data distribution patterns and sample sizes (n numbers).

The choice of the bar graph was the result of a careful evaluation of the best quantitative representation of the data. Because we had relatively large samples, displaying raw data was sometimes making the data hard to digest. But on the other hand, we agree that it is still valuable information. As a compromise, we have kept the bar graph in the main text such that readers can readily focus on the average CMK-1 behavior, but we have also generated supplemental figures in which we include a violin plot with jittered datapoints overlaid.
