This question is particularly relevant for the study of the vertebrate neural crest, a transient population of stem-like cells that contribute to multiple traits and form numerous cell types. Neural crest cells (NCCs) make the cartilages and bones of the skull, neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), glial cells, and pigment cells among other derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theveneau and Mayor, 2012</xref>). How and when NCCs acquire these diverse fates are long-standing questions in the study of vertebrate development and have direct implications for both our understanding of vertebrate evolution as well as the origins of NCC-derived hereditary diseases such as cleft lip and palate.</p><p>NCC development is classically conceived as a stepwise series of bifurcating cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klymkowsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simoes-Costa et al., 2014</xref>). NCCs are specified at the neural plate border, a region of ectoderm in the gastrula stage embryo that also produces cranial placodes, and in fishes and frogs, Rohon–Beard sensory neurons. Once specified, NCCs undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migrate throughout the embryo, and differentiate into multiple cell types. When and how NCCs differentiate into these derivative lineages remains unclear. Early studies in chick and frog suggested that migratory NCCs are multipotent, requiring cues from the migratory environment to initiate differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collazo et al., 1993</xref>). Other studies in zebrafish and quail suggested that NCCs are often lineage restricted prior to migration, and thus interactions among NCCs in the neural tube must somehow specify cells to different lineages before cells become migratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henion and Weston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raible and Eisen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raible and Eisen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schilling and Kimmel, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Current understanding of the transcriptional changes associated with different stages of NCC development has largely been built from analysis of gene expression in whole tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simoes-Costa et al., 2014</xref>). However, developing tissues are often transcriptionally heterogeneous, a fact highlighted by recent developments in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farnsworth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zalc et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, as cells within tissues are often at different stages of fate specification, scRNA-seq has the potential to expose transcriptional changes associated with differentiation that would have been missed by bulk sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, in chick, scRNA-seq studies of migrating cranial NCCs identified unique transcriptional signatures associated with a morphologically cryptic population of cells at the leading migratory edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, an emerging picture is that NCCs are more transcriptionally heterogeneous than once thought, and that a complete understanding of NCC biology must account for this heterogeneity.</p><p>Here, we use scRNA-seq to characterize the transcriptional landscape of trunk neural crest cells (tNCCs) during the early stages of migration in zebrafish. We sampled NCCs at a stage in zebrafish development when both migratory and pre-migratory tNCC populations are present in the embryo. In the trunk, NCCs migrate along one of two paths that are temporally and spatially separated. Early migrating tNCCs move between the neural tube and somitic mesoderm along the medial path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These cells give rise to neurons of the PNS, glia, and pigment cells. Later migrating tNCCs follow the dorsolateral path between the skin ectoderm and somitic mesoderm to produce pigment cells. Thus, our experiment aims to capture transcriptional changes associated with the onset of migration and the splitting of NCCs into a neuronal or pigment lineage. We show that tNCCs are a transcriptionally diverse population of cells, and that some pre-migratory tNCCs are already expressing genes associated with a differentiated xanthophore pigment lineage. In addition, we identify a unique population of Rohon–Beard neurons (RBs) that expresses <italic>sox10</italic> and comment on the developmental similarity among RBs and NCCs. Ultimately these data create a foundation for future genetic work studying the roles of previously uncharacterized genes during NCC and RB development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell RNA analysis identifies transcriptionally heterogeneous <italic>sox10</italic>:eGFP population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of zebrafish trunk neural crest cell (tNCC) migration.

At this developmental stage, the <italic>sox10</italic>:eGFP transgene labels NCCs as well as the otic organ and lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carney et al., 2006</xref>). tNCCs in the anterior segments of the body are beginning to migrate along the medial path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), while most tNCCs that populate the posterior segments of the body and dorsolateral pathway are pre-migratory. Thus our sample represents the early stages of tNCC migration and includes a mixed population of migratory and pre-migratory tNCCs.</p><p>Our scRNA-seq analysis identified a transcriptionally heterogeneous population of sox10:eGFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Most cells were assigned to the NCC lineage based on expression of genes known to label NCCs at this stage (<italic>crestin, sox10, foxd3,</italic> and <italic>tfap2a</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We also identified a cluster of cells (cluster 7, 39 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that belongs to the otic organ or lateral line (<italic>epcam</italic>, <italic>cldn7b</italic>, <italic>f11r.1</italic>, <italic>otomp</italic>, <italic>otog</italic>). A small cluster of cells (cluster 6, 28 cells), expressing multiple collagen genes, were assigned to a ‘mesenchymal’ NCC type found in other datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>), and some cells were assigned as posterior arch cranial NCCs based on the expression of genes known to mark these regions of the embryo (<italic>prdm1a</italic>, <italic>grem2b</italic>, <italic>dlx2a</italic>, and <italic>fli1a</italic>).</p><p>These posterior arch cells were split across two clusters (clusters 4 and 5, 116 and 94 cells, respectively), one of which (cluster 5) are proliferating cells expressing genes involved in cell cycle (e.g., <italic>cdk1, mki67, plk1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Regressing out cell cycle confirms that most cluster 5 cells are mitotic posterior arch cells, though a small number of these mitotic cells are assigned as tNCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we recover the same biologically relevant groupings of cells and marker genes whether regressing out variables such as cell cycle or not indicating that the biological signal of cell type in the data is robust to different analysis parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods). Since our main interest is on NCCs in the trunk, we do not further analyze the otic, mesenchymal, and posterior arch tissues at length below.</p><p>Despite sampling zebrafish embryos during the early stages of tNCC migration, we observed multiple transcriptionally unique populations of tNCCs. One cluster of tNCCs (cluster 1, 112 cells) expresses genes that mark NCCs (e.g., <italic>crestin</italic>, <italic>sox10</italic>, <italic>foxd3</italic>, sox9a, <italic>tfap2a</italic>), and multiple Hox genes (e.g., <italic>hoxb8a</italic>, <italic>hoxa11b</italic>, <italic>hoxb7a</italic>) that place these cells in the posterior section of the zebrafish trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and F</xref>). Cells in cluster 1 express genes associated with tNCC migration (e.g., <italic>snai1b, prickle1a, wnt11</italic>) and genes with unknown function including a predicted cdc42 effector protein (zgc:150493) and cytokine-associated factor <italic>crlf1a</italic>. As tNCCs in this cluster lack expression of genes identifying these cells to a differentiated lineage, we hypothesize cluster 1 as multipotent tNCC progenitors.</p><p>We found a large number of tNCCs already expressing genes associated with differentiated pigment cells spread across two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and F</xref>). This was surprising as these cells are presumably pre-migratory based on the sampled stage. Cells in cluster 2 (79 cells) express melanophore/pan-pigment genes including <italic>mitfa</italic>, <italic>gpr143</italic>, <italic>trpm1b</italic>. We hypothesize these cells as pan-pigment-cell progenitors. In contrast to these pigment progenitors, cells in cluster 3 (82 cells) express genes enriched in differentiated xanthophores (red/orange pigment cells) including <italic>aox5</italic>, <italic>pax7a/b</italic>, and <italic>gch</italic>. We hypothesize cluster 3 as xanthoblast cells (e.g., pre-xanthophore), and these data identify novel markers of the early xanthophore lineage including solute carrier paralogs <italic>slc2a15a/b</italic> and gap junction protein <italic>gjp8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that a subset of tNCCs begin expressing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) associated with pigment cell lineages prior to migration. This raises the possibility that the sequencing data reflect transcriptional profiles of cells at different stages of differentiation. To explore this further, we inferred RNA velocity (Velocyto) as a measure of developmental pseudotime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>). This method uses estimates of RNA splicing to infer how cells may be transitioning across different transcriptional states. RNA velocity showed a strong signal of tNCCs differentiating from NCC progenitor cluster 1 into xanthoblast pigment cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) consistent with a hypothesis that some tNCCs initiate a pigment differentiation program prior to migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of neural-like cells and Rohon–Beard neurons</title><p>Two clusters (clusters 8 and 9) are distinguished from other cells by expression of genes enriched in the developing spinal cord and differentiated neurons (e.g., <italic>elavl3</italic>, <italic>elavl4</italic>). Cells in cluster 8 (21 cells) express genes associated with the neural plate and neural tube including <italic>olig3</italic>, <italic>olig4</italic>, <italic>sox3</italic>, <italic>boc</italic>, <italic>cdon</italic>, and multiple zic family transcription factors (<italic>zic1</italic>, <italic>zic2a</italic>, <italic>zic2b</italic>, <italic>zic4</italic>, <italic>zic5</italic>, <italic>zic6</italic>). Intriguingly some of these genes (e.g., <italic>zic2a/b</italic>, <italic>zic5</italic>) are also expressed by a subset of tNCC progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cells assigned to this neural cluster may represent ‘early’ NCCs still enriched in genes associated with the neural plate/neural plate border. Alternatively, these cells may be differentiating glia or other neuronal subtype precursors.</p><p>Cells in cluster 9 (36 cells) were transcriptionally distinct from all other cells in the dataset and express genes known to mark RBs including <italic>isl1</italic>, <italic>isl2a/b</italic>, <italic>scrt2</italic>, <italic>prdm14</italic>, and <italic>drgx</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). RBs are a non-migratory population of cells in the dorsal neural tube that innervate the skin of embryonic and larval zebrafish. Like NCCs, RBs are also specified at the neural plate border and genes critical for the proper specification of NCCs are also critical for specification of RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2011</xref>). While we cannot fully rule out that RB neurons are represented in our dataset due to the proximity of RBs and NCCs to each other in the neural tube, we find this explanation unlikely.

With the exception of three <italic>mitfa</italic> expressing cells, RBs do not express genes associated with other NCC clusters, which would be expected if these cells are due to incomplete dissociation from NCC tissue.

We thus hypothesize that RBs may be represented in our dataset because a small percentage of these cells express the <italic>sox10</italic> transgene similar to NCCs. This hypothesis is supported by low-level expression of both <italic>sox10</italic> and eGFP by RBs in the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, we note that RBs in an independent scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>) also express some NCC genes including <italic>crestin</italic> at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are intriguing as RBs and NCCs share a developmental origin in the neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornell and Eisen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritzsch and Northcutt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2005</xref>), and thus our data are consistent with a literature of developmental similarity between these two cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Expression of novel xanthophore and RB neuron markers is lost in <italic>Prdm1a</italic> mutants</title><p>Both NCCs and RBs are specified in the neural plate border during gastrulation.

Prior studies have shown that <italic>m</italic>utant <italic>prdm1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fail to specify NCCs and RBs at 24 hpf and have a reduction of melanocytes at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olesnicky et al., 2010</xref>). We thus reasoned that if expression of these genes is restricted to NCCs and RBs respectively then we should see loss of expression of these genes in <italic>prdm1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants and this is exactly what we found. Dorsal neural tube expression of <italic>slc2a15b</italic>, <italic>gjp8</italic>, <italic>fgf13a</italic>, and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> were all lost in <italic>prdm1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–I</xref>). Expression of these genes in areas of the embryo other than NCCs and RBs was not affected (e.g., <italic>cxcr4b</italic> expression in ventral neural tube shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). These data suggest that loss of expression was due to loss of NCC and RB cell specification, confirming expression of these genes to NCCs and RBs and placing these genes downstream of the neural plate border specifier Prdm1a.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Expression of novel xanthoblast and Rohon–Beard neuron (RB) marker genes is lost in the Prdm1a mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of neural crest cell (NCC) and RB specification.

Our data identify both presumptive multipotent tNCC progenitor cells and a subset of tNCCs already expressing genes associated with differentiated pigment cells prior to migration and at relatively early developmental stages (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling and Sauka-Spengler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). Cells specified towards the xanthophore lineage, in particular, may be one of the earliest tNCC derivatives to begin differentiating.</p><p>While we find NCCs expressing markers of differentiated pigment cells, we did not find tNCCs beginning to express genes associated with the PNS. This observation was supported in analyses that compare tNCCs from 24, 48, and 68 hpf embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cells expressing genes associated with PNS are only observed at 48 and 68 hpf when these post-migratory NCCs are already differentiating/differentiated. Thus, while genes associated with pigment cell derivatives are expressed at pre-/early migratory stages, NCCs delay expression of genes associated with PNS cell types until post-migratory stages.</p><p>Identification of pre-migratory pigment NCCs is consistent with results from some cell labeling experiments in zebrafish, suggesting that NCCs are lineage restricted prior to migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raible and Eisen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raible and Eisen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schilling and Kimmel, 1994</xref>). In these experiments, pre-migratory NCCs labeled in the neural tube only make a single NCC derivative. While these classic cell labeling experiments could not identify whether pre-migratory NCCs were beginning to differentiate, our data extend these studies by showing that some pre-migratory NCCs are already expressing a pigment cell GRN. Whether presumptive pigment cells identified in our scRNA-seq data are truly fate restricted, however, is unknown and would require additional experimental manipulation.</p><p>Some scRNA-seq studies have observed multipotent cells transiently expressing genes associated with two or more differentiated fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). These data challenge a classical bifurcating model of cell specification, suggesting that instead multipotent cells begin initiating GRNs characteristic of multiple fates before becoming committed to one lineage over others. We do not observe populations of cells expressing multiple fate derivatives in our data, though we do note that xanthoblasts have a more pan-NCC gene expression signature than differentiated xanthophores from 68 hpf embryos. However, we also note that our relatively small sample size for scRNA-seq datasets (607 cells) and lack of multiple sampled developmental stages may prohibit identifying multi-fate expressing cells. Future work sampling earlier stages is likely to provide further insight into how NCC early specification occurs in zebrafish and complement other studies in both mouse and chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling and Sauka-Spengler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zalc et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Other studies have used scRNA-seq to identify transcriptionally cryptic populations of cells associated with the leading edge of the cranial NCC migratory front in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>). In zebrafish, cell tracking studies in the trunk similarly suggest that a subset of migrating tNCCs act as leader cells forging a path along which follower NCCs migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). While we identify multiple transcriptionally unique populations of NCCs in our data, we do not identify a cluster of cells associated with this ‘leader’ cell type. Neither do we find any cluster in our data characterized by expression of orthologous genes that identify trailblazer NCCs in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison et al., 2017</xref>). Thus the identification of zebrafish trunk leader cell transcriptome remains open.</p><p>Though our experimental design targeted NCCs, we also sequenced a population of RB neurons and show that in zebrafish some RBs express <italic>sox10</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> transgenes. While these data do not directly test for a shared progenitor, it is intriguing to consider these data in the context of other studies showing that NCCs and RBs share a similar developmental origin at the neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olesnicky et al., 2010</xref>). Cells at the neural plate border are thought to be an equivalence group, able to differentiate into both NCCs and RBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>). Interactions among neural plate border cells, mediated in part by notch signaling, bias cells towards one fate over the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appel and Eisen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornell and Eisen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>). Our data suggesting that RBs express both <italic>sox10</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> transgenes seems to be in line with this idea of a shared developmental potential.</p><p>To what extent NCCs and RBs share a common progenitor and whether the evolution of these two tissues is temporally coincident at the root of the vertebrate phylogeny are questions that have long captured the imagination of scholars of vertebrate biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bone, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornell and Eisen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritzsch and Northcutt, 1993</xref>). The neural crest is a novel migratory cell population unique to vertebrates with no known homology to tissues in non-vertebrate chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gans and Northcutt, 1983</xref>), though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeffery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeffery et al., 2004</xref>. RBs are a non-migratory neuron with uncertain homology to morphologically similar motor neurons in non-vertebrate chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bone, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gans and Northcutt, 1983</xref>). Here, we identify a zebrafish RB transcriptome providing unique insight into the RB GRN. Future work identifying whether orthologous genes are expressed by motor neurons in non-vertebrate chordates could provide further insight into whether these morphologically similar neurons are homologous or homoplastic to vertebrate RB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCune and Schimenti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner, 2007</xref>). Whether emerging technologies like scRNA-seq will help illuminate the evolutionary origins of new tissue types such as RBs and NCCs only time will tell.</p><p>Ultimately, our data suggest that pre-migratory tNCCs are transcriptionally heterogenous and that some pre-migratory NCCs express differentiated pigment cell GRNs. Importantly, this finding is concordant with results from other recent studies in mouse and chick that similarly find NCCs expressing differentiation programs at pre-/early-migratory stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling and Sauka-Spengler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zalc et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, these single-cell genomic studies are challenging some classic models of NCC development that emphasize the role of environmental signals from the migratory environment in biasing NCCs towards one derivative state over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collazo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trainor and Krumlauf, 2000</xref>). In contrast, this emerging work emphasizes interactions among NCC progenitors in the neural tube as critical for specifying at least some NCCs towards different fates prior to migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raible and Eisen, 1996</xref>).</p><p>What mechanisms may be driving these data are speculative and an area of active interest in the field. Notch signaling plays a role in early NCC specification at the neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornell and Eisen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornell and Eisen, 2002</xref>), but whether notch signaling continues to play a role in specifying pre-migratory NCCs to different fates at later time points is unknown. Furthermore, there is a temporal component to NCC development. In most taxa, PNS NCCs migrate first and there is a delay before pigment NCC migration occurs. Thus, differences in signals that pre-migratory NCCs receive in the neural tube over time may play a role in biasing cells towards different fates. Ultimately, our and others’ data suggest that unknown interactions in the neural tube are critical for understanding NCC development, and that this pre-migratory period represents an area that deserves continued research attention.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Cells were filtered for quality based on mitochondrial gene expression (≤6% and ≥0.5%) and number of unique transcripts expressed (≥5000 and ≤16,000) in order to remove low-quality cells as well as any possible doublets. Data was normalized using the sctransform function in Seurat (variable features = 3000). Cells were clustered (resolution = 0.6) and projected with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method using the first 15 principal component analysis (PCA) axes as implemented in Seurat. To find marker genes associated with cell clusters, we performed differential expression using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as implemented by the FindAllMarkers command in Seurat (logfc.threshold = 0.5, min.pct = 0.25). Changing cell filtering, clustering, and UMAP projection parameters had minor affects and does not change major results of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further explore mitotic cells in cluster 5, we reanalyzed our data regressing out variation due to cell cycle, mitochondrial expression, and ribosomal expression either in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) or individually (not shown). For these analyses, we first calculated an estimate of cell cycle for each cell with the CellCycleScoring function in Seurat using zebrafish orthologs of cell cycle genes available from the Seurat website. We then regressed out the effects of these variables using the SCTransform function prior to clustering and analysis. The primary difference across different analyses is that most mitotic cells in cluster 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) group with other posterior arch cells from cluster 4 when cell cycle is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A smaller number of mitotic cells cluster with tNCC progenitors from cluster 1. Importantly, in all analyses we recover similar clusters of cells and marker genes, indicating that the major conclusions from these data are robust to differences in analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We used the package Velocyto to infer developmental pseudotime from our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>). This method uses estimates of RNA splicing from scRNA-seq data to infer how cells may be transitioning across different transcriptional states; the analysis assumes that the ratio of spliced to unspliced transcripts should provide an estimate of the time since a cell has started expressing a new set of genes associated with a different transcriptional state. We used the Python implementation of Velocyto to infer RNA splicing with default parameters, and the R implementation of Velocyto to infer RNA velocity (e.g., pseudo-time) with default parameters and plot velocities onto UMAP space.</p><p>To quantify GFP expression in RB cells, reads were aligned to the <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> green fluorescence protein sequence (EBI accession #AAA27722.1) using cell ranger (v5.0.1).

Custom RNA probes were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Probes were designed using either the B2 or B3 hairpin loop sequences with adaptor fluorophores of either Alexa Fluor 488 (B3) or Alexa Fluor 647 (B2). In situ hybridizations were conducted following Molecular Instruments protocol for whole-mount zebrafish. Samples from 25 somite (24 hpf), 8 somite, 15 somite, and 20 somite embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in methanol at –20°C. Samples were rehydrated in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and permeabilized for 5 min in 1 µg/mL proteinase K at room temperature. Hybridization was conducted using RNA probes diluted to 4 picamols/mL at 37°C overnight. Amplification was performed diluting hairpins to 60 picamols/mL at room temperature overnight.</p><p>Following in situ hybridization, Rohon–Beard cells were identified by HNK-1 immunofluorescence. Samples were blocked in IF blocking buffer (2% normal goat serum, 2% BSA, 1× PBS) at room temperature for a minimum of 1 hr. Primary mouse anti-HNK-1 antibody (Sigma) was diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer, and samples were incubated in this primary antibody at 4°C for 24–48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2011</xref>), and visualized using secondary goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594.</p><p>Samples were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. For whole-mount images, samples were mounted in 0.2% agarose and imaged at either 10× or 40× magnification. For co-expression of xanthophore genes, samples were cryosectioned every 15 µM and imaged at 63× magnification. For both whole-mount and sectioned samples, we imaged over the yolk extension in order to make images comparable.</p><p>Unless noted, all images are 3D projections from either whole-mount or sectioned material produced using either ImageJ or Napari.

This work presents a single-cell RNAseq dataset from zebrafish trunk neural crest cells during the early stages of migration that identifies the subpopulations of trunk neural crest cells, new genetic markers and a subset of Rohon-Beard neurons. The paper generates a dataset for further investigations and reports expression of differentiated pigment cell markers in the pre-migratory neural crest populations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell RNA analysis identifies pre-migratory neural crest cells expressing markers of differentiated derivatives&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor who also read the manuscript, has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should more clearly state how this study advances their past work that demonstrated the presence of HNK1+ (NV migratory marker) RB neurons in a well-characterized pdrm1 mutant (Hernandez-Lagunas et al., 2014).</p><p>2. Reviewers were also concerned that such an analysis performed at a single stage and at a relatively late time point cannot be used to infer common developmental origin or path. This raises questions about the identification of both sox10+ and sox10- RB neurons – both of which are lost in pdrm1 mutant – this finding should be more fully addressed appropriately.</p><p>3. Reviewers felt that there is a disconnect between the title and what forms the bulk of the discussion and figures in this paper. The authors should either change the title or put more emphasis on the findings that premigratory NCCs express markers of differentiated derivatives.</p><p>4. A stronger attempt should be made to compare/integrate their limited dataset with other more extensive existing datasets (Wagner et al.,2018) to investigate whether markers (fgf13a, cxcr4b) are expressed at earlier time points to help support the authors' hypothesis? Similarly, the authors do not seek to utilize single-cell datasets at later time points obtained using the same transgenic line to verify whether these markers are expressed (Aubrey et al., 2021). Further mining and integration with available datasets would help strengthen the authors' point.</p><p>5. When discussing their finding that some premigratory cells already express differentiated genes as a novelty but, the authors should cite studies that have shown this in the neural crest in zebrafish and other models (Soldatov et al., 2019, Ling et al., 2019).</p><p>6. The &quot;unknown&quot; cluster 7 described by the authors as a potential new NCC lineage cluster is most likely (authors should verify this) a previously reported mesenchymal cluster expressing a wealth of collagen genesl; this should be verified and rectified.</p><p>7. The claim 'Some of 156 cells (Cluster 5) are presumably neural tube tissue' is unclear, as sox10 found in Cluster 5 does not label neural tube. What are the Cluster 5 marker genes; they should be shown as Supp. Figure 1. Cluster 5 also seems to be split into two subclusters. Do different genes mark these regions? The authors should elaborate on the differential split of sox10-expressing and non-expressing cells within the cluster (feature plots in 1F indicate that sox10 is downregulated in the top left portion of this cluster and the RB cluster).</p><p>8. One of the primary novelty points emphasized by the authors is the subset of RB neurons. If this is to be confirmed, the authors should perform KO of some of the known marker genes specific to this cell population to show their relevance to RB cell development? What role do these subsets of NCC-RB cells play? While this experimental work is not essential, in the time of CRISPR/Cas9, querying such candidates in F0 generation would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>9. Important technical points: The study lacks sufficient information to verify the data quality and level of rigour in the analysis. For instance, information such as the number of embryos used to get 607 cells should be provided (this is important for defining genetic heterogeneity). What proportion of embryos were 20hpf and 24hpf? How many cells were loaded into the channel? What was the mean number of genes and UMI's were found per cell? How was the analysis performed, what were the parameters/cut-offs used? How many cells are found within each cluster? Furthermore, the data is not always of the highest quality, and figure annotations should be improved. In general, figures need better annotation and precision – indicating developmental stages on HCR images, the section's location, and clarifying the number of sections used for quantification. Also, figure legends should clearly describe annotation detail.</p><p>10. Figure 1 Supplement 1 while very visually appealing, it could have a stronger information content. The authors might consider presenting these results in the form of a dot plot (see Seurat function DotPlot), which in addition to conveying the 10 strongest markers of each of these clusters, would also provide information about (a) their expression level and (b) how specific they are to a particular population that might be helpful to readers. Additionally, the authors might consider adding something that presentation about which of those markers are novel, versus which are well established markers of these cell types. This could even be suitable for promotion into main figure 1, as it would add a lot of information content for readers interested in the neural crest and would clarify the novelty of the authors' findings.</p><p>11. The presentation and validation of the pair of novel markers for both the xanthophores and Rohon-Beard neurons are very compelling. However, it seems like there is a missed opportunity here to present more of the novel expression findings in a way that is accessible to a broader audience. While it would certainly be unrealistic to validate them all, it seems like it would be very valuable to provide a broader presentation of the convincing novel markers identified in these populations via differential expression as a figure (or figure panel) – perhaps dot plots or some other format.</p><p>12. Lines 217-218 &quot;While we cannot rule out that RB neurons are represented in our dataset due to the proximity of RBs and NCCs to each other in the neural tube&quot;. Whereas the presentation in Figure 3g, h that sox10::RFP labels some Rohon Beard neurons is convincing, the authors could go one step further – as they point out, the most likely other potential explanation would be that some of these represent doublets, where an RB neuron and another cell ended up in a droplet together perhaps due to imperfect dissociation. A fairly simple analysis that would help further exclude this possibility would be to simply check whether any of the cells identified as RB neurons express markers that are exclusive markers of another cell type in the dataset that is expected to be sox10+. If they do not, then they are unlikely to represent a combination of two cells. (This could be done in fancy ways, but also simply by checking in scatter plots or some other format the expression of the best markers of other clusters in the RB neurons.) It would provide an additional piece of strong evidence that some RB neurons must have expressed sox10 at some point in their developmental history.</p><p>13. That some cells prior to migration express markers of pigment cells is convincingly demonstrated. One is left wondering – do the authors think that ALL pigment cells begin to express their markers prior to migration? Are all of the migrating tNCCs that are not expressing cell-type specific markers bound to become PNS derivatives? If there are data from sox10 lines that perhaps estimate the percentage of cells that give rise to these different cell types. The authors could make statements in the Discussion section to help clear this up.</p><p>14. The authors note expression of fgf13a in the RB neuron cluster and comment that &quot;FGF and chemokine signaling are critical for proper morphogenesis..&quot; and later &quot;The RBs are apparently sources of and responsive to morphogens important for development. The authors need to reconsider this interpretation of fgf13 expression in RBs, as Fgf13 belongs to the class of intracellular FGF, iFGFs, which are not secreted and have no identified interaction with signaling FGFRs (Ornitz DM, Wires Dev Bio, 2015).</p><p>15. Discussion could have more explanation or speculation about why only NCCs expressing pigment cell markers are observed prior to migration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66078.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

At the stage studied in zebrafish, HNK-1 marks Rohon-Beard neurons, and unlike chick, does not label migratory NCCs.</p><p>Both NCCs and RBs require prdm1a for proper specification. We present a new panel to Figure 4 that summarizes the GRNs for both NCCs and RBs. Characterizing the expression of these genes in the prdm1a mutant is important because it both (1) confirms expression of these genes to the NCC/RB lineages respectively, and (2) puts these genes within known NCC/RB GRNs. We discuss how these data affect our previous and ongoing work in the results (lines: 301-317). These data identify an RB transcriptome and we discuss relevance of this for past and future work in the discussion (lines:362-387).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We do not think that these data directly support a common developmental origin. However, we do not think it is appropriate to ignore the decades of literature hypothesizing a common developmental origin. Finding RBs in our dataset was unexpected result. We were also shocked to observe low level expression of sox10 in RBs. We further note that crestin, another gene that labels NCCs in zebrafish, is expressed by RBs in an independent dataset (Wagner et al. 2018). We have gone through our manuscript to be sure that we are careful in how we address this issue. We feel that it is important to consider these data within the context of other similarities among these two cell populations without making a direct claim of shared developmental origin. We agree that future work is needed to tease this apart. We are currently studying the function and expression of RB GRNs identified from these data, and future scRNAseq analyses at earlier developmental stages may help to further illuminate this long-standing hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In particular, analyses integrating our dataset with those of Howard et al. 2021 and Wagner et al. 2018 support our finding that pre-migratory tNCCs express markers of differentiated derivatives (see below). Thus we feel that our manuscript stresses a finding that pre/early migratory tNCCs are already expressing markers of differentiated derivatives. This is shown by both scRNA-seq analyses and confirmation of some xanthophore marker genes by ISH. While we are willing to change our title if requested, we would rather not. In our opinion the current title communicates a major finding from the data that will be interest to other researchers in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This work has led to a new section in the main text, and we have modified our figures to produce a new figure 2 that covers this integrated data analysis.</p><p>Importantly, these analyses of the integrated data further support the main findings and arguments that we made in the original manuscript. NCCs cluster by cell identity when integrating our data with Howard et al. 2021 or Wanger et al. 2018. As noted in the comment, Aubrey Howard et al. 2021 samples tNCCs using the same transgene as our own study, but at older developmental stages. We find that cells from our dataset cluster with similar cell types from these older embryos. Pigment cells that we identify as expressing markers of differentiated derivatives group with pigment cells at these later stages. Further, pre-migratory xanthoblasts that we characterize from 24 hpf embryos express the same genes as differentiated xanthophores sampled from 68hpf embryos. Thus, this integrated analysis supports our hypothesis that pre-migratory NCCs are already expressing markers of differentiated derivatives. We do observe some pigment cell maturation and comment on these findings in the manuscript. We note that tNCCs at 24hpf do not express markers of differentiated neurons supporting the hypothesis that NCCs delay expressing PNS associated genes until post-migratory stages.</p><p>Integrating our data with Wagner et al. 2018 produces a similar result in that cells in our dataset cluster with similarly annotated cells in the Wagner et al. dataset. Importantly, Wagner et al. sampled whole embryos and annotated a small number of cells as RBs. RBs from our dataset cluster with RBs from Wagner et al. and these cells, derived from these independent studies, express the same genes. These data confirm our own analyses and further extend support for identification of genes previously unknown to be expressed by RBs.</p><p>In addition to these integrated analyses, we directly looked at how gene expression changes across developmental time by using HCR to examine expression of xanthoblast and RB marker genes at earlier developmental stages. These data are included as Figure 3—supplement1, support our previous findings, and are discussed in lines: 253-258 and 282-284.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. When discussing their finding that some premigratory cells already express differentiated genes as a novelty but, the authors should cite studies that have shown this in the neural crest in zebrafish and other models (Soldatov et al., 2019, Ling et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and have rectified discussion of these missing citations. We thank the reviewers for bringing our attention to this oversight on our part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The &quot;unknown&quot; cluster 7 described by the authors as a potential new NCC lineage cluster is most likely (authors should verify this) a previously reported mesenchymal cluster expressing a wealth of collagen genesl; this should be verified and rectified.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great hypothesis and supported by integrating our data with other datasets that fully sample a ‘mesenchymal’ NCC cell type (see above). In these integrated analyses cells in this cluster group with mesenchymal NCCs from these other datasets. We now label these cells as “mesenchymal”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The claim 'Some of 156 cells (Cluster 5) are presumably neural tube tissue' is unclear, as sox10 found in Cluster 5 does not label neural tube. What are the Cluster 5 marker genes; they should be shown as Supp. Figure 1. Cluster 5 also seems to be split into two subclusters. Do different genes mark these regions? The authors should elaborate on the differential split of sox10-expressing and non-expressing cells within the cluster (feature plots in 1F indicate that sox10 is downregulated in the top left portion of this cluster and the RB cluster).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. These cells express many neural markers that are also in the neural plate and neural tube (as well as many neurons). We provide a greater detailed discussion of these cells as a new Figure1—supplement 3. We note that these cells are characterized by the expression of many neural genes from the neural plate and a number of zic transcription factors, as well as lower (but not absent) sox10. Thus these cells may represent ‘early’ NCCs still expressing a number of NPB genes. Some of these marker genes are also expressed by a limited number of NCC progenitors. We refer to these cells as ‘neural’ and note in the main text that they are characterized by expression of multiple neural plate genes (lines: 145-152).</p><p>The comment that the cluster is split is in reference to when the data are analyzed by regressing out biologic variation due to cell cycle etc. In this case, some cells that otherwise group with NCCs now cluster with neural cells (see Figure 1—supplement1). These neural/NCC cells are almost certainly NCCs and express NCC marker genes (e.g. sox10 etc) but not neural plate genes (olig3, zic2a, etc). This is a rather minor observation in the data, and does not affect any major conclusions, and thus we do not feel a lengthy discussion is necessary on this topic. Instead, a broader discussion of the analysis is provided in the manuscript where appropriate that shows how the same conclusions are reached regardless of different analysis parameters (Figure 1—supplement 1, lines:107-115, 449-460).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. One of the primary novelty points emphasized by the authors is the subset of RB neurons. If this is to be confirmed, the authors should perform KO of some of the known marker genes specific to this cell population to show their relevance to RB cell development? What role do these subsets of NCC-RB cells play? While this experimental work is not essential, in the time of CRISPR/Cas9, querying such candidates in F0 generation would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great idea, and one we are pursuing. However, we agree that this work is not essential for the current manuscript and feel that making CRISPR/Cas9 KOs is outside of the scope of the current study. In our experience, phenotypes from mosaic CRISPR F0s are often not seen in the full knockout F1s. We are thus hesitant to do a study of F0 mosaic embryos. To do these KO studies, we would want to make F1 heterozygous mutants carrying loss of function alleles, and study the function of these genes in the F2+ generations. This would take substantial time to generate these mutants and characterize them sufficiently. So while we absolutely love this idea, and it is a focus of ongoing research, we feel that this is future work and not necessary for the conclusions drawn in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Important technical points: The study lacks sufficient information to verify the data quality and level of rigour in the analysis. For instance, information such as the number of embryos used to get 607 cells should be provided (this is important for defining genetic heterogeneity).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided this information in the methods, results, and figure legends where appropriate. We used the trunks from 80 embryos for cell dissociation (lines:91, 418-420).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What proportion of embryos were 20hpf and 24hpf?</p></disp-quote><p>All embryos are of the same stage. We age them as 20-24hpf to account for uncertainty in fertilization time. This is fairly standard practice in zebrafish (see Howard et al. 2021). Further, we note that time is a poor substitute for developmental stage as slight differences in temperature can mean that 24 hpf embryos of very different stages. This is why we also have staged these embryos to the 25 segment stage. We have moved this information into the results from the methods (line 91).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many cells were loaded into the channel? What was the mean number of genes and UMI's were found per cell? How was the analysis performed, what were the parameters/cut-offs used? How many cells are found within each cluster? Furthermore, the data is not always of the highest quality, and figure annotations should be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>These are now provided in the methods where appropriate. We loaded approximated 10000 cells. Median number of UMI = 4255 and genes/features = 32425. Analysis parameters and cutoffs are indicated in methods (lines 436-448). Number of cells per cluster is now indicated in parentheses within the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, figures need better annotation and precision – indicating developmental stages on HCR images, the section's location, and clarifying the number of sections used for quantification. Also, figure legends should clearly describe annotation detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our figure legends to provide more information. Developmental stage and section location is indicated. Samples sizes for quantification are included in appropriate legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 1 Supplement 1 while very visually appealing, it could have a stronger information content. The authors might consider presenting these results in the form of a dot plot (see Seurat function DotPlot), which in addition to conveying the 10 strongest markers of each of these clusters, would also provide information about (a) their expression level and (b) how specific they are to a particular population that might be helpful to readers. Additionally, the authors might consider adding something that presentation about which of those markers are novel, versus which are well established markers of these cell types. This could even be suitable for promotion into main figure 1, as it would add a lot of information content for readers interested in the neural crest and would clarify the novelty of the authors' findings.</p><p>11. The presentation and validation of the pair of novel markers for both the xanthophores and Rohon-Beard neurons are very compelling. However, it seems like there is a missed opportunity here to present more of the novel expression findings in a way that is accessible to a broader audience. While it would certainly be unrealistic to validate them all, it seems like it would be very valuable to provide a broader presentation of the convincing novel markers identified in these populations via differential expression as a figure (or figure panel) – perhaps dot plots or some other format.</p></disp-quote><p>These are great ideas. We have updated figure 1 to provide more information on marker genes associated with different cell clusters. We also show additional feature plots for each cluster to visualize gene expression patterns. This new figure 1 provides much more data for readers interested in what genes mark different cell clusters and how restricted different genes are to these different clusters.</p><p>We further provide information in supplements to figure 1 that provide further insight into the genes that mark the xanthoblast, RB, and neural cell clusters. We show the top 80 genes (filtering out SI:#### genes for clarity) that mark each of these clusters. These new supplementary figures provide much more information to the reader on known and novel genes that mark these clusters of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Lines 217-218 &quot;While we cannot rule out that RB neurons are represented in our dataset due to the proximity of RBs and NCCs to each other in the neural tube&quot;. Whereas the presentation in Figure 3g, h that sox10::RFP labels some Rohon Beard neurons is convincing, the authors could go one step further – as they point out, the most likely other potential explanation would be that some of these represent doublets, where an RB neuron and another cell ended up in a droplet together perhaps due to imperfect dissociation. A fairly simple analysis that would help further exclude this possibility would be to simply check whether any of the cells identified as RB neurons express markers that are exclusive markers of another cell type in the dataset that is expected to be sox10+. If they do not, then they are unlikely to represent a combination of two cells. (This could be done in fancy ways, but also simply by checking in scatter plots or some other format the expression of the best markers of other clusters in the RB neurons.) It would provide an additional piece of strong evidence that some RB neurons must have expressed sox10 at some point in their developmental history.</p></disp-quote><p>We like this idea a lot and generated a new supplementary Figure that shows this (Figure 1— supplement 4). We note that (1) FAC sorting gated for single cells, (2) our bioinformatic pipeline filtered cells for quality and doublets (e.g. very high number of genes), and (3) scatterplots showing that RBs do not express genes that mark other NCC populations. The one caveat here is that we see three RB cells that do express mitfa. However, these data overwhelming indicate that RBs are not expressing other NCC genes and thus unlikely to be doublets. Interestingly, we do find low sox10 expression in these RB cells. We also note that independent data from Wagner et al. 2018 observe crestin expression in RBs. These data do not rule out the possibility that RBs are doublets, but we find this explanation unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. That some cells prior to migration express markers of pigment cells is convincingly demonstrated. One is left wondering – do the authors think that ALL pigment cells begin to express their markers prior to migration? Are all of the migrating tNCCs that are not expressing cell-type specific markers bound to become PNS derivatives? If there are data from sox10 lines that perhaps estimate the percentage of cells that give rise to these different cell types. The authors could make statements in the Discussion section to help clear this up.</p><p>15. Discussion could have more explanation or speculation about why only NCCs expressing pigment cell markers are observed prior to migration.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. No, we do not find NCCs at 24hpf expressing markers of the peripheral nervous system. This is further supported by integrating our data with Howard et al. 2021 where differentiated peripheral nervous system neurons are present in 48 and 68 hpf embryos. In these integrated analyses NCCs from 24hpf embryos group with pigment cells from older embryos reflecting expression of pigment lineage genes in these pre-migratory NCCs. In contrast, NCCs from 24hpf embryos do not group with neural derivative cells from these 48 and 68 hpf embryos. This suggests that NCCs do not express genes marking PNS derivatives until post-migratory stages. We have included this as discussion in the relevant locations of the results (lines 177-186) and discussion (lines 326-332).</p><p>To our knowledge there is not a clear estimate of the percentage of cells that give rise to these different cell types. However our qualitative observations are that fewer NCC cells migrate along the medial path during the 24 hpf time point than are pre-migratory pigment cells in the neural tube.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The authors note expression of fgf13a in the RB neuron cluster and comment that &quot;FGF and chemokine signaling are critical for proper morphogenesis..&quot; and later &quot;The RBs are apparently sources of and responsive to morphogens important for development. The authors need to reconsider this interpretation of fgf13 expression in RBs, as Fgf13 belongs to the class of intracellular FGF, iFGFs, which are not secreted and have no identified interaction with signaling FGFRs (Ornitz DM, Wires Dev Bio, 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an oversight on our part and one that we also discovered with further reading while our manuscript was in review. We apologize, and have updated our discussion of these data to account for what is known about these non-canonical fgfs. They seem to play a role in solute carrier binding and critical for neuron function. It is intriguing to us that these fgf13 paralogs are not expressed in all neurons, suggesting some specific role that is required for some neuronal function but not critical for pan-neuronal function.</p></body></sub-article></article>
