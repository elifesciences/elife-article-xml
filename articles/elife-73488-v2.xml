These diverse clinical outcomes are directly associated with parasite strain and species diversity. Although <italic>Leishmania</italic> reproduction is mainly clonal, a cryptic sexual cycle capable of producing hybrid genotypes has been inferred from population genetic studies and directly demonstrated by laboratory crosses. Experimentally, mating competence has been largely confined to promastigotes developing in the sand fly midgut. The ability to hybridize culture promastigotes in vitro has been limited so far to low-efficiency crosses between two <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> strains, L747 and MA37, that mate with high efficiency in flies. Here, we show that exposure of promastigote cultures to DNA damage stress produces a remarkably enhanced efficiency of in vitro hybridization of the <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains and extends to other species, including <italic>Leishmania donovani, Leishmania infantum,</italic> and <italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic>, a capacity to generate intra- and interspecific hybrids. Whole-genome sequencing and total DNA content analyses indicate that the hybrids are in each case full genome, mostly tetraploid hybrids. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the L747 and MA37 parental lines highlights the transcriptome heterogeneity of culture promastigotes and reveals discrete clusters that emerge post-irradiation in which genes potentially involved in genetic exchange are expressed, including the ancestral gamete fusogen <italic>HAP2</italic>. By generating reporter constructs for HAP2, we could select for promastigotes that could either hybridize or not in vitro. Overall, this work reveals that there are specific populations involved in <italic>Leishmania</italic> hybridization associated with a discernible transcriptomic signature, and that stress facilitated in vitro hybridization can be a transformative approach to generate large numbers of hybrid genotypes between diverse species and strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>mating</kwd><kwd>Hap2</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>hybridization</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>WGS</kwd><kwd>NGS</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania tropica</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania donovani</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania braziliensis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania infantum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paun</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009826</institution-id><institution>University of Colombo, Sri Lanka</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIAID Award Number U01AI136033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karunaweera</surname><given-names>Nadira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Following exposure of <italic>Leishmania</italic> culture promastigotes to DNA stress, single-cell RNA sequencing reveals discrete clusters of cells associated with efficient generation of hybrids between different species and strains in vitro marked by expression of the ancestral gamete fusogen HAP2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protozoan parasites of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genus produce a spectrum of diseases in their mammalian hosts, including humans, ranging from self-limiting cutaneous lesions and tissue-destructive mucosal involvement to infection of the deep viscera that is fatal in the absence of treatment. These clinical outcomes are associated with an extraordinary diversity of <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and strains, with more than 20 species that are pathogenic to humans. All members of the genus have a dimorphic life cycle consisting of extracellular promastigotes that multiply asexually in the digestive tract of their sand fly vectors, and amastigotes that multiply asexually in the phagosomes of their mammalian host cells, primarily macrophages. <italic>Leishmania</italic> were long considered to be essentially clonal, with genetic diversity arising from gradual accumulation of somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tibayrenc et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The reproductive strategies of <italic>Leishmania</italic> are now known to include a cryptic sexual cycle that has been inferred from the analysis of hybrid genotypes observed in natural isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bañuls et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dujardin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nolder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Odiwuor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ravel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>) and directly demonstrated by the generation of hybrids between different <italic>Leishmania</italic> strains and species in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akopyants et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inbar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadlova et al., 2011</xref>). The latter involved mating between extracellular promastigotes stages developing in the sand fly and was achieved by coinfection of flies with two parental lines bearing different drug resistance markers, with subsequent selection of double-drug-resistant cells. Experimentally at least, the sexual cycle is nonobligatory, relatively rare, and confined to life-cycle stages present in the sand fly midgut. Based on whole-genome sequencing analyses, the allele inheritance patterns of experimental hybrids provide strong evidence that the system of genetic exchange in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is Mendelian and involves meiosis-like sexual recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inbar et al., 2019</xref>). Homologues of meiosis-specific genes are found within the genomes of <italic>Leishmania</italic> and are expressed by stages in the sand fly<italic>,</italic> including the core meiotic genes <italic>SPO11, HOP1,</italic> and <italic>DMC1</italic> involved in creating DNA double-strand breaks, homologous chromosome alignment, and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inbar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramesh et al., 2005</xref>). Homologues of the cell and nuclear fusion proteins HAP2 and GEX1, respectively, have also been found in ancestral trypanosomatid lineages and extant <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, providing indirect evidence that sex was already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Speijer et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, there has been no direct evidence that any of these genes or their products are involved in <italic>Leishmania</italic> genetic exchange, and due to the difficulty of making direct observations of the mating events in the sand fly, the precise nature of this reproductive process, including the identification of putative gametic cells, has been difficult to study.</p><p>We recently reported that <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes, which can be grown readily in axenic culture, can form stable hybrids entirely in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Louradour et al., 2020</xref>). While this result proved that mating competent cells can arise in culture, its broader applicability to study the biology of mating and to generate recombinant parasites for genetic linkage analysis was limited by the fact that the in vitro hybridization was confined to only two strains of <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> and occurred at frequencies far lower than in the sand fly. In the current studies, we have investigated the conditions that might potentiate the mating success of <italic>Leishmania</italic> in vitro. It is common for organisms that are facultatively sexual to undergo sex in response to environmental stress, including conditions that produce DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ram and Hadany, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoustra et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a primary function of sex is proposed to be an adaptation for DNA repair, for which a homologous, undamaged chromosome serves as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>). Amongst eukaryotic microbes, oxidative DNA-damaging conditions have been shown to promote sexual spore formation in the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein and Johns, 1989</xref>) and in the multicellular green alga <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nedelcu et al., 2004</xref>). Oxidative stress also efficiently induced the expression of sexual pheromone precursors and same-sex mating in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guan et al., 2019</xref>). DNA damage caused by X-irradiation induced meiotic recombination in the budding yeast <italic>Sacchromyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thorne and Byers, 1993</xref>) and in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). In the current studies, we have used DNA-damaging conditions to promote in vitro hybridization of <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), or to γ-radiation produced a remarkably enhanced efficiency in the in vitro hybridization of the <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains, and extended to other species and strains a capacity for in vitro hybridization. Single-cell RNA-seq comparisons of untreated and irradiated promastigotes revealed greatly expanded subpopulations amongst the irradiated cells that expressed homologues of genes involved in genetic exchange. We identified expression of the ancestral gamete fusogen <italic>HAP2</italic> as a selectable marker for promastigotes able to hybridize in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stress conditions increase the frequency of <italic>Leishmania</italic> hybrid formation in vitro</title><p>We recently developed a protocol for generating <italic>Leishmania</italic> hybrids completely in vitro using two <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains, L747 and MA37, each transfected with different drug resistance and fluorescent markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Louradour et al., 2020</xref>). While this protocol achieved the recovery of stable, full-genome hybrids, referred to as LMA hybrids, the frequency of in vitro hybridization was notably low (minimum frequency of hybridizing cells ranging between 10<sup>–7</sup> and 10<sup>–9</sup>), particularly in comparison to the frequency of LMA hybrids generated in sand fly coinfection experiments. Stress conditions leading to DNA damage have been shown in other organisms to trigger their sexual reproductive cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ram and Hadany, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoustra et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we chose exposure to γ-radiation, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or MMS, treatments known for their genotoxic effects, as experimental stress conditions. To assess the effects of these treatments on the frequency of hybrid formation in vitro, both the L747 RFP-Hyg and MA37 GFP-Neo parental lines were pretreated or not with the various conditions, and then were mixed without any drug selection and distributed into 96-well plates. For each experiment, the numbers of parental cells present in each well, counted at the moment of mixing, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. After 24 hr, the content of each well was transferred into double-drug-selective medium (hygromycin and neomycin) in 24-well plates. In untreated conditions, a low proportion (1.7%) of wells yielded double-drug-resistant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). When L747 and MA37 parental lines were pre-exposed to either γ-radiation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or MMS, the frequency of positive wells averaged 63.7, 26.5, or 34.5%, respectively, in the four independent experiments conducted for each treatment. These increased frequencies were observed despite the fact that fewer of the pretreated L747 and MA37 cells were present at the initiation of co-culture due to the negative impact of each of these treatments on parasite growth. Growth curves of L747 and MA37 parasites cultures after exposure to γ-radiation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MMS are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the culture growth showed a total area ratio of 0.71-fold and 0.44-fold in irradiated L747 and MA37 cultures, respectively, compared to their respective untreated controls. The minimal frequency of hybridizing cells for the two parental lines, calculated using the number of input cells at the start of each co-culture and assuming that each positive well contained only one hybridization event, was between 10<sup>–8</sup> and 10<sup>–9</sup> in untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These frequencies increased between 59- and 347-fold when the cultures were submitted to the different stress conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stress treatments strongly enhance in vitro hybridization of <italic>L.</italic> <italic>tropica</italic> L747 and MA37.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Proportion of culture wells exhibiting growth of LMA hybrids when exposed to γ-radiation (<bold>A</bold>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<bold>B</bold>), or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<bold>C</bold>); data are presented as mean values (black line) and individual measurements.

To evaluate the applicability of the current protocol to different species, we performed a series of crosses using different pairs of parental lines exposed or not to γ-radiation.

These results suggest that tetraploid intermediates, as have been described in some fungi, might reflect a normal part of the sexual cycle in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. In this context, under the conditions of irradiation-facilitated hybridization in vitro, promastigotes capable of cell and nuclear fusion can be generated but somehow fail to complete the ploidy reduction steps of the meiotic cycle. In attempts to promote these processes, selected LMA tetraploid clones were re-exposed to stress conditions, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and γ-radiation, and/or were passed through sand flies. All of these attempts to induce ploidy changes in the LMA hybrids were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To determine the copy number of individual chromosomes and their respective parental genome contributions, we performed whole-genome sequencing of selected progeny clones. For somy quantification, the average of coverage for each chromosome was scaled to the ploidy of the cells. The somy profiles of the parents and hybrid clones are depicted as heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The parental somies are in each case close to 2n, with the exception of chr 31, which is trisomic in every parent, along with other chromosomes that show close to 3n profiles in combinations that are specific to the parental line, for example, chrs 8, 20.1 in <italic>Lb</italic>RicX; chrs 5, 12, 26, 33 in <italic>Li</italic>LLM320. The majority of the chromosomes that are 2n in both parents are close to 4n in the hybrid progeny. For those chromosomes that are close to 3n in one of the parents, the hybrid somies are in most cases close to 5n, while chromosomes that are close to 3n in both parents are close to 6n in the hybrids. These inheritance patterns reinforce the conclusion that the hybrids are products of the fusion of the complete parental genomes. There are, nonetheless, a large number of hybrid chromosomes that deviate from the expected additive copy number, showing an apparent gain or loss of somy. As a result, within a particular cross each of the hybrids appear to possess a unique combination of somies. This plasticity was related to hybridization and was not driven by the irradiation per se since four independent subclones and one uncloned line of the irradiated L747 parent did not show any changes in somy from the untreated line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>For all intra- and interspecific hybrids analyzed, we could observe biallelic inheritance of almost all of the nuclear homozygous SNPs that are different between the two parental lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that they are full-genome hybrids. The SNP inheritance profiles are depicted as Circos plots showing the relative parental contributions of homozygous SNPs across all 35 (chr 20 in <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> is a single chromosome product of a fusion between chrs 20 and 34 but is analyzed as chrs 20.1 and 20.2 in the plot) or 36 chromosomes. While the tetraploid hybrids show generally balanced contributions of chromosomes from both parents, in many cases asymmetric contributions are observed, for example, chrs 12, 16, 21, 30 in IMA (<italic>Lt</italic>MA37 × <italic>Li</italic>LLM320) hybrid Ac5a, for which three copies are contributed by the <italic>Lt</italic>MA37 parent, and one copy by <italic>Li</italic>LLM320. Rare instances of uniparental inheritance involving a particular chromosome are also observed, for example, chr 12 in Mondo06 (<italic>Ld</italic>Mongi × <italic>Ld</italic>SL2706) hybrid Cc5a, for which loss of heterozygosity is inferred. There are a substantial number of chromosomes for which the asymmetric or uniparental inheritance patterns involve only part of the chromosome, for example, chr 32 in IMA Ac5a; chrs 17 and 26 in IMA Ba4a; chrs 4, 13, 34 in Mondo06 Cb6a; chrs 20, 29 in MIR (<italic>Lb</italic>RicX × <italic>Lb</italic>M1) 1a; and chrs 14, 32 in MIR 3a, implying recombination between homologous chromosomes. The asymmetric parental contributions, both partial and complete at the level of individual somy, are highlighted in the Circos plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. For the 17 <italic>Ld</italic>Mongi × <italic>Ld</italic>SL2706 hybrids analyzed, 102 chromosomes, or 17% of the total, show evidence of either recombination or the gain or loss of somy producing unbalanced contribution of the parental alleles.</p><p>Additional analysis of SNPs detected in the kDNA (mitochondrial DNA equivalent) of <italic>L. tropica</italic> MoMA crosses indicates the uniparental inheritance of parental maxicircle sequences in the irradiation-facilitated hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) between irradiated and nonirradiated promastigotes to help define transcripts and possible rare cell types associated with hybridization in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ workflow (10X Genomics) and Illumina sequencing, gene expression analysis with the Seurat R toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) was carried out on 20,122 and 16,708 cells obtained from duplicate cultures of L747 and MA37, respectively, exposed or not to γ-radiation, 1 day post-inoculation of a log-growth culture at 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> promastigotes per mL. After filtering the data to remove potential cell multiplets, dying cells or cells with poor quality transcripts (see Materials and methods), 20,087 L747 (13,392 untreated plus 6695 irradiated) and 16,645 MA37 (8156 and 8489 irradiated) cells remained, with expression of 8156 different genes detected and a median number of 1079 different mRNAs detected per cell.

First, analysis of the untreated parasite samples separately from irradiated cells revealed a transcriptomic heterogeneity among promastigotes within the same mid-logarithmic-phase culture, which would not be detectable using bulk-RNA sequencing without prior cell sorting.

As expected for <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell cultures at early-log growth, the majority of the single-cell gene transcriptomes reflect the predominance of proliferative procyclic promastigotes over other life-cycle stages. The main core of clusters identified in the untreated samples of both strains revealed transcripts found to be upregulated in procyclics by bulk RNA analyses, while cells that upregulate a restricted number of metacyclic-specific genes comprise a small, discrete cluster only in untreated MA37 (cluster 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

For both L747 and MA37, submitting the cells to γ-radiation altered the relative distribution of cells within particular clusters, with greatly increased cell frequencies in cluster 2 for the irradiated vs. untreated L747 cells (47.5% vs. 1.5%) and cluster 1 for MA37 (36.2% vs. 2.7%) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast, the relative abundance of cells in MA37 cluster 3 decreased after treatment, suggesting that cells from this cluster might be closely related to the irradiation-induced MA37 cluster 1. The dominant cluster 2 in the irradiated L747 culture stands out as a spatially separated cluster, consistent with the PCA plot showing the relatively strong effect that the γ-radiation has on altering the transcriptome of this strain.</p><p>Relative expression of the top 10 upregulated transcripts in each of the seven clusters in each strain revealed the different gene expression profiles in the subgroups of cultured promastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

In each case, the tag was inserted by CRISPR/Cas9 in the N-terminal part of the ORF, so that the endogenous sequences, in particular the 3′UTR involved in post-transcriptional regulation, would not be affected. The intensity of mNG expression detected by flow cytometry was low in both parental strains, but in both cases a proportion of cells reproducibly expressed a fluorescence level higher than the negative control (L747 or MA37 cultures without the reporter construct; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and G</xref>). Following inoculation of fresh cultures with stationary phase L747 mNG-HAP2 promastigotes, an average of only 3.0% of cells expressed mNG-HAP2 in the untreated condition at day 1 post-inoculation, whereas at the same time point 23.4% of the L747 irradiated cells expressed mNG-HAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By day 2 post-inoculation, mNG-HAP2<sup>+</sup> cells in the irradiated cultures were detected at frequencies closer to those of untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the irradiated cells transiently upregulate HAP2 expression during log-phase growth. A similar pattern of increased frequency of mNG-HAP2<sup>+</sup> cells was observed for L747 parasites treated with either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) or MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), although in each case the elevated expression persisted until day 4 of culture, and the effect was especially pronounced in the MMS-treated cells (60.2% mNG-HAP2<sup>+</sup>). For the MA37 reporter line, HAP2 expression was again elevated on day 1 post-inoculation as cells transitioned into log-phase growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref>). In this case, however, the proportions of mNG-HAP2<sup>+</sup> cells were not significantly different at day 1 comparing treated and irradiated cultures (32.8% vs. 28.9%, p=0.8857 Mann–Whitney test), which was consistent in all stress treatments. By day 2, the relative frequencies were altered, with levels declining in the untreated cells and increasing in the irradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

The relatively high frequency of mNG-HAP2<sup>+</sup> cells in the untreated MA37 cultures was surprising given the scRNA-seq comparisons showing the large expansion of HAP2-expressing cells in the irradiation-induced cluster, and suggests that HAP2 can be expressed under nonstress conditions even if not necessarily within the same population of promastigotes. By contrast, HAP2 expression in the L747 parent appears more dependent on induction by exposure to stress.

While these initial findings established that mating-competent forms can arise in axenic culture, the mating frequencies were extremely low, and only a single pairwise combination of <italic>L. tropica</italic> parental lines would successfully hybridize. In the current studies, we demonstrate that under various conditions of environmental stress, including exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, MMS, or γ-radiation, the in vitro hybridization capacity of the <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains could be markedly enhanced and extended to other <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains and multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, including <italic>L. infantum, L. donovani,</italic> and <italic>L. braziliensis</italic>. The products of these cell fusion events were in each case full-genome, polyploid hybrids. By single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we could identify transcriptionally unique populations of promastigotes whose numbers were drastically increased in each parental line following exposure to γ-radiation, and for which specific meiotic gene homologues, including the ancestral gamete fusogen HAP2, were found to be upregulated. By generating reporter constructs for HAP2, we could select for promastigotes that could hybridize or not in vitro.</p><p>Our findings add to the list of facultatively sexual eukaryotes, including yeast and green alga, that exhibit more sexual events under stress conditions. As each of the stress conditions that we imposed are known to produce DNA damage, the results also support studies in varied model eukaryotes, suggesting that DNA repair is a central adaptive function of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ram and Hadany, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoustra et al., 2010</xref>). Homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis provides an undamaged, template chromosome for DNA repair. The generation and repair of double-strand breaks is evidenced in our in vitro hybrids by the substantial number of chromosomes for which there were changes within the chromosome in the relative contribution of the parental alleles. A role for SPO11 protein in the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks is argued to be a universal feature of meiotic crossover events in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). However, meiotic recombination induced by X-irradiation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was shown to occur even when SPO11 was absent or nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thorne and Byers, 1993</xref>). In our studies, expression of the homologous <italic>SPO11</italic> gene in <italic>L. tropica</italic> was not upregulated in the irradiated, hybridization-competent cells.</p><p>In order to identify hybridization-competent cells present in <italic>Leishmania</italic> cultures, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of L747 and MA37 cultured cells exposed or not to γ-radiation. To our knowledge, this is the first application of single-cell transcriptomics in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, although it has been applied to other kinetoplastid pathogens to reveal the heterogeneity of the parasite populations arising in their mammalian hosts or insect vectors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2021</xref>). Our analyses revealed transcriptomic heterogeneity within and between the parental <italic>L. tropica</italic> lines in the promastigote cultures. The heterogeneity likely reflects cells in different phases of the cell cycle, as well as differences in the developmental stage progression of the cultured promastigotes. The extensive differences in the transcriptomes of cells comparing the parental lines, apparent in both the PCA and UMAP visualizations, are surprising given the genetic similarity between these <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iantorno et al., 2017</xref>) and likely reflect their different culture histories.</p><p>More meaningful to the current studies is the cluster heterogeneity comparing the untreated versus irradiated cells, which for each parental line revealed the emergence of a transcriptionally unique population in the irradiated cultures. Probing the clusters for enriched transcripts related to meiotic processes identified homologues of HAP2, GEX1, and RAD51, involved respectively in cell fusion, nuclear fusion, and DNA repair, that were largely confined to the unique clusters that emerged in the irradiated cultures. Even though a large fraction of the transcriptional shift is likely explained as part of a more global cellular mechanism to recover from stress caused by the irradiation, the expansion of cells expressing HAP2 transcripts in treated samples, the co-regulation of other meiotic genes (a HAP2-like FusM homologue, GEX1, and RAD51), and validation in vitro using HAP2 reporters, all strongly suggest that these cells are associated with the enhanced hybridization frequency observed post-treatment. The possible role in genetic exchange of other genes coordinately expressed with HAP2 but without any described meiotic function will be investigated in future studies. Of note, RNA-binding proteins, such as RBP5 and ZC3H11, were found to be upregulated in these cells and could have novel regulatory functions during <italic>Leishmania</italic> mating. Critically, we did not find significant upregulation of other meiosis-specific markers, including <italic>SPO11</italic>, <italic>DMC1,</italic> and <italic>MND1</italic>. This suggests that cell fusion might be a response to DNA stress that is independent of a meiotic program, especially as the meiotic reduction steps were for the most part absent in the stress-induced hybrids. Nevertheless, a similar finding was recently reported in an scRNA-seq analysis of <italic>T. brucei</italic> stages in the tsetse fly salivary glands, in which the gamete cell cluster was defined based solely on the upregulation of HOP1 and HAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutchinson et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that some of these markers of gametogenesis are expressed within a narrow time frame, and by analyzing single-cell gene expression at a single time point post-irradiation, we may have missed their expression peak in what is likely a rare cell population. In addition, expression of several genes may not have been detected due to ‘dropout’ events or excessive zeros, which has often been described in this type of approach due to a lower sequencing depth when compared to bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>HAP2 is a type I transmembrane protein that displays the same three-dimensional fold as class II viral fusion proteins.

In the current work, we generated reporter constructs for HAP2 in L747 and MA37 and could show enhanced expression or altered expression kinetics in the stressed cultures. By sorting the cells into mNG<sup>+</sup> and mNG<sup>-</sup> populations, we could confirm that HAP2 expression is a marker for hybridization-competent cells since hybridization failed unless the co-cultures included mNG<sup>+</sup> selected cells from one or both of the parents. To the extent that HAP2 is itself required for hybridization, then the apparent requirement for HAP2 expression on just one of the fusing cells is consistent with a number of studies showing that it can function unilaterally; either on the mating type minus gamete in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fédry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) or on the male gamete in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), the ciliated protozoan <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 2014</xref>), or the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mori et al., 2006</xref>).

These results strongly suggest fusion between the two diploid parental cells, and that the stress conditions that promoted the fusogenic potential of the cells may have produced unusual features leading to unreduced gamete formation, which is a common mechanism underlying polyploidization in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Storme and Geelen, 2013</xref>). Attempts to condition the tetraploid hybrids to complete a putative meiotic program by passing them through flies or by re-exposure to stress conditions failed to reduce their ploidy, showing that their polyploid state is relatively stable. As tetraploid progeny are occasional products of hybridization events in flies, it is also possible that tetraploid intermediates, as described for some fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heitman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roman et al., 1955</xref>), are a normal part of the mating process in <italic>Leishmania,</italic> with the ploidy reduction steps somehow lacking in the in vitro protocol. Since in the related protist <italic>T. brucei,</italic> haploid gametic cells have been identified prior to fusion in cells localized to the salivary gland of the tsetse fly vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peacock et al., 2014</xref>), we favor a comparable sexual process can operate during <italic>Leishmania</italic> development in sand flies. The fact that a few triploid hybrids, also observed in flies, were generated by the in vitro protocol could mean that a haploid gamete was produced by at least one of the parents and may encourage additional manipulations of the culture conditions to promote a more complete and uniform sexual cycle in vitro.</p><p>The absence of random segregation and genome-wide recombinations associated with a reductional meiotic program will undermine the utility of the hybrids for use in SNP association studies. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the hybrids seem to have retained an ability for homologue pairing and recombination after fusion, as evidenced by the breaks within chromosomes in the relative contributions of the parental alleles. Since the maintenance of the tetraploid state (two genome complements from each parent) would be expected to mask recombinations generated by reciprocal crossover events typically associated with meiosis I, the data suggest noncrossovers or gene conversion as a mechanism of DNA repair that would result in gene exchange in only one of the homologs. The asymmetric parental contributions observed both within and between different chromosomes could also have arisen by chromosome loss or gain at the level of individual somy, which is well described for <italic>Leishmania</italic> genomes during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dujardin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sterkers et al., 2011</xref>). Aneuploidy, including mosaic aneuploidy, is a constitutive feature of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sterkers et al., 2012</xref>). Since gene dosage can directly control the levels of gene expression in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and impact phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iantorno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prieto Barja et al., 2017</xref>), the chromosome-specific patterns of aneuploidy and recombination in the hybrids can be used for linkage studies. It is notable that the progeny that were recovered are in almost every case distinct from the other progeny clones generated in the same experimental cross with respect to the combinations of the relative parental contributions to individual chromosomes that they possess. The distinct haplotypes observed in each of the 17 hybrids generated between the <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains from India and Sri Lanka are a case in point. As these parental strains produce, respectively, visceral and cutaneous forms of disease in humans and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kariyawasam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karunaweera et al., 2003</xref>), it may be possible to map the genes controlling the behavior of the progeny clones in mice by genome-wide association studies. At a minimum, the admixture of these genomes should permit assessment as to whether or not the cutaneous or visceral tropisms are expressed as a dominant trait.</p><p>The stress-facilitated, in vitro hybridization protocol described in this report removes the requirement for sand flies as the main constraint to generating large numbers of genomic hybrids between <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and strains, and offers a transformative approach for genetic analysis to understand the extraordinary phenotypic diversity of the genus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (species)(<italic>Leishmania tropica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hapless2 (Hap2)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TritrypDB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LmjF.35.0460</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Also called GCS1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>L. tropica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L747 RFP-Hyg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inbar et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHOM/IL/02/LRC-L747</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>L. tropica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MA37 GFP-Neo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inbar et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHOM/JO/94/MA37</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>Leishmania major</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LV39 RFP-Hyg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akopyants et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MRHO/SU/59/P-strain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>L. major</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FV1-Sat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akopyants et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008042</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LLM320 RFP-Hyg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romano et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHOM/ES/92/LLM-320; isoenzyme typed MON-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415109111">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415109111</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>L. tropica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Moro RFP-Hyg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHOM/AF/19/Moro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient from Afghanistan; cell line maintained in D.

The fixed parasites were then mounted on polylysine-coated glass microscope slides, and images were acquired on a SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Whole-genome sequencing analysis</title><p>DNA was purified from log-phase promastigote cultures using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and submitted to Psomagen for next-generation sequencing (Rockville, MD). DNA libraries were generated using TruSeq Nano DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina), and the 100-bp-paired-end reads were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). FastQ files were quality checked with FastQC software. Read trimming and filtering were performed with Trimmomatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>), resulting in &gt;7.8M reads per library. Mean sequencing coverage in the dataset was 33.5, according to Qualimap v.2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Paired-end reads were aligned to the closest reference genomes available from TriTrypDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app">tritrypdb.org</ext-link>; <italic>L. tropica</italic> L590 v.50, <italic>L. donovani</italic> BPK282A1 v.50, <italic>L. infantum</italic> JPCM5 v.50, <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> M2904 v.50) using BWA v.0.7.17 with default parameters. The PAINT software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaik et al., 2021</xref>) was used to find and extract the homozygous SNP marker differences between each parental strain pair. The alleles and their frequencies in the different hybrid progenies were found using the getParentAllelFrequencies utility in PAINT. Chromosome somies were determined by calculating the normalized read depth with the ConcatenatedPloidyMatrix in PAINT. In the case of polyploid hybrids, the somy values were divided by 2 and multiplied by the estimated ploidy from the DNA content analysis and the parental contribution profile. Somies were reported as heatmaps generated using the gplots and ggplot2 packages in R. Circos plots of the inferred parental contribution were generated using the Circos software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krzywinski et al., 2009</xref>). Sequence reads obtained from the <italic>Lt</italic>MA37 and <italic>Lt</italic>Moro parental strains and MoMA hybrids that did not map to the reference nuclear genome sequence were used in maxicircle kDNA inheritance analysis. Unmapped reads were aligned to the <italic>L. major</italic> Friedlin maxicircle reference sequence (leish-esp.cbm.uam.es) using BWA v.0.7.17. Maxicircle sequence read depth and alternative allele frequencies were visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer v.2.8.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Promastigotes at early-log phase were treated with 6.5 Gy of γ-radiation and compared with untreated cultures using scRNA-seq. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 1 day post-irradiation/inoculation, and samples were prepared according to Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v3.1 (10X Genomics) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells were loaded onto the 10X Chromium Controller microfluidics system and combined into microdroplets with a unique bead carrying oligonucleotides containing an Illumina adapter, a 10× cell barcode, a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and a poly(dT) sequence. Co-partitioned cells were submitted to lysis, followed by reverse transcription of poly-adenylated mRNA, cDNA amplification, enzymatic fragmentation, and size selection. Final cDNA library quality control was assessed using a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and Qubit fluorometer and dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were submitted to Psomagen (Rockville, MD), pooled, and sequenced using two lanes of HiSeqX (Illumina; 150 bp paired-end; read length 28 * 8 * 91). Two biological replicates of each <italic>L. tropica</italic> culture were sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>scRNA-seq data preprocessing and quality control</title><p>Raw sequencing data were processed using Cell Ranger software v.5.0 (10X Genomics). Sequence reads were demultiplexed into FastQ files using Cell Ranger <italic>mkfastq</italic>. Reads were quality checked using FastQC, trimmed, and filtered using Fastp for average read quality of at least 20 and minimum length of 20 bp. Since Cell Ranger currently does not provide a built-in reference <italic>Leishmania</italic> transcriptome, a custom reference was generated using <italic>L. major</italic> Friedlin genome v.50 fasta and gff annotation files from TritrypDB. Reliable 3′UTR annotation was necessary for appropriate mapping of the scRNA-seq reads as the 3′tag-based approach used here only targets the 3′ end region of transcripts and eventual polyA stretches in the middle of genes. Therefore, absence of 3′UTR annotation available for <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains made it necessary to use the mapped 3′UTR coordinates from genetically close <italic>L. major</italic> (Dillon et al.). Using custom scripts (the source code file is provided), the <italic>L. major</italic> transcript coordinates were included in the <italic>L. major</italic> gff annotation file, so that the original coding sequence (CDS) annotations were extended to the predicted 3′ ends of transcripts and renamed as ‘exon’ to be read by Cell Ranger <italic>mkgtf</italic> and <italic>mkref. L. major</italic> mitochondrial DNA sequence (kDNA maxicircle) was added to the reference for eliminating the cell barcodes associated with dying/dead cells later. The resulting custom reference transcriptome was used to align filtered reads and quantify the number of different UMIs for each gene using Cell Ranger <italic>count</italic>. Data from irradiated and untreated samples from the same strain were aggregated together using Cell Ranger <italic>aggr</italic>. The fraction of reads containing a valid barcode assigned to a cell and confidently mapped to the transcriptome varied between 87 and 94% in MA37 and 85.7 and 86.8% in L747 libraries. The estimated number of cells detected in each replicate was between 3245 and 7485 with 20,401–49,580 mean reads per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The generated UMI count matrices were loaded into RStudio v.1.4.1717 and further processed using the Seurat R package v.4.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). Low-quality cells were removed according to the following parameters: (1) cells in which maxicircle genes represent &gt;10% of total expression, (2) cells with expression of fewer than 200 different transcripts, or (3) more than 5000 different transcripts. The first two filters were used to account for dying/dead cells and empty beads and the third for multiplets in the same droplet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell clustering and differential expression analysis</title><p>Filtered data were normalized and variance stabilized by regularized negative binomial regression using the <italic>sctransform</italic> utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) for cell clustering, dimensionality reduction, and UMAP visualization in Seurat. This package provides a fast approach to help decrease possible batch effects in the clustering. Maxicircle gene expression was regressed out of the sctransform analysis to avoid effects on the data clustering. For differential gene expression analyses reported in violin plots, dot plots, and heatmaps, the raw UMI counts were normalized by library read depth, log-transformed, centered, and scaled (Z-scored). The two replicates of untreated and irradiated samples from the same strain were integrated and analyzed as a single Seurat object. The 3000 most variable genes were identified using <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> utility and used to perform PCA. Based on empirical data, the top seven principal components were used to build a shared nearest-neighbor graph and modularity-based clustering using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.34 using <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> and <italic>FindClusters</italic>, which resulted in seven clusters for both <italic>L. tropica</italic> strains. UMAP visualization was calculated using these seven neighboring points. Transcript markers for each cluster were identified by comparing the average expression and the percent expressed of each gene in the cells within a cluster against the rest of the cells in the sample using <italic>FindMarkers</italic>. For the pseudo-bulk quality control analysis at the sample level of the scRNA-seq replicates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the DESeq2 R package was used. Briefly, <italic>DESeqDataSetFromMatrix</italic> was used to create a DESeq object using the raw UMI counts, which were then normalized and log-transformed using <italic>rlog</italic> to account for differences in library depth and transcript composition. PCA plots were generated to visualize the first two principal components that best explain the variance in the data. Additional comparisons between untreated L747 and MA37 scRNA-seq data were performed by identifying match anchor cells with <italic>FindIntegrationAnchors</italic> and integrating the data from the two strains using <italic>IntegrateData</italic> in Seurat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>HAP2mNG protein expression reporters</title><p>The L747-mNG-HAP2 and MA37-mNG-HAP2 reporter lines were generated by inserting resistance markers for blasticidin and neomycin, respectively, followed by an N-terminal mNeonGreen tag by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, following the strategy previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). The correct insertion of the tag was validated by two PCRs: the first using a forward primer located in the 5′UTR part of the Hap2 gene and a reverse primer located in the middle of the ORF; the second using the same forward primer and a reverse primer located at the end of the resistance marker inserted with the mNeonGreen (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for the complete list of primers used for the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy).

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Christine Clayton as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Ouellette (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please temper the claims. All referees agreed that this is really interesting but might not actually be &quot;mating&quot; in the usual sense, since there is no meiosis. This, combined with the inability to get diploids, also clearly compromise the usefulness of the resulting hybrids. So you also need to write very clearly what can, and cannot, be done with the method as it stands. (Just finding out whether characteristics are dominant or recessive? Any other possibilities?) Please change the title by replacing the word &quot;mating&quot; with &quot;cell fusion&quot; (or similar).</p><p>2) Otherwise all referees had various suggestions for improvement. Please make sure the huge Table is submitted as a dataset, the pdf conversion is a disaster, and fix the statistical presentation. No experiments required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors show that the ability of Leishmania promastigotes to fuse with each other is greatly enhanced after treatments that induce DNA damage. Although the fusion-competent cells express the gamete fusogen HAP2, the parasites do not undergo meiosis and the cells that result from fusion of two diploid organisms are mostly tetraploid. I actually wonder, therefore, whether this process can actually be called &quot;mating&quot; or whether it would be more correct to call it &quot;cell fusion&quot;. It is not clear how useful this will be in practice since no meiosis appears to occur and diploid cells could not be recovered.</p><p>I personally think that the title should be modified, as it would be more accurate to use &quot;cell fusion&quot; rather than &quot;mating&quot;.</p><p>In the discussion the authors should:</p><p>a) discuss the lack of other sexual/meisosis markers more critically. Could this be some sort of stress response rather than really triggering of the mating pathway?</p><p>b) Make more precise suggestions as to how this could be used. We no longer need mating for linkage studies since we have the genome sequences. We can transfect in modified genes and we can delete or mutate them. What, actually, would you use this for? Finding genes linked to any particular process by selection won't be possible unless the genomes can be reduced again. I guess you might find out that a phenotype was dominant but you wouldn't be able to assign it to a particular gene.</p><p>Abstract – The fact that hybrids were mostly tetraploid should be mentioned – it's more specific than &quot;polyploid&quot;. In fact, specifically that the hybrids appear mostly to have retained both parental genomes.</p><p>Figures: Please make sure that all axis labels in all Figures can be read easily at 1x magnification. Also make all labels in one whole Figure the same size. People will be trying to read this on a laptop and will not want to have to magnify to 300% in order to understand the graphs. I found 6-point text – and less. For example, Figure 6 suffers from a very wide range of font sizes and formats. The numbers on B and G are tiny and in K and L the only important part is the (currently microscopic) superscripts. For the x-axis why not just put a large &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; and Use &quot;L7547 HAP2&quot; and &quot;MA37 HAP2&quot; as the left-hand labels? And for the y-axis in L you could put &quot;log 10&quot; and then use the superscripts as the main label.</p><p>Statistical analysis on Figures:</p><p>Generally please say how many replicates there were for each measurement in all Figures. If there are less than 5 replicates please show individual measurements (e.g. FIgure 6 H-K). I know it's been common practice for decades to use standard deviations when there are three measurements, but it's invalid and often does not really reflect what is observed. In Figure 6K the significance measurements must be removed, they are invalid.</p><p>Figure 1A, B, C: These should not be column graphs. You could use a box plot (though four measurements is rather low for that), or else just show the individual measurements. The distribution of points is clearly not normal so the standard deviations are invalid, please remove. Actually I'm not sure whether these are necessary at all since D,E and F are much more informative.</p><p>.</p><p>Figure 5A, B, G, H – this would be much easier to understand if the gene designations were used instead of the gene IDs. The IDs can be kept in the Legend only. Similarly in page 14 line 17 – also mention which genes were NOT up-regulated, since they might be a clue as to the lack of meiosis. How do the transcriptomes of mating-competent Leishmania compare with those seen from single-cell sequencing of T.. brucei? (Just released on line – see Hutchison et al., https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009904).</p><p>Figure 6: What is &quot;inoculation&quot; and what was the state of the cells before &quot;inoculation&quot;? Is it dilution of dense cells into new medium? Why do the authors think HAP2 expression increases when MA37 is &quot;inoculated&quot;? Were the cells mock-treated and could this be a source of stress? The stress treatments are missing from the methods section.</p><p>Supplementary Table 2 is an 85-page pdf. I wonder if this was an error, since as a pdf it is impossible to manipulate in any way. Please submit it in spreadsheet form and include gene annotations, and with the commas replaced by decimal points. The average log2 fold change would be easier to read if it were rounded to 4 decimal places. In the Table legend please say what the various clusters are. It would also be useful to highlight the &quot;top ten markers&quot; described on page 11 of the manuscript. A separate sheet could list the genes that are co-expressed with HAP2 – that would also be useful for people who are interested in looking for regulatory motifs.</p><p>&quot;can be readily grown&quot; – I'm old-fashioned, and find the split infinitive rather ugly. 'Can be grown readily&quot; or &quot;can readily be grown&quot; are (to my eyes) preferable.</p><p>p3 Line 37 – &quot;in vitro&quot; should be italicised.</p><p>p4 Line 22 – how low? A number would be nice.</p><p>p4 Line 30 – how many cells per well?</p><p>p9 Line 13 – should be &quot;a median number of 1,079 different mRNAs detected&quot; (not &quot;genes expressed&quot;).</p><p>p11 Is LmjF.31.1440 also a pseudogene in other species? (is it a multigene family?).</p><p>p11 line 47 &quot;being expressed in&quot; should be &quot;expression being detected in&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Louradour et al., have followed up on their exciting Leishmania sex studies. In a previous study they have shown that hybrids could be obtained in vitro, but only when working with L. tropica. Now they show that this hybrid formation is increased significantly in cells subjected to treatments known to damage DNA and that importantly it can be extended to other Leishmania species. Furthermore, and elegantly, they have shown that these hybrids are found only in cells expressing HAP2.</p><p>I am not asking for further experiments (a lot of competent work is included in this study) but a number of points would merit clarifications. Indeed, it remains to be seen whether the tetraploid state of the hybrids will allow SNP discovery linked to phenotypes. I would presume that inkage studies would require massive recombination for reducing the complexity of the hybrids. I am curious to know whether the authors have attempted to cross a tetraploid hybrid with a wild-type cell (I realize that this will require the insertion of new markers) but this back-cross type of experiment would go a long way to support the hypothesis that in vitro sex could be helpful for GWAS studies. Can the author also comment on why hybrids cannot be obtained with L. major? Were any L. major hybrids (in sand-fly or natural isolates) described previously?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Leishmania parasites have been shown to produce genetic hybrids after co-transmission via the sand fly vector of genetically different parental strains of the same or different species. in vitro production of hybrids has also been shown for one species, L. tropica. Here the authors set out to investigate whether the production of hybrids in vitro could be enhanced by stress induction via irradiation or chemical means.</p><p>Pairwise mixtures of drug resistant Leishmania strains were analysed for production of double drug resistant hybrids before or after stress induction. The number of hybrids greatly increased following stress induction in both L. tropica and other Leishmania species tested. Analysis of the DNA contents of hybrids showed the vast majority to be 4N compared to 2N parental lines, with few 3N and no 2N hybrids; this contrasts with sand fly co-transmission experiments, where the majority of hybrids are 2N with occasional polyploids. Genome sequencing and SNP analysis indicated that both sets of parental chromosomes were present in the 4N hybrids and they appear to be fusions of the parental cells, albeit with some evidence of chromosomal recombination. The authors further investigated the stress response by single cell RNA sequencing of L. tropica cultures, and showed that a cluster of cells characterised by expression of sex-related genes such as HAP2 and GEX1, increased in number. Tagging HAP2 with a fluorescent marker demonstrated that the number of HAP2 expressing cells increased after cell cultures were irradiated and cultures enriched for HAP2-expressing cells showed increased production of hybrids. The authors' interpretation of their data is that stress induces formation of sex cells in vitro with increased production of hybrids in mixed cultures. There are indeed more hybrids after stress induction, but the vast majority are whole genome fusions of the two parental lines. The number of cells expressing HAP2 is also increased after stress induction. However, neither of these phenomena may be part of the natural sexual reproduction process in Leishmania.</p><p>The manuscript is well written overall and the figures are clear.</p><p>Might be informative to include kinetoplast maxicircle data for hybrids to determine whether they have kDNA from both parents as well as nuclear genomes.</p><p>The single cell RNA sequencing data show an interesting difference between L. tropica strains in producing metacyclics in vitro, which is presently buried in Supp Figure 6 – perhaps more could be made of this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Louradour et al. present exciting data on an approach to greatly improve the efficiency of purely in vitro experimental hybridisation in Leishmania, which might help male forward genetics approaches practical in this important parasite group. As well as this methodological step forward, the data presented add to our understanding of the basic reproductive biology of Leishmania. The conclusions of this paper are well-supported by the data and analysis presented, and the writing and presentation is of a very high quality throughout.</p><p>One thing that makes the paper slightly difficult to follow at one place is the separate clustering of single-cell data from the two different hybrid lines. It wIs there no way to either cluster genes from the two strains in a single analysis, or somehow identify which clusters represent the same cell groups across the strain. These clusters could then be numbered the same across the lines, which would clarify the writing. That might then also allow us to get some handle on to what extent similar clusters show overlapping gene expression patterns, which is lost in the current analysis. I appreciate that the number of significantly DE genes differs greatly between the two lines, but it would be good to drill a little down into whether this is due to substantially different patterns of expression between the two lines, or differences in the power to detect differential expression.</p><p>One missing piece that slightly dilutes the impact of this work is that it is not yet completely clear that what is happening in the in vitro hybrids is identical to the clear crossing-over in meiosis seen in experimental fly infections and that is evident in natural populations. The authors observe a few apparent intra-chromosomal changes in parental coverage, there appear to be rather few (a handful per line) : rather less than we expect to see in normal meioses, and perhaps so few as to be consistent with some kind of mitotic crossing-over. This slight uncertainty on whether the in vitro system really reflects the situation in flies also slightly dents the relevance of the finding that hybrids here are highly polyploid fusions of parental cells.</p><p>I guess that many crossing-overs are not associated with changes in parental coverage, but it seems a shame that no attempt has been made to directly infer cross-overs in these data. I presume the heterozygosity is too low, and this would be challenging in polyploid-ish cells in any case. To my mind this rather reduces the utility of in vitro hybridisation and thus the impact of this work.</p><p>Finally, nothing is really said about the 'other clusters' in the scRNA-seq data. While it is nice to see scRNA-seq being used to test a specific hypothesis rather than purely descriptively, it seems a slightly unfortunate omission to now say something about these data more generally, given that I think it is the first scRNA-seq in Leishmania. I suspect the authors could – and perhaps should – argue that including this would dilute the main message of this manuscript and be beyond the scope of what they are trying to achieve here.</p><p>I have some detailed comments on the text that might help the authors revise the manuscript.</p><p>p2 line 11 – is it 'mating competency' or 'mating competence'.</p><p>p3 line 6 – 'to infection' – this clause isn't quite clear to me.

Although the fusion-competent cells express the gamete fusogen HAP2, the parasites do not undergo meiosis and the cells that result from fusion of two diploid organisms are mostly tetraploid. I actually wonder, therefore, whether this process can actually be called &quot;mating&quot; or whether it would be more correct to call it &quot;cell fusion&quot;. It is not clear how useful this will be in practice since no meiosis appears to occur and diploid cells could not be recovered.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the point about mating vs fusion is fair, and we have removed ‘mating’ from the title while emphasizing the genome hybridization aspects of the cell fusion events. We agree that the utility of the tetraploid hybrids in terms of SNP association studies is certainly compromised. We argue, nonetheless, that there are sufficient differences in the genotypes of different progeny clones due to their distinct patterns of aneuploidy and homologous recombination that linkage studies may be possible, especially given the ease with which so many different hybrids can now be generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I personally think that the title should be modified, as it would be more accurate to use &quot;cell fusion&quot; rather than &quot;mating&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to emphasize the genome hybridization aspects of the cell fusion events. i.e. the admixture of heterologous genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion the authors should:</p><p>a) discuss the lack of other sexual/meisosis markers more critically. Could this be some sort of stress response rather than really triggering of the mating pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded on this important point the discussion, lines 482-494:</p><p>“Critically, we did not find significant up-regulation of other meiosis-specific markers, including <italic>SPO11</italic>, <italic>DMC1</italic> and <italic>MND1</italic>. […] In addition, expression of several genes may not have been detected due to “dropout” events or excessive zeros, which has often been described in this type of approach due to a lower sequencing depth when compared to bulk RNA-seq (Choi et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Make more precise suggestions as to how this could be used. We no longer need mating for linkage studies since we have the genome sequences. We can trasnfect in modified genes and we can delete or mutate them. What, actually, would you use this for? Finding genes linked to any particular process by selection won't be possible unless the genomes can be reduced again. I guess you might find out that a phenotype was dominant but you wouldn't be able to assign it to a particular gene.</p></disp-quote><p>As efficient as reverse genetic tools are in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, they have so far failed to identify genes controlling such fundamental traits as tissue tropism, pathogenicity and virulence. These traits are likely under polygenic control, and will be difficult for targeted mutagenesis to address. An unbiased, forward genetics approach offers an important strategy, although the reviewer is correct that in the absence of meiotic reduction and recombination, SNP association studies will be far more challenging. We observed, nonetheless, that following fusion of the parental genomes, there are extensive changes in the relative contribution of the parental chromosomes due to homologous recombinations and copy number variation at the level of individual somy. We argue that because of the genotype differences between progeny clones, plus the relative ease with which large numbers of hybrids can now be generated, that linkage studies may be possible. And as the reviewer suggests, assessing the dominance of a particular trait should also be possible.

In a previous study they have shown that hybrids could be obtained in vitro, but only when working with L. tropica. Now they show that this hybrid formation is increased significantly in cells subjected to treatments known to damage DNA and that importantly it can be extended to other Leishmania species. Furthermore, and elegantly, they have shown that these hybrids are found only in cells expressing HAP2.</p><p>I am not asking for further experiments (a lot of competent work is included in this study) but a number of points would merit clarifications. Indeed, it remains to be seen whether the tetraploid state of the hybrids will allow SNP discovery linked to phenotypes. I would presume that inkage studies would require massive recombination for reducing the complexity of the hybrids. I am curious to know whether the authors have attempted to cross a tetraploid hybrid with a wild-type cell (I realize that this will require the insertion of new markers) but this back-cross type of experiment would go a long way to support the hypothesis that in vitro sex could be helpful for GWAS studies. Can the author also comment on why hybrids cannot be obtained with L. major? Were any L. major hybrids (in sand-fly or natural isolates) described previously?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the utility of the hybrids for SNP association studies, please refer to our response to the public evaluation summary and to lines 538-563 of the discussion.</p><p>We have not attempted a cross with a tetraploid hybrid as yet.</p><p>Why our <italic>L. major</italic> strains will not hybridize in vitro remains an unanswered but intriguing question, especially as they do hybridize in sand flies, demonstrating that they possess the machinery for genetic exchange (Akopyants et al., Science, 2009; Inbar et al., PloS Gen, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Leishmania parasites have been shown to produce genetic hybrids after co-transmission via the sand fly vector of genetically different parental strains of the same or different species. in vitro production of hybrids has also been shown for one species, L. tropica. Here the authors set out to investigate whether the production of hybrids in vitro could be enhanced by stress induction via irradiation or chemical means.</p><p>Pairwise mixtures of drug resistant Leishmania strains were analysed for production of double drug resistant hybrids before or after stress induction. The number of hybrids greatly increased following stress induction in both L. tropica and other Leishmania species tested. Analysis of the DNA contents of hybrids showed the vast majority to be 4N compared to 2N parental lines, with few 3N and no 2N hybrids; this contrasts with sand fly co-transmission experiments, where the majority of hybrids are 2N with occasional polyploids. Genome sequencing and SNP analysis indicated that both sets of parental chromosomes were present in the 4N hybrids and they appear to be fusions of the parental cells, albeit with some evidence of chromosomal recombination. The authors further investigated the stress response by single cell RNA sequencing of L. tropica cultures, and showed that a cluster of cells characterised by expression of sex-related genes such as HAP2 and GEX1, increased in number. Tagging HAP2 with a fluorescent marker demonstrated that the number of HAP2 expressing cells increased after cell cultures were irradiated and cultures enriched for HAP2-expressing cells showed increased production of hybrids. The authors' interpretation of their data is that stress induces formation of sex cells in vitro with increased production of hybrids in mixed cultures. There are indeed more hybrids after stress induction, but the vast majority are whole genome fusions of the two parental lines. The number of cells expressing HAP2 is also increased after stress induction. However, neither of these phenomena may be part of the natural sexual reproduction process in Leishmania.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility that the stress-facilitated hybridization reflects cell fusion events unrelated to natural mating is an important point that has been raised by the other reviewers, and is discussed in the paragraph beginning on line 518 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript is well written overall and the figures are clear.</p><p>Might be informative to include kinetoplast maxicircle data for hybrids to determine whether they have kDNA from both parents as well as nuclear genomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the maxicircle kDNA data would be informative to include. It can now be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and referred to lines 214-219 of the results. It is interesting that maxicircle kDNA inheritance appears uniparental, consistent with our experimental crosses in flies and the vast majority of natural crosses described to date. In this respect the in vitro hybrids are not simply products of the fusion of diploid cells but share an important character of natural hybrids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The single cell RNA sequencing data show an interesting difference between L. tropica strains in producing metacyclics in vitro, which is presently buried in Supp Figure 6 – perhaps more could be made of this?</p></disp-quote><p>The single cell RNA sequencing data was generated from cells obtained from log phase growth. Few metacyclic forms would be expected in these cultures and the sample comparisons were not designed to identify clusters representing different development stages of promastigotes. This point is clarified on lines 266-273 of the results. While the strain differences in the small cluster of cells representing metacyclics is interesting, we would prefer not to comment further on this given the constraints of our sampling bias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Louradour et al. present exciting data on an approach to greatly improve the efficiency of purely in vitro experimental hybridisation in Leishmania, which might help male forward genetics approaches practical in this important parasite group. As well as this methodological step forward, the data presented add to our understanding of the basic reproductive biology of Leishmania. The conclusions of this paper are well-supported by the data and analysis presented, and the writing and presentation is of a very high quality throughout.</p><p>One thing that makes the paper slightly difficult to follow at one place is the separate clustering of single-cell data from the two different hybrid lines. It wIs there no way to either cluster genes from the two strains in a single analysis, or somehow identify which clusters represent the same cell groups across the strain. These clusters could then be numbered the same across the lines, which would clarify the writing. That might then also allow us to get some handle on to what extent similar clusters show overlapping gene expression patterns, which is lost in the current analysis. I appreciate that the number of significantly DE genes differs greatly between the two lines, but it would be good to drill a little down into whether this is due to substantially different patterns of expression between the two lines, or differences in the power to detect differential expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The decision to perform the comparisons between untreated vs irradiated cells separately for each strain was due to the very limited representation of shared cell clusters between the untreated L747 and MA37 strains. The clustering of the integrated, untreated L747 and MA37 is now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement2A and referred to in the text in lines 275-286, emphasizing how distinctive their transcriptional profiles are at the single cell level. Therefore, to avoid additional unnecessary bias in the analysis of irradiation-induced changes, cells from each strain were clustered separately. The complete list of cluster markers for the analysis of integrated, untreated strains is now included in the new Sup. File 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One missing piece that slightly dilutes the impact of this work is that it is not yet completely clear that what is happening in the in vitro hybrids is identical to the clear crossing-over in meiosis seen in experimental fly infections and that is evident in natural populations. The authors observe a few apparent intra-chromosomal changes in parental coverage, there appear to be rather few (a handful per line) : rather less than we expect to see in normal meioses, and perhaps so few as to be consistent with some kind of mitotic crossing-over. This slight uncertainty on whether the in vitro system really reflects the situation in flies also slightly dents the relevance of the finding that hybrids here are highly polyploid fusions of parental cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the number of observable recombinations is less than expected from normal meiosis, and as we followed only the homozygous SNPs that are different between the parents, the recombinations will have occurred following fusion of the parental genomes, likely during subsequent mitotic divisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I guess that many crossing-overs are not associated with changes in parental coverage, but it seems a shame that no attempt has been made to directly infer cross-overs in these data. I presume the heterozygosity is too low, and this would be challenging in polyploid-ish cells in any case. To my mind this rather reduces the utility of in vitro hybridisation and thus the impact of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the extra ploidy and low heterozygosity will make it difficult to appreciate many of the cross-overs that may have occurred, and that this will compromise the utility of the hybrids. Nonetheless, the cross-overs that were detectable, in addition to the differences in parental contributions at the level of individual chromosomes (both are now highlighted in the new circos plots shown in Figure 2 -Figure sup. 3), may still afford opportunities for genome wide association studies. This point is referred to in the text lines 208-212 of the results, and in the discussion in the paragraph beginning on line 538.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, nothing is really said about the 'other clusters' in the scRNA-seq data. While it is nice to see scRNA-seq being used to test a specific hypothesis rather than purely descriptively, it seems a slightly unfortunate omission to now say something about these data more generally, given that I think it is the first scRNA-seq in Leishmania.
