First, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) enables cap-independent translation. The second regulon is a translation inhibitory element or TIE, which ensures concomitant cap-dependent translation inhibition. In this study, we deciphered the molecular mechanisms of mouse <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIEs. Both TIEs possess an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is critical to inhibit cap-dependent translation. However, the molecular mechanisms used are different. In <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE, we identify an uORF which inhibits cap-dependent translation and we show the requirement of the non-canonical initiation factor eIF2D for this process. The mode of action of <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE is different, it also contains an uORF but it is a minimal uORF formed by an uAUG followed immediately by a stop codon, namely a ‘start-stop’. The ‘start-stop’ sequence is species-specific and in mice, is located upstream of a highly stable stem loop structure which stalls the 80S ribosome and thereby inhibits cap-dependent translation of <italic>Hoxa11</italic> main ORF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>uORF</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>hox mRNA</kwd><kwd>TIE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE12-0025-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Franck</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> translation inhibitory elements block cap-dependent translation by using upstream open reading frames with distinct modes of action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression constitutes an indispensable cellular process for which the genetic information encodes a functional product, mainly proteins. This process named translation initiates by a cap-dependent mechanism for most cellular mRNAs. It involves a large number of auxiliary proteins termed eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) which are required for the recruitment of the ribosomes on the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merrick and Pavitt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shirokikh and Preiss, 2018</xref>). To ensure fine-tuning of translation, this step is highly regulated. However, several mRNA subclasses are translated by non-canonical mechanisms. For instance, this is the case for homeobox (Hox) mRNAs. Hox genes encode a family of proteins that constitutes transcription factors. Their main function is to orchestrate specific sequential transcription processes during embryonic development. A wealth of experimental data over the last three decades has led to the identification of many <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that control Hox gene transcriptional patterns, thus giving deeper insights into the expression of Hox mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, Hox homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, precisely Antp and Ubx genes in the Hom-C cluster, have been suggested to be under translational control during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oh et al., 1992</xref>). A subgroup of mRNAs produced from the Antp and Ubx loci contain functional internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that allow their translation using a cap-independent mechanism during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye et al., 1997</xref>). More recently, the presence of other IRES elements in the 5’UTR of subsets of mice HoxA mRNAs (<italic>Hoxa3, Hoxa4, Hoxa5, Hoxa9</italic>, and <italic>Hoxa11</italic>) has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leppek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these IRES require the presence of the ribosomal protein RpL38 in the ribosome to efficiently initiate translation, thereby explaining the tissue patterning defective phenotype observed with RpL38 knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>). The IRES activity in these Hox mRNAs was found to be critical for their appropriate expression. Upon the discovery of the IRES elements in Hox mRNAs, other RNA regulons termed translation inhibitory elements (TIEs) were also found in the 5’UTR of Hox mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). TIEs are located upstream of the previously described IRES. According to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>, these elements efficiently inhibit canonical cap-dependent translation in subsets of HoxA mRNAs (<italic>Hoxa3, Hoxa4, Hoxa9</italic>, and <italic>Hoxa11</italic>) by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). The action of TIE that ensures efficient blockage of cap-dependent translation promotes IRES-mediated cap-independent translation. TIE and IRES act in synergy to ensure tightly regulated translation during organismal development. Indeed, it has been shown that Hox TIEs ensure that Hox mRNAs are translated solely by their IRES element. Thereby, TIEs represent the first example of specific RNA elements dedicated to inhibiting specifically cap-dependent translation in Hox mRNAs. However, the mechanism of action of these elements as well as their structural characterization are still unknown. In this study, we investigate the functional mode of action of TIEs from <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> mRNAs that were previously identified and characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>. Our study was conducted on <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> for several reasons. First, among Hox mRNAs, the translation mechanism used for each is distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Hoxa11</italic> mRNA translation being RpL38-dependent while <italic>Hoxa3</italic> is RpL38-independent. Second, these two TIEs have very efficient translation inhibition rate and third, their relatively short lengths were more suitable for our experiments. First, we determined their secondary structure by chemical probing assays and then, using cell-free translation extracts and in vivo assays, we deciphered their mode of action. Interestingly, the translation inhibitory mechanism that is mediated by <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE is radically distinct from the one used by <italic>Hoxa11. Hoxa3</italic> TIE contains an uORF that is translated into a 9 KDa protein through the <italic>Hoxa3</italic> IRES and that requires the presence of the non-canonical translation initiation factor eIF2D. Indeed, eIF2D has been shown to be involved in diverse functions from translation initiation on specific mRNAs to reinitiation and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weisser et al., 2017</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE contains a long stable hairpin structure which is preceded by a start-stop codon combination. In mice, these three elements enable a highly efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation by <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE that is achieved through a start-stop stalling mechanism of an 80S ribosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TIE-mediated inhibition recapitulated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate</title><p>To dissect the mechanism of TIE-mediated inhibition, we first set up an efficient cell-free assay. We used rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and performed in vitro experiments using several reporter constructs. To analyse their translation efficiency, capped mRNAs were translated in RRL in the presence of [<sup>35</sup><italic>S</italic>]-methionine to verify the size of the expected synthesized protein and luciferase activity was measured to determine their translation efficiency. In order to standardize the measured translation activities, we inserted the TIEs identified and characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>, in murine <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and mRNAs upstream of the well-characterized human β-globin (<italic>Hbb-b1</italic>) 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> allows translation strictly by a cap-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fletcher et al., 1990</xref>). Therefore, in order to evaluate the inhibition due to TIEs, we used a reporter mRNA containing the sole <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> 5’UTR placed upstream of Renilla luciferase (RLuc) coding sequence as a control reporter gene. First, we demonstrated that translation with these extracts is cap-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Second, we performed translation experiments with increasing amounts of the same mRNA and determined that with concentrations higher than 100 nM, the translation yield reached a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In order to avoid any titration effect due to excess of mRNA, we performed all translation assays at an mRNA concentration of 50 nM, which enables sub-saturating conditions. <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIEs efficiently promote a translation inhibition by 79% and 91%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, our cell-free translation assay using RRL efficiently recapitulates the previously described TIE-mediated translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, TIE-mediated inhibition was efficiently recapitulated in other cell-free translation systems, which are partially or fully cap-dependent from other organisms like wheat germ extracts, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell extracts, and human HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the same constructs were introduced in a plasmid that allowed us to monitor translation inhibition in vivo. We tested two cell lines that have been shown to express Hox genes, namely human HEK293T and murine mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phinney et al., 2005</xref>). In these cells, translation inhibition by <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE is 98% and 88%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, to define the minimal active domains of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic>, sequential 5’ deletions were performed. In each experiment, translation for each construct was compared to the control (w/o TIE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, we tested large deletions in order to roughly determine the functional domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), then more precise deletions to map exactly the 5’ end of functional domains for <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deletion of 68 nts in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE does not affect inhibition (81%). A further deletion of 113 nts completely abolishes the translation inhibition of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE (10%). Therefore, the minimal <italic>Hoxa3</italic> element encompasses nucleotides 68–170. Concerning <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE, the situation is not as clear. In fact, the inhibition is completely lost when 161 nts are deleted. In this case, the deletions indicate that elements essential for translation inhibition are most likely located between residues 139 and 161. In conclusion, these experiments allowed the localization of essential RNA elements required for <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> RNA regulons that are required to retain their full inhibitory function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Translation inhibitory element (TIE)-mediated inhibition is recapitulated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and does not require full-length TIEs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three capped mRNAs were used to test TIE-mediated inhibition in vitro.

Since modifications were performed in triplicates, the average of reactivity was calculated for each nucleotide at a specific position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). With this reactivity, we built a secondary structural model for both <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIEs. <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE contains a 5’ proximal stem loop and another bigger structure comprising two-way junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, the minimal <italic>Hoxa3</italic> contains putative uORFs starting from two putative uAUGs at positions 111–113 and 123–125, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to test their implication in the translation inhibition, both uAUGs were mutated independently into UAC thereby eliminating any possibility of AUG-like codon recognition. Interestingly, the mutation of AUG111 completely abolishes the inhibition by <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE thereby confirming its implication. On the contrary, this is not the case for AUG123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is in good agreement with the fact that AUG111 has an optimal Kozak sequence (A at −3 and G at +4), thereby the ribosome initially recognizes it during scanning along the 5’UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozak, 1986</xref>. To further confirm the assembly of the ribosome on uAUG111, we mutated it into AUG-like codons. We tested previously described AUG-like codons such as AUU, CUG, GUG, and ACG. None of the tested AUG-likes are used for translation inhibition indicating that <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE requires a genuine AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel). Since the AUG111 is involved in a stem, it is possible that the absence of inhibition with the AUG-likes is actually due to the disruption of the stem. To rule out this possibility, we mutated the AUG111 into CUG and GUG and inserted simultaneously the compensatory mutations in AUG123 into AGG and ACG respectively that enable the formation of the stem with the mutated CUG and GUG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel). In both mutants, the inhibition was fully destroyed indicating that efficient inhibition requires a genuine AUG start codon independently of the secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we confirmed the use of uAUG111 by toe printing assay. As expected, a canonical +16 reverse transcription (RT) arrest from uAUG111 was clearly detected with GMP-PNP, a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP that prevents subunit joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliseev et al., 2018</xref>), and less efficiently with cycloheximide, a translocation inhibitor that binds the E-site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider-Poetsch et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, when the uAUG is mutated to UAC, the +16 toe print disappears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Altogether, this data confirm that a pre-initiation complex efficiently assembles on the uAUG111. We then wondered whether the ribosome assembled on this AUG codon proceeds to translation elongation resulting in a polypeptide synthesis encoded by the uORF. By performing sucrose gradient analysis, we detected polysome formation suggesting that efficient translation is occurring from uAUG111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accordingly, mutation of uAUG111 drastically reduces the amount of polysomes and the formation of 48S complexes in the presence of GMP-PNP thereby corroborating that the translation is starting on uAUG111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In <italic>Hoxa3</italic> 5’UTR, the uORF starting from uAUG111 is extending through the full IRES. To check further whether the uORF is indeed translated through the full-length <italic>Hoxa3</italic> 5’UTR, we first deleted a single nucleotide (G333) to change the frame and thereby producing a fusion protein formed by the peptide produced from the uORF and RLuc. Indeed, with this single frameshifting point mutation, we could detect a longer protein demonstrating that the pre-initiation complex assembled on the uAUG111 indeed proceeds to translation elongation and is efficiently translating through the full-length 5’UTR of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also verified the translation from uAUG111 with our reporter constructs containing only the <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE. Likewise, the insertion of a single frameshifting nucleotide (A220) allows the detection of a longer fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Remarkably, with a double mutant that combines the mutation of the uAUG111 to ACG with the (A220) insertion, a mixture of two proteins is detected, the fusion protein and the more abundant RLuc protein. Indeed, this confirms that the ribosome requires the uAUG111 but still able to recognize, although less efficiently, the AUG-like ACG as a start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, when we use the native full-length <italic>Hoxa3</italic> mRNA, we detect the <italic>Hoxa3</italic> uORF protein of 9 KDa size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Altogether, our cell-free translation assays demonstrate that <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE translation is achieved by translation of an uORF that starts at AUG111 codon that extends through the whole <italic>Hoxa3</italic> 5’UTR. To confirm these results in vivo, we generated reporter constructs in the plasmid pmirGlo that contains TIEs upstream of Renilla luciferase (hRLuc). Values were normalized to that of control enhanced Firefly luciferase (luc2) to calculate the luciferase activity for each report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, wild-type <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE blocks translation very efficiently in both HEK293T and C3H10T1/2 cells. When the uAUG111 is mutated to UAC, the inhibition is significantly affected in both HEK293T and C3H10T1/2 cells at respectively 57% and 45% compared to wild-type <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Deletion experiments suggested that critical elements were located in the region 139–216. We also found that <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE contains two putative upstream AUGs at positions 84–86 and 159–161. Mutations of both AUG84 and AUG159 had no impact on translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). According to our 2D model, a long GC-rich stable stem loop (SL) structure (ΔG = −25.00 kcal/mol) spans nucleotides 104–154 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This long hairpin comprises 16 G-C base pairs that can putatively interfere with the progression of a pre-initiation scanning complex. To test the inhibitory efficiency of this stem loop, we transplanted it in a strictly cap-dependent reporter mRNA containing the 5’UTR of <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> upstream of the luciferase coding sequence. The <italic>Hoxa11</italic> SL was inserted in the middle of the 5’UTR. In this construct the first 25 nucleotides from the 5’ proximity are unfolded thereby ensuring proper access to the 5’ cap. Interestingly, the translation of this mRNA was significantly abolished showing that this SL on its own is sufficient to inhibit cap-dependent translation when transplanted in another mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, in <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE, uAUG84 codon is located 19 nts upstream of the inhibiting SL. This distance is compatible with the assembly of a pre-initiation complex on uAUG84 without clashing with the SL. Moreover, the distance between the uAUG and the SL is optimal for favouring AUG recognition by scanning arrest of the pre-initiation complex forced by the SL. Importantly, the uAUG84 is immediately followed by a stop codon UAG87. The sequence context of the uAUG84 (A at −3 and U at +4) is suboptimal compared to the consensus Kozak sequence. This unique combination of start-stop codon upstream of SL structure raised the question of whether the ribosome is forced to recognize this uAUG despite a suboptimal Kozak context. To address this hypothesis, we mutated the stop codon UAG87 to UGG thereby creating an uORF. When the stop is mutated, a small peptide is produced from the translation of uAUG84 through 5’UTR, which we called <italic>Hoxa11</italic> uORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that uAUG84 is indeed efficiently used as a start codon despite its suboptimal sequence context. Unfortunately, the presence of the highly stable SL is not compatible with the toe printing assay. Indeed, premature RT arrests occur due to the presence of the highly stable SL, rendering the toe printing assay on TIE <italic>Hoxa11</italic> impossible. Therefore, to further confirm that the ribosome is efficiently assembled on uAUG84, we performed sucrose gradient analysis with radiolabelled mRNAs. With wild-type <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE, an 80S complex efficiently accumulates in the presence of cycloheximide as expected. However, an 80S complex is also detected without inhibitor indicating that the 80S complex is in fact a stalled ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mutation of uAUG84 to UAC drastically reduces the amount of 80S complex; in contrast, mutation of uAUG159 to UAC does not affect 80S accumulation. This further confirms that the stalled 80S complex is indeed assembled on the uAUG84. Altogether, this data show that a stalled ribosome is indeed assembled on uAUG84 and the stalling is caused by the synergistic effect of a stop codon next to the AUG and a stable SL downstream of the start-stop of <italic>Hoxa11</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A start-stop upstream open reading frame (uORF) in <italic>Hoxa11</italic> translation inhibitory element (TIE) stalls an 80S upstream of a highly stable structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mutational analysis of uAUGs in <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE.

To determine the effect of eIF2D silencing, the RL/FL ratio was compared to that with the siRNA-NT, which serves as a control for siRNA effect on the cell line. Thereby, the comparison between the two values would determine the effect of eIF2D silencing with each TIE. Interestingly, silencing eIF2D in <italic>Hoxa3</italic>-transfected cells at an efficiency of 76% drastically abolishes <italic>Hoxa3</italic>-mediated inhibition and RL/FL ratio (0.06) increases six times compared to that in siRNA-NT cells (0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). On the contrary, the silencing of eIF2D at efficiency of 81% has no significant effect on <italic>Hoxa11</italic>-mediated inhibition (RL/FL ratio of 0.02 with both siRNAs). Similarly, silencing eIF2D at 83% efficiency has no effect on general translation (RL/FL ratio remains around 0.06 with both siRNAs). Altogether, this confirms the specific requirement of eIF2D for efficient <italic>Hoxa3</italic> inhibition but not for <italic>Hoxa11</italic>. This conclusion is in good agreement with our previous mass spectrometry analysis of <italic>Hoxa3</italic>-ribosomal complexes blocked by translation inhibitors, which show the specific presence of eIF2D in the initiation complexes programmed with <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fact that we found eIF2D in pre-initiation complexes suggests that eIF2D is involved in the initiation of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> uORF. Since <italic>Hoxa3</italic> uORF is long and extends downstream the AUG start codon of the main CDS in native <italic>Hoxa3</italic> mRNA, which means that the <italic>Hoxa3</italic> uORF partially overlaps the main CDS, a mechanism using a reinitiation event after <italic>Hoxa3</italic> uORF translation is impossible. Therefore, we rather favour a model in which eIF2D is required for <italic>Hoxa3</italic> initiation. Previous studies have shown that an A-motif upstream of an uAUG has been shown to be important for proper eIF2D recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, a closer look at the sequences in the <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE uORF revealed A-rich motifs upstream and downstream of uAUG111. We tested the implication of both A-motifs, AAAA107 upstream of the AUG and AAAAA147 downstream of the AUG, in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In order to avoid any side effect due to mutation in the sequence context around the uAUG, we kept an optimal Kozak sequence and mutated the As at position 107–110 to GGCC thereby keeping a purine residue at −3 position. The second A-motif downstream of AUG was similarly mutated to GGCCC. Interestingly, the mutation of upstream A-motif had a twofold reduction effect on translation inhibition of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE. In contrast, mutation of the downstream A-motif does not affect <italic>Hoxa3</italic>TIE inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed the implication of upstream A-motif in vivo with HEK293T cell line using plasmids with wild-type <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and the mutant of AAAA107 into GGCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The AAAA107 mutant reduces the inhibitory efficiency of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE by 2.5 times compared to wild-type <italic>Hoxa3</italic>. Therefore, we show that the A-motif upstream of the AUG is critical for translation inhibition and most probably because it is required for eIF2D recruitment.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Co-transfection assay of translation inhibitory element (TIE) plasmids and siRNA against eIF2D confirms its implication in <italic>Hoxa3</italic>-mediated inhibition.</title><p>Mutational analysis of A-motif sequences in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE shows a requirement for an upstream A-motif for efficient inhibition.

First, we have shown that TIEs can function in vitro using cell-free translation extracts. We then confirmed the results obtained with these extracts using in vivo assays in several cell lines. Our findings suggest that <italic>Hoxa3</italic> inhibits translation by an uORF which is translated through the whole 5’UTR of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> mRNA producing a small protein of size 9 KDa. Interestingly, the alignment of <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE shows a conservation of the uAUG111 (highlighted in red box) among different species. In contrast to the localization of the uAUG that is highly conserved, the coding sequence of the uORF is not conserved among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, uORFs have been recognized as regulators of translation for number of cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbosa et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, four uORFs in the 5’ leader of yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA restrict the flow of scanning ribosomes from the cap site to the <italic>GCN4</italic> initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch, 1993</xref>). In plants, the uORF in <italic>AdoMetDC</italic> mRNA generates a nascent hexapeptide that interacts with its translating ribosome to suppress translation of <italic>AdoMetDC</italic> RNA in a cell-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uchiyama-Kadokura et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, our data indicates that eIF2D is required in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE mode of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). A recent study has shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATF4 mRNA translation is induced by eIF2D and its homologue DENR during integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasudevan et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, eIF2D requires its RNA binding motif to mediate translation of ATF4 mRNA through its 5’ leader sequence consisting of multiple uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasudevan et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that eIF2α phosphorylation during stages of embryonic development promotes translation from uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friend et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, canonical cap-dependent translation initiation with eIF2 is not possible during embryonic development. The cap-dependent translation initiation of uORF from <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE might use eIF2D as an alternative to replace inactive phosphorylated eIF2 to promote uORF translation. So far, the only <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence that has been clearly defined on an mRNA for specific eIF2D recruitment is an A-rich motif upstream of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>). We showed that <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE contains such an A-motif upstream of the uORF that is critical for TIE function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Other reports showed that eIF2D would form initiation complexes on leaderless and A-rich 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akulich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE, mass spectrometry analysis enabled us to demonstrate that eIF2D is present only in pre-initiation complexes programmed with <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE. Importantly, two more factors, eIF5B and HBS1L, have been specifically found in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> complexes, which would be interesting to investigate their involvement in eIF2D-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Regarding <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE, the ribosome recognizes a combination of two <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). (i) A start-stop codon combination located at positions 84–89 and (ii) a long highly stable GC-rich helical structure (SL) located at +20 downstream of the uAUG (by convention, the A from the AUG being +1). These two elements act in synergy to promote the stalling of an 80S complex upstream of the SL. This is a reminiscent of a similar mechanism that has been described in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NIP5.1 5’UTR mRNA that contains an AUG-stop that regulates translation of the main ORF through a ribosome stalling mechanism and mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 2016</xref>). This mechanism requires only the start-stop codons. In the case of <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE, the stable SL structure that is present downstream of the AUG-stop plays a major role. A ribosome that is stalled with a stop codon in the A-site, in other words an empty A-site without any tRNA, is usually the signal for recruitment of the release factors to dissociate the ribosomal subunits from the mRNA. With our cell-free translation assay and sucrose gradient analysis, we showed that the stalled 80S programmed with <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE is very stable and does not dissociate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). A possible explanation for the stability of this complex could be that the SL blocks the access of the release factors to the empty A-site thereby preventing ribosome dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the alignment of <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE among different species shows that the start-stop combination (highlighted in red) lacks conservation and remains species-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Some species possess a substitution of the start codon AUG to AUG-like codons such as GUG or a mutation of stop codon that leads to a longer uORF. In contrast, the SL (104–154) remains highly conserved suggesting its high functional significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accordingly, we have shown that the sole SL is strong enough to impede scanning by the pre-initiation complex. Indeed, secondary structures in the 5’UTR have been shown to inhibit translation like the case of a conserved SL structure in the 5’UTR of TGF-β1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, in various species, <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE might use different combinations of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in order to block cap-dependent translation, the common <italic>cis</italic>-acting element between all species being the SL that is conserved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Two distinct models for translational inhibition by <italic>Hoxa3</italic> translation inhibitory element (TIE) and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE.</title><p>A model for <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE suggests a ribosomal assembly on the uAUG111 with a requirement of eIF2D initiation factor.

Our probing experiments revealed that the folding of both <italic>Hoxa3</italic> and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIEs is independent of the presence of IRES suggesting that their mode of action does not depend on the IRES. TIE may have evolved in such a way to favour the translation from the downstream IRES hence justifying why there is variation in terms of sequence and mechanism but same inhibitory effect. This unique combination of an inhibitor of canonical translation mechanism and the activator of specialized translation sets an interesting point on how the 5’UTR elements confer ribosome specificity to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the acquisition of these TIEs in subsets of Hox mRNAs enables an additional layer of regulatory control between the canonical translation and the IRES-dependent one. One intriguing study would be to determine how other TIEs a4 and a9 inhibit translation and whether there are common functional features amongst all Hox mRNAs. Beyond Hox mRNAs, our data on eIF2D suggests a specific role in translation initiation and it would be interesting to decipher its precise role at the molecular level. More precisely, investigations that will allow determining how uORF length, codon composition, and consensus sequences may influence the role of eIF2D in the initiation process on uORFs are needed. Future studies will be required to fully understand the role of eIF2D in translation initiation of specific mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For in vitro studies, murine <italic>Hoxa3</italic> TIE (170 nts) and <italic>Hoxa11</italic> TIE (216 nts) (sequences were kindly provided by Dr Maria Barna, which were amplified from mouse E10.5–12.5 cDNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xue et al., 2015</xref>) were placed upstream of 5’UTR of <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> (accession number: KU350152) (50 nts) and <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> luciferase coding sequence (accession number: M63501) (936 nts).

Firefly luciferase activities were measured to monitor transfection efficiency in order to normalize RLuc activities for each construct.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Co-transfection assay of siRNAs and reporter plasmid in HEK293T cells</title><p>HEK293FT cells were used to test the effect on inhibition of eIF2D knock-down and of a non-target siRNA pool, as a negative control, on RLuc expression (<italic>hRluc-neo</italic>) in pmirGLO vectors. We used ON-TARGETplus human siRNAs against eIF2D (catalog number L-003680-01-00) and siRNA-NT (catalog number D-001810-10-05) purchased from Horizon Discovery. HEK293T cells were cultured according to manufacturer’s instructions (ATCC) for 24 hr and used for co-transfection by siRNAs and reporter plasmid. We used 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 1 ml of culture medium without antibiotics. Upon reaching 70% confluence, cells were transfected by 5 pmoles of siRNAs in different wells with 500 ng of reporter plasmid. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hr, cells were washed twice by phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1×) and incubated with passive lysis buffer 1× for 15 min. Luciferase assay was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford’s assay. The impact of silencing on TIE-mediated translation inhibition was measured by luciferase assay according to manufacturer’s instructions as previously mentioned.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blot against eIF2D and GAPDH</title><p>The silencing efficiency was quantified by western blots using rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF2D antibody (12840–1-AP) from Proteintech and mouse polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (sc-1377179) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For that, 20 μg of protein extracts were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. After migration, proteins were transferred to an Immobilin-P membrane (Millipore) at 10 V for 1 hr in a semi-dry apparatus (Trans-Blot SD) on a PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane that had been previously activated with 100% methanol for few seconds and a transfer buffer pH 8 (25 mM Tris; 200 mM glycine; 20% ethanol). After transfer, the membrane was saturated for 2 hr by blocking buffer (5% milk, 0.05% Tween-20, PBS 1×). Primary antibodies were added at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers in blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C. Then, the membranes were washed three times by PBST (PBS 1×; 0.05% Tween-20) to remove the excess of primary antibodies. Then, membranes were incubated with secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 1 hr at room temperature followed by three washing steps. The signal produced by reaction between HRP and ECL (Kit ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System, GE Healthcare) was detected by chemiluminescence using imaging Chemidoc (Biorad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ribosome toe printing assay</title><p>Toe printing assay was adapted from previously established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, RRLs were incubated for 5 min at 30°C then 10 min on ice with buffer containing 1 U/μl of recombinant RNasin (Promega), 75 mM KCl 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3 mM of puromycin prior to initiation complex assembly. Then, the pre-initiation complexes were formed by incubation with 500 nM of the RNA of interest in the presence of specific inhibitors such as cycloheximide (1 mg/ml) or GMP-PNP (4 mM) for 5 min at 30°C and then 20 min on ice. Then, the pre-initiation complexes were complemented with one volume of ice-cold buffer A containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KAc, 2.5 mM MgAc<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 0.25 mM spermidine and placed on ice. In order to separate ribosomal complexes from the non-ribosomal fraction, samples were centrifuged at 88,000 rpm in S100AT3 rotor (Sorvall-Hitachi) at 4°C for 1 hr. After centrifugation, the pellets containing the pre-initiation complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of ice-cold buffer A and incubated with 5’ radioactively labelled DNA oligonucleotide complementary to nts 22–51 of RLuc coding sequence for 3 min at 30°C. Then, 1 μl of a 320 mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub>, 4 μl of a dNTP mixture (containing 5 mM of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP), 10 units of recombinant RNAsin (Promega), and 1 unit/μl AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) were added and incubated for 1 hr at 30°C. The synthesized cDNAs were analysed on 8% PAGE next to sequencing ladders.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by ‘Agence Nationale pour la Recherche’ (Ribofluidix, ANR-17-CE12-0025-01), by University of Strasbourg, and by the ‘Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique’.

The paper reports that the translation of Hox a3 and a11 is regulated by different mechanisms. The inhibitory mechanism that is mediated by TIE a3 requires the translation initiation factor eIF2D, while The inhibitory mechanism of TIE a11 is mediated by three elements: an upstream start codon (uAUG), followed by a stop codon, and a long stable hairpin. These findings show that the TIE elements of Hox mRNAs control translation via novel mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Translation Inhibitory Elements from Hox a3 and a11 mRNAs use uORFs for translation inhibition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Given the importance of HoxA mRNAs in development the paper is of interest. The study is comprehensive and thorough. A revised version needs to address the listed below criticisms and concerns. The full text of the reviewers' comments is appended, inasmuch as they contain many additional thoughtful and constructive criticisms.</p><p>1. The mass spectral tables must be shown.

Reviewer #1 raised issues with peak/fraction assignments.</p><p>3. Figure 7A (reviewer #1). It is not clear why is it expected that reduction in eIF4E levels would interfere with TIE-mediated inhibition on translation. Also, internal controls, which are known to be (or not be) responsive to eIF4E and eIF2D suppression are lacking making it difficult to judge whether the changes in expression are specific.</p><p>4. It is not clear why specifically Hox a3 and a11 were investigated, and not the other HoxA mRNAs (reviewer #3).</p><p>5. Figure 6 (reviewer#3), both TIE a3 and a11 are showing RPL38 ribosomal protein. Why is it stated on page 38 that Hox a3 mRNA is RPL38-independent?</p><p>6. In vitro and cell-based experiments assessing the translational activity of reporters lack internal reference controls. What is usually used in these types of experiments is an IRES-driven reporter that can inform on non-specific inhibition events and control for transfection efficiencies</p><p>7. The paper is too long.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are many instances (in other contexts) where uORFs or secondary structure within 5' UTRs have been found to be detrimental to translation initiation. Whereas the current study provides insight into the specific regulation of the Hox a3 and Hox a11 mRNAs, the mechanism elucidated is not particularly novel.</p><p>1. In vitro and cell-based experiments assessing the translational activity of reporters lack internal reference controls (unless I am missing something on how the data was processed). What is usually used in these types of experiments is an IRES-driven reporter that can inform on non-specific inhibition events and control for transfection efficiencies. As well, the authors have not ruled out differential mRNA stabilities contributing to reduced output from test mRNAs in any of their experiments.</p><p>2. FiguresS3B, 5C and 8 – In this ribosome binding assay, we do not see the distribution of the ribosomes throughout the gradient, only the radiolabelled counts of the mRNA are plotted as % of input. How do the authors know to assign polysomes, 80S, 48S, RNP to specific parts of the gradient? I'm assuming they are using the migration of their labelled mRNA in the presence of drugs whose mechanism of action are known to infer there the polysomes, 80S, 48S, RNP are located, but this is indirect. Normally, when these polysome binding studies are understaken, one monitors the OD260 profile to directly observe the ribosome distribution throughout the gradient. The mRNA counts are then layered on top of this.</p><p>3. The authors undertake Mass Spect analysis of pre-initiation complexes purified by affinity chromatography and report differences in protein-RNA complexes when complexes were formed on TIE a3 versus TIE a11 globin mRNA. I couldnt really get a sense of how well the purification worked, on the quality of the MS data, nor could I find comprehensive experimental validation performed on several of the &quot;hits&quot;. The authors refer to eIF2D (as well as eIF1A, eIF1a-X, eIF5B, LARS, QARS, DHX21, HBS1L [p. 16]) as TIE a3 enriched factors and make the statement that this hints at two distinct TIE-mediated inhibitions. I disagree with this statement since factors, such as eIF5B, eIF1A, LARS, QARS, are required for the basic translation process and their presence will simply reflect which stage of translation is captured/enriched in the affinity chromatography experiments. I think this preliminary data is over-interpreted in its current form. Since PKR appears in the a3 and a11 complexes, is eIF2alpha phosphorylated in cells expressing these reporters?</p><p>4. The labelling on siRNA-eIF2D panel for TIE a3 in Figure 7 should be better positioned above the panel.</p><p>5. I don't understand the results with si4E in Figure 7A. Why is it expected that reduction in eIF4E levels would interfere with TIE-mediated inhibition on translation? As well, internal controls known to be (or not be) responsive to eIF4E and eIF2D suppression are lacking here in order to be able to know if changes in expression are specific.</p><p>6. I'm not sure the cycloheximide experiment in Figure 8 adds to the understanding of the a3 TIE. It's not that complexes are &quot;resistant&quot; to cycloheximide (as the authors state in their subtitle), it's just that different complexes are observed compared to the reporter without the TIE 5' UTR. Without knowing the basis for these additional complexes, or their composition, this experiment is of limited value since a clear interpretation is difficult to make.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The tables for the mass spectrometry experiments were not included. These should be added.</p><p>2. Based on the data presented, it seems the authors are overemphasizing the &quot;start-stop&quot; part of the mechanism for a11. A better wording would note the generality of the SL for a11, and a species-specific use of a &quot;start-stop&quot; uORF upstream of the SL.</p><p>3. All of the data points for the bar graphs should be plotted on top of the bars.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are 9 figures in the manuscript that should be consolidated, as it is cumbersome for the reader to follow.</p><p>2. What is the relation between Hox and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes Antp and Ubx? This is not clear in the Introduction section.</p><p>3. It is not clear why specifically Hox a3 and a11 were investigated, and not the other HoxA mRNAs.</p><p>4. The grammar of manuscript needs correction, and many sentences are missing appropriate punctuation which adds to confusion</p><p>5. The term in vivo refers to research done with or within an entire living organism. The term in vitro refers to research done outside of a living organism, this included studying cells in culture. The term in vivo should be corrected in the manuscript. OR better yet, don't use either term because they are context dependent.</p><p>6. The mutations performed in AUG123 from Figure S3A (right panel) are not described in the manuscript.</p><p>7. What does FLa3 stand for in Figure 4A?</p><p>8. Why does Figure S4B (right panel) have two lanes for Hox a3 and w/o TIE? Are they representing duplicate results? The lanes should be labeled.</p><p>9. Are the results from Figure S5 statistically significant?</p><p>10. Figure 6 (middle panel) is not showing QARS, as mentioned in the manuscript on page 16, line 8.</p><p>11. Figure 6, both TIE a3 and a11 are showing RPL38 ribosomal protein. Why does page 38 states that Hox a3 mRNA is RPL38-independent?</p><p>12. Page 17 lines 1-5, the percentage mentioned of 74% and 76% are respectively to Hox a3 and a11? This should be clarified.</p><p>13. The silencing of eIF2D at efficiency of 81% has no significant effect on a11-mediated inhibition compared to which sample? Needs explanation.</p><p>14. The text describing GMP-PNP and cycloheximide from page 18 should be moved to the first mention of each inhibitor in the manuscript.</p><p>15. In Figure 7, the blots should be improved and experiments repeated in the 10T<sub>1/2</sub> cells (that are used elsewhere in the manuscript) which mimic the embryonic development and differentiation.</p><p>16. One of the major weaknesses is that there is no functional assay to really assess the role of these findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66369.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the importance of HoxA mRNAs in development the paper is of interest.

As presented in the manuscript, we have validated the involvement of eIF2D in TIE a3-mediated inhibition in vivo by an RNA interference approach. Importantly, eIF2D does not seem to be involved in TIE a11-mediated inhibition. Since our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that eIF2D is found only with a3 but not with a11 (Figure 6), our functional data (New Figure 7) are in agreement with our Mass Spectrometry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The ribosome binding assays are problematic and need to be rectified (reviewer #2). Reviewer #1 raised issues with peak/fraction assignments.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewers for their constructive comments. In these experiments, we incubate 5’-capped and radiolabeled mRNA transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The coloured sections corresponding to polysomes, 80S, 48S and RNP have been assigned according to the OD profiles at 254 nm for each sucrose gradient fractionation. To improve the clarity of the profiles, we have chosen not to superimpose all the OD profiles on top of the radioactivity curves. However, we have generated a new supplemental figure S6 showing an example of the OD profile on top of the radioactivity curves to clarify how the coloured sections have been assigned. We have also explained in more details the experiments and the coloured section assignment in figure 5C legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 7A (reviewer #1). It is not clear why is it expected that reduction in eIF4E levels would interfere with TIE-mediated inhibition on translation. Also, internal controls, which are known to be (or not be) responsive to eIF4E and eIF2D suppression are lacking making it difficult to judge whether the changes in expression are specific.</p></disp-quote><p>The confusion comes from the fact that siRNA against eIF4E have additive effects on two mechanisms, first it affects TIE-mediated inhibition since TIE are using uORF that are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism but the siRNA against eIF4E also impacts the expression of the main ORF, the Renilla coding sequence (RL) which is translated by leaky scanning of the uORF and, more importantly the second reporter Firefly luciferase (FL) that is used for normalization. Therefore, the reviewer is right, the conception of this experiment is not appropriate. We thank the reviewer for pointing this contradiction. Indeed, we cannot use the siRNA against eIF4E in this experiment. First, we improved the presentation of the experimental procedure in figure 7A. We clearly show that the plasmid pmirGLO used harbours two reporter genes, Renilla luciferase to test the impact of TIEs and Firefly luciferase for normalization purposes. We also remodelled the presentation of this experiment and limited it to the assessment of the impact of siRNA against eIF2D only. Our current figure shows the RL/FL ratio for each co-transfection experiment. Using this ratio, we can compare the effect of silencing eIF2D to that of nontarget siRNAs in a3, a11 and pmirGLO constructs. In this latter case, the design of this experiment is appropriate since eIF2D silencing does not impact the translation of the main ORF. This is corroborated by the fact that eIF2D silencing has no impact on the second internal control reporter, Firefly luciferase. Another important result of this experiment is that silencing of eIF2D impacts specifically a3 but not a11. This also confirms our Mass Spec data that demonstrates that eIF2D is recruited specifically on a3 but not on a11. The figure 7A legend has been corrected accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear why specifically Hox a3 and a11 were investigated, and not the other HoxA mRNAs (reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>We choose to work with a3 and a11 for several reasons. First, among hox, the translation mechanisms used are distinct (Xue et al., 2015). In fact some hoxA mRNAs are translated by an RPL38-mediated mechanism whereas some others do not require RPL38 to be present on the ribosome, which hints at least two different mechanisms. We wanted to investigate further an example of each of these two categories; Hox a11 mRNA translation being RPL38-dependent while Hox a3 is not. Another important criteria for the choice of a3 and a11 is their high inhibition rate of their TIE element, a3 and a11 are among the best (Xue et al., 2015). Last but not least, we chose a3 and a11 because of their small 5’UTR size, which makes them more suitable for several experiments that were conducted in our study, which required pure RNA transcripts with a high purification quality. Indeed, such experiments are more challenging with longer transcripts. These three arguments are now explained in the introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 6 (reviewer#3), both TIE a3 and a11 are showing RPL38 ribosomal protein. Why is it stated on page 38 that Hox a3 mRNA is RPL38-independent?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, our mass spectrometry data showed that pre-initiation complexes assembled with both TIE elements contain RPL38. This seems to be contradictory because in the literature, only hoxa11 translation has been described to be RPL38independent (Xue et al., 2015). In fact, all the ribosomal proteins are present in these complexes, which is expected since we purified a full ribosome and we don’t expect specific depletion of RPL38 from the ribosome. This does not mean that RPL38 is needed for translation but it is present in our analysis just because it is part of the ribosome. However, the reviewer is right our statistical analysis shows that RPL38 is enriched with both a3 and a11 TIEs. Although this is interesting, so far, we have no rationale to explain this fact, we added two sentences to the manuscript to discuss this point in the result section. We also want to mention that the study from Xue et al. addresses the role of RPL38 for IRES functioning yet no study has been conducted to address the role of RPL38 for TIE functioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In vitro and cell-based experiments assessing the translational activity of reporters lack internal reference controls. What is usually used in these types of experiments is an IRES-driven reporter that can inform on non-specific inhibition events and control for transfection efficiencies</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, such experiments need internal controls. Concerning in vitro cellfree experiments, we did perform quality checks of our extracts using various reporter genes. Using a standard reporter construct containing the β-globin 5’UTR upstream of a Renilla coding sequence, we showed that translation is predominantly cap-dependent as expected in our self-made extracts from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We have included in supplementary figure 1A, an additional panel that shows cap-dependency of RRL with a reporter mRNA without TIE. Concerning the in vivo experiments, we have in fact included an internal control in all our experiments. The plasmid used harbours two reporter genes, a Renilla luciferase in which we test the inhibition of TIEs and a Firefly luciferase that is translated in a canonical cap-dependent manner. All the results have been normalized against this internal control. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have clarified this point by inserting a new supplementary figure S1A for the in vitro experiments reference controls that we have used for assessing the translational activity of our cell-free extracts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The paper is too long.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed figure 8 and the discussion about this point to shorten the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are many instances (in other contexts) where uORFs or secondary structure within 5' UTRs have been found to be detrimental to translation initiation. Whereas the current study provides insight into the specific regulation of the Hox a3 and Hox a11 mRNAs, the mechanism elucidated is not particularly novel.</p><p>1. In vitro and cell-based experiments assessing the translational activity of reporters lack internal reference controls (unless I am missing something on how the data was processed). What is usually used in these types of experiments is an IRES-driven reporter that can inform on non-specific inhibition events and control for transfection efficiencies. As well, the authors have not ruled out differential mRNA stabilities contributing to reduced output from test mRNAs in any of their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning RNA controls, we have answered to this point (see point 6 of general comments). For the stability of our transcripts in cell-free translation extracts, we want to emphasize that we are using capped-mRNA transcripts in addition to RNAse inhibitors. The use of these cell-free extracts has been assessed carefully in our lab since several years. In particular, we have shown previously that there is no RNA degradation is these assays (Martin et al., 2011; Mol Cell, Martin et al., 2016 Nat Comm, Gross et al., 2018 NAR, Martin et al., 2018 Nat Comm). Concerning in vivo assays, we used the plasmid pmirGlo that contains two reporters. This allows internal standardization of each assay by normalization of the same reporter in every assay. Figure 7 has been clarified to better explain the experimental procedure of our in vivo assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figures S3B, 5C and 8 – In this ribosome binding assay, we do not see the distribution of the ribosomes throughout the gradient, only the radiolabelled counts of the mRNA are plotted as % of input. How do the authors know to assign polysomes, 80S, 48S, RNP to specific parts of the gradient? I'm assuming they are using the migration of their labelled mRNA in the presence of drugs whose mechanism of action are known to infer there the polysomes, 80S, 48S, RNP are located, but this is indirect. Normally, when these polysome binding studies are undertaken, one monitors the OD260 profile to directly observe the ribosome distribution throughout the gradient. The mRNA counts are then layered on top of this.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer for these constructive comments. Yes, we haven’t shown the OD profiles in purpose. We didn’t want to superimpose all the OD profiles to improve the clarity of our plots. However, we have assigned the polysomes, 80S, 48S and RNP sections according to the OD profiles. As an example, we inserted an additional supplementary figure S6 showing one OD profile on top of the sucrose gradient from figure 5. We also implemented the figures 5C and S6 legends with a better description of the assignments of each section with the OD profile. In conclusion, we believe that overlaying OD profiles on all the plots will be detrimental to the clarity of the figures and we would prefer not to show them but rather keep the coloured sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors undertake Mass Spect analysis of pre-initiation complexes purified by affinity chromatography and report differences in protein-RNA complexes when complexes were formed on TIE a3 versus TIE a11 globin mRNA. I couldn’t really get a sense of how well the purification worked, on the quality of the MS data, nor could I find comprehensive experimental validation performed on several of the &quot;hits&quot;. The authors refer to eIF2D (as well as eIF1A, eIF1a-X, eIF5B, LARS, QARS, DHX21, HBS1L [p. 16]) as TIE a3 enriched factors and make the statement that this hints at two distinct TIE-mediated inhibitions. I disagree with this statement since factors, such as eIF5B, eIF1A, LARS, QARS, are required for the basic translation process and their presence will simply reflect which stage of translation is captured/enriched in the affinity chromatography experiments. I think this preliminary data is over-interpreted in its current form. Since PKR appears in the a3 and a11 complexes, is eIF2alpha phosphorylated in cells expressing these reporters?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we included the results of our Mass Spec analysis. We would like to emphasize that the complex purifications have been done in three independent experiments. Analysis of the multidimensional scaling plots, which illustrate the global variance and similarities between the GMP-PNP complexes and cycloheximide complexes detected in the replicates, after a median-to-ratio normalization, shows that our purification procedure is robust and highly reproducible. Moreover, we have used routinely this purification procedure for pre-initiation complexes isolation (Prongidi et al., 2013; Chicher et al., 2015) that allowed us to faithfully characterizer specific eIFs on CrPV IRES (Gross et al., 2017, NAR) and pre-initiation complexes assembled on histone H4 mRNA with a high purity grad that allowed further characterization and visualization by Cryo-EM (Martin et al., 2016, Nat Comm). In the volcano plots presented in the manuscript, we show only the differences between complexes. We now present as supplementary material the full datasets as supplementary tables 1 and 2. The outcome of our experiments clearly shows that we purified pre-initiation complexes that all contain ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic initiation factors indicating functional complexes.</p><p>Among specific proteins, the reviewer is right that there are other very interesting candidates. We chose to focus on eIF2D in this manuscript for further functional validation. Nevertheless, other candidates will be pursued in future studies. We added a comment in the results and in the Discussion sections in the revised manuscript on two interesting candidates, eIF5B and HBS1L as pointed out by reviewer #2. Concerning PKR, the reviewer points out an interesting question, we have not checked whether eIF2 is phosphorylated in cells expressing TIE reporters, we will also address this issue in future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The labelling on siRNA-eIF2D panel for TIE a3 in Figure 7 should be better positioned above the panel.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I don't understand the results with si4E in Figure 7A. Why is it expected that reduction in eIF4E levels would interfere with TIE-mediated inhibition on translation? As well, internal controls known to be (or not be) responsive to eIF4E and eIF2D suppression are lacking here in order to be able to know if changes in expression are specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7 has been totally remodelled in order to address the concerns from the reviewer. (see point 3 of general comments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I'm not sure the cycloheximide experiment in Figure 8 adds to the understanding of the a3 TIE. It's not that complexes are &quot;resistant&quot; to cycloheximide (as the authors state in their subtitle), it's just that different complexes are observed compared to the reporter without the TIE 5' UTR. Without knowing the basis for these additional complexes, or their composition, this experiment is of limited value since a clear interpretation is difficult to make.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for this comment. We agree that this experiment is not conclusive and although we are convinced that the unconventional profile that was observed in the presence of cycloheximide is interesting, we don’t have a rational explanation so far. Since the paper is too long (point 7), we propose to remove Figure 8 from the manuscript and the comments related to this figure (i.e. point 6 of general comments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Our conclusion was based on the comparison of RL/FL values in eIF2D silencing and in the non-target pool of siRNAs. The difference between the two RL/FL values would represent the effect of eIF2D silencing on a11-mediated inhibition. Accordingly, RL/FL values upon eIF2D silencing (0.017) and upon using non-target pool of siRNAs (0.02) are almost the same then we can conclude that there is no significant effect of eIF2D silencing on a11-mediated inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

However, following hox expression in vivo is very challenging, it is well described that western blot for Hox protein are very difficult because reliable antibodies are not easily available. According to (Luo et al.,2019: PMID: 30866492), one of the main technological challenges to study Hox is that: “Most commercial antibodies to the HOX proteins are of very low quality (perhaps due to the strong evolutionary conservation of their protein sequences) and cannot even detect exogenously expressed high levels of the target HOX protein”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
