Although GpsB has been studied in several bacteria, the structure, function, and interactome of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> GpsB is largely uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, we solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB, which adopts an atypical, asymmetric dimer, and demonstrates major conformational flexibility that can be mapped to a hinge region formed by a three-residue insertion exclusive to <italic>Staphylococci</italic>. When this three-residue insertion is excised, its thermal stability increases, and the mutant no longer produces a previously reported lethal phenotype when overexpressed in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we show that these hinge mutants are less functional and speculate that the conformational flexibility imparted by the hinge region may serve as a dynamic switch to fine-tune the function of the GpsB complex and/or to promote interaction with its various partners. Furthermore, we provide the first biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic evidence that the N-terminal domain of GpsB binds not only PBP4, but also FtsZ, through a conserved recognition motif located on their C-termini, thus coupling peptidoglycan synthesis to cell division. Taken together, the unique structure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB and its direct interaction with FtsZ/PBP4 provide deeper insight into the central role of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell division.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>GpsB recognition motif</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>penicillin-binding protein</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>EzrA</kwd><kwd>DivIVA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI164775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><name><surname>Eswara</surname><given-names>Prahathees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM133617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eswara</surname><given-names>Prahathees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminal domain of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> GpsB, a scaffolding protein, forms an atypical asymmetric dimer and binds to the C-termini of FtsZ and PBP4, influencing the localization and regulation of both the Z-ring and cell wall synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial cell division is a dynamic process involving more than a dozen proteins that form a multimeric complex at mid-cell. Collectively known as the divisome, this network of scaffolding proteins and enzymes stimulates peptidoglycan synthesis, constricts the existing membrane, and forms the septal cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahone and Goley, 2020</xref>). While divisomal proteins may differ among certain clades, most are conserved among all bacteria. Perhaps the most important and well-studied divisomal protein is FtsZ, a bacterial homolog of eukaryotic tubulin. FtsZ marks the division site by forming a ‘Z-ring’ in association with early-stage divisomal proteins such as FtsA, ZapA, SepF, and EzrA in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</xref>). Late-stage divisomal proteins such as DivIVA, FtsL, DivIB, and various penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) subsequently assemble to carry out cell division and facilitate the separation and creation of identical daughter cells.</p><p>GpsB is a DivIVA-like protein that is highly conserved in Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halbedel and Lewis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>). While GpsB is dispensable, or conditionally essential in most Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fleurie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tavares et al., 2008</xref>), it was reported to be essential for growth in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santiago et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillaspy, 2006</xref>). However, recent studies indicate that <italic>gpsB</italic> may not be essential, but nevertheless plays a significant role in maintaining <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartlett et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2023</xref>). In particular, the importance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB (<italic>Sa</italic> GpsB) for cell division is underscored by its unique ability to regulate FtsZ polymerization in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>). At this time, GpsB-FtsZ interaction has not been reported in other bacteria. <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB has also been reported to interact with other cell division proteins such as EzrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steele et al., 2011</xref>), DivIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottomley et al., 2017</xref>), and the wall teichoic acids (WTA) biosynthesis/export proteins TarO and TarG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kent, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The interaction of GpsB with PBPs has also been investigated in several bacteria, including <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>) PBPA1, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>) PBP2a, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<italic>Bs</italic>) PBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halbedel and Lewis, 2019</xref>). These studies show that GpsB binds to a short, ~5- to 30-residue N-terminal sequence found on the cytosolic region of these bitopic PBPs, referred to as an N-terminal ‘mini-domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>). Cleverley et al. found PBP mini-domains containing an (S/T)-R-X-X-R-(R/K) motif directly interact with the N-terminal domain of GpsB by forming electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with a shallow, acidic cavity located at the GpsB dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>While <italic>Lm</italic>, <italic>Sp</italic>, and <italic>Bs</italic> have at least six annotated PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kocaoglu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korsak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunst et al., 1997</xref>), there are only four in <italic>S. aureus</italic>: PBP1, PBP2, PBP3, and PBP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillaspy, 2006</xref>) - five in methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) which expresses an additional β-lactam insensitive PBP, PBP2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartman and Tomasz, 1984</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> is further distinguished by its highly cross-linked peptidoglycan and can readily become resistant to β-lactams via PBP4 and the acquisition of PBP2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Łeski and Tomasz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snowden and Perkins, 1990</xref>). It is believed this β-lactam-resistant phenotype relies on WTA assembly, which influences the function and localization of PBP4 and PBP2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atilano et al., 2010</xref>). While PBP2a is a historically recognized element of antibacterial resistance, PBP4 has recently been found to contribute to β-lactam insensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>). As the sole class C PBP in <italic>S. aureus,</italic> PBP4 bears the fold and architecture of a carboxypeptidase, but uniquely catalyzes both transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henze and Berger-Bächi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Navratna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wyke et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show that <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB directly binds to FtsZ and PBP4 through a signature GpsB recognition sequence. Further analysis of the GpsB N-terminal domain reveals unique conformations and innate flexibility that is integral to the function of GpsB. Together, these findings provide insight into the unique role of GpsB in synchronizing FtsZ dynamics with cell wall synthesis during cell division in <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The crystal structure of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB N-terminal domain reveals an atypical asymmetric dimer</title><p>The full-length <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB is a relatively small protein of 114 residues. Its N-terminal domain homodimerizes as a coiled-coil, while its smaller C-terminal domain homotrimerizes, forming a hexamer as the biological unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halbedel and Lewis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cleverley et al., 2016</xref>).

The overall structure of GpsB is similar to previously determined GpsB orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rismondo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>) and retains the same fold of DivIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>), though it shares much less sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Dimerization of the N-terminal domain is facilitated by a pattern of nonpolar residues every three to four residues, promoting the formation of a hydrophobic core in the coiled-coil. This N-terminal domain is partitioned into three regions: a relatively short α-helix with approximately two turns (residues 10–16), a second longer α-helix (residues 28–70) that forms a coiled-coil, and an amphipathic 10-residue loop (residues 17–27) that links these two helices and intertwines with the adjacent protomer, ‘capping’ GpsB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In contrast, GpsB protomers from <italic>Lm, Bs</italic>, <italic>Sp</italic>, and <italic>Sa</italic> DivIVA are almost linear (θ=167–179°) and practically indistinguishable when superimposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We find that there is a 3-amino acid insertion in the <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB sequence where the helicity is disrupted and that a cluster of four Met residues (Met45, Met48) are interlocked at the dimer interface at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; dotted rectangle). These Met residues are only found in <italic>Staphylococci</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and take the place of an aromatic Tyr or Phe present in other orthologs, which normally stabilize the core via π stacking interactions. While the 3-amino acid insertion likely disrupts the continuity of the coiled-coil, methionine is one of the most flexible aliphatic amino acids and may further contribute to the conformational flexibility.</p><p>Experiments using solution state NMR spectroscopy further support the notion of intrinsic conformational heterogeneity, suggesting it is a bona fide structural feature rather than a crystallization artifact. The <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>WT</sup><sub>1-70</sub> construct contains a two-residue N-terminal extension (GH) after removal of the purification tag, and thus a total of 72 signals are expected. The 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum shows good signal dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is characteristic of a folded domain. However, a total of 100 well-resolved backbone amide signals are observed, and seven pairs of signals are detected in the Asn/Gln sidechain region instead of four pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The appearance of the additional signals is not due to proline <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization since there are no prolines in the sequence, nor is it due to self-aggregation of the dimers to form a dimer-of-dimers or higher order oligomers, because raising the concentration from 160 to 700 μM has no effect on the number of signals in the spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>WT</sup><sub>1-70</sub> exhibits differential linewidths, with a set of 13 narrow signals at the center of the spectrum where disordered segments appear, and a larger set of 87 signals dispersed throughout the spectrum. The number of the narrow signals corresponds well with the number of residues found at the flexible N-terminus, suggesting that the appearance of extra signals is due to sampling of multiple conformations of the coiled-coil. Furthermore, three of the four Asn/Gln sidechain pairs showing chemical shift degeneracy are adjacent to the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) providing strong evidence that the observed conformational heterogeneity occurs at this region.</p><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using Gromacs v. 5.0.4 and a CHARMM36m force field also support the idea that conformational flexibility exists in solution.

Deleting either MAD or MNN produces a homology model where residues 45–70, normally displaced by one turn, are now aligned with their orthologous residue pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To investigate the relative degree of stability imparted by these residues, GpsB mutant lacking the extra MAD or MNN residues at the hinge region was recombinantly constructed and purified, and T<sub>m</sub> (melting temperature) was determined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Most of the dispersed signals from the coiled-coil region experience severe broadening, in many cases beyond detection, as well as changes in chemical shift, while all narrow signals at the center of the spectrum show no change in linewidth or positions. Signal broadening is caused by changes in the rate of interconversion between the available conformations from the intermediate-slow for WT (s) to the intermediate-fast exchange regime for ΔMAD (ms), but without altering the overall number of states, as seven pairs of Asn/Gln sidechain pairs of signals are observed.

We used this system to probe the significance of the flexibility provided by MAD/MNN residues for the function of GpsB. First, we conducted a growth assay on solid medium by spotting serial dilutions of cells of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> WT and cells harboring an inducible copy of <italic>Bs gpsB</italic>, <italic>Sa gpsB</italic>, <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic>, or <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup></italic>. As previously established, overproduction of <italic>Bs</italic> GpsB is not lethal, but <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB is (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, overproduction of either ΔMAD or ΔMNN <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB is not lethal and cells grow as well as the negative controls (<italic>B. subtilis</italic> WT and inducible <italic>Bs</italic> GpsB strain). These results suggest the hinge region of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, characterized by two Met residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), is essential for the normal function of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB as assessed by lethal phenotype in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. To further investigate the impact of these mutations, we examined GFP tagged ΔMAD and ΔMNN <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. As reported previously, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <italic>Bs</italic> GpsB-GFP localizes to the division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tavares et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>) and does not lead to filamentation upon overproduction (2.09 ±0.49 µm; n=50), but <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB-GFP forms foci throughout the entire cell, and causes severe filamentation (22.83 ±16.51 µm; n=21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>). However, ΔMAD and ΔMNN variants of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB-GFP do not cause filamentation (2.13 ±0.44 µm and 2.10 ±0.43 µm respectively; n=50) and are clearly localized at the division site. It has been noted previously that <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB-GFP also localizes to the division sites at initial stages prior to causing filamentation at a lower inducer concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, this data suggests the ΔMAD and ΔMNN mutants presumably interact with the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell division machinery to allow for division site localization, but fail to elicit lethal filamentation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated the phenotypes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains that overexpress <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup> and <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup>. First, we conducted a growth assay by spotting serial dilutions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains harboring an empty vector (EV) or an additional plasmid-based inducible copy of <italic>Sa gpsB</italic>, <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic>, or <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup></italic>. Overproduction of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB leads to a 100- to 1000-fold growth inhibition compared to EV control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, while cells overproducing <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup> grew similarly to the EV control, <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic> overexpression resulted in growth inhibition comparable to <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB. We hypothesized that the difference in phenotype is due to differential affinity of native <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB (produced from chromosomal locus) to <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup> and <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup> mutants (produced from a plasmid-based system), leading to varying propensity for homo/hetero complex formation. To test this, we conducted bacterial two-hybrid analysis in MacConkey plates and liquid culture as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti and Bouveret, 2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the affinity of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup> to itself appears to be greater compared to <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup> and <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB. <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup> appears to have similar affinity to itself and <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, but it is weaker compared to the self-interaction of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB. Thus, the differential affinity between mutant <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB and WT <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB could underlie the observed difference in phenotypes. Next, we analyzed the cell morphology of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains overproducing ΔMAD/ΔMNN mutants. As we have previously shown, overproduction of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB leads to cell size enlargement due to cell division inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>). Using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), we re-confirmed the increase in cell diameter in cells overproducing <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB (1.00 ±0.19 µm) when compared to the EV control (0.90 ±0.13 µm). In agreement with the lethal plate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), cells overproducing <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup> also displayed a statistically significant increase in cell diameter (0.95 ±0.16 µm), while <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup> did not (0.91 ±0.15 µm) and resembled EV control. We also ensured the stable production of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, ΔMAD, and ΔMNN via western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Lastly, by GFP tagging, we observed that both mutants localize to the division site similar to <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eswara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>). In summary, ΔMNN is less functional compared to ΔMAD in terms of causing growth inhibition on plate and cell enlargement phenotype, however both ΔMAD and ΔMNN mutants are able to localize to division sites.</p><p>To further test the functionality of the hinge region mutants, we generated a <italic>Sa gpsB</italic> knockout strain using CRISPR/Cas9-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). As the sole copy, <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic> appears to be less toxic compared to the inducible WT <italic>Sa gpsB,</italic> suggesting that it is partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, the ability of <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup></italic> to impact <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth is severely impaired and resembles the EV control. This observation was consistent with the cell diameter quantification of different strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also ensured the stability of these mutants is unaffected via western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To probe whether these mutants inhibit the native function of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB when in a heteromer, similar to other previously isolated and functionally defective <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB mutants (such as <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔLEE</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>), we co-expressed <italic>Sa gpsB-gfp</italic> and <italic>Sa gpsB</italic>, <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic>, or <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup></italic> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We observed that co-expression of hinge region mutants does not completely abolish the toxicity of <italic>Sa gpsB-gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This result suggests that, although the <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMAD</sup></italic> and <italic>Sa gpsB<sup>ΔMNN</sup></italic> mutants are by themselves nonfunctional in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), they do not drastically inhibit the function of WT GpsB in the heteromer. We hypothesize that the deletion mutants lacking the flexible hinge region may to some degree potentially mimic certain GpsB conformations with varied activities. Thus the new data may indicate that the protomers adopting different conformations within the GpsB complex can function independently of one another, providing a mechanism to fine-tune the function of the whole complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The C-terminus of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ binds to the N-terminal domain of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB through a conserved (S/T/N)-R-X-X-R-(R/K) motif</title><p>One of the few proteins known to interact with <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB is the tubulin-like GTPase, FtsZ - a central cell division protein that marks the division site in nearly all bacteria.

A simultaneous titration against only the <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB N-terminal domain (1–70) demonstrates that the C-terminus of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ binds exclusively to this domain (K<sub>D</sub> = 40.22 ± 1.38 µM). This is further supported by assays with <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ CTV (379–390; K<sub>D</sub> = 73.63 ± 9.43 µM) and the final eight residues of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ (383–390; K<sub>D</sub> 17.76±1.25 µM). The described biophysical affinity aligns with previous cellular studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>), and is consistent with our hypothesis that the impetus for binding is the (S/T/N)-R-X-X-R-(R/K) motif which associates with the PBP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike the previously identified GpsB-binding motifs located at the N-termini of PBPs, this is the first time such a motif has been found at the C-terminus of a GpsB-binding protein. The approximate fourfold difference in affinity between the CTV and the final eight residues could be a result of the inclusion of two Glu residues in the CTV (E381, E382), which may experience repulsion from the negatively charged PBP-binding pocket of GpsB. Notably, the GpsB recognition motif of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ is adjacent to the C-terminus carboxylate, which imparts an additional negative charge.</p><p>To further characterize the interaction between <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ and <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, we conducted a GTPase assay with <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB and <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ or <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ with the C-terminal six residues truncated (<italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ<sup>ΔC6</sup>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that truncation of the terminal six residues of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ would eliminate the GpsB-mediated enhancement of GTPase activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and as reported previously, addition of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB enhanced the GTPase activity of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ. However, this effect was not seen in <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ<sup>ΔC6</sup>, suggesting that the last six C-terminal residues of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ is likely where the interaction with <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB occurs.</p><p>The interaction of the <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB N-terminal domain with the <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ derived peptide (383–390) was also monitored using NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Addition of the octapeptide to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled N-terminal domain results in a significant chemical shift perturbation to a small number of dispersed signals in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum, suggesting that the interaction is highly localized and occurs through the coiled-coil region without disturbing the conformational heterogeneity of the dimer. The available structures of <italic>Bs</italic> GpsB and <italic>Sp</italic> GpsB in complex with PBP-derived peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) suggest the complex is stabilized through interactions with helices 1 and 2, as well as part of the h1-h2 capping loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>). The N-terminal Arg of <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ octapeptide utilized in our experiments is expected to be placed in the PBP-binding pocket near Q43, based on the complex structures of GpsB homologs.

A key factor preventing the formation of this complex were the tight interactions forming at the crystal packing interface. By extending the asymmetric unit, we found each GpsB dimer coordinates two others in a head-to-head arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This involves the insertion of Arg and Lys residues from the membrane-binding loop into the PBP-binding site from the adjacent GpsB protomer, mimicking the binding mode observed between PBP mini-domains and GpsB in orthologous structures, such as <italic>Bs</italic> PBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>). It is unclear whether this head-to-head interaction occurs in the cell or is simply a crystallization artifact. Nonetheless, it is apparent this interaction would need to be disrupted to capture interactions with a binding partner. To do so, we generated an R24A mutant because of its central role in the head-to-head interaction and its distance from the PBP-binding groove. This point mutation successfully disrupted the occluded crystal packing interface and allowed us to determine a 2.40 Å resolution structure of <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4 peptide bound to <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unambiguous electron density for the <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4 C-terminal octapeptide, which adopted an α-helix, was resolved at the PBP-binding groove of GpsB. This structure clearly shows that two of these residues, Arg425 and Arg428, are key components of the <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4<italic>-Sa</italic> GpsB interaction, where they form multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB Ile13, Tyr14, Lys16, and the sidechain hydroxyl of Tyr26. Furthermore, Arg425 and Arg428 form two salt bridges with the carboxyl sidechain of Asp32. Additionally, <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB Asp36 appears to play a major role in stabilizing the PBP4 α-helix by forming two hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen of Arg425 and Leu426, an arrangement that is only possible when these two residues are part of an α-helix. Overall, the complex of <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4/<italic>Sa</italic> GpsB is very similar to <italic>Bs</italic> PBP1/<italic>Bs</italic> GpsB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and is distinguished by the interactions of two Arg residues with the backbone and acidic sidechains lining the PBP-binding groove.

In this study, we initially present the crystal structure of the <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB N-terminal domain (1–70) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The characteristic coiled-coil motif demonstrates conformational flexibility resulting from a three-residue hinge region that is unique to <italic>Staphylococci</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D, and E</xref>).

Furthermore, unlike WT <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, ΔMAD and ΔMNN mutants are not toxic to <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), underscoring the cellular significance of this region.

This recognition motif, which is also present, but in the N-termini of <italic>Lm</italic> PBPA1, <italic>Sp</italic> PBP2a, and <italic>Bs</italic> PBP1, involves the insertion of several Arg residues into the binding groove formed at the coiled-coil interface near the membrane-binding loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our group previously found that <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB interacts with <italic>Sa</italic> FtsZ to regulate its polymerization characteristics, but the repeated (S/T/N)-R-X-X-R-(R/K) GpsB recognition motif on its C-terminus was not recognized until the work on such motifs in PBPs published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleverley et al., 2019</xref>.

Furthermore, this finding is significant not only because it is the sole <italic>S. aureus</italic> PBP that binds to GpsB, but also because <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4 is intimately associated with WTA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atilano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farha et al., 2013</xref>).

To our knowledge, <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4 does not directly interact with any of the known WTA machinery. However, it does require WTA for recruitment to the division septum, and impairment of WTA assembly results in delocalization of <italic>Sa</italic> PBP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atilano et al., 2010</xref>).

Furthermore, while GpsB lacks certain direct interactions with other known divisome proteins, they are indirectly linked through intermediate proteins.

The delineation of the physiological role of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB, identification of its recognition motifs, and characterization of its 3D structure greatly enables modern antibiotic drug-discovery strategies. Furthermore, the involvement of <italic>Sa</italic> GpsB in multiple essential processes presents the opportunity to design targeted antibiotics. There is a growing need for narrow-spectrum antibiotics, especially for common infections, such as those caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melander et al., 2018</xref>). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics avoid selective pressure of commensal bacteria which can serve as a reservoir for resistance elements. In the same vein, their limited disruptive properties can avoid pathologies associated with bacterial dysbiosis, like <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection. The results from this study provide new information for both understanding the role of GpsB in <italic>S. aureus</italic> division and probing new avenues for narrow-spectrum antibiotic development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant protein cloning and purification</title><p>The nucleotide sequence of <italic>Sa gpsB</italic> corresponding to the N-terminal domain (1–70) and full length (1–114) was inserted into a modified pET28a vector with a His-TEV sequence 5’ to the multiple cloning site (MCS).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tobias Doerr (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers identified that the study of S. aurues GpsB and its interactions with FtsZ and PBP4 is important for understanding the essential role of GpsB in the cell division of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, the structure of GpsB and PBPs has been reported before in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, and the functional characterization of GpsB's new motif and the structural characterization of GpsB and FtsZ's interaction is incomplete. The manuscript requires extensive revisions to address two essential points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>1) Please address the functionality of the 3-aa insertion/kinked structure motif in <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB by providing new experiments as requested by Reviewer #1, points 1 and 2, and Reviewer #3, point 1 (first paragraph of recommendations to authors).</p><p>2) Please provide a structural characterization of GpsB in complex with the C-terminus of FtsZ. If a co-structure is not possible, please provide justifications and/or a discussion on a predicated model using Alphafold2/RosettaFold.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The crystal structure revealed similarities and differences between Sa GpsB and GpsB from other species. Sa GpsB contained a hinge in the helix that results in bending of the protomer. This feature was not observed in other species. The authors provided strong evidence showing that the hinge was not a crystallization artifact but a novel motif through stability measurements, NMR, and MD simulations (Figures 1 and 2). The authors further tested the effects of deletion of two 3-residue insertions uniquely present in Sa GpsB (∆MAD and ∆MNN) using the lethality of Sa GpsB overexpression in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Figure 2). While these experiments are important, the overexpression of ∆MAD or ∆MNN in <italic>S. aureus</italic> appeared to have a modest effect (Figure S4), thus it may be difficult to argue that the hinge is important for Sa GpsB function. The authors hypothesized that this modest effect is due to the differential affinity of ∆MNN to itself than Sa GpsB, but it is unclear how it would explain the modest effect. Furthermore, these mutational investigations may be better/easier to interpret if mutants are expressed in wt gpsB depletion background.</p><p>2. To complement these experiments, perhaps the authors could insert MAD or MNN into Bs GpsB and monitor the mutants' thermostability, localization, and lethality in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> subsequently. Additionally, overexpressed WT Sa-GpsB mislocalized in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and was lethal, while overexpressed ∆MAD and ∆MNN localized to the mid cell and cells were normal. Do these results indicate that the lethality of SaGpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is a nonspecific protein aggregation effect and that the two regions are responsible for the aggregation? What protein-protein interactions contribute to the mid-cell localization of SaGpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>? If the toxicity of Sa GpsB in Bs is caused by the hinge structure one would expect mutating the Bs GpsB to include it would also have a similar toxic effect.</p><p>3. The discovery that the CTV of Sa FtsZ has a repeat match of the consensus GpsB binding motif is interesting. The binding affinities at ~ 20 to 70 μM, however, do not appear to be strong. The authors suggested that cellular affinities may be higher and a regulatory point. Could the authors provide a negative control using Sa FtsZ∆6, or a peptide from another species that does not have the motif to rule out sequence-independent binding? These controls may be important because the FtsZ (320-390) terminus includes the two negatively charged E but binds tighter than FtsZ (379-390), which also contains the two E residues. Additionally, if we assume that the crystallographic work between the FtsZ terminus with Sa GpasB is not successful, can a structure be deduced from the NMR study?</p><p>4. As the FtsZ CTV's binding motif is similar to that of PBP4, do they compete with each other, or can they both bind to two monomers of GpsB simultaneously? How important is this binding? The authors reported that ∆MAD has lost the binding to PBP4 and FtsZ CTV, but it is hard to imagine how the structure that is different from the binding site causes a significant reduction in binding. To demonstrate the importance of binding, the authors may wish to design some mutations at the binding surface and exam the consequences in cell physiology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I appreciate the efforts in providing a solid base for the characterization of the interactions between GspB and FtsZ or PBP4; I consider the novelty is not enough to publish in <italic>eLife</italic> considering the previously published works.</p><p>– Results. When describing the 3D structure of the GspB N-term domain; Did authors run AlphaFold2 (AF2) to see the prediction of the hexameric full-length structure? Is this configuration compatible with interaction with other partners? How the discovered hinge could affect the oligomeric arrangement of the full-length protein? How these results could compare with GspB from other bacterial species for which this region has been also solved?</p><p>– Results. Line 201. Also, as there is no 3D structure for the complex between the N-term domain of GspB and the C-term domain of FtsZ, AF2 prediction could be important to identify if the same pattern of interactions observed for PBP4 are observed here, and maybe to identify key residues in this interaction. Mutagenesis experiments could then validate this interaction.</p><p>– Results. When describing the interactions between GspB and PBP4, authors should directly compare with previous interactions observed for GspB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Cleverley et al. Nat Comms 2019). Now, this information is only partially presented when comparing crystal packing in <italic>S. aureus</italic> GspB with the complex GspB:PBP1a in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>Two Arg residues seem to be critical in the interaction with PBPs, is this interaction lost if you mutated both of them?</p><p>– Figure 5. Please indicate how this model was generated. Is this just an artistic representation of the partners? is based on previous structures? or on predictions by AF2?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a nice study overall, and very well-written and well-organized. My main issue is with the overexpression experiments. Overexpression toxicity of divisome components can be highly pleiotropic and is difficult to interpret. I don't follow the conclusion that the insertion sequence is important for function since an assessment of functionality is only based on overexpression toxicity. Can you replace native GpsB with the ∆MAD and ∆MNN mutants? This would be the ultimate test of functionality. If not possible, you could conduct depletion experiments of the wild-type copy in a background expressing the mutants.</p><p>It is unclear to me why the ∆MAD/MNN mutants are less toxic than the WT (see my minor comment below as well). I don't find the bacterial two-hybrid data very convincing. BACTH is not necessarily quantitative, so more precise experiments (ELISA?) would be necessary to conclude something about the affinity of heterocomplexes. Since the exact mechanism of toxicity is not important for their conclusions, maybe tread a little more lightly here. The statement in line 185 is a bit too strong.</p><p>Figure 3C needs a negative control. Not knowing if a value of ~1.5 in their GTPase assay is significantly above the background, it is possible that the ∆C6 mutant is simply catalytically dead, and thus cannot be activated by GpsB. A GTPase point mutant in FtsZ would be a great control here to establish whether FtsZ without GpsB has activity significantly above background, and would consequently demonstrate that the ∆C6 mutant is specifically deficient in GpsB-mediated activation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and PBP4 bind to the conformationally dynamic N-terminal domain of GpsB&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Bavesh Kana (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please add discussions regarding the putative arrangement between FtsZ and GpsB in Figure 5, either by Alpah-fold2 predication as Rev #2 suggested, or textual justifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have partially responded to my previous review.</p><p>It seems that more detailed information on the C-term FstZ and GpsB interaction is ongoing for future work.</p><p>The predicted model by AF multimer of the N-term GpsB dimer and the C-term of FtsZ is straightforward to do, and this model could reinforce, at this moment, the experimental results provided in the manuscript. If the AF multimer fails, thus it can be just mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>Other potential implications of this in silico experiment, could be to know if the GpsB dimer interacts with one or two FtsZ chains.</p><p>Also, as a proof of concept, the same AF multimer run can be done with PBP4 and GspB to see if a more extended picture of the PBP4-GspB complex can be reached.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately responded to the first round of reviews. I still believe that an FtsZ GTPase mutant would be the better control for the biochemical assay showing stimulation of GTPase activity by GpsB, but BSA is adequate.</p><p>I also still believe that a true examination of the functional importance of the hinge domain residues would require replacement of the native GpsB with these variants, followed by phenotypic characterization (though my understanding is that ∆gpsB phenotypes are subtile, but measurable nonetheless via e.g. morphology). The current reliance on overexpression toxicity (which was pointed out during the first round of reviews) makes interpretation of these data more difficult. That said, using a gpsB mutant for overexpression experiments is certainly an improvement over the first version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85579.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Inspired by the new reports, within the past few months, that showed <italic>gpsB</italic> can be deleted (PMID: 37711690 | bioRxiv: 538170; 545294), we generated our own <italic>gpsB</italic> knockout using CRISPR-Cas9 approach in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (PMID: 28218837). Using this del-<italic>gpsB</italic> strain, we now show that ∆MAD and ∆MNN variants of GpsB are partially and less functional respectively (Figure 2 Supplement 2A). Thus, we believe that the hinge region is important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB function by dynamically controlling GpsB activity and/or possibly enabling interactions with other partners.</p><p>Previously we showed that the toxic effect of GpsB is suppressed by co-expression of non-functional <italic>gpsB</italic> alleles in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Hammond et al., Microbiology Spectrum 2022; Figure S2A). As shown in Figure 2 Supplement 2D in this revised manuscript, co-expression of ∆MAD or ∆MNN does not fully inhibit the function of unmutated GpsB (although individually they are not toxic; Figure 2C). This implies that the flexibility provided by the hinge region allows for additional control of GpsB function within the GpsB complex (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

What protein-protein interactions contribute to the mid-cell localization of SaGpsB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>? If the toxicity of Sa GpsB in Bs is caused by the hinge structure one would expect mutating the Bs GpsB to include it would also have a similar toxic effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this idea. We previously conducted a suppressor screen to identify the source of toxicity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Hammond et al., Microbiology Spectrum 2022). We reported that inhibition of wall teichoic acids pathway relieves the toxicity. We are also exploring possible interactions between Sa GpsB and Bs FtsZ in light of the new data from this manuscript. At lower inducer concentration, Sa GpsB localizes to mid-cell (Eswara et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018; Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Therefore, we do not think non-specific aggregation is the cause of toxicity. Multiple other factors are different between Bs GpsB and Sa GpsB besides MAD/MNN such as linker length and potential affinity to FtsZ. Thus, we did not test whether MAD/MNN insertion in Bs GpsB renders it toxic, as it is physiologically not relevant, and a negative result would not be informative due to the presence of other differences between Bs GpsB and Sa GpsB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The discovery that the CTV of Sa FtsZ has a repeat match of the consensus GpsB binding motif is interesting. The binding affinities at ~ 20 to 70 μM, however, do not appear to be strong. The authors suggested that cellular affinities may be higher and a regulatory point. Could the authors provide a negative control using Sa FtsZ∆6, or a peptide from another species that does not have the motif to rule out sequence-independent binding? These controls may be important because the FtsZ (320-390) terminus includes the two negatively charged E but binds tighter than FtsZ (379-390), which also contains the two E residues. Additionally, if we assume that the crystallographic work between the FtsZ terminus with Sa GpasB is not successful, can a structure be deduced from the NMR study?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4 and the main text, we discussed the testing of N-terminal minidomain peptides of Sa PBP1, PBP2, PBP2A (MRSA), and PBP3 –which lack this motif. These sequences are shown in Figure 4a. We found there was no dose dependent saturation, suggesting no sequence independent binding occurs. Furthermore, the GTPase assay (Figure 3C) comparing Sa FtsZ with Sa FtsZ∆6, supports the notion that these terminal six residues are critical for function. Although complex structure characterization using the current FtsZ peptides (residues 379-390, 383-390) has been unsuccessful, we have been actively testing crystallization using shorter peptides corresponding to each binding motif. Ultimately we feel a complex crystal structure will be possible and provide more information than NMR analysis. The data from the current NMR study is also not enough for deriving any detailed structural information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As the FtsZ CTV's binding motif is similar to that of PBP4, do they compete with each other, or can they both bind to two monomers of GpsB simultaneously? How important is this binding? The authors reported that ∆MAD has lost the binding to PBP4 and FtsZ CTV, but it is hard to imagine how the structure that is different from the binding site causes a significant reduction in binding. To demonstrate the importance of binding, the authors may wish to design some mutations at the binding surface and exam the consequences in cell physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>As speculated in our model (Figure 5), we believe the GpsB complex would be able to bind FtsZ and PBP4 simultaneously, each by a different GpsB protomer and with similar K<sub>D</sub> values determined by SPR. As shown by Supplementary File 2, ∆MAD affected GpsB binding by different FtsZ/PBP4 peptides slightly differently, ranging from ~2 to &gt;4 fold. Due to the limitations of our SPR analysis, two K<sub>D</sub> values were shown as &gt;200 µM, but these values may reflect only a 3-4 fold decrease of the binding affinity. These data suggest that the ∆MAD retained binding of the partner peptides but with weaker affinities, probably due to unfavorable interactions occurring outside the binding pocket for the GpsB recognition motif as a result of the altered tertiary structure in the mutant. We agree that it will be informative to investigate how the interactions involving the GpsB recognition motif may affect GpsB function, as shown by the data concerning Sa FtsZ∆6. The overall importance of similar interactions was demonstrated by previous mutagenesis studies of GpsB from other species (PMID: 30651563). We intend to perform more comprehensive analysis of these interactions in <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While I appreciate the efforts in providing a solid base for the characterization of the interactions between GspB and FtsZ or PBP4; I consider the novelty is not enough to publish in eLife considering the previously published works.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to point out that the innovation and significance of our results goes beyond simply the structural basis of GpsB protein-protein interactions. The conformational heterogeneity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB is not observed in any of the other previously determined homolog structures, and this information will be important for our understanding of its unique role in <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth compared with the less critical functions of the homologs in other bacteria. The location of the GpsB-recognition motif in <italic>S. aureus</italic> proteins (i.e., C-terminus) is also different from all the previous examples (N-terminus), and our results suggest alternative binding patterns that will need to be analyzed in future studies. Finally, considering the importance of FtsZ in cell division, the identification of the specific FtsZ sequence bound by GpsB can lead to new experiments on how the Z-ring is formed and regulated in coordination with other cellular processes. Also, GpsB-FtsZ interaction has not been reported in other organisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results. When describing the 3D structure of the GspB N-term domain; Did authors run AlphaFold2 (AF2) to see the prediction of the hexameric full-length structure?

However, the program failed to predict the kink we observed in our experimental structures. We do not think the hinge region will affect the oligomeric arrangement of the full-length protein because the two GpsB domains are connected by a flexible linker region and thus likely function independently of one another. Our experiments have shown that the dimer of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB N-terminal domain is able to interact with multiple proteins, so the hinge region does not appear to hinder GpsB protein-protein interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results. Line 201. Also, as there is no 3D structure for the complex between the N-term domain of GspB and the C-term domain of FtsZ, AF2 prediction could be important to identify if the same pattern of interactions observed for PBP4 are observed here, and maybe to identify key residues in this interaction. Mutagenesis experiments could then validate this interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be important to understand the molecular basis for the GpsB-FtsZ interactions. As described in the main text, the GpsB-binding sequence in FtsZ appears unique as it has two similar copies of the canonical recognition motif. We do plan to carry out an in-depth investigation, including mutagenesis, biochemical and structural studies, into a number of questions concerning FtsZ binding, such as how both recognition motifs may contribute to GpsB binding, whether the C-terminal carboxylate group plays a role in binding, and whether the C-terminus of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> FtsZ binds to GpsB as well. Due to the focus of the current manuscript and the amount of analysis to be performed, we feel these questions can be better addressed in a follow-up paper. However, we have added discussion in the current paper to briefly address the need for such future experiments. Also, as demonstrated by our preliminary analysis, AF2 could not capture important structural details unique to <italic>S. aureus</italic> GpsB. It is also not particularly suitable for protein-protein docking. Therefore we did not use AF2 to generate a model, although we feel that some important contacts, such as those involving the arginines, may be retained in FtsZ-GpsB interactions, based on the GpsB complex structures by us and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results. When describing the interactions between GspB and PBP4, authors should directly compare with previous interactions observed for GspB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Cleverley et al.

Now, this information is only partially presented when comparing crystal packing in <italic>S. aureus</italic> GspB with the complex GspB:PBP1a in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><p>Two Arg residues seem to be critical in the interaction with PBPs, is this interaction lost if you mutated both of them?</p></disp-quote><p>Both arginine residues form multiple interactions with GpsB in the superimposed structures of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> complexes in Figure 4B, although the first arginine is placed deeper into the binding pocket and may thus be more critical for GpsB binding. Based on the structural data and the conserved nature of these two residues in the GpsB-binding sequences, we agree that these arginine residues would make important contributions to GpsB binding and the interactions would be nearly abolished if both are mutated. The amount of new information generated by mutating these two residues will be relatively limited. But as we mentioned above, we plan to carry out a detailed mutagenesis analysis of the whole CTV region of FtsZ in the future, which will address these questions as well as those involving the two copies of GpsB-binding motif.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5.

My main issue is with the overexpression experiments. Overexpression toxicity of divisome components can be highly pleiotropic and is difficult to interpret. I don't follow the conclusion that the insertion sequence is important for function since an assessment of functionality is only based on overexpression toxicity. Can you replace native GpsB with the ∆MAD and ∆MNN mutants? This would be the ultimate test of functionality. If not possible, you could conduct depletion experiments of the wild-type copy in a background expressing the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank this reviewer for their kind words. Please see our response to comment #1 of reviewer #1. Briefly, we used a del-gpsB strain to study the functionality of GpsB hinge mutants. Our results show that ∆MAD and ∆MNN variants are partially and less functional respectively (Figure 2 Supplement 2A). We believe that the hinge region may result in different GpsB conformers with various activities to dynamically finetune GpsB function, and/or allow for interaction with other partners.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me why the ∆MAD/MNN mutants are less toxic than the WT (see my minor comment below as well). I don't find the bacterial two-hybrid data very convincing. BACTH is not necessarily quantitative, so more precise experiments (ELISA?) would be necessary to conclude something about the affinity of heterocomplexes. Since the exact mechanism of toxicity is not important for their conclusions, maybe tread a little more lightly here. The statement in line 185 is a bit too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 2 Supplement 2A, ∆MAD and ∆MNN are less toxic. We previously showed that the toxic effect of GpsB is suppressed by co-expression of non-functional <italic>gpsB</italic> alleles in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (Hammond et al., Microbiology Spectrum 2022; Figure S2A). In Figure 2 Supplement 2D we show that co-expression of ∆MAD or ∆MNN does not fully inhibit the function of unmutated GpsB (although individually they are not toxic; Figure 2C). This implies that the flexibility provided by the hinge region may allow for additional control of GpsB function within the GpsB complex (Figure 1D). We have now moderated our interpretation of our BACTH results as per your suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C needs a negative control. Not knowing if a value of ~1.5 in their GTPase assay is significantly above the background, it is possible that the ∆C6 mutant is simply catalytically dead, and thus cannot be activated by GpsB. A GTPase point mutant in FtsZ would be a great control here to establish whether FtsZ without GpsB has activity significantly above background, and would consequently demonstrate that the ∆C6 mutant is specifically deficient in GpsB-mediated activation.</p></disp-quote><p>As FtsZ and FtsZ∆C6 both show similar GTPase activity we do not think ∆C6 is catalytically dead.
