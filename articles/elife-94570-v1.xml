Here, deletion of the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from forebrain neurons or arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in failure to maintain normal lactation-induced suppression of estrous cycles. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity and pulsatile LH secretion were increased in these mice, even in the presence of ongoing suckling stimulation and lactation. GCaMP fibre photometry of arcuate kisspeptin neurons revealed that the normal episodic activity of these neurons is rapidly suppressed in pregnancy and this was maintained throughout early lactation. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate kisspeptin neurons resulted in early reactivation of episodic activity of kisspeptin neurons prior to a premature return of reproductive cycles in early lactation. These observations show dynamic variation in arcuate kisspeptin neuronal activity associated with the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation, and provide direct evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary for suppressing fertility during lactation in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroendocrinology</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>prolactin</kwd><kwd>lactation</kwd><kwd>infertility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21-560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grattan</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lactational infertility in mice is dependent on prolactin action in kisspeptin neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, lactation is accompanied by a period of infertility. This adaptive change establishes appropriate birth spacing to enable maternal metabolic resources to be directed towards caring for the newborn offspring, rather than supporting another pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Short, 1976</xref>). Lactational infertility is characterised by a lactation-induced suppression of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, and the temporary loss of the reproductive cycle (in rodents this is exhibited as an extended period of diestrus or anestrus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNeilly et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox and Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNeilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsukamura and Maeda, 2001</xref>). Lactation is also characterised by chronically elevated levels of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin, which is essential for milk production and promotes adaptive changes in maternal physiology and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Short, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNeilly et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNeilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsukamura and Maeda, 2001</xref>). Despite hyperprolactinaemia being a well-recognised cause of infertility, the specific role that prolactin plays in lactational infertility, as distinct from other suckling- or metabolic-related cues, is currently unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNeilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNeilly, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Recent in vivo studies have confirmed that kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are responsible for the periodic release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequent pulsatile LH secretion that drives reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2023</xref>). Studies using GCaMP fibre photometry in conscious mice have demonstrated that the arcuate kisspeptin neuronal population exhibits episodes of increased intracellular calcium levels coincident with, and immediately preceding, each pulse of LH secretion in intact and gonadectomised male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). Miniscope investigations showed that individual kisspeptin neurons within the arcuate population act in a coordinated, synchronised, and episodic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2023</xref>). Loss of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation and consequent lactational infertility may be caused by the loss of kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of GnRH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ladyman and Woodside, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">True et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Kisspeptin expression is markedly suppressed in lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">True et al., 2011</xref>) and even when exogenously stimulated, kisspeptin neurons are unable to activate GnRH neurons during lactation, likely due to a lack of kisspeptin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that hyperprolactinemia causes infertility, and thus, the elevated prolactin present in lactation seems a likely candidate to be involved in suppressing fertility during lactation. Prolactin administration acutely suppresses LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2019</xref>), and chronic exposure to elevated prolactin reduces <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo-Lopes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sonigo et al., 2012</xref>). In lactating mice, suppressing endogenous prolactin secretion shortens the period of infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackwell et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that prolactin is important for maintaining the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion during lactation. Such a role for prolactin is controversial, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNeilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNeilly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNeilly, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sugimoto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DÃ­az et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">ÃrdÃ¶g et al., 1998</xref>), with studies in a number of species suggesting that the neural stimulation of suckling may be more important than prolactin in maintaining lactational infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith, 1978</xref>). However, it has previously been difficult to disentangle the specific role of prolactin, as suckling, prolactin, and milk production are so tightly linked that manipulating one ultimately impacts the others, making it difficult to determine the contribution of any one element. Here, using a conditional deletion strategy, we have blocked prolactin action in the brain leaving suckling, lactation, and maternal behaviour intact. Using GCaMP fibre photometry techniques, we have also documented arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity across pregnancy and lactation transitions in the same mice and established that prolactin directly acts on these neurons to suppress fertility in lactation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolactin action on forebrain neurons is necessary to maintain lactational infertility</title><p>Lactation has previously been associated with a marked decrease in <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA levels in both rostral periventricular regions of the third ventricle (RP3V) and arcuate nucleus populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).

Deleting Prlr specifically from arcuate kisspeptin neurons (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) prevented the suppression of activity in early lactation, resulting in premature induction of episodic activation of kisspeptin neurons, and early onset of estrus. Combined, these data provide direct evidence that prolactin action on kisspeptin neurons is necessary for lactation-induced infertility in mice.</p><p>It is now well established that arcuate kisspeptin neurons form the GnRH âpulse generator,â and hence drive the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and consequent pulsatile secretion of LH from the pituitary that is required for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Roux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seminara et al., 2003</xref>). This is the first study to monitor the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons across different reproductive states in the same animal, and the data largely match previously described patterns of LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNeilly, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morishige et al., 1973</xref>). The frequency and dynamics of the SEs changed dramatically, initially due to the pregnancy-induced changes in ovarian hormones. The abrupt decrease in arcuate kisspeptin activity in early pregnancy is likely caused by rising levels of progesterone, known to profoundly suppress the activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons and LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodman and Karsch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skinner et al., 1998</xref>). Progesterone is elevated throughout pregnancy, gradually increasing until luteolysis and progesterone withdrawal occur in the lead-up to parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Virgo and Bellward, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pointis et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bridges, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugimoto et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a transient reactivation of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons in the night between days 18 and 19 of pregnancy. This was characterised by frequent, low amplitude SEs, and increased baseline activity that may represent the intermittent synchronised activity of small subsets of arcuate kisspeptin neurons that have not yet transitioned to full synchronisation of the whole population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2023</xref>). It seems likely that this pattern of activity is associated with progesterone withdrawal in late pregnancy and may be important in stimulating follicular growth leading up to a postpartum ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thapa et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zakar and Hertelendy, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In early lactation, the episodic activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons was absent, with sporadic low-amplitude activity returning around day 14 of lactation. There was another period of increased baseline activity in late lactation, similar to that seen in late pregnancy, potentially representing a signature of reactivation of synchronised activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons. This increase in arcuate kisspeptin population activity during late lactation mirrors the increase in LH levels that has been reported as lactation progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rolland et al., 1975</xref>). Overall patterns of SE activity rapidly returned to normal diestrus levels soon after weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rolland et al., 1975</xref>). However, in the absence of Prlr in arcuate kisspeptin neurons, SE activity reappeared as early as day 5 of lactation, even in the presence of ongoing suckling. These data clearly show that prolactin action in arcuate kisspeptin neurons is necessary to sustain lactational infertility in mice. The observed disruption of lactational infertility in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice is particularly remarkable given that Prlr deletion is restricted to arcuate kisspeptin neurons in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2019</xref>), and prolactin action on RP3V kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sonigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kokay et al., 2011</xref>) and on gonadotrophs in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tortonese et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henderson et al., 2008</xref>) are unaffected.</p><p>The indispensable role of prolactin in mediating lactation-induced infertility in the mouse is surprising, given the consensus of much work in other species concluding that other factors may be more important (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNeilly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNeilly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DÃ­az et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodside and Jans, 1995</xref>). This may reflect a level of redundancy amongst contributing factors across all species, including ovarian hormones, metabolic cues, and neural inputs of suckling. Notably, the conditional deletion approach described here distinguishes prolactin action from the neurogenic effects of suckling without altering the process of lactation itself. Moreover, this approach avoids the potential confounding effects of using dopamine agonists to suppress prolactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maeda et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith, 1978</xref>), given that dopamine can directly inhibit GnRH neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Herbison, 2013</xref>).</p><p>While the effects of widespread neuronal deletion (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) on fertility were largely recapitulated by the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>), it was apparent that the global deletion was more effective at inducing the return to estrus during lactation (in 100% of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice by day 10), compared to the arcuate kisspeptin-specific model (63% by day 10, and 83% by day 19). This may be due to the absence of lactation-induced suppression of <italic>Kiss1</italic> expression in RP3V kisspeptin neurons of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice. Similarly, we cannot rule out the possibility that other populations of prolactin-sensitive neurons, such as GABA or dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kokay et al., 2011</xref>), may contribute to suppressing estrous cycles during lactation.</p><p>Nevertheless, our data collectively provide strong evidence that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons is the primary factor mediating lactation-induced infertility in mice. Given that hyperprolactinemia induces infertility in many other mammalian species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sonigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackwell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koike et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patel and Bamigboye, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen-Becker et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarkar and Yen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park and Selmanoff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grattan et al., 2007</xref>), it is possible that a conserved mechanism could be contributing to lactational infertility in these species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed using adult female mice on a C57BL/6 J background (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>; 8â20 wk of age unless otherwise stated).

Briefly, the fluorescent signal obtained after stimulation with 405 nm light was used to correct for movement artefacts as follows: first, the 405 nm signal was filtered using a savitzky-golay filter and fitted to the 490 nm signal using least linear square regression. The fitted 405 nm signal was then subtracted and divided from the 490 nm signal to obtain the movement and bleaching corrected signal. The output of these templates is 490-adjusted405/adjusted405, which was multiplied to get the final ÎF/F as a percentage increase. All photometry data is reported as ÎF/F(%).</p><p>All recordings were obtained from freely behaving mice between 0800 hr and 1200 hr (apart from 24 hr post-weaning recording (0900 hr to 1700 hr), and day 18/19 pregnancy recording (1800 hr to 0800 hr the following day)). SEs were defined as when ÎF/F exceeds 3 standard deviations (SD) above the trace mean. Manual SE shape analysis was performed in addition to the standard deviation method for certain datasets where necessary. SEs were counted manually to determine the frequency of SEs per 60 min. The between-animal variability in total signal means that changes in SE amplitude can only be reported as relative changes within an animal. Relative SE amplitude was calculated by using normalised ÎF/F data and then subtracting the peak of an SE from the nearest nadir to the rise of the SE and averaging that for the number of SEs in a recording. To obtain normalised ÎF/F, three pre-pregnancy datasets from each mouse were used to find the average maximum ÎF/F for that mouse. All datasets were then divided by that normalisation value to get normalised ÎF/F for each trace for each individual mouse. In these long-term longitudinal studies, some data points are missing due to issues with recordings (e.g. dirty fibre optic cannula or system battery issues), meaning that occasionally fewer mice are used for analysis at various time points. During experimentation, no mice lost cannulas, but a gradual reduction in the amplitude of the signal was observed over time.</p><p>Following experimentation, brains were collected in a similar way to that described above. Postmortem analysis of cannula placement and GCaMP6 transfection in each animal were not done, because, with experience, the quality and characteristics of the SE recordings (including corresponding pulsatile LH secretion) in each animal was indicative of successful cannula placement and transfection of the GCaMP. In a preliminary the trial the green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached to the GCAMP was restricted to the caudal arcuate nucleus (n=3 mice, preliminary trial), with little evidence of spread into the rostral or middle arcuate. GFP was seen exclusively ipsilaterally, with no GFP observed on the contralateral side. Cannula placement in these trial animals was in the caudal arcuate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Monitoring the activity of arcuate kisspeptin neurons across different reproductive stages in the same mice</title><p>Adult <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice were 8â10 wk of age at the beginning of experiments, and up to 12 months old by the time of final recording (n=8 during pregnancy; n=6 during lactation, two mice were euthanised due to dystocia). Monitoring of vaginal cytology and weight was continuous from 1 wk pre-surgery till day 19 of pregnancy and resumed on day 3 of lactation until the end of the experiment. All handling stopped on day 19 of pregnancy to avoid potential compromise of parturition and onset of maternal behaviour.</p><p>To investigate the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population across different reproductive states in the same animal, the following recording protocol was followed for all <italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice, unless otherwise stated; diestrus NL, day 4 of pregnancy, day 14 of pregnancy, day 18/19 of pregnancy (overnight), day 7 of lactation, day 14 of lactation, day 18 of lactation, 24 hr after weaning, first diestrus after estrous cycles begin following weaning, and 10 d post-OVX. In addition, blood sample collection for paired LH measurement was done in diestrus NL state, on day 14 of pregnancy (in four mice, a maximum of six samples were collected around small âpeaksâ in baseline), day 7 of lactation, and day 14 of lactation. During sampling, blood samples were taken at the usual 6- min intervals previously described, however, if a SE was observed and the next scheduled sampling was more than 3 min away, an extra blood sample was taken 2 min after the SE. Following this additional sampling, the next scheduled blood sample would be taken at its original time and then every 6 min after, till another SE was seen. Blood sampling was not carried out at additional time points as blood sampling was undertaken at least a week apart, and stress from repeated sampling was attempted to be kept at a minimum e.g., not blood sampling around the time of birth. Fibre photometry recordings were usually between 2â4 hr in length. The only longer recordings were undertaken on day 18/19 of pregnancy (14 hr) and 24 hr after weaning (8 hr). These particular recording sessions were extended to determine whether there were any longer-term changes occurring in the activity of the arcuate kisspeptin population in the lead-up to parturition or following weaning of pups (states closely followed by postpartum estrus and resumption of normal estrous cycles, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Effect of arcuate kisspeptin neuron-specific deletion of the prolactin receptor gene on the maintenance of lactational infertility and the activity of kisspeptin neurons during lactation</title><p>Kisspeptin-specific prolactin-receptor knockout mice (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>) and their respective Cre-negative controls (<italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>) were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (n=27) and <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> control (n=30) dams underwent estrous cycle monitoring from day 3 of lactation onwards to determine whether mice showed an early resumption of estrous cycles.

Recordings were undertaken in a similar timeline to that described above, however, no pregnancy recordings were done, and in early lactation recordings were performed every 2 d from day 3 to day 9 of lactation, before following the same protocol as described.

Individual symbols in graphs represent individual mice. Differences in kisspeptin cell number or fibre density were assessed using two-way ANOVAs with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons tests or t-tests, with both analyses using combined averages of each animal (averaged number of cells or fibre density across the three subdivisions of each nucleus to get the total number reported). Resumption of estrous cycles was analysed using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test chi-squared test. LH pulse frequency data and mean LH data were analysed using two-way ANOVAs with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons tests. SE frequency and amplitude throughout reproductive cycles were analysed using mixed effect analysis (fixed type III) with Tukeyâs multiple comparisons tests where appropriate and day 18/19 of pregnancy data were analysed using t-tests. Correlation between SE occurrence and LH pulses was assessed using the chi-squared test. All fibre photometry data used for quantitative analysis and comparison were from the first pregnancy and lactation.

The data show an immediate suppression of activity of arc Kiss1 neuronal activity during pregnancy that is maintained during lactation. In the absence of any apparent change in suckling stimulus or milk production, mice lacking prolactin receptors in arcuate Kiss1 neurons regained Kiss1 episodic activity and estrous cyclicity faster than control mice, demonstrating that direct prolactin action on Kiss1 neurons is at least partially responsible for suppressing fertility in this species. The effect of loss of prolactin receptors from CamK2a expressing neurons was even greater, indicating either that prolactin sensitivity in Kiss1 neurons of the RP3V contributes to lactational infertility or that other prolactin-sensitive neurons are involved. These data demonstrate the important role of prolactin in suppressing Kiss1 neuron activity and thereby fertility during the lactational period in the mouse.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is the first study to monitor activity of the GnRH pulse-generating system across different reproductive states in the same animal. Another strength in the study design is that it isolated the effects of prolactin by maintaining normal lactation and suckling (assessed indirectly using pup growth curves). The study also offers insight into the phenomenon of postpartum ovulation in mice. The results showed a brief reactivation of arcuate Kiss1 activity immediately prior to parturition, attributed to falling progesterone levels at the end of pregnancy. This hypothesis will be of interest to the field and is likely to inspire testing in future studies. With the exceptions mentioned below, the conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data and the aims of the study were achieved. This paper is likely to raise the standard for technical expectations in the field and spark new interest in the direct impact of prolactin on Kiss1 neurons during lactation in other species.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A weakness in the approach is the use of genetic models that do not offer complete deletion of the prolactin receptor from targeted neuronal populations. A substantial proportion of Kiss1 neurons in both models retains the receptor. As a result, it is not clear whether the partial maintenance of cyclicity during lactation in the genetic models is due to incomplete deletion or to the involvement of other factors. In addition, results showing no impact of progesterone on LH secretion during lactation are surprising, given the effectiveness of progesterone-containing birth control in lactating women. While the authors assert their findings may reflect an important role for prolactin in lactational infertility in other mammalian species, that remains to be seen. Hyperprolactinemia is known to suppress GnRH release, but its importance in the suppression of cyclicity during the lactation is controversial. Indeed, in several species, the stimulus of suckling is considered to be the main driver of lactational fertility suppression. Data from rats shows that exogenous prolactin was unable to suppress LH release in dams deprived of their pups shortly after birth; both suckling and prolactin were necessary to suppress a post-ovariectomy rise in LH levels. The duration of amenorrhea does not correlate with average prolactin levels in humans, and suckling but not prolactin was required to suppress the postpartum rise in LH in the rhesus monkey. The protocol of this or other studies might result in discordant results; alternatively, mice may be an outlier in their mechanism of cycle suppression.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>I remain enthusiastic about this article, which has been substantially improved in this revision. However, I didn't feel the authors responded to any of the points I raised previously in my public review (see Weaknesses), for example by adding to the manuscript's discussion section. These are the larger, conceptual issues that speak to the value of the paper in the context of the existing literature. The authors could also state they feel they have addressed the issues raised sufficiently in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94570.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The overall goal of Eleni et al. is to determine if the suppression of LH pulses during lactation is mediated by prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons. To address this, the authors used GCaMP fiber photometry and serial blood sampling to reveal that in vivo episodic arcuate kisspeptin neuron activity and LH pulses are suppressed throughout pregnancy and lactation. The authors further utilized knockout models to demonstrate that the loss of prolactin receptor signaling at kisspeptin cells prevents the suppression of kisspeptin cell activity and results in the early reestablishment of fertility during lactation. The work demonstrates exemplary design and technique, and the outcomes of these experiments are sophistically discussed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript demonstrates exceptional skill with powerful techniques and reveals a key role for arcuate kisspeptin neurons in maintaining lactation-induced infertility in mice. In a difficult feat, the authors used fiber photometry to map the activity of arcuate kisspeptin cells into lactation and weaning without disrupting parturition, lactation, or maternal behavior. The authors used a knockout approach to identify if the inhibition of fertility by prolactin is mediated via direct signaling at arcuate kisspeptin cells. Although the model does not perfectly eliminate prolactin receptor expression in all kisspeptin neurons, results from the achieved knockdown support the conclusion that prolactin signaling at kisspeptin neurons is required to maintain lactational infertility. The methods are advanced and appropriate for the aims, the study is rigorously conducted, and the conclusions are thoughtfully discussed.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>All comments and suggestions have been addressed by the authors in this revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94570.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hackwell</surname><given-names>Eleni CR</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ladyman</surname><given-names>Sharon R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Clarkson</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McQullian</surname><given-names>H James</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boehm</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Saarland University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Homburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Rosemary SE</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grattan</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I recommend being explicit regarding how the animals were habituated to blood sampling.</p></disp-quote><p>On lines 109-111 we have added a more detailed explanation of how mice were habituated to blood sampling.

Therefore, no further analysis was done. This question would need to be examined with a follow up experiment. Given the 5s on, 15 s off scheduled mode of recording used here, amplitude was not an extremely accurate measure and amplitude has been reported as relative within each mouse. There is also an additional issue of a gradual reduction in amplitude of signal over time in these long-term experiments â although it is true that much larger signals were detected after ovariectomy at the end of the experiment. At present, we have not tried to interpret whether the changes in amplitude are informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fiber photometry studies: Please indicate whether a post-mortem examination of GCaMP transfection and fiber photometry placement was conducted, and what region of the ARC was imaged.</p></disp-quote><p>Brains from these mice were collected, however postmortem analysis of cannula placement of GCaMP6 transfection was not carried out in all mice. This was based on our experience with this method, in that the quality and characteristic pattern of activity seen, as well as corresponding LH secretion following an SE, was indicative of successful cannula placement and transfection. Incorrectly placed cannular failed to show SEs. A trial was done with 3 mice and cannula placement was found to be in the caudal ARC (cARC) with GFP (attached to GCaMP) restricted to the cARC.
