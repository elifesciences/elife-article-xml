In order to better understand these changes, we measured mRNA and protein levels in genetically diverse mice at different ages. We observed distinctive change in mRNA and protein levels as a function of age. Changes in both mRNA and protein are associated with increased immune infiltration and decreases in mitochondrial function. Proteins show a greater extent of change and reveal changes in a wide array of biological processes including unique, organ-specific features of aging in kidney. Most importantly, we observed functionally important age-related changes in protein that occur in the absence of corresponding changes in mRNA.

Kidney function is affected early in the aging process and declines progressively with age. Decreased renal volume and the loss of functioning filtration units lead to a decline in glomerular filtration rate of 5–10% per decade after the age of 35 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glassock and Rule, 2012</xref>). It is relatively easy and non-invasive to measure functional changes of the kidney in blood and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindeman et al., 1985</xref>). Moreover, kidney function significantly impacts age-related diseases in other organs including cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elias et al., 2009</xref>). These factors make the kidney an excellent model to study organ-specific aging.</p><p>While physiological changes in kidney function are well documented, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular processes that drive age-related loss of function. Molecular profiling of normal aging kidneys at different life stages is most readily carried out in a model organism. Previous molecular profiling studies of the aging kidney have been limited to microarray based gene expression assays in young versus old kidneys of mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, single cell transcriptional profiling of aging C57BL/6NJ mice has been reported for multiple tissues, including kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almanzar et al., 2020</xref>). When aging studies are carried out in single inbred strains, they may display specific and idiosyncratic patterns of aging and thus lack generalizability beyond the particular strain studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voelkl et al., 2020</xref>). In order to capture the full range of pathologies associated with the aging kidney, a genetically diverse set of animals is required. In addition, previous studies have not attempted to relate transcriptional variation to changes in protein levels that are arguably more relevant to physiological aging.</p><p>Here we examine physiological kidney function together with mRNA and protein levels in male and female diversity outbred (DO) mice at ages 6, 12, and 18 months. The DO mice are a genetically diverse, outbred population derived from eight founder strains that together contribute &gt;50 million well-characterized variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Svenson et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, each DO animal is genetically unique and has the potential to reveal distinct age-related pathologies. This allows us to examine the common features of age-related change that are not specific to a single genetic background. Genetic variation will drive variation in mRNA and protein abundances for the majority of genes expressed in the kidney. This provides a unique opportunity to characterize the relationship between mRNA expression and protein levels and to examine how this relationship changes with age.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We carried out a cross-sectional aging study of ~600 DO mice including equal numbers of male and female mice that were aged to 6, 12, and 18 months. To evaluate kidney function, we successfully collected spot urine from 490 mice (141 at 6 months, 199 at 12 months, and 150 at 18 months) and measured albumin, creatinine, and phosphate levels. We obtained flash frozen tissue from the right kidney of 188 randomly selected mice (30 males and 33 females at 6 months; 31 males and 31 females at 12 months; and 34 males and 29 females at 18 months). We quantified mRNA by RNA-Seq and detected expression of 22,259 genes. We obtained untargeted proteomics data on the same set of 188 kidney samples and quantified 6580 proteins representing 6515 unique genes. Both mRNA and protein data were available for 6449 genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sources of variation in mRNA and protein expression</title><p>In order to characterize the main sources of variation in mRNA and protein in aging mouse kidney, we computed principle components (PCs) on the common set of 6449 genes. Data were transformed to rank-normal scores to reduce the influence of outliers.</p><p>The top four PCs for RNA explain 46.5% of variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first PC explains 22.1% of variance and is strongly correlated with sex (p-value &lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) and only weakly correlated with age (p-value = 0.050). The second PC (PC2) explains 15.3% of total variance and is not associated with sex (p-value = 0.30) or with age (p-value = 0.87). PC2 is explained by a batch effect in the RNA sequencing that we account for in subsequent analyses (see Materials and methods). The effects of age on mRNA are apparent in the third and fourth PCs but these explain 5% or less of total variation. Overall sex is a dominant factor in determining mRNA variation with minor contribution attributable to age.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis for females (dots) and males (triangles) at 6 (red), 12 (green), and 18 months (blue) of age.</title><p>The top four principal components for (<bold>A</bold>) RNA expression, with sex as the dominant factor and (<bold>B</bold>) protein expression, with age as the dominant factor.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62585-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The top four PCs for protein explain 39.1% of total variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The first PC explains 16.6% and is strongly associated with age (p-value = 5.3 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) but not with sex (p-value = 0.24). The second PC explains 12.0% of variation. It is associated with sex (p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) and only marginally so with age (p-value = 0.014). Effects of age and sex are apparent in the third and fourth PCs which each explain less than 5% of total variation. In contrast to mRNA, age is a dominant factor in determining protein variation with lesser but still substantial influence due to sex. We also observed that the age-specific variability of the protein PCs (especially PC1 and PC4) is greater in the 18-month animals indicating that there is greater between-animal variation in protein at later ages. In contrast, variation of mRNA is constant across age groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Age-related changes in mRNA expression</title><p>To identify transcripts that change with age, we applied differential expression testing with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Love et al., 2014</xref>) (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We identified 449 transcripts that showed a trend with age (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) of which 426 show increasing expression with age and only 23 are decreasing. It is striking that 95% of the changes are increasing, but this is a stringent family-wise criterion that selects only transcripts with the biggest age-related changes. At a relaxed stringency using a false discovery rate criterion (FDR &lt; 0.1), we identified 4039 transcripts that change with age and 2649 (65%) are increasing. The 426 mRNA species with the largest increase with age, we find 83 immunoglobulin genes (<italic>Igh</italic> and <italic>Igk</italic> classes).

All of the top 100 enrichment categories were related to immune cell functions. Increased expression of immune and inflammatory response genes in the aging kidney has been shown in previous mRNA expression studies and is likely the result of immune cell infiltration into the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodwell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melk et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of differentially expressed mRNA with age.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Functional enrichment and (<bold>B</bold>) network analysis, using ClusterProfiler, show overrepresentation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory response and is likely the result of immune cell infiltration into the kidney.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62585-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Relative changes in kidney cell composition as a function of age.</title><p>Plots show relative cell proportions in kidneys for B lymphocyte and macrophage subsets as depicted in facets.

These proteins are associated with mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum (Golgi and nuclear membranes), and the plasma membrane. Many of the latter are markers of specific cell types in the kidney. In order to better understand the mixed patterns of change, we used publicly available single-cell data sets (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/">https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/</ext-link>) from mouse kidneys and literature in which proteins were localized to specific segments of the tubule using immunohistochemistry to identify genes from the enrichment categories that could be associated with specific cell types as well as the basal and apical cell surfaces of proximal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A subset of differentially expressed proteins with age that are specific for various parts of the nephron, based on single-cell data, show distinct changes with age, such as actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement in podocytes and changes in intercalated cells and the loop of Henle.</title><p>Striking are the changes in channels and transporters of the proximal tubular transport, where there is an upregulation at the basolateral side and a downregulation at the apical side.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62585-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Two kidney-specific processes stand out: First, there is a large representation of transporters expressed in the proximal tubule cells. These are the most abundant cells in the renal tubule and do most of the work in reabsorbing salts, amino acids, glucose, and water, moving it from the filtrate back to the blood stream through transporters and channels on both the apical side and the basolateral side. We see a significant upregulation with age of the transporters on the apical side (e.g. SLC5A2 [or SGLT2], SLC7A9, SLC10A2, SLC5A8, and SLC6A19), while at the same time a significant downregulation of transporters on the basolateral side (e.g. SLC2A1 [a.k.a. GLUT1], SLC26A1, SLC4A4, SLC12A6, SLC12A7, SLC13A3, and SLC19A1). Many of these basolateral transporters depend on ion gradients generated by the Na+/K+ ATP pump for their ability to function and both subunits of this pump (ATP1A1 and ATP1B1) are significantly decreased with age. A picture of reduced proximal tubular function is completed by the overall decrease in many mitochondrial proteins, including VDAC1, which is one of the key proteins that regulate mitochondrial function and is considered the gatekeeper for the passages of metabolites, nucleotides, and ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camara et al., 2017</xref>). Transport requires a large amount of energy and proximal tubule cells are one of the most ATP-requiring cells and therefore a cell type with a very high mitochondrial content. We observe a decrease of proteins from all mitochondrial complexes as well as mitochondria-specific transporters.</p><p>The second important kidney-specific process that is suggested by the age-related changes in protein abundance is the actin remodeling in the podocytes. Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton has a primary role in the structural adaptations made by these cells to preserve their glomerular filtration properties. Focal adhesions and slit diaphragms are signaling networks that interact with the actin cytoskeleton, maintain balance between intracellular and extracellular signals, and regulate podocyte function and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perico et al., 2016</xref>). For the focal adhesions, we see a decrease in dystroglycan (DAG1), a protein that is highly abundant at the interface between the podocyte foot process and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The slit diaphragm contains proteins that include nephrin (NPHS1) and CD2AP, both increased with age, and they regulate Cofilin (CFL1) activity, which is also increased and leads to stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. We see an increase in actinin 4 (ACTN4), which crosslinks actin filaments in the podocyte and interacts with various other proteins. Two other upregulated proteins linking to the actin filaments and involved in filament organization are MYO1C and MYO1E. Interesting, MYH9, which also interacts with actin filaments to contract the cytoskeleton, is decreased with age. AKT2, encoding the RACβ serine/threonine-protein kinase, has an essential role in maintaining podocyte viability and normal cytoarchitecture after nephron loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perico et al., 2016</xref>). We see that AKT2 is upregulated with age. Activation of AKT2 is mediated by mTOR complex 2. Overall, these changes with age suggest actin remodeling of the podocyte foot processes, which may be due to changes in glomerular filtration rate.</p><p>Overall, we see that proteomics reveals a highly varied array of both fundamental and kidney-specific changes that are occurring at the cellular level. The picture that emerges is distinct and complementary to age-related changes observed at the transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of age-related changes in mRNA and protein</title><p>In order to compare age-related trends in mRNA and proteins, we identified 6514 proteins (representing 6449 distinct genes) that had corresponding mRNA data.

Direct comparison of the numbers of statistically significant mRNA and protein species that are changing with age is complicated by the potential difference in precision of the measurements as well as the different statistical testing methods. However, applying the same statistical criteria, we identified 5325 mRNAs and 4412 proteins with significant sex-specific differences. This suggests that we are not underpowered to detect changes in mRNA. We conclude that age-related changes are more prevalent for proteins as compared to mRNA, consistent with our analysis of the PCs of variation described above.</p><p>We looked at concordance in the directions of change between mRNA and protein.

Thus, the two groups of genes that show opposite directions of age-related change between mRNA and protein appear at first to present a paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson, 2009</xref>).

However, within each age group, we observe a positive correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression. <italic>Flot1,</italic> a gene in Group C, illustrates the opposite pattern of change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, while RNA and protein are usually correlated within age groups, the relative balance between RNA and protein can change in any direction across age groups. This suggests that age-related changes in protein levels are not necessarily due to transcriptional regulation and may not track age-related changes in RNA.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Examples of genes with opposite directions of age-related changes between mRNA and protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Slc5a12</italic> shows a decrease in mRNA and an increase in protein with age.

If age-related changes in protein are fully or partially mediated by changes in mRNA, the significance of the regression of protein on age should drop after accounting for mRNA. However, we observe essentially no change in the significance of the age effect on protein and conclude that the age-related changes in protein occur independently of changes in mRNA. To provide a point of reference for our mediation analysis of the age effect on proteins, we repeated the same analysis to determine whether sex difference in protein levels could be explained by corresponding sex differences in mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Its function is relatively easy to measure (through blood and urine) and functional changes can be observed early in the aging process. Although molecular changes in the aging kidney have been studied previously, these have been limited to microarray assays and RNAseq of mRNA expression. An implicit assumption of these studies is that changes in gene function (protein levels) can be extrapolated from changes in mRNA. While others have reported that mRNA can be a poor proxy for protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), we find that the direction of change of a protein with age cannot be reliably predicted based on changes in its coding mRNA even for genes where the mRNA and protein are correlated within age groups. We were able to confirm previously reported transcriptional changes in the kidney with age, such as the increase in immune-related pathways due to immune cell infiltration. However, in this study we provide another layer of understanding through our data that show that the changes in the aging kidney at the molecular level are more complicated than a change in gene expression directly affecting the expression of the encoded protein in the same direction. In fact, in most cases, at the global level we show that the changes in protein expression related to aging are not mediated through mRNA levels. Through distilling this global information, we were able to obtain valuable information that distinctly show that changes in mRNA and protein can shift in both concordant and discordant direction and are pathway and cell-type dependent.</p><p>Many mechanisms known to affect the aging process can explain this disconnect between mRNA expression and protein expression. Gene-specific changes in translation rate may cause these differences. However, a recent study in which RNAseq and Riboseq data was compared in kidneys in 3-, 20-, and 32-month-old male C57BL/6 mice concluded no significant changes in translation rates between time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anisimova et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of proteostasis is a hallmark of aging that manifests at the cellular level in a number of ways, such as protein aggregation, unfolding, oxidative damage, post-translational modification, and altered rates of protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014</xref>). We recently found a decrease in correlation between protein subunits of the 26S proteasome complex in the heart of DO mice with age, suggesting that loss of stoichiometry of the proteasome system itself may contribute to the decline in the protein quality control process during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gyuricza, 2020</xref>). Since proteostasis is tailored to the specific proteomic demands of different cells and the kidney consists of many different cell types, this is difficult to entangle in our study. Furthermore, our study can only detect protein levels and we cannot draw any conclusions about the status of the protein (functional, modified, or damaged). However, the significant changes in a number of ubiquitin-related genes and enrichment of proteins associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum with age may suggest important roles for these parts of the proteostasis network.</p><p>It is important to note that protein abundance does not equal protein function. In our study, the observation that proximal tubule-specific transporters on the apical side are increased with age, while at the same time transporters at the basolateral side are decreased poses the question what happens to cellular transport. However, increased apical-associated transporters do not necessarily mean increased uptake of molecules from the lumen and a build-up of these molecules in the cell as the transporters may not be localized to the brush border.</p><p>In conclusion, there appear to be distinct modes of aging when comparing the transcriptome and the proteome in the mouse kidney and that changes with age at the mRNA and protein level are driven by different factors. Identifying these factors and the mechanisms that disconnect gene expression from protein expression at the global scale with age will be essential to understand what drives the kidney (and possibly other organs) to become more susceptible to disease with age and to develop novel therapies to build resilience against them.</p><p>Age-related changes in protein levels are not driven by corresponding changes in mRNA. Instead they reflect a change in the balance of protein homeostasis that is altered in older animals compared to young animals. The drivers of age-specific changes do not act in the same way as factors that regulate sex differences in proteins. Sex differences appear to be largely driven by corresponding changes in mRNA. Age-related changes in protein and mRNA appear to be uncoupled, despite that protein and mRNA remain coupled within age groups. Our findings suggest that changes in protein homeostasis in aging animals occur as a result of changes in post-transcriptional processes – through changes in translation efficiency or of protein turnover. These changes appear to be coordinated across functionally related groups of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study cohort</title><p>Our initial cohort consisted of 600 DO mice (300 males and 300 females) bred at The Jackson Laboratory (stock no. 009376) in five breeding waves (generations 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12).

Age is coded using centered and scaled values (−0.5, 0, 0.5) to obtain effect size estimates in units of log<sub>2</sub> fold change per year. We chose to test for a linear trend because the test is more powerful than the general test for age as a three-level categorical variable. The trend test will detect nonlinear changes that have an overall trend, but with only three time points in the data, modeling nonlinear effects is not feasible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and testing of protein expression data</title><p>Tissue from the total (right) kidney samples was homogenized in 1 ml lysis buffer, which consisted of 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8 and Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche # 11697498001, Clifton, NJ, USA), and analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chick et al., 2016</xref>). Protein abundances were estimated from their component peptides identified through mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a database search of MS spectra. Prior to protein expression estimation, we filtered out peptides that contained polymorphisms relative to the mouse reference genome. We determined the age-related changes for each protein by computing the likelihood ration test for age (as a linear trend) using a mixed model linear regression with random effect terms to account for protein labeling (Tag), DO mouse generation, and a fixed-effect correction for sex. The regression coefficient and p-values generated from this model were used to determine the significant change in direction of the mRNA and proteins.</p><p>For both mRNA and protein data, we applied two types of multiple test corrections. We applied a stringent family-wise error correction using Holm’s method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615733">https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615733</ext-link>), indicated as ‘adjusted p’ in the text. We applied a less stringent false discovery rate correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346101">http://www.jstor.org/stable/2346101</ext-link>), indicated as ‘FDR’ in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In silico cell type deconvolution of bulk RNA-Seq</title><p>In order to examine relative changes in cell composition with age, we used in silico cell type deconvolution as implemented in the CellCODE R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chikina et al., 2015</xref>). This approach uses marker genes derived from transcriptional profiles ascertained for purified cell types to quantify changes in cell composition in a heterogeneous mixture of RNA (bulk RNA-Seq). For this analysis we used a bulk gene expression matrix that was upper quartile normalized to account for differences in library size. We obtained cell type-specific transcriptional profiles using single cell RNA-Seq data and cell type labels from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2018</xref>. To obtain markers from single cell transcriptional profiles, we normalized the count matrix by the number of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) per cell per 10,000 UMIs, took the log of counts + 1, and calculated mean expression of each gene in each cell type. We allowed up to 50 markers per cell type and calculated surrogate proportion variables using the ‘raw’ method to ensure that trends in relative cell type proportions were estimated independently of mouse age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chikina et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mediation analysis</title><p>We evaluated the potential for mRNA to act as a mediator of age-related changes in protein. We applied a regression modeling approach to the mediation analysis. We evaluated the significance of the regression of protein on age with and without mRNA as a predictor. If mRNA is a mediator of the effects of age on protein, we expect a substantial drop in the significance of the age term when mRNA is included in the model. There are alternative explanations for a drop in significance, but if mRNA fully or partially mediates the age effect, we should see the drop. To see the mediation effect, we compared −log<sub>10</sub> p-values for the age term in linear regression models Protein ~ Age + Sex + Generation and Protein ~ mRNA + Age + Sex + Generation. To evaluate whether mRNA could be mediating the effect of sex on proteins, we repeated the mediation analysis but computed significance of the sex term in the linear regressions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data normalization and statistics</title><p>All RNA-seq expression data and proteomics data were transformed to rank-normal scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conover, 1999</xref>) prior to analysis, unless otherwise stated. Albumin and urinary phosphorus data were log transformed after regression adjustment for urinary creatinine levels. Data analysis and figures were generated using R v4.0.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Sample size determination and allocation of samples to treatments</title><p>The sample size required to detect a significant age trend is determined by the expected size of the trend (difference in means between the 6- and 18-month age groups) relative to the within age-group variance. Therefore, we define the strength of a trend in units of standard deviation (SD) of the within group variance. Based on standard power calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voorhis and Morgan, 2007</xref>), with a sample size of ~64 animals per age group we can expect to achieve power = 0.80 to detect an age trend of 0.5 SD at an unadjusted type I error of 0.05. In practice because of the high precision of the RNA and protein quantification, this enabled us to detect age trends in the majority of genes tested. In order to focus on only the most substantial trends in the data we applied a strong, family-wise error rate correction for multiple testing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/">https://www.jstor.org/stable/</ext-link> 4615733).</p><p>The experiment was performed once. Both RNA and protein measurements were carried out in batches that were accounted for in the analysis. Samples were assigned to batches at one time in fully randomized order. Sample labels were not masked. There were no technical replications performed. In order to minimize the impact of outliers that inevitably occur in large-scale data, we analyzed after rank normal scores transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conover, 1999</xref>). We included only samples for which we had obtained both RNA and protein data.</p><p>Mice were assigned to pens at random with four mice per pen at weaning. The pens were assigned to age groups and tissue collection dates at random at weaning. The full study was populated across six generations of DO breeding spanning a period of 2 years. Assignment of pens to age groups was partially balanced across generations to minimize confounding effects and to ensure that tissue collection dates were spread evenly across the calendar year.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data access</title><p>Source data and analysis scripts have been deposited with FigShare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare">10.6084/m9.figshare. 12894146</ext-link>).

proteomic and transcriptomic changes of kidney aging in genetically diverse mice at different ages generated a rich resource for aging research. The common and unique mRNA and protein changes associated with kidney aging provides a more comprehensive picture of the aging processes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling reveal different aspects of aging in the kidney&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Steve Horvath (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In this work, the authors measured kidney mRNA and protein levels in 188 genetically diverse mice at ages 6, 12, and 18 months. They found age-related changes in both mRNA and protein were associated with increased immune infiltration and decreases in mitochondrial function. In addition, they observed some age-related changes in protein showed no corresponding changes in mRNA. Therefore, the authors concluded that examination of changes in proteins is essential to understand aging processes that are not transcriptionally regulated. Overall the experiments are well designed and provides the research community a new dataset of both gene expression and protein expression data to study murine kidney aging.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The figure legends were often too brief and did not provide sufficient information to help readers to understand the figure. For example, in Figure 6, it was not clear each dot's meaning, and the figure legend was not very helpful in general.</p><p>2) Some of the analyses were not well described. For example, DEseq2 is most commonly used to compare differential gene expressions under two conditions; however, in this experiment, there were three time points. Additional description will be helpful to demonstrate how the trend test was performed and what exactly was tested. It seems that there were way many more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes from this analysis. However, using a different model, when authors compared gene expression with protein expression, there were comparable numbers of up-regulated genes vs. down-regulated genes. Would non-linear changes be captured by this analysis, e.g., up- regulation in the second time point then down-regulation in the third time point?</p><p>3) In the subsection “Age-related changes in Protein Expression”, the authors tried to identify proteins/genes from enrichment categories that were associated with specific cell types as illustrated in Figure 3. However, it is not clear how accurate such cell type inference was. Additional information such as how cell type specific marker genes were derived will be helpful to understand what the authors did to decompose the proteomic changes into cell-type specific changes as suggested in the aforementioned subsection and Figure 3.</p><p>4) The authors observed essentially no change in the significance of correlations between protein and age when mRNA expression was considered or excluded from the regression model. Therefore they concluded that the age-related components of change in protein abundance occurred independently of the mRNA. This is not fully anticipated, as I would expect that for some proteins, their age-related changes depend on mRNA. It seems to me that a conditional independence test would be more appropriate, i.e., to test if protein and age are still correlated when condition on mRNA expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62585.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The figure legends were often too brief and did not provide sufficient information to help readers to understand the figure.

In this case we provided two model formulas, one with just covariates and the other with covariates plus Age expressed as a continuous variate (not a factor), centered and in units of years (-0.5, 0, 0.5). The likelihood ratio test for these models will be significant if there is a trend (up or down) with Age. DESeq2 will also estimate the magnitude of the trend in units of log<sub>2</sub> fold change per year. We have added text to the Materials and methods to clarify how this was done.</p><p>At the stringent significance levels (Holm adjusted p &lt; 0.05), there are 449 RNAs that have a significant Age effect. This is a very stringent criteria that picks out only those RNAs with the biggest trends. Of these, 426 are increasing (95%!). However, if we relax the stringency using a false discovery rate (FDR &lt; 0.1), as we will do in later sections of the manuscript, we find 4039 RNAs are changing with Age. Of these, 2649 are increasing (65%). We would interpret this to mean that there is a slight bias for RNAs that change with Age to be increasing – and the bias gets stronger as the significance becomes more stringent. We checked using magnitude of fold-change and the same pattern holds, RNAs with the biggest change tend to be increasing with Age, it is such a striking observation, we have added text to explain further (Results).</p><p>It is likely that many of the Age-related changes in RNA (and protein) are non-linear. But we only have data at three time points. The trend test (with 1 df, Age as a variate) is more powerful than the general test (2df, Age as a factor). The trend test will pick up trends, even if the change is non-linear – unless they go up and down by the same magnitude (or down then up). Non-linear changes would be of interest, but with only three time points we have little confidence in our ability to detect and characterize them.

It seems to me that a conditional independence test would be more appropriate, i.e., to test if protein and age are still correlated when condition on mRNA expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a surprising finding, and that is why we set the stage by looking in detail at how RNA-protein pairs change with age. We conclude that, even for genes with discordant directions of change, RNA and protein are usually correlated within age groups. However, the average level of RNA and average level of protein can change across age groups in any direction. This is best illustrated in Figure 5. RNA and protein can still be coupled but display different directions of change with age. We have added text to expand on this point (Results).</p><p>The regression test – comparing models for protein with vs. without RNA as a predictor – is the likelihood ratio test for conditional independence. The way we present it is not standard. On the x- and y-axes of the plot in Figure 6 we show the -log10 p-value for the effect of Age (on protein) without and with RNA in the model, respectively. If RNA is a complete mediator, i.e., Age -&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein, the adjusted -log 10 p-values (y-axis) would drop to nearly 0, i.e., we fail to reject the null hypothesis of conditional independence. The conditional independence model is a null hypothesis so we cannot “prove” it. The situation is trickier because if there is any measurement error (there always is), complete mediation doesn’t hold – but the -log10 p-values should still drop to the extent that (measured) RNA is a partial mediator. Complicated. As a sanity check, we also evaluated whether RNA could be a mediator of the effects of Sex on protein, Sex -&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein. Sex effects appear to be at least partially mediated by RNA for most genes. We checked everything three times, there is no mistake. We have expanded our explanation in the text (Materials and methods) and also expanded the legend of Figure 6 to (partially) explain the logic of this analysis. We feel that this is potentially an important finding with implications about the nature of the aging process – but requires more follow-up with data spanning different species and contexts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
