To evaluate neuropathophysiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examine transcriptional and cellular signatures in the Brodmann area 9 (BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF) in SARS-CoV-2, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases. Here, we show similar alterations of neuroinflammation and blood–brain barrier integrity in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals. Distribution of microglial changes reflected by the increase in Iba-1 reveals nodular morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals. Similarly, HIF-1α is significantly upregulated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same brain regions regardless of AD status. The finding may help in informing decision-making regarding therapeutic treatments in patients with neuro-PASC, especially those at increased risk of developing AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>post acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New evidence of brain proinflammatory cascades supports post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ultimately promoting the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease as a function of age.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been well studied in the respiratory system; however, much less information is available regarding the neurological consequences of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flerlage et al., 2021</xref>). Previous evidence tentatively suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be neuroinvasive, leading to a vast array of neurological symptoms, including anosmia, ageusia, cognitive functions, and cerebrovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desforges et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hingorani et al., 2022</xref>). Neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection manifest with increased severity related to age and shared medical history of metabolic disorders and other vascular risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Divani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sullivan and Fischer, 2021</xref>). Some strains within the coronavirus family are implicated in neuronal degeneration, such as HCoV-OC43, which can lead to glutamate excitotoxicity and neuronal degradation in mice through cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacomy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brison et al., 2011</xref>). Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new addition to the coronavirus family, less information exists regarding the potential long-term neurological complications that may impact COVID-19 survivors. This may be especially concerning for aging individuals with increased vulnerability to developing age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>While it is currently unknown whether neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection arise solely from systemic inflammation in the periphery or brain infiltration, it is well established that secretion of cytokines and chemokines from the periphery allows the recruitment of leukocytes and other cells to specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prinz and Priller, 2017</xref>). This type of immune response is speculated to accelerate blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and may potentially damage cells within the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Erausquin et al., 2021</xref>). Such effects are similar to neuropathology seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders, where leukocyte infiltration, BBB dysregulation, and microglial activation are observed. Thus, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may accelerate the onset and severity of cognitive decline or AD in susceptible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meinhardt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mhatre et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS and subsequent mechanisms associated with cognition is particularly pressing, given the number of individuals presenting with neurological symptoms of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (neuro-PASC), colloquially termed ‘long-COVID’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shanley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the potential brain mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals by comparing transcriptional and cellular responses in the cortical Brodmann area 9 (cortical BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF); two brain regions deeply involved in cognitive and emotional functions, to age- and gender-matched neurological cases. Here, we report evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes similar pathophysiological features found in AD cortical BA9 and HF regions and possibly exacerbate preexisting AD pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographics of human postmortem cases</title><p>We examined postmortem tissue samples of cortical BA9 of the frontal cortex and the HF collected by the Neuropathology Brain Bank and Research CoRE at Mount Sinai from four different groups: SARS-CoV-2, AD, and AD individuals who became infected by SARS-CoV-2, compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Within the cortical BA9 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), for example, several pathways, including neuroinflammation, TREM1, and cell senescence, show increased activation in the AD, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD groups. TREM1 signaling, the most highly activated pathway in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), is expressed primarily on myeloid cells, such as macrophages and microglia, and is involved in pro-inflammatory immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Oliveira Matos et al., 2020</xref>). Although age-associated cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is a natural process where telomeres shorten over time, this process also occurs during cellular stress due to inflammation, including that caused by viral infections, leading to a senescence-associated secretory phenotype such as metalloproteinases (MMPs), and inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). Another pathway of interest, SNARE, shows decreased activation in the AD and SARS-CoV-2 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with the most significant reduction seen in the SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases group. SNARE proteins play an essential role in neurotransmitter release, and altered function is implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, where SNARE proteins affect β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and cytoplasmic transport of neurofibrillary tangles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Margiotta, 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Changes in signaling pathways within the cortical Brodmann area 9 (BA9).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The similarities of canonical pathways reveal the top regulated canonical pathways within the cortical BA9 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases in reference to the control.

Interestingly, CREB signaling modulates processes in consolidating memory and information processing and is inhibited in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amidfar et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we also see a reduction in CREB signaling in the AD individuals; however, this effect is reversed in SARS-CoV-2-infected AD individuals in the HF. It is important to note that TREM1 signaling is upregulated in two of the three sample groups (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases), but no predictions for this pathway occur in the AD group.

Additionally, Zhou and colleagues found a significant overlap in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monocytes and markers in AD and COVID-19, which also occurs in our dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). The similarities of transcriptional profiles and cellular pathophysiology in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals support the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS, leading to neuro-PASC symptoms such as brain fog and memory loss.</p><p>Notably, our study identifies similar neuroinflammatory profiles in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and AD SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals at the transcriptional and cellular levels in both the cortical BA9 and HF brain regions. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 generates a similar neuroinflammatory environment in neurodegenerative disorders like AD. This was highlighted by the regulation of TREM1, neuroinflammation, and cellular senescence/inflammatory pathways present in all groups and further established by the widespread microglial activation seen in AD and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases, and in particular, the nodular formation seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases. Microglia nodule formation is present in some neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS, and viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tröscher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer-Smith, 2001</xref>). A potentially compounding finding is the nodular formation that is initially characterized by abundant presence of activated microglia and innate immune factors leading to Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and upregulations of inflammasome genes, leading to T cell stimulation and ultimately the destruction of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tröscher et al., 2019</xref>). This may be of particular concern in the SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases, where we primarily observe increased nodular lesions. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 further promotes neuroinflammation in AD, which likely advances the progression and severity of CNS disease in these individuals. Interestingly, a large retrospective study of patients 65 years or older revealed that patients with SARS-CoV-2 were at an increased risk for a new AD diagnosis within a year of their SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, with the most significant risk seen among those 85 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). This may underscore the critical role of preexisting inflammation in the brain, which is seen in the context of ‘normal’ aging, in promoting or advancing AD progression.</p><p>Our findings also support the notion that SARS-CoV-2 may cause cognitive deficits via regulation of pathways associated with cognition and neuroinflammation. Here, we show changes in the transcriptional regulation of SNARE and NGF pathways, suggesting impaired neuronal health and function, presumably negatively impacting cognitive function. We also observed potential damage to the vasculature via increased regulation of HIF-1α, integrin signaling, and IL-8 signaling. It is important to note the possibility of vascular damage due to ventilation prior to death in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals; however, vascular damage by SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by HIF-1α, is observed in non-human primates that were euthanized at designated end-of-life time points precluding breathing intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutkai et al., 2022</xref>). These findings may point to a possible route for lymphocyte transmigration following chemoattractant gradients such as IL-8 and enhancement of MMPs and VEGF, which are aided by integrins such as cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and are implicated with inflammatory signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patarroyo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bui et al., 2020</xref>). This process leads to T cell activation, which may be responsible for the observed inflammatory environment. Our transcriptional data showed an abundant upregulation of TLRs (TLRs 1, 5, 7, and 8) related to the inflammasome. Further analysis of this dataset also indicated the potential role for T cells through IL-7 pathway activation and CD86 upregulation; however, we did not confirm changes in the number of T cells, and no evidence of leukocyte infiltration into the CNS compartment was observed in any disease state in this investigation. Future studies will be required to determine the role of leukocytes in the observed pathophysiology.</p><p>Although neuroinflammation and vascular injury were prominent features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases brain pathology, the direct role of the virus is unclear. We did detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in some SARS-CoV-2 brain tissues that appear to be restricted to the vasculature. This finding is supported by other studies suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is sporadically present in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serrano et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, we only investigated CNS regions with the greatest significance in AD. These regions may be less prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than others, such as the olfactory bulb and tract, where olfactory neurons are proposed to be infected through viral spread from olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burks et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings of the viral nucleocapsid limited to the endothelium suggest the hematological spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS that may not extend to the neurons in the cortical BA9 and HF yet is still capable of inducing widespread inflammation in the brain. Even in the absence of a detectable virus in the neurons or neural cells, SARS-CoV-2 may impact cognitive dysfunction through TREM1 activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent pyroptosis, where pro-caspase 1 cleavage and subsequent cleavage and activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and gasmerdin D pore formation in cells ultimately lead to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parodi-Rullán et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). NLRP3 activation is reported in AD and COVID-19, and is suggested by the formation of microglial nodules demonstrated in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lünemann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herman and Pasinetti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 is not the first virus to be implicated in cognitive dysfunction. This is a facet shown with other viruses such as HIV, HSV, and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smail and Brew, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). While this study cannot predict the outcome of disease progression in COVID-19 survivors, the present findings that SARS-CoV-2 infection can recapitulate AD-type transcriptional and cellular neuroinflammatory patterns among other in a very short time frame make it critical to understand how SARS-CoV-2 impacts long-term cognition. The increase in nodular formation present in SARS-CoV-2-infected AD cases tissue also demonstrates a critical need to functionally determine potentially synergistic effects of AD and SARS-CoV-2. This is underscored by the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction seen among neuro-PASC patients, making it imperative that the link between SARS-CoV-2 and cognition be intensively investigated to identify potential therapeutic strategies for halting cognitive decline in these individuals. Collectively, our results demonstrate several key areas of overlap between the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and AD. These findings may help inform decision-making regarding therapeutic treatments in patients with COVID-19, especially those who may be at increased risk of developing AD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Brain tissue was collected from the cortical BA9 and HF of four SARS-CoV-2 cases, four AD cases, and four non-SARS-CoV-2 or AD autopsies.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors examined neuropathological changes in postmortem brain tissue samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Alzheimer's disease, both SARS-CoV-2 and Alzheimer's disease, and demographically matched controls. This is an important comparison since there is still a lot that is unknown regarding SARS-CoV-2 effects in the central nervous system and there is concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection can accelerate cognitive decline or development of Alzheimer's disease in certain at-risk individuals.</p><p>The experimental tissue samples were obtained from a well-established Neuropathology Brain Bank at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. The authors examined brain tissue samples from the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation, and analyzed transcriptional profiles using a volcano plot for distributions of gene transcripts of SARS-CoV-2 and AD cases compared to controls for thousands of genes. The authors identified genes with different expression according to a p-value of less than 0.01 and an absolute log fold change greater than 1, including upregulated and downregulated genes. The authors then utilized rank-rank hypergeometric overlap analysis and determined the number of shared differentially regulated genes among SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2/AD groups with a p value of less than 0.05 and an absolute z value of greater than 0.0001 for frontal lobe and hippocampal formation areas. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was then used to further characterize pathways with altered gene expression compared to controls, including pathways involved in inflammation, β-amyloid accumulation and neurofibrillary tangle transport, cell senescence, and integrin signaling and nerve growth factor signaling. Markers for microglial activation and hypoxia were also assessed.</p><p>The authors concluded that SARS-CoV-2 and AD cause similar alterations of regulatory patterns of immune-inflammatory pathways at the transcriptional and cellular levels. The authors also explained that the data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease which could advance the progression and severity of the disease process in these individuals and may contribute to increased risk for development of Alzheimer's disease in susceptible individuals as well. The authors also make the point that their findings support the notion that SARS-CoV-2 may cause cognitive deficits through disruption of regulation of pathways associated with neuroinflammation and that they detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in brain vasculature but not in neurons.</p><p>This is an excellent and timely study that highlights yet another potential contribution of viruses to the development of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Additionally, the results of this study may be useful in improving understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection produces long-term cognitive dysfunction in certain individuals.</p><p>This is an interesting and excellent study. I think the information in this article would be useful to clinicians caring for patients with both SARS-CoV-2 and Alzheimer's disease. I am not really an expert on a lot of the methods that were used or this type of genetic analysis, but the conclusions seemed logical and well supported by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The importance of SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuro-pathophysiological change in Alzheimer's disease is a very important subject. Elizabeth et al., investigated the common aspects of AD and COVID-19 based on the four conditions; SARS-CoV-2 infected, AD and AD individuals who became infected by SARS-CoV-2, compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases by comparing transcriptional and cellular responses in the cortical Broadman area 9 (cortical BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF); The authors reported increased Iba-1 positive microglial cell in conjunction with the morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals. Similarly, they can observe HIF-1α is significantly upregulated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same brain regions regardless of the AD status.</p><p>Although the study subject is very important, the conclusions are not sufficiently supported to advance our understanding of AD pathophysiology in the context of viral infection. Many of the observed effects could simply be blamed on the fact that neuroinflammation occurs with both AD and viral infections. No data address the effects of COVID-19 on AD-specific pathology – amyloid plaques and Tau-tangles. In addition, significant analytical details are missing, e.g. FDR values.</p><p>The study assesses the importance of COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuro-pathophysiological change in Alzheimer's disease based on four conditions; SARS-CoV-2 infected, AD and AD individuals who became infected by SARS-CoV-2, compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases by comparing transcriptional and cellular responses in the cortical Broadman area 9 (cortical BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF); The authors reported that increased Iba-1 positive microglial cell in conjunction with morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals.

The authors selected the significant gene changes based on only p-value and fold change. However, it is essential that the authors include the &quot;false discovery rate (FDR)&quot; values, which would greatly affect the validity and reliability of the findings.

While the total number of samples available in this study does reach 16 samples, the samples are distributed across four different patient groups and two genders. Therefore, the mixture of groups and genders would make it difficult to identify condition-specific modules. The justification for using nominal p-values instead of FDR values was included in the Materials and methods (pages 19-20, lines 395-397) multiple testing correction was performed for all comparisons; however, due to the relatively small number of genes surpassing an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05, a nominal p-value was used in the selection of differential genes for all downstream analyses. As this study is exploratory in nature, it is expected that the trends and pathways observed in the current study will provide direction for future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1 Gene expression profiles are well described but would be great if the authors could dissect up and down pathways based on the DEG changes. Figure 1 itself is not informative enough to get insights, so it is highly recommended that the authors report what genes/pathways are affected based on their observations.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that the purpose of Figure1 is to facilitate quick visual identification of genes with large fold changes and statistical significance, as demonstrated through volcano plots and bar graphs, for subsequent analysis. As suggested by the reviewer, we revised the bar graphs in Figure 1 to indicate the number of genes that are upregulated or downregulated in each comparison (page 30, lines 594-596). Moreover, we want to point out that current analysis, depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4, include the pathways that are either upregulated or downregulated based on the differential gene expression changes. These changes are detailed in the Figure 2C-source data 1 and Figure 2D-source data 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2 gene names are not described. Thus, it is hard to understand what is up or down based on the conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this point. In Figure 2, we provided a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed gene changes across all groups using a heatmap and included Rank-rank hypergeometric overlap analysis to further elucidate the findings in Figure 2—figure supplementary 1 and Figure 2—figure supplementary 2. To provide specific information regarding the changes, including upregulation and downregulation in the cortical BA9 and hippocampal formation, we provide detailed descriptions of the regulated pathways and genes in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3 It is interesting that TREM1 signaling significantly changed in AD and AD with SARS-CoV-2, but more important that the authors should compare AD with SARS-CoV-2 vs AD condition, as well.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is an interesting direction, it should be noted that the scope of our current study is to explore the similarity of neuroinflammatory processes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection to those observe in AD. Regarding TREM1 signaling, we now clarified it in the Results (page 8, lines 147-148) and Legend. Additionally, while a direct transcriptional comparison of AD with SARS-CoV-2 condition to the AD condition was examined (data not shown), the results were ambiguous and so not reported in this manuscript. This may be due to several factors, such as patient heterogeneity and potential differences in disease severity, and would require a larger sample size to reliably identify specific transcriptional modifications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in an AD background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3 and Figure 4 Need to address/discuss why are the transcriptomic data from two regions – BA9 and HF – are showing different results.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the importance of understanding the regional distribution of transcriptomic changes and agree that it is a valuable aspect to consider. Our study was primarily designed to investigate the broader neuroinflammatory patterns induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential resemblance to that seen in AD. While regional variations in gene expression may exist, our research focused on identifying global transcriptomic changes, rather than region-specific alterations. This approach allowed us to capture the overall impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neuroinflammation across different brain regions, which provides a broad overview of the neuroinflammatory profile that will be explored further. Nonetheless, we recognize the significance of regional differences and their potential implications. Future studies with a specific focus on regional transcriptomic changes could provide valuable insights into the localized effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neuroinflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5 The detailed experimental procedures are needed. e.g. is one dot representing the one individual subject? Or one dot is from the one image?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important question to consider. However, it should be noted that the specific subject we examined in our study (SARS-CoV-2) did not display amyloid plaque and tau-pathology. Moreover, as described in Table S1, the relatively short survival time of approximately 3 months post-infection may not be sufficient to observe significant changes in AD-related neuropathology such as amyloid-β plaques and Tau tangles. While we cannot provide a definitive answer to this question within the scope of our study, it is important to note that our findings strongly support the existence of significant similarities in proinflammatory conditions between SARS-CoV-2 and AD. This suggests the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 as a risk factor in triggering local proinflammatory changes, which are known to play a significant role in the onset of AD. Although the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection promoting the development of AD is currently unknown, our findings reported herein support the notion that the long-term impact of infection on brain health contributes to and/or advances the progression to age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and AD-related dementias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 5. Microglial cells are less activated in brain parenchyma while they are accumulating more significantly around vessels. Thus, compromised blood vessels may be affected by activated microglial cells and consequently lead to more immune cell infiltration.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to confirm that each point on the graphs represent the average finding per total brain area for an individual subject. We have amended the Materials and methods section (page 19, lines 379-382, and 385) and the Figure 5 and Figure 6 legends clarify this important point (page 32, lines 643-644 and page 33, lines 668-669).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. As such, it would be useful if the authors could address whether they observed any peripheral immune cell infiltration such as T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and/or monocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Leukocyte infiltrate can be identified by H&amp;E, as well as through the hematoxylin counterstain used in the different IHC studies that examined specific proteins of interest. Naturally, when seen, leukocyte infiltration is obvious within the perivascular space, which was heavily viewed and analyzed on multiple 5µm sections on glass and through HALO analyses in silico. We would like to clarify that in our investigation, we did not observe evidence of leukocyte infiltration into the CNS compartment in any disease state examined. This is consistent with other reported findings from human autopsies and relevant animal models, which do not show leukocyte infiltration is a major finding in SARS-CoV-2 infection, outside of rare cases of encephalitis. While we can confirm that significant infiltrate was not seen in any of our subjects, this does not negate the potential for increased trafficking of leukocytes in the brain. We acknowledge that further studies will be necessary to determine the role of leukocytes in the observed pathophysiology. Future investigations should explore the potential involvement of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and neuroinflammation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
