To preserve cellular function, transcription of proteasome subunit genes is induced in response to proteasome dysfunction caused by pathogen attacks or proteasome inhibitor drugs. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, this response requires SKN-1, a transcription factor related to mammalian Nrf1/2. Here, we use comprehensive genetic analyses to identify the pathway required for <italic>C. elegans</italic> to detect proteasome dysfunction and activate SKN-1. Genes required for SKN-1 activation encode regulators of ER traffic, a peptide N-glycanase, and DDI-1, a conserved aspartic protease. DDI-1 expression is induced by proteasome dysfunction, and we show that DDI-1 is required to cleave and activate an ER-associated isoform of SKN-1. Mammalian Nrf1 is also ER-associated and subject to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a conserved mechanism of proteasome surveillance. Targeting mammalian DDI1 protease could mitigate effects of proteasome dysfunction in aging and protein aggregation disorders, or increase effectiveness of proteasome inhibitor cancer chemotherapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17721.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17721.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17721.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform many important roles in cells, but these molecules can become toxic if they are damaged or are no longer needed. A molecular machine called the proteasome destroys ‘unwanted’ proteins in animal and other eukaryotic cells. If the proteasome stops working properly, unwanted proteins start to accumulate and cells respond by increasing the activity of genes that make proteasomes. A protein called SKN-1 is involved in this response and activates the genes that encode proteasome proteins, but it is not understood how SKN-1 “senses” that proteasomes are not working properly.</p><p>Here, Lehrbach and Ruvkun used a roundworm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to search for new genes that activate SKN-1 when the proteasome’s activity is impaired. The roundworms were genetically engineered to produce a fluorescent protein that indicates when a particular gene needed to make proteasomes is active. Lehrbach and Ruvkun identified some roundworms with mutations that cause the levels of fluorescence to be lower, indicating that SKN-1 was less active in these animals. Further experiments showed that some of these mutations are in genes that encode enzymes called DDI-1 and PNG-1. DDI-1 is able to cut certain proteins, while PNG-1 can remove sugars that are attached to proteins. Therefore, it is likely that these enzymes directly interact with SKN-1 and alter it to activate the genes that produce the proteasome.</p><p>More work is now needed to understand the details of how modifying SKN-1 changes its activity in cells. In the future, drugs that target DDI-1 or PNG-1 might be used to treat diseases in which proteasome activity is too high or low, including certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17721.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17721.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>aspartic protease</kwd><kwd>peptide N-glycanase</kwd><kwd>SKN-1A/Nrf1</kwd><kwd>ER traffic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG016636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruvkun</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehrbach</surname><given-names>Nicolas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Post-translational processing of the SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcription factor regulates proteasome expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proteasome is a multi-protein complex responsible for the majority of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). The essential function of the proteasome, and its highly conserved structure and mechanism of proteolysis renders it an attractive target for bacteria and other competitors. Production of small molecule inhibitors and protein virulence factors that target the proteasome by some bacteria and fungi exploits this vulnerability to gain a growth advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenteany et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Groll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, environmental stresses antagonize the proteasome by causing accumulation of unfolded and aggregated proteins that can form a non-productive inhibitory interaction with proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayyadevara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deriziotis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kristiansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Snyder et al., 2003</xref>). Human diseases in which proteasome dysfunction is implicated highlight the importance of maintaining proteasome function in the face of these challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciechanover and Kwon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paul, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>), and it follows that animal cells possess mechanisms to monitor and defend proteasome function.</p><p>A conserved response to proteasome disruption is the transcriptional up-regulation of proteasome subunit genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meiners et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wójcik and DeMartino, 2002</xref>). In mammalian cells members of the Cap’ n’ Collar basic leucine zipper (CnC-bZip) family of stress responsive transcription factors mediate this transcriptional response. Two CnC-bZip franscription factors, Nrf1/NFE2L1 and Nrf2, have similar DNA-binding domains and may regulate an overlapping set of downstream targets. However, only Nrf1 is required for upregulation of proteasome subunits following proteasome disruption, whereas Nrf2 may activate proteasome expression under other circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arlt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). The events leading to Nrf1 activation in response to proteasome disruption are complex. In vitro analyses in human and mouse cells indicate that Nrf1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane associated glycoprotein that is constitutively targeted for proteasomal degradation by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Upon proteasome inhibition Nrf1 is stabilized, undergoes deglycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, and localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Hayes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2014</xref>).

The transcriptional response to proteasome disruption involves <italic>skn-1,</italic> which encodes multiple isoforms of a transcription factor with similarities to both Nrf1 and Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>skn-1</italic> was originally identified for its essential role in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowerman et al., 1992</xref>), but is also required after these early stages for stress responses in a manner analogous to mammalian Nrf1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An and Blackwell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paek et al., 2012</xref>). SKN-1 binds to the promoters of proteasome subunit genes and mediates their upregulation in response to proteasome disruption, and is required for survival of a mutant with attenuated proteasome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular mechanism that links SKN-1 activation to the detection of proteasome dysfunction has not been established.</p><p>Here, we use genetic analysis to uncover the mechanism that couples detection of proteasome defects to these transcriptional responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We find that an ER-associated isoform of SKN-1 (SKN-1A), is essential for this response. Our genetic data show that the ER-association of this transcription factor normally targets it for poteasomal degradation via ERAD, but is also required for its correct post-translational processing and activation during proteasome dysfunction. After ER-trafficking, our data argues that the PNG-1 peptide N-glycanase removes glycosylation modifications that occur in the ER, and then the DDI-1 aspartic protease cleaves SKN-1A. Each of these steps in SKN-1A processing is essential for the normal response to proteasomal dysfunction. This pathway is essential for compensation of proteasome function under conditions that partially disrupt the proteasome; when compensation is disabled, mild inhibition of the proteasome causes lethal arrest of development. Thus we reveal a vital mechanism of proteasome surveillance and homeostasis in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The aspartic protease DDI-1 and ERAD factors are required for transcriptional responses to proteasome disruption</title><p>The proteasome subunit gene <italic>rpt-3</italic> is upregulated in a <italic>skn-1</italic>-dependent manner in response to proteasome disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>).

This reporter gene is upregulated in response to drugs such as bortezomib or mutations that cause proteasome dysfunction. To identify the genetic pathways that sense proteasome dysfunction and trigger the activation of SKN-1, we took advantage of a regulatory allele affecting the <italic>pbs-5</italic> locus. <italic>pbs-5</italic> encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome.

The collection includes multiple alleles of genes encoding factors required for ERAD. In ERAD, misfolded glycoproteins are retrotranslocated from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).

HRD3/SEL1 localizes to the ER membrane and recognizes ERAD substrates in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gauss et al., 2006</xref>), and a single allele of <italic>sel-9</italic>, which encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of TMED2/EMP24, which is also ER-localized and implicated in ER quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wen and Greenwald, 1999</xref>). We also found mutations in <italic>png-1</italic>, which encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of PNG1/NGLY1. After ERAD substrates have been retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm, PNG1/NGLY1 removes N-linked glycans to allow their degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>).

In the ER, SKN-1A is subject to glycosylation, and possibly other post-translational modifications. ERAD-dependent release of SKN-1A from the ER targets SKN-1A for proteasome-mediated degradation. When the proteasome is functional (shown on the left half of the model), SKN-1A is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Under these conditions, the DDI-1 protease is expressed at low levels and localizes largely to the cytoplasm. During proteasome dysfunction (shown on the right half of the model), SKN-1A is not efficiently degraded. Stabilized SKN-1A is deglycosylated by PNG-1 (this deglycosylation might take place in the nucleus or cytoplasm) and localizes to the nucleus. Proteasome dysfunction also leads to increased expression and nuclear localization of DDI-1 (this is in part due to regulation of <italic>ddi-1</italic> transcription by SKN-1A, but likely involves additional SKN-1A-independent mechanisms). Once in the nucleus, SKN-1A is cleaved by DDI-1 to produce the active truncated form of SKN-1A, allowing upregulation of proteasome subunits and other downstream genes. Cleavage of SKN-1A is disrupted by mutations that affect ERAD, or if SKN-1A lacks its transmembrane domain, suggesting that DDI-1-dependent cleavage occurs downstream of ER-trafficking and may require post-translational modifications to SKN-1A acquired during this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17721.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17721.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17721-fig6-figsupp1-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our genetic screen for mutants that fail to activate SKN-1 and dissection of the isoform-specific role of SKN-1A reveals the molecular details of proteasome surveillance. We show that SKN-1A is an ER associated protein that is normally targeted by the ERAD pathway for proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. Mutations affecting ERAD genes <italic>sel-1</italic>/SEL1/HRD3 and <italic>sel-11</italic>/HRD1, stabilize SKN-1A, but also disrupt localization of SKN-1A following proteasome disruption, due to a failure to efficiently release SKN-1A from the ER. Our data argues that following release from the ER, SKN-1A must be deglycosylated by PNG-1 and cleaved by DDI-1 to become fully active <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The bortezomib sensitivity defect of <italic>png-1</italic> mutants is similar in strength to <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutants, and both <italic>png-1</italic> and <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutations are synthetic lethal with <italic>rpn-10(RNAi</italic>). These similarities suggest that SKN-1A activity may be completely abolished in the absence of PNG-1; likely as a result of failure to deglycosylate SKN-1A following its retrotranslocation from the ER, although we cannot rule out the possibility that deglycosylation of other proteins contributes indirectly to SKN-1A function. Surprisingly, we were unable to generate <italic>png-1; skn-1a</italic> double mutants, apparently due to lethality of double mutant embryos (NL unpublished). This indicates that in <italic>png-1</italic> mutant animals, SKN-1A (likely in a glycosylated state) retains a function that is essential for development. This suggests that SKN-1A is not only important for proteasome homeostasis, but is also important for cellular homeostasis upon disruption of glycoprotein metabolism. Consistently, <italic>skn-1</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover-Cutter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>NGLY1, the human PNG-1 orthologue, plays important roles in human development; NGLY1 deficiency, a recently described genetic disorder of protein deglycosylation, is caused by mutations at the NGLY1 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enns et al., 2014</xref>). Failure to deglycosylate Nrf1, and consequent defects in proteasome homeostasis, likely contributes to the symptoms associated with NGLY1 deficiency. As such our work identifies a pathway that may be targeted for treatment of NGLY1 deficiency - genetic screens for suppressors of the defective proteasome gene regulation of <italic>png-1</italic> mutants could indicate targets for drug development.</p><p>The expression of DDI-1 is dramatically responsive to proteasome inhibition, indicating that its synthesis or stability is coupled to surveillance of proteasome dysfunction. ChIP analysis of SKN-1 shows binding at the promoter element of the DDI-1 operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that DDI-1 upregulation may occur via SKN-1 mediated transcriptional regulation, and we observed a defect in the upregulation of GFP::DDI-1 following proteasome disruption in <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutants. This suggests a positive feedback loop, wherein SKN-1A upregulates DDI-1, and DDI-1 promotes SKN-1A activation. Positive feedback may ensure a timely and robust response to proteasome inhibition.</p><p>Mutation of <italic>ddi-1</italic> causes defective regulation of <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic> and increases sensitivity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to proteasome inhibitors. SKN-1A is cleaved at a site ~20 kD from the N-terminus, and <italic>ddi-1</italic> is required for this cleavage. The requirement for its catalytic function strongly suggests that DDI-1 is the enzyme directly responsible for cleavage of SKN-1A, although we cannot rule out the possibility that DDI-1 acts upstream of an as-yet unidentified second protease. There are precedents for cascades of proteases, for example caspases in apoptosis, complement cascades in immunology, and thrombin cascades in blood clotting. Our genetic screen for proteasome surveillance defective mutants isolated six independent <italic>ddi-1</italic> alleles, but as yet no alleles of any other genes that encode proteases. This argues that either DDI-1 is the only protease in the pathway, or that any other proteases function redundantly or have other essential functions.</p><p>Uncleaved SKN-1A localizes to the nucleus in <italic>ddi-1</italic> mutants, so cleavage of SKN-1A is not essential for its nuclear localization, and SKN-1A cleavage may occur either in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Given that GFP::DDI-1 is largely (but not exclusively) nuclear under conditions of proteasome disruption, we speculate that DDI-1 cleavage of SKN-1A is nuclear. In either case, unusually for a membrane-associated transcription factor, SKN-1A is released from the ER by a mechanism that does not require proteolytic cleavage. DDI-1-dependent cleavage therefore activates SKN-1A by some other mechanism(s) downstream of ER release. Cleavage of SKN-1A may be required to remove domains in the N-terminus that interfere with its normal function in the nucleus. For example, retention of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain may be disruptive once the protein has been extracted from the ER membrane.</p><p>Mutant SKN-1A lacking the transmembrane domain is not subject to proteasomal degradation, and is not cleaved by DDI-1. So, in addition to serving to link SKN-1A levels to proteasome function via ERAD, ER trafficking of SKN-1A is important for subsequent DDI-1-dependent activation. The bortezomib sensitivity of <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutants (or <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutants carrying the transmembrane domain-lacking transgene) is more severe than that of <italic>ddi-1</italic> and ERAD mutants, so ER-association must also promote SKN-1A activation by additional mechanisms. As well as proteasome disruption, <italic>skn-1</italic> is implicated in responses to several endocrine and environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackwell et al., 2015</xref>). Modifications such as glycosylation that SKN-1A acquires in the ER may tailor its activity to respond to proteasome dysfunction, identifying these modifications and how they are regulated will be of interest.</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddi1 contains an N-terminal UBL domain and a C-terminal UBA domain, This domain architecture is typical of extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptors, which play a role in recruiting ubiquinated proteins to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ddi1 binds to both ubiquitin and the proteasome, and participates in the degradation of some proteasome substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolaet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaplun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nowicka et al., 2015</xref>), and synthetic genetic interactions with extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptor and proteasome subunit mutants supports a role for Ddi1 in proteasome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Díaz-Martínez et al., 2006</xref>). Although the aspartic protease domain is highly conserved, DDI-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and related nematodes apparently lacks both UBL and UBA domains, and the UBA domain is not found in mammalian Ddi1 orthologues, so it remains unclear whether Ddi1 orthologues function as extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptors in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nowicka et al., 2015</xref>). The effect of <italic>ddi-1</italic> on development upon proteasome disruption by bortezomib is entirely dependent on <italic>skn-1a</italic>, indicating that DDI-1 promotes resistance to proteasome disruption via SKN-1A, rather than a general effect on proteasome function. Regardless, it will be of interest to determine whether DDI-1 binds to proteasomes and/or ubiquitin, and whether this affects its function in SKN-1A activation.</p><p>Activation of the mammalian SKN-1 homologue Nrf1 involves both deglycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, but the enzymes responsible are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, a large scale screen for gene inactivations that render cells more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors supports a model that human DDI1 protease also processes Nrf1: DDI2 (one of two human orthologues of DDI-1) and Nrf1 were highly ranked hits in this screen that identified hundreds of gene inactivations that increase sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that DDI2 is required to cleave and activate Nrf1 in human cells. The site at which Nrf1 is cleaved during proteasome dysfunction has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>), but the primary sequence of this site is not conserved in SKN-1A. Comparisons of SKN-1A with its nematode orthologues reveals conservation at positions consistent with the ~20 kD cleavage product we have observed (NL unpublished). It is possible that DDI-1 and its substrate(s) have divergently co-evolved in different lineages. Thus, we suggest that DDI-1 and SKN-1A are core components of a conserved mechanism of proteasome surveillance in animals.</p><p>Here we have shown that correct post-translational processing of SKN-1A is essential for development if proteasome function is disrupted.

Blocking the activation of proteasome subunit gene expression by Nrf1 has been proposed as a potential strategy to improve effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors in cancer treatment. The conserved SKN-1A/Nrf1 processing factors we have identified, particularly DDI-1, are ideal targets for such an approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> maintenance and genetics</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were maintained on standard media at 20°C and fed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50.

Do other stresses also regulate its movement?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Lehrbach and Ruvkun report the identification of <italic>C. elegans ddi-1</italic> as a gene that is required for the activation of proteasome gene transcription in response to chemical inhibition of the proteasome or knockdown of proteasome subunits. It was shown over 10 years ago that inhibition of the proteasome in mammalian cells results in transcriptional induction of genes that encode proteasome subunits. Six years ago, the Deshaies group showed that this induction requires Nrf1 in mouse cells, and this was followed by a report from the Kruger group that the Nrf1 ortholog TCF11 mediates the response in human cells. They also showed that TCF11 is a substrate for the ERAD pathway. More recently, the Deshaies group reported the surprising observation that most of Nrf1 enters the ER lumen during its biogenesis, but is quickly retrotranslocated to the cytosol in p97-dependent manner, where it is clipped on the C-terminal side of tryptophan-103. This retrotranslocation and clipping were shown to be essential for Nrf1 activation. However, the protease was not identified, although a subsequent report from Fred Goldberg's group claimed that Nrf1 processing is carried out by partially inhibited proteasomes.</p><p>Lehrbach and Ruvkun carried out a screen to identify genes required for activation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Nrf1, SKN-1A. They identify DDI-1, which is an aspartyl protease of largely unknown function, that in budding yeast doubles as a substrate receptor for the proteasome. They also identify ERAD genes including PNG-1, which is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the protein N-glycosidase enzyme NGLY1 that cleaves asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from retrotranslocated proteins. Overall, this is a compelling manuscript that makes an important finding that is likely to have broad ramifications not only for Nrf1 and protein homeostasis, but also for aging, neurodegeneration, and possibly cancer therapy. In my view, this manuscript should be an exceptionally high priority for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have several comments, which are all modest in nature:</p><p>1) At the outset of Results, it should be explained what <italic>pbs-5(mg502</italic>) is, and what is the rationale for its use. I had to do a google search to figure out it is a mutation in a 20S proteasome subunit.</p><p>2) What happens in a <italic>png-1</italic> ERAD double mutant in terms of growth in bortezomib? Is the enhanced proteasome sensitivity of png-1 compared to ERAD mutants due to accumulation of glycosylated ERAD substrates in cytosol, or are the ERAD mutants simply leaker? i.e. which phenotype is epistatic?</p><p>3) What happens in the intestine in <italic>skn1-a</italic>? It is stated in the manuscript that SKN-1C is expressed in the intestine. Does this provide SKN-1A function in the intestine?</p><p>4) The authors make the comment, &quot;We generated similar transgenes to express tagged full length and truncated SKN-1C, but did not observe any effect of proteasome disruption (data not shown).&quot; What exactly is meant by this? Was SKN-1C not expressed under either condition (-/+ proteasome inhibition), or was SKN-1C equally expressed under both conditions?</p><p>5) Can the authors please comment on whether the cleavage site reported by Radhakrishnan et al. is in a region that is conserved in SKN-1A? How does the cleavage site in the human protein relate to the N-terminus of the ∆TMD construct?</p><p>6) Some of the references are not complete. This includes Arribere, Ayyadevara, Blackwell, Dickinson, Paix, Radhakrishnan 2014 (why is M.S. Brown an author here?), Sha, Zhang 2013.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The transcription factor SKN-1/NRF1 is best known for its roles in oxidative and xenobiotic stress response pathways, but in recent years has become increasingly implicated in protein homeostasis. It responds to translational inhibition, upregulating the stress response, it controls proteasomal gene expression, upregulating target genes in response to proteasomal compromise. Finally it plays an important role in the ER stress response and autophagy regulation. However, the pathways governing these regulatory networks and their potential interconnections are not well understood.</p><p>In this work, Ruvkun and co-workers perform genetic screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for loci required for the SKN-1 regulatory response to proteasome inhibition. Interestingly, they identify a number of genes involved in ER associated degradation (<italic>sel-1, sel-11, sel-9, png-1</italic>), as well as the aspartyl protease ddi-1. They further show that an ER localized isoform of SKN-1a/NRF-1 translocates to the nucleus upon proteasome knockdown, where it upregulates its targets. ERAD knockdown also facilitate SKN-1a stabilization, although without nuclear localization, suggesting that ERAD components control SKN-1 availability from the ER.</p><p>The authors focus predominately on characterizing DDI-1, a conserved aspartyl protease whose function is poorly understood. They find that DDI-1 is induced upon proteasomal dysfunction in a SKN-1 dependent manner, and localizes largely to the nucleus. They find that DDI-1 plays a role in proteolytic processing of SKN-1A, which is likely important for its activity.</p><p>This is an excellent study that uses the power of genetics to unravel a very topical area, how proteasomal status regulates NRF activity and proteasome surveillance. This work gives key insight into how this might occur via ERAD and proteolytic regulation, providing a plausible link of NRF1 activation with the ER stress response and ERAD. The authors focus on the role of DDI-1 predominately because it is not well studied, thereby lending new insight. Among other things, this study raises the question of how mechanistically ERAD mobilizes SKN-1A from the ER, but perhaps this would be the subject of a whole other study.</p><p>I only have a few concerns/questions:</p><p>Major: The major question is to what extent does proteasome inhibition link to canonical ERAD signaling?</p><p>1) Do other ERAD components, such as CDC-48, play any role in SKN-1 dependent proteasomal activation?</p><p>2) Does proteasome compromise trigger the ER stress response, (and thereby SKN-1a activation? i.e. does proteasome knockdown induce UPR or ERAD?</p><p>3) Does ddi-1 loss block all transcriptional SKN-1a activity or only targets linked to ERAD and proteasome perturbation?</p><p>4) Does ddi-1 play any role in ERAD? Is it required to degrade an ERAD substrate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17721.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>In this body of work Ruvkun and colleagues begin to query proteasome regulation using elegant genetics and the nematode C. elegans.

Is the enhanced proteasome sensitivity of png-1 compared to ERAD mutants due to accumulation of glycosylated ERAD substrates in cytosol, or are the ERAD mutants simply leaker? i.e. which phenotype is epistatic?</italic> </p><p>This is an important question, but we think one best left as part of a future study that more fully addresses the role of ERAD and PNG-1 in SKN-1A activation. (Aside – we have only done the experiment once, and replicates will be needed to confirm, but it appears that the <italic>png-1</italic> phenotype is epistatic in <italic>png-1; sel-1</italic> double mutants. i.e. the sensitivity of the <italic>png-1</italic> mutant is probably not due to accumulation of glycosylated ERAD substrates in the cytoplasm.)</p><p> <italic>3) What happens in the intestine in skn1-a? It is stated in the manuscript that SKN-1C is expressed in the intestine. Does this provide SKN-1A function in the intestine?</italic> </p><p>Our experiments with <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic> suggest that in the context of proteasome dysfunction caused by RNAi or bortezomib treatment, SKN-1B and SKN-1C do not provide function. In <italic>skn-1a</italic> mutant animals we have not observed activation of <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic> in any tissue, including the intestine, where skn-1C is expressed. We have added a sentence to the results to emphasize this point. One interpretation of our data may be that SKN-1A and SKN-1C (even though they have the same DNA binding domain) are regulated by distinct mechanisms. Indeed, as SKN-1A is the only SKN-1 isoform with a transmembrane domain it is unlikely that ERAD and DDI-1 play a role in SKN-1C activation. This may be analogous to the different mechanisms regulating Nrf1 and Nrf2 in mammals. A full answer to this question will require a deeper understanding of the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms that govern activation of SKN-1A and SKN-1C.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors make the comment, &quot;We generated similar transgenes to express tagged full length and truncated SKN-1C, but did not observe any effect of proteasome disruption (data not shown).&quot; What exactly is meant by this? Was SKN-1C not expressed under either condition (-/+ proteasome inhibition), or was SKN-1C equally expressed under both conditions?</italic> </p><p>SKN-1C::GFP expression was not detectable under either condition. We admit that this negative result in itself is somewhat weak, but we think it is important when taken together with the genetic requirement/sufficiency of <italic>skn-1a</italic>. We favor keeping this sentence in the manuscript – this result (and the existence of the <italic>skn-1c::gfp</italic> transgenes) should be of interest to SKN-1 aficionados.</p><p> <italic>5) Can the authors please comment on whether the cleavage site reported by Radhakrishnan et al. is in a region that is conserved in SKN-1A? How does the cleavage site in the human protein relate to the N-terminus of the ∆TMD construct?</italic> </p><p>The sequence conservation between SKN-1A and Nrf1 is restricted to the DNA binding domain near the C-terminus of the protein; the primary sequence of the cleavage site (AAs 99-108 of Nrf1) does not appear to be conserved. Even within nematodes, the N-terminus of SKN-1A is not highly conserved – although there are two relatively well conserved stretches at AA 122-135 and AA 155-167.</p><p>The size (~20kD) of the N-terminal HA::SKN-1A fragment that is present in wild type animals treated with bortezomib, suggests that the cleavage site is somewhere in the vicinity of AAs 140-180 of SKN-1A. This putative cleavage site is some distance from the TMD at AAs 39-59, so we think that the failure to cleave ∆TMD SKN-1A is not a consequence of disrupting the cleavage site. We are working to map the cleavage site using HA::SKN-1A::GFP transgenes with small deletions within AAs 130-180. Future analysis of cleavage-resistant SKN-1A mutants will be needed to clarify the relationship between ER-trafficking and cleavage, and whether there are conserved features between the Nrf1 and SKN-1A cleavage sites.</p><p>We have added sentences to the discussion to point out the lack of conservation of the Nrf1 cleavage site and the presence of potential conserved SKN-1A cleavage site(s) in nematode Nrf1/SKN-1A orthologues.</p><p> <italic>6) Some of the references are not complete. This includes Arribere, Ayyadevara, Blackwell, Dickinson, Paix, Radhakrishnan 2014 (why is M.S. Brown an author here?), Sha, Zhang 2013.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected the mistakes in the references.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] I only have a few concerns/questions:</italic></p><p> <italic>Major: The major question is to what extent does proteasome inhibition link to canonical ERAD signaling?</italic> </p><p>This is an important question, but considerable work will be required to tease out the interaction between SKN-1A, ERAD, the UPR and possibly other stress response pathways. We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion above that this would be best addressed by a separate study.</p><p> <italic>1) Do other ERAD components, such as CDC-48, play any role in SKN-1 dependent proteasomal activation?</italic> </p><p>Yes, but it’s complicated. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two near-identical genes encoding CDC-48 (<italic>cdc-48.1</italic> and <italic>cdc-48.2</italic>) which appear to be redundant – this might explain why no <italic>cdc-48</italic> alleles were isolated in our mutagenesis screen. RNAi of either gene apparently silences both paralogs and is lethal. <italic>cdc-48.1/2</italic> RNAi of wild type animals causes mild activation of <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic>, and <italic>cdc-48</italic> RNAi of <italic>pbs-5(nic67)</italic> mutants causes a mild reduction in <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic> expression. RNAi-mediated silencing of the <italic>cdc-48</italic> cofactors <italic>ufd-1</italic> or <italic>npl-4</italic> each cause activation of <italic>rpt-3::gfp</italic> in wild type animals. Overall these data suggest that the CDC-48/UFD-1/NPL-4 complex may play a role as both a positive and negative regulator of SKN-1A, and more work will be needed to clarify its role.</p><p> <italic>2) Does proteasome compromise trigger the ER stress response, (and thereby SKN-1a activation? i.e. does proteasome knockdown induce UPR or ERAD?</italic> </p><p>There is evidence that the UPR is activated by proteasome dysfunction in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; e.g. Proteasome RNAi induces expression of <italic>hsp-4::gfp</italic>, a UPR reporter that is regulated by XBP-1. Since the UPR is thought to regulate ERAD, it is reasonable to suspect that the UPR could influence, at least under some circumstances, the activation of SKN-1A. We think testing this is beyond the scope of this study but would be worth doing in future.</p><p> <italic>3) Does ddi-1 loss block all transcriptional SKN-1a activity or only targets linked to ERAD and proteasome perturbation?</italic> </p><p>We do not know yet. We plan to perform RNAseq and SKN-1A ChIP experiments to examine this.</p><p> <italic>4) Does ddi-1 play any role in ERAD? Is it required to degrade an ERAD substrate?</italic> </p><p>Constitutive degradation of SKN-1A requires the ERAD factors SEL-1 and SEL-11, but does not require DDI-1, so this is at least one ERAD substrate that is still degraded in <italic>ddi-1</italic> mutants. Relatively little is known about endogenous ERAD substrates in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, so time-consuming experiments to find and characterize such ERAD substrates would be required to address this question further.</p><p>Related to both this point and point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) above, it would be interesting to determine which (if any) extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptors participate in ERAD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and whether these affect SKN-1A degradation or activation. Again, this is best the focus for a future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
