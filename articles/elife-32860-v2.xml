pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32860.001</object-id><p>Angiogenesis is coordinated by VEGF and Notch signaling. DLL4-induced Notch signaling inhibits tip cell formation and vessel branching. To ensure proper Notch signaling, receptors and ligands are clustered at adherens junctions. However, little is known about factors that control Notch activity by influencing the cellular localization of Notch ligands. Here, we show that the multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ) enhances Notch signaling activity. MPDZ physically interacts with the intracellular carboxyterminus of DLL1 and DLL4 and enables their interaction with the adherens junction protein Nectin-2. Inactivation of the MPDZ gene leads to impaired Notch signaling activity and increased blood vessel sprouting in cellular models and the embryonic mouse hindbrain. Tumor angiogenesis was enhanced upon endothelial-specific inactivation of MPDZ leading to an excessively branched and poorly functional vessel network resulting in tumor hypoxia. As such, we identified MPDZ as a novel modulator of Notch signaling by controlling ligand recruitment to adherens junctions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32860.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels transport oxygen and nutrients to all our organs and also remove waste products. New blood vessels form – in a process called angiogenesis – when a tissue is not receiving enough oxygen. This happens during normal development and wound healing, but also during tumor growth. Cells at the tip of a branching blood vessel sense when a tissue lacks oxygen and use proteins on their cell surfaces to help new vessels to grow.</p><p>During this process, the tip cells of an existing vessel relay the signal from the tissue to other cells ‘behind’ them, in the so-called stalk of the vessel. It is known that tip- and stalk cells communicate by using specific proteins at their interfaces. The tip cells activate proteins called Notch ligands, such as DLL4, while stalk cells express the Notch receptor. During a process called Notch signaling, the ligands bind to the receptor, which becomes active and helps to control angiogenesis. It also hinders excessive vessel branching and so prevents the blood vessels from becoming leaky and inefficient. However, it was not known exactly how Notch ligands interact with their receptors on neighboring cells, and Notch signaling is regulated.</p><p>Here, Tetzlaff et al. sought to answer these questions by using blood vessel cells from the human umbilical cord grown in the laboratory and blood vessel cells in mice. The results showed that the proteins DLL1 and DLL4 interacted with a protein called MPDZ. This interaction stabilized the DLL proteins at the cell membrane, which increased the Notch-signaling activity.</p><p>When Tetzlaff et al. experimentally reduced the amount of MPDZ in the laboratory-grown cells, the Notch signaling decreased. Furthermore, the cells with less MPDZ formed more branching structures. And when MPDZ was genetically removed in mice, the embryos had more branched blood vessels in their developing brains. Lastly, when mice without MPDZ were transplanted with tumor cells, the tumors contained more, but leakier, blood vessels and were not supplied with enough oxygen.</p><p>This suggests that MPDZ is an important factor that helps to regulate angiogenesis by enhancing Notch signaling between tip and branch cells in a new blood vessel. The increased activity of the Notch limits new blood vessels from branching too much. A better understanding of how blood vessels form or become leaky may help to find ways to prevent tumors from growing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>MPDZ</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB-TR23 (A7)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum and the Israeli Ministry of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cooperation Program in Cancer Research CA156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tetzlaff</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name><name><surname>Menuchin</surname><given-names>Amitai</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprinzak</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The multiple PDZ domain protein recruits Notch ligands to Nectin-2, which increases Notch signaling activity during angiogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from pre-existing ones is essential for embryonic development, tissue growth, wound healing, and regeneration. However, angiogenesis also substantially contributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases, most notably tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Potente et al., 2011</xref>). Angiogenesis is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which activates quiescent endothelial cells (EC). These cells subsequently degrade the extracellular matrix and migrate toward the VEGF gradient. A new vessel sprout is guided by the tip cell, which expresses high amounts of VEGF receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siekmann et al., 2013</xref>). VEGF signaling induces the expression of the Notch Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) on activated ECs. This transmembrane protein activates Notch receptors on adjacent cells, which adopt the stalk cell phenotype and form the new vessel lumen.</p><p>Notch signaling requires ligand binding in trans that triggers Notch receptor cleavage to release the intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. Prototypical Notch target genes are the HES and HEY transcriptional repressors. These inhibit VEGF receptor expression which limits responsiveness to VEGF, tip cell formation and vessel branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of DLL4/Notch signaling is a powerful tool to interfere with angiogenesis as it results in the formation of excessive tip cell numbers and vessel branches. This chaotic vessel network precludes proper blood perfusion leading to severe tumor hypoxia. Interestingly, inactivation of the Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) results in a reduced sprouting angiogenesis, indicating that JAG1 and DLL4 have opposing roles during blood vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kangsamaksin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kofler et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It remains poorly understood which factors modulate and control Notch activity during angiogenesis. To become fully competent for Notch receptor activation, Notch ligands need to gain several posttranslational modifications, for example ubiquitinylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Souza et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, Notch ligands need to be presented on the cell surface at an area, that is likely to be in contact with Notch receptors on adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaya et al., 2017</xref>). Delta-like and Jagged proteins contain different PDZ binding motifs at their intracellular carboxyterminus, which enable binding to certain PDZ domain containing proteins. There are some indications that binding of Notch ligands to PDZ domain proteins, for example DLL1 to MAGI1 and SYN2BP as well as JAG1 to AF6 control their cellular localization or their protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mizuhara et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, these proteins are associated with either adherens or tight junctions. Notch receptors are also localized at adherens junctions in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchuluun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benhra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, clustering ligands and receptors at cellular junctions might increase the rate of physical binding events and subsequent Notch signaling activity.</p><p>In yeast, two-hybrid screening approaches the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4, but not JAG1, interacted with the multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ) also known as MUPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estrach et al., 2007</xref>). Also a synthetic DLL1 peptide containing the 27 carboxyterminal amino acids interacted with PDZ proteins including MPDZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2004</xref>). However, this interaction had not yet been confirmed by independent methods and any potential functional consequences are elusive. MPDZ contains 13 PDZ domains and a single L27 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ullmer et al., 1998</xref>). It lacks an intrinsic catalytic function, and it is assumed that its function is to cluster proteins at the cell membrane or at adherens and tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>). Such clustering of proteins was shown to affect the strength of melatonin or the AMPA transmembrane receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillaume et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krapivinsky et al., 2004</xref>). As Notch receptor expression is often enriched at cellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchuluun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benhra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>), we analyzed how the protein interaction of MPDZ with the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4 affects Notch signaling during angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MPDZ physically interacts with the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4 and promotes Notch signaling</title><p>MPDZ has been identified in screening approaches as a putative binding partner of the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estrach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2004</xref>).

Full-length DLL1 and DLL4 or mutants thereof lacking the carboxyterminal PDZ-binding site (amino acids IATEV) were co-expressed with MPDZ fused with an amino-terminal fluorescent Citrine. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that MPDZ associated with DLL1 and DLL4 proteins. However, DLL1 or DLL4 lacking their PDZ-binding site did not interact with MPDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), indicating that the carboxyterminus of Delta-like ligands binds to MPDZ.

The activation of Notch receptors depends on physical contact with Notch ligands expressed on the adjacent cell. This study describes a novel mechanism that improves presentation of Delta-like ligands on the cell surface. MPDZ could be identified as a protein that mediates intracellular protein interactions with DLL1, DLL4 and Nectin-2 to facilitate presentation of DLL1 and DLL4 at the EC surface and to strengthen Notch signaling activity.</p><p>Upon posttranslational modifications, Notch ligands are transported to the plasma membrane. It is not yet clear how Notch ligands are recruited to the plasma membrane or to cellular junctions. Previous studies have shown that PDZ domain proteins interact with Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mizuhara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfister et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Six et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2004</xref>). However, the functional consequences of these are mostly elusive. The interaction of DLL1 with SYNJ2BP acts via a different mechanism on Notch signaling strength. SYNJ2BP prevents lysosomal degradation of DLL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>). The interaction with MPDZ however promotes cell surface presentation. Based on this, one can assume that changes in expression levels of Notch ligand-interacting PDZ proteins influence strongly the behavior of Notch ligands.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that MPDZ interacts with Delta-like ligands and the transmembrane protein Nectin-2, a component of adherens junctions. This is interesting as also Notch receptors can be enriched at adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batchuluun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benhra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatakeyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2007</xref>) to facilitate the physical interactions with ligands.

Whereas forced <italic>MPDZ</italic> expression enhanced Notch target gene expression, inactivation of the <italic>MPDZ</italic> gene resulted in a lower Notch target gene expression which might be due to the reduced DLL1 and DLL4 localization at the cell surface.</p><p>The reduction of endothelial Notch signaling activity in <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>ΔEC</sup> mice was only moderate. One possible explanation is the redundancy between PDZ proteins that bind the same motif. For example, MPDZ shares large structural homology with the INADL protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>) and the Notch ligands can be bound also by several other PDZ domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estrach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfister et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Six et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wright et al., 2004</xref>). As such it is not surprising that <italic>Mpdz-</italic>deficient mice did not exhibit major angiogenesis defects, which would cause embryonic lethality. The vascular phenotype is similar to <italic>Notch1</italic> heterozygous mice. These mutants develop normally and show only slight vascular abnormalities (higher microvessel density and vessel branching) during phases of rapid vessel growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huppert et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacological Notch inhibition also leads to excessive tumor vessel sprouting and the formation of a poorly functional vessel network due to too many branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funahashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noguera-Troise et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ridgway et al., 2006</xref>). This is in particular achieved by DLL4-specific, but not JAG1-specific inhibition of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kangsamaksin et al., 2015</xref>). We could also observe an increased tumor vessel sprouting in mice lacking <italic>Mpdz</italic> expression in the endothelium. Tumor vessel density was significantly increased, tumor perfusion impaired and this led to larger hypoxic tumor areas. Again, similar as after DLL4 blockade, vessel coverage with mural cells was not altered in tumors grown in <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>ΔEC</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funahashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kangsamaksin et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, this work shows that MPDZ is a novel modulator of DLL4-induced Notch signaling in the vasculature by recruiting DLL1 and DLL4 to Nectin-2 on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Elisabetta Dejana, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lena Claesson-Welsh. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see from their comments both reviewers liked your work and acknowledge the novelty and the relevance of your observations. However, both reviewers ask for some additional experimental data that, to our view, would strongly improve the quality and the strength of the paper. After discussion among the reviewers, we ask you to consider the specific recommendation #1 of reviewer 1 and #4 of reviewer 2 as essential. We ask you to consider the other remarks but view them as advisory rather than essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors present novel data on the Notch signaling system and cell-to-cell junctions. In particular, they found that MPDZ (multiple PDZ protein) associates to Dll1 and Dll4 promoting their interaction with Nectin-2 and modulating signaling. Although of interest, the paper presents some weak experimental aspects that do not fully support the conclusions.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>1) The authors should show immunofluorescence junctional staining of endothelial cells with Dll1 and Dll4 in the presence or absence of MPDZ and in the presence or absence of Nectin-2, in sparse and confluent conditions. This is required to support immuno- precipitation data and to exclude any possible in vitro association of MPDZ, nectin and Dll1 and 4.</p><p>These experiments would be even more convincing by performing the analysis of junction organization and composition in vivo in MPDZ ECKO mice.</p><p>2) The results presented do not exclude that Nectin-2 could associate to Dll4 also in absence of MPDZ (see Figure 3E using 293 T cells). The amount of DLL4 co-immunoprecipitated with Nectin-2 in absence of MPDZ is lower but still easily detectable.</p><p>3) Along the paper the authors use a quite large spectrum of different cell lines (HEK293T, HUVEC, cardiac and lung EC). It is conceivable that each cell line may express other proteins able to modulate Notch signaling. I fully understand the difficulties in transfecting different types of endothelial cells but, for sake of clarity, I would make an effort to maintain the same endothelial cell line along the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Tetzlaff et al., follows up on a yeast-two hybrid screen for Dll interacting proteins in which the authors identified the multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ). They now verify this interaction in cell models and show that MPDZ gain-/loss of function leads to increased/decreased expression of HEY2 and HES1 indicating that MPDZ modulates Notch signalling activity. At least in part, this effect is exerted by regulation of the subcellular localization of Dll ligands as their complex formation with the adherens junction protein Nectin-2 is dependent on MPDZ. The authors probe for the effect of MPDZ on vessel formation using in vitro (sprouting collagen assay), ex vivo (aortic rings with and without siRNA silencing) and in vivo models, developmental (hindbrain) as well as pathological (cancer). The data are neatly presented, well controlled and of interest to the vascular biology field.</p><p>1) In a yeast-two hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the intracellular domains of Dll ligands, the authors previously identified SYNJ2BP and MUPP1/MPDZ. Forced lentiviral SYNJ2BP expression led to increased transcription of the HEY1 and LFNG, indicating increased Notch activity (Adam et al., Circ Res 2013) similar to the data in this study for MPDZ. What is the relationship between SYNJ2BP and MPDZ? Are they part of the same multiprotein complex? Do they compete for binding to Dll ligands? Which other proteins does MPDZ interact with in endothelial cells? It is likely that such multiprotein complexes are established at junctions and it is important to address these complexes in a comprehensive manner to understand their biology.</p><p>2) MPDZ has been described as a tight junction component in epithelial cells and as a Claudin-5 partner in Schwann cells, alternatively, as a gap junction protein. Please show the expression pattern of MPDZ in endothelial cells. Which types of vessels express MPDZ (arteries, veins, capillaries) and what is its subcellular localization?</p><p>3) Does MPDZ interact with Dll ligands in vivo? Can the authors use e.g. tumor lysates to ip for one and blot or do mass spectrometry to detect the other component?</p><p>4) The authors show that loss of MPDZ expression in endothelial cells leads to an increase in sprouting angiogenesis ex vivo (aortic rings, Figure 4) and during development (hindbrain angiogenesis, Figure 5). In cancer, the microvessel density is increased in the absence of MPDZ (Figure 6). Loss of MPDZ leads to higher Notch signalling and therefore increased angiogenesis which very nicely explains the findings in Figures 4-6. However, in none of these data sets are we informed about the morphology of the vasculature in the <italic>Mpdz</italic>-deficient condition compared to wt. Are MPDZ expressing ECs preferentially found at the tip cell position? Are the MPDZ LOF ECs tip cells? The tumors lacking MPDZ do not grow bigger but has a substantial hypoxic zone that is lacking in the wild type condition. Are the abundant vessels formed due to MPDZ-deficiency not functional? What is the phenotype of the tumor vasculature in Figure 6?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32860.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper the authors present novel data on the Notch signaling system and cell-to-cell junctions.

This is required to support immuno- precipitation data and to exclude any possible in vitro association of MPDZ, nectin and Dll1 and 4.</p><p>These experiments would be even more convincing by performing the analysis of junction organization and composition in vivo in MPDZ ECKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point in several ways. First, we silenced MPDZ in HUVEC with lentiviral shRNA expression constructs and cultured the cells under sparse and confluent conditions. Cells were stained to detect DLL1, DLL4 and Nectin-2. Further staining against MPDZ was not possible, as this requires fixation in methanol whereas the other antibodies require PFA fixation. Only GFP positive cells were analyzed (indicating that they are expressing the transduced construct). Staining analysis revealed that the knock-down of MPDZ (verified by qPCR, WB and by the fact that lentiviral transduced cells express GFP) resulted in lesser co-localization of Nectin-2 with DLL1 or DLL4 (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Under confluent conditions, in particular the co-localization at the cell membrane was disturbed upon MPDZ silencing.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the localisation of Nectin-2 and DLL1/4 in HUVEC. Since Nectin-2 was transiently knocked-down, analysis under fully confluent conditions was not possible. We detected co-localization at the cell membrane. Silencing of Nectin-2 revealed that DLL1 and DLL4 were still at the same localization (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2). As such, MPDZ promotes the co-localization of DLL1/4 with Nectin-2, whereas Nectin-2 is not absolutely required for cell surface presentation of Notch ligands.</p><p>Secondly, we analyzed the junctional organization in retinal vessels of <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (see new Figure 4) as well as in cryosections of brain derived from <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>∆EC</sup> and <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This revealed that loss of <italic>Mpdz</italic> does not affect the overall junctional organization and composition, what is not surprising as the mice are viable and do not show signs of edema. These data are also in line with our previous publication (Feldner et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results presented do not exclude that Nectin-2 could associate to Dll4 also in absence of MPDZ (see Figure 3E using 293 T cells). The amount of DLL4 co-immunoprecipitated with Nectin-2 in absence of MPDZ is lower but still easily detectable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. However, this is difficult to address as the function of MPDZ can be compensated by INADL which shows high homology with MPDZ and which most likely interacts with the same proteins. For instance it has been shown that INADL also binds to Nectin-2 (Adachi et al., 2009). As such it might be possible that INADL compensates the loss of MPDZ. To investigate this in detail, we are currently generating <italic>Mpdz</italic> and <italic>Inadl</italic> double knock-out mice. Detailed analysis will be time consuming and goes beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along the paper the authors use a quite large spectrum of different cell lines (HEK293T, HUVEC, cardiac and lung EC). It is conceivable that each cell line may express other proteins able to modulate Notch signaling. I fully understand the difficulties in transfecting different types of endothelial cells but, for sake of clarity, I would make an effort to maintain the same endothelial cell line along the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that it would be ideal to perform all experiments in a single cell line. Therefore, we used HUVEC cells for almost all in vitro experiments. Only for biochemical studies we used HEK293T cells, since expression of cDNA constructs is more efficient. Nevertheless we wanted to confirm critical data also in ex vivo settings. Therefore we isolated also cardiac or lung EC from the KO mice. Here the isolation of two different EC types had at least the advantage of being able to perform mRNA expression (cardiac EC) together with protein expression (lung EC) in the same animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) In a yeast-two hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the intracellular domains of Dll ligands, the authors previously identified SYNJ2BP and MUPP1/MPDZ. Forced lentiviral SYNJ2BP expression led to increased transcription of the HEY1 and LFNG, indicating increased Notch activity (Adam et al., Circ Res 2013) similar to the data in this study for MPDZ. What is the relationship between SYNJ2BP and MPDZ? Are they part of the same multiprotein complex? Do they compete for binding to Dll ligands? Which other proteins does MPDZ interact with in endothelial cells? It is likely that such multiprotein complexes are established at junctions and it is important to address these complexes in a comprehensive manner to understand their biology.</p></disp-quote><p>SYNJ2BP as well as MPDZ are PDZ-domain proteins which bind to DLL1 and DLL4 via their PDZ-binding site. To investigate whether MPDZ and SYNJ2BP compete for binding to the Notch ligands, we performed a Co-IP study with HEK293T control and <italic>MPDZ</italic>-silenced HEK293T cells (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). DLL1 or DLL4 and SYNJ2BP were over-expressed and the Notch ligands were immunoprecipitated. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the absence of MPDZ does not affect the interaction of SYNJ2BP with the Notch ligands. Hence, we concluded that MPDZ and SYNJ2BP do not compete for binding to the Notch ligands. We fully agree with the reviewer that there will be most likely competition of PDZ proteins for binding to DLL ligands. However, at the moment we do not have the tools to study this in detail. We had reported before that SYNJ2BP prevents DLL1 lysosomal degradation. Here we propose that MPDZ promotes its localization at the cell membrane. Therefore it could indeed be that these binding proteins act at different subcellular localization. Unfortunately, the quality of the antibodies preclude any further investigation at this stage.</p><p>To address the question which proteins are also interacting with MPDZ in endothelial cells, we performed a mass spectrometry screen. MPDZ was immunoprecipitated in HUVEC lysates and the washed precipitate was analyzed by mass spectrometry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). With this method we could show that the antibody indeed binds MPDZ and that we can verify the interaction with MPP5 (String database). However, in this screening approach we could not detect any of the known interactions with transmembrane proteins (e.g. Claudin-5, JAM-A or DLL4). The method of cell lysis or the composition of the precipitation buffer might be responsible for this. Therefore we suggest not to put this data set into the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32860.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32860-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) MPDZ has been described as a tight junction component in epithelial cells and as a Claudin-5 partner in Schwann cells, alternatively, as a gap junction protein. Please show the expression pattern of MPDZ in endothelial cells. Which types of vessels express MPDZ (arteries, veins, capillaries) and what is its subcellular localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We could show that MPDZ is expressed in endothelial cells derived from veins, arteries and microvessels (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We studied the subcellular localization in freshly isolated venous and arterial ECs (cell passage 0). This demonstrated that MPDZ is mainly expressed at the cell membrane but can be also found in the cytoplasm. In microvessel ECs we could not analyze the subcellular localization, since we had to use a commercial available cell line at a higher cell passage number (cell passage 4). Our previous experiments have clearly shown that MPDZ can only be detected robustly at the cell membrane in freshly isolated ECs (cell passage 0), ideally under confluent conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does MPDZ interact with Dll ligands in vivo? Can the authors use e.g. tumor lysates to ip for one and blot or do mass spectrometry to detect the other component?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question we prepared total protein lysates from kidneys, which express high amounts of MPDZ, which is required for barrier integrity under high osmotic stress (Lanaspa et al., 2007). We immunoprecipitated DLL1 and DLL4 and immunoblotted for MPDZ. This revealed that MPDZ also interacted with DLL1 and DLL4 in this mouse tissue (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors show that loss of MPDZ expression in endothelial cells leads to an increase in sprouting angiogenesis ex vivo (aortic rings, Figure 4) and during development (hindbrain angiogenesis, Figure 5). In cancer, the microvessel density is increased in the absence of MPDZ (Figure 6). Loss of MPDZ leads to higher Notch signalling and therefore increased angiogenesis which very nicely explains the findings in Figures 4-6. However, in none of these data sets are we informed about the morphology of the vasculature in the Mpdz-deficient condition compared to wt. Are MPDZ expressing ECs preferentially found at the tip cell position? Are the MPDZ LOF ECs tip cells? The tumors lacking MPDZ do not grow bigger but has a substantial hypoxic zone that is lacking in the wild type condition. Are the abundant vessels formed due to MPDZ-deficiency not functional? What is the phenotype of the tumor vasculature in Figure 6?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question whether MPDZ expressing cells prefer the tip or stalk cell position, we performed an in vitro tip-stalk-cell sprouting assay (new Figure 5C). <italic>MPDZ</italic>-deficient endothelial cells preferred the tip cell position whereas <italic>MPDZ</italic>-expressing cells adopted the stalk cell phenotype. This result is in accordance with a recent paper by the Adams laboratory showing that cells with high Notch signaling activity preferentially adopt the stalk cell phenotype (Pitulescu et al., 2017).</p><p>To further investigate the functionality of the tumor vessels, we repeated the tumor experiments and injected Hoechst 33342 and FITC-Lectin into the tail vein 5 min prior to sacrifice. Tumors were stained for CD31 and vessel perfusion and Hoechst extravasation was analyzed (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The experiments in the wildtype control animals revealed that LLC tumors were better perfused than B16F10 tumors. In LLC tumors almost all of the CD31+ vessels were also Lectin positive. This was also the case in <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>∆EC</sup> mice. However the rate of Hoechst dye penetration into the tumor mass was significantly reduced in <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>∆EC</sup> mice compared to <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> control littermates. In B16F10 melanoma the Hoechst staining was very weak, which precluded further analysis. However, analysis of the Lectin-positive vessels revealed lower rates in <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>∆EC</sup> mice compared to <italic>Mpdz</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> littermates.</p><p>References:</p><p>Lanaspa, MA, Almeida, NE, Andres-Hernando, A, Rivard, CJ, Capasso, JM, and Berl, T.
