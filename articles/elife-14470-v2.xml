Our current understanding of the role of PROP1 in the pituitary gland is limited to the repression and activation of the pituitary transcription factor genes <italic>Hesx1</italic> and <italic>Pou1f1,</italic> respectively. To elucidate the comprehensive PROP1-dependent gene regulatory network, we conducted genome-wide analysis of PROP1 DNA binding and effects on gene expression in mutant mice, mouse isolated stem cells and engineered mouse cell lines. We determined that PROP1 is essential for stimulating stem cells to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like process necessary for cell migration and differentiation. Genomic profiling reveals that PROP1 binds to genes expressed in epithelial cells like C<italic>laudin 23,</italic> and to EMT inducer genes like <italic>Zeb2, Notch2</italic> and <italic>Gli2.

There is a strong incentive for developing a pituitary stem cell therapy that could repopulate the pituitary hormone producing cells that are missing in patients with hypopituitarism. A comprehensive knowledge of pituitary stem cell differentiation is therefore relevant from a basic and medical research perspective.</p><p>Normal pituitary gland development involves invagination of oral ectoderm to create Rathke’s pouch and evagination of the overlying neural ectoderm, which contains the FGF and BMP signaling center that stimulates pituitary growth. The stem cells in Rathke’s pouch express SOX2, and as they transition to differentiation, they delaminate from the ventral aspect of the cleft, migrate ventrally and rostrally, and become the glandular parenchyma of the anterior lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Lavandeira et al., 2009</xref>). Notch signaling is required to prevent premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raetzman et al., 2004</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms for stimulating progenitors to migrate and differentiate are unknown; and these processes are of central importance for understanding pituitary organogenesis and the pathophysiology of congenital pituitary hormone deficiency.</p><p>Mutations in several genes are known to cause hypopituitarism in children, and the pituitary transcription factors <italic>HESX1, PROP1</italic> and <italic>POU1F1 (PIT1</italic>) are among them. <italic>PROP1</italic> is the most commonly mutated gene, and it is the first pituitary-specific gene in the transcriptional hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deladoëy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böttner et al., 2004</xref>). PROP1 activity is modulated by WNT signaling, enabling it to suppress <italic>Hesx1</italic> and activate <italic>Pou1f1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olson et al., 2006</xref>). Despite its central role in pituitary organogenesis and important clinical significance, no comprehensive analysis of PROP1 function has been undertaken.</p><p>We hypothesized that PROP1 has a role in stem cell regulation because of the dysmorphic stem cell niche and cell migration defect in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant mice, and because humans with <italic>PROP1</italic> mutations tend to have progressive hormone deficiency, which could be attributable to exhausting stem cell pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böttner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). To test this idea, we used RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq to identify novel targets and functions of PROP1. This led to the discovery that PROP1 has a key role in stimulating progenitors to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition (EMT) prior to differentiation. PROP1 binds to promoters and enhancers of genes with demonstrated roles in EMT during development of other organs, including <italic>Notch2, Zeb2</italic> and <italic>Gli2. Zeb2</italic> expression appears to be a pivotal step in the EMT process. In addition, we show that PROP1 has an indirect role in regulating <italic>Sox2</italic> expression and stem cell proliferation. This in-depth molecular analysis of PROP1 action advances our fundamental understanding of pituitary organogenesis and the pathophysiology of hypopituitarism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PROP1 is transiently co-expressed with stem cell marker SOX2</title><p>PROP1 is the earliest known exclusive marker of pituitary identity, and it is detectable at embryonic day 11.5 (e11.5) in the mouse and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sornson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic tracing experiments revealed that <italic>Sox2</italic>-expressing cells in the embryonic pituitary give rise to <italic>Sox2-</italic>expressing cells postnatally and to all the hormone-producing cell types of the anterior pituitary gland, demonstrating that SOX2-positive cells are the pituitary stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>). We recently demonstrated that all the hormone-producing cells of the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland pass through a <italic>Prop1</italic> expressing intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2016</xref>). Pituitary stem cells are reported to express PROP1 and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Lavandeira et al., 2009</xref>), but the overlap in expression of these genes during mouse embryogenesis has not been analyzed. PROP1-expressing cells are largely co-incident with SOX2 expressing progenitors at e12.5, although SOX2-positive cells extend over a larger area of Rathke’s pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). Later in development, at e14.5, PROP1 expression is decreased, particularly in the dorsal region of Rathke’s pouch, where the highly proliferative SOX2-positive cells still predominate. At this time, <italic>Prop1-</italic>expressing cells are predominately located in the transitional zone, where cells are migrating ventrally to populate the anterior lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suh et al., 2002</xref>). One of the known functions of PROP1 is to activate expression of another pituitary-specific transcription factor, POU1F1. Little or no co-localization of POU1F1 and SOX2 is observed in the cell nuclei, either during development or after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). The consistently mutually exclusive expression of SOX2 and POU1F1 supports the idea that POU1F1 regulates a later stage of differentiation, and it suggests that any effect of POU1F1 on pituitary stem cells would be indirect. Thus, PROP1, but not POU1F1, is initially expressed in SOX2 expressing stem cells in the embryonic pituitary, and the co-localization of PROP1 and SOX2 is transient, ceasing as cells migrate and transition to differentiation.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14470.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PROP1 is expressed in pituitary stem cells and is necessary for cell cycle regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left Panel: Double immunofluorescence reveals co-staining of PROP1 (red) and SOX2 (green) at e12.5 in the dorsal and ventral areas of Rathke’s pouch (arrowheads). At e14.5 less co-localization was observed (arrowheads).

Non-cycling precursors are restricted both spatially and temporally during normal development and are marked by expression of p57<sup>Kip2</sup> and cyclin E. In most tissues, cyclin E marks the transition from G1 to S phase, but it marks non-cycling precursors in the developing pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilodeau et al., 2009</xref>). As differentiation proceeds, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is up-regulated concomitant with extinguishing p57<sup>Kip2</sup> expression, and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protects cells from re-entering the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilodeau et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate whether PROP1 has a role in regulating the progression of proliferating stem cells to a transition phase, we evaluated the expression of transitional cell markers in <italic>Prop1</italic> loss-of-function mutant (<italic>Prop1</italic><sup>df/df</sup>, p.Ser83Pro) and control pituitaries. Immunofluorescence revealed CYCLIN E expression in the expected transitional zone of non-cycling progenitors in normal e13.5 pituitaries, but it is completely absent at e13.5 in the pituitaries of <italic>Prop1</italic><sup>df/df</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunoreactivity for p57<sup>kip2</sup> and p27<sup>kip1</sup> was spatially and temporally normal in <italic>Prop1</italic><sup>df/df</sup> pituitaries, but the number of double positive cells was abnormally high in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Prop1</italic> deficiency causes an abnormal progression from stem cell to differentiated cell. Cyclin D1 is expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is essential for cells to passage into S phase. At e12.5, CYCLIN D1 is expressed mainly in the proliferative zone of wild-type and <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries. However, at e13.5, there is a reduction in CYCLIN D1-positive cells in dwarf pituitaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results show that <italic>Prop1</italic> is necessary for several aspects of cell cycle regulation during embryogenesis: promoting proliferation of progenitor cells marked by Cyclin D1, transitioning them out of the cell cycle to express Cyclin E, and progressing from p57<sup>kip2</sup>-positive transitional cells to p27<sup>kip1</sup>-positive differentiating cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PROP1 is required to maintain normal SOX2 expression after birth</title><p>The rodent pituitary gland undergoes two distinct waves of cell proliferation and differentiation, one occurring during embryogenesis and a second one during the first 3 weeks afterbirth in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gremeaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbajo-Pérez and Watanabe, 1990</xref>). The known pattern of <italic>Prop1</italic> expression correlates with the first wave of proliferation, which peaks at e12.5 and wanes at e14.5, but expression during the postnatal wave of cell proliferation has not been investigated. Using qRT-PCR, we discovered high <italic>Prop1</italic> mRNA levels at postnatal days 3 and 7 (P3 and P7), that are similar to the peak levels at e12.5 and coincident with the second wave of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The epithelial markers E-cadherin (<italic>Cdh1</italic>) and claudin-23 were uniquely up-regulated in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant colonies.

This consensus sequence is the first to be experimentally determined based on genome-wide data and is consistent with the paired homeodomain core consensus expected for PROP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sornson et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, additional enriched transcription factor binding motifs were also identified in approximately 30–38% of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The best match for the motifs TGAGTCAT and CGATTAGC are Jun-AP1 and CRX, respectively. Because CRX (cone rod homeobox) is not expressed in the pituitary gland, the CGATTAGC motif is likely bound by a different OTX-like paired homeodomain protein that cooperates with PROP1 to direct transcriptional programs associated with target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reed et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14470.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>PROP1 is a regulator of genes involved in EMT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HOMER analysis of new motif enrichment within PROP1 peaks.

PROP1 deficiency causes similar hormone deficiencies to those caused by POU1F1 mutations, but in addition, it is uniquely associated with progressive hormone loss, highly dysmorphic Rathke’s pouch, and poor vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ward et al., 2006</xref>). However, the molecular bases for these aspects of PROP1-specific disease pathologies are unknown.</p><p>Here, we define two new roles of <italic>Prop1</italic>: first, PROP1 is a regulator of pituitary stem cell (SOX2+ cell) population and second, PROP1 triggers an EMT-like process in pituitary stem cells that is crucial for normal pituitary morphology and cell specification of the PIT1 lineage. Our genome-wide analysis of PROP1 binding identifies target genes that regulate these processes. We propose that <italic>Prop1</italic> mediates progenitor cell proliferation by driving cell cycle progression. In the absence of functional <italic>Prop1</italic>, embryonic pituitary progenitors fail to maintain expression of the proliferative markers Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raetzman et al., 2004</xref>), and they fail to initiate expression of the transitional marker Cyclin E. We did not detect <italic>Prop1-</italic>binding sites near the <italic>CyclinD1, D2</italic> or <italic>E</italic> genes, suggesting that <italic>Prop1</italic> regulation of these genes is indirect. There is a precedent for <italic>Gli2</italic> activating expression of these genes in the developing lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutter et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Gli2</italic> is necessary for pituitary progenitor proliferation and normal pituitary morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Gli2-</italic>deficient mice either lack their anterior pituitary or have pituitary hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the human <italic>GLI2</italic> gene cause pituitary anomalies and holoprosencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roessler et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Gli2</italic> expression is reduced in colonies derived from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries, and PROP1 binds to the 5’ region of the <italic>Gli2</italic> gene in cell culture. However, <italic>Gli2</italic> expression is not strictly or directly <italic>Prop1</italic> dependent because <italic>Gli2</italic> is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the pituitary early on (at e12.5) and is expressed in pituitary tissue after <italic>Prop1</italic> expression wanes (e15.5).</p><p><italic>Prop1</italic> is required to maintain stem cell pools and stimulate progenitor cells to differentiate. This idea is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, all the hormone producing cell types of both the anterior and intermediate lobes go through a <italic>Prop1</italic> expressing intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2016</xref>). Second, <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants have reduced cyclin D1 and D2 expression in the progenitor compartment embryonically. Third, <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants have more SOX2-positive cells residing in the marginal zone or residual Rathke’s cleft, and fewer SOX2-positive cells in the parenchyma, in comparison to both <italic>Pou1f1</italic> mutants and control mice. Fourth, the SOX2-expressing cells in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants lack SOX9, have reduced colony forming capabilities, and exhibit abnormal colony morphology. PROP1 regulation of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression may be indirect, even if they are expressed in the same cell at one point during development and after birth, since PROP1 did not bind the SOX2 promoter in cell culture.</p><p>Another role of PROP1 is to drive an EMT-like process in pituitary stem cells by stimulating expression of <italic>Zeb2</italic>. We determined this using several different approaches: colony-forming assays, in vivo analysis of <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant tissues and genetically engineered cell lines. <italic>Prop1</italic> deficiency affects pituitary colony-forming properties, and the <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant<italic>-</italic>specific alterations in gene expression in these CFCs indicate failure of an EMT-like process. The classic pattern of EMT involves loss of Cdh1 (E-Cadherin) and up-regulation of Cdh2 (N-Cadherin). In <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants CFCs as well as in pituitary tissues, we observed an increase in Cdh1, however no changes in Cdh2 expression were found. Thus, the process is likely a partial EMT, in which mesenchymal cells do not display all the characteristics of a typical EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leroy and Mostov, 2007</xref>). A number of transcription factors, including ZEB family members, regulate EMT. PROP1 binds to the <italic>Zeb2</italic> promoter, suggesting the regulation may be direct. The level of <italic>Zeb2</italic> expression is decreased in both CFCs and developmental pituitaries from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant mice, and reduction in <italic>Zeb2</italic> expression is sufficient to mimic some of the properties of <italic>Prop1-</italic>deficient CFCs. ZEB family proteins reduce epithelial marker expression and increase mesenchymal marker expression during the induction of EMT in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peinado et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>Zeb2</italic> is repressed through microRNA 200 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010</xref>), and we found an increase in miR-200a transcripts in colonies from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries. In humans, mutations on the <italic>ZEB2</italic> gene cause Mowat Wilson Syndrome, a disorder associated with mental retardation, microcephaly and short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mowat et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that affected individuals with this pathology could have also pituitary defects.</p><p>During development, expansion of organs relies on cell migration and differentiation. These events imply changes in the actin cytoskeleton and altered expression of adhesion molecules and matrix extracellular components. We show altered cell shape, elevated expression of adhesion molecules and reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in stem cell colonies from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant mice. MMPs play key roles in embryonic development and are involved in EMT in the morphogenesis of many tissues, including neural crest delamination, endocardial invasion and mammary gland branching formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radisky and Radisky, 2010</xref>). Several genes down regulated in the stem cell colonies from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries were associated with main inducers of the EMT including members of the Notch, TGF-β, Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. All these signaling pathways are also well known for their critical role in pituitary embryonic development and have important roles in tumorigenesis in both humans and mice. EMT plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis, particularly during growth, maintenance and progression of the tumor with local invasion or metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Craene and Berx, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pirozzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2008</xref>). Pituitary adenomas are tumors with significant prevalence and, although they are often benign, can become invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melmed, 2011</xref>). At present, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic processes of initiation, expansion and invasion of pituitary adenomas are still unknown. Our data provide insight into a role of EMT in pituitary development that could be applied in the context of pituitary tumor formation and to other tissues that contain stem cells that undergo an EMT-like process before differentiating, such as during heart and mammary development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we showed that <italic>Prop1</italic> is required for normal stem cell pools during embryogenesis and postnatal pituitary expansion.

To make stable cell lines, transfected cells were incubated with 1.4 mg/ml G-418 solution (Roche) and 5 µg/ml Puromycin (Sigma) for selection of BirA and <italic>Prop1-Tag,</italic> respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total protein from cultured cells was extracted in a T-PERbuffer (Thermo) and Halt protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo). Total protein was quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). Proteins and ladder (BIO-RAD) were run on 4–20% Mini-ProteanTGX Gels from BIO-RAD. Membranes were washed with buffered Tris. Anti-V5 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase antibody (diluted 1:4000, Invitrogen) was used to detect BirA. Anti-Histone H3 antibody (Abcam) was used at a 1:4000 dilution and an anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody (diluted 1:20000, Thermo). All membranes were blocked and antibodies diluted in a 1% BSA/TBS-Tween solution. Membranes were developed with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo) and stripped with Restore western blot stripping buffer (Thermo).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</title><p>ChIP was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al. (2009</xref>) . Briefly, for ChIP-Seq, approximately 10<sup>7</sup> cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and neutralized with 0.15 M glycine. After sonication, 10 µg of soluble chromatin was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Invitrogen) at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, beads were washed and DNA was eluted with elution buffer 1% SDS. After reverse crosslinking, RnaseA and proteinase K digestion, chromatin was purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. For ChIP-Seq, the extracted DNA was ligated to specific adaptors followed by deep sequencing with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The confirmatory ChIPs for specific peaks were performed with immunoprecipitated and reverse cross-linked chromatin that was prepared as described above. Quantitative real time PCR was performed with primers specific for ChIP-Seq peak sequences using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) assays. Values were normalized to input. The primers used for real-time PCR are listed on Supplemental Information.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ChIP-Seq</title><p>Multiplex libraries were prepared using Rubicon ThruPlex kit according to their protocol (Cat R40012). Library amplification reaction was performed in 14 cycles. The concentration and quality of purified, amplified DNA were estimated using a high sensitivity DNA assay Bioanalyzer 2200 (Agilent). After quality confirmation, the DNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina High Seq 2000 (Sequencing Core, UMICH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Chip-Seq analysis and motif enrichment</title><p>DNA sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome mm10 assembly by Bowtiev0.12.7. MACS2 was used to identify peaks. FastQC and cross-correlation test were performed to evaluate the data quality. Peaks were annotated for their locations regarding to nearby genes by HOMERv4.6. To discover DNA binding motifs enriched among PROP1 peaks, HOMER's findMotifsGenome.pl was used. FIMO was used to identify locations of motifs inside peaks. ChIP-Seq data are available in the GEO database under accession number GSE77302.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R01HD-30428 to SAC), the Endocrine Society International Scholar Program and University of Michigan Center for Organogenesis Fellowship (MIPM).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PROP1 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process in pituitary stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: JP Martinez-Barbera.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In an interesting study, Pérez Millan et al. provide molecular evidence supporting the idea that the PROP1 transcription factor initiates an EMT-like process during pituitary development. This idea was implicit in descriptions of PROP1 mutant mice initiated almost 20 years ago and pursued by Dr Camper, but the present work provides RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data for PROP1 in the support of this hypothesis. Changes in gene expression in PROP1 mutant pituitaries, such as for the genes encoding E-cadherin, claudin 23, MP2/3, ZEB2, <italic>Notch2</italic> and GLI2, are correlated with presence of PROP1 ChIP-seq peaks in their vicinity. The authors also show that PROP1 expression overlaps with the progenitor marker <italic>Sox2</italic>, presumably as progenitors exit the stem state towards differentiation. They also show that the transitional marker cyclin E is much less expressed in PROP1 mutant pituitaries despite the fact that the cell cycle inhibitors p57 and p27 are expressed normally in developing pituitaries. Finally, they show that the colony-forming ability of PROP1 mutant pituitaries is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, altered to yield more of a differentiated rather than progenitor appearance.</p><p>While the data presented are interesting, provocative and highly suggestive of the importance of a PROP1-dependent EMT-like process, the reviewers were concerned that the evidence presented is largely correlative. As detailed in the individual critiques below, the major common concern was that the data on changes in E-cadherin expression were not very convincing and that some form of more functional assessment of the proposed target genes in PROP1 mutants would help support the hypothesis proposed in the title of the paper. While there are a number of issues raised by the referees, the three key areas that must be addressed before we can consider a revised manuscript are listed below. If you feel you can address these in the required two-month time frame, we will be happy to receive a revised manuscript. If you have concerns about this, please let us know and we can discuss further. It may help us if you responded to this decision letter with a list of the experiments you feel address the major concerns of the reviewers and a reasonable timetable for their completion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of <italic>Prop1</italic> in EMT is not characterized very well. Although potential target genes involved in EMT are identified by ChIP-seq, the E-Cadherin immunostaining is not convincing. Functional characterization of the importance of some of the target genes would help support the conclusions. At least one of the proposed PROP1-dependent regulators of EMT should be assessed by mutagenesis in order to offer a convincing piece of work. Perhaps the authors could try a functional approach in the adherent culture system.</p><p>2) A better characterization of the <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Prop1</italic>-expressing cells postnatally is required.</p><p>3) It is unexpected to see formation of the same number of colonies in vitro, when in vivo the proportion of <italic>Sox2</italic> positive cells is increased in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants. The authors comment that mutant colonies do not have the same morphology as wild-type ones so maybe prevention of the EMT like-transition is perturbing colony formation? Clonogenic differences need to be better presented and discrepancies with <italic>Sox2</italic>-immunostaining need to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14470.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The role of Prop1 in EMT is not characterized very well.

We also show a merged image of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> Panel A that makes it easier to appreciate the excess E-cadherin staining in the <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitary during embryonic development and a new Panel B that shows ectopic E-cadherin staining in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries postnatally.</p><p>We reasoned that the functional characterization of a down-stream target of <italic>Prop1</italic> by knock out or overexpression would be more likely to generate an obvious phenotype if the target gene selected is itself a master-regulator like <italic>Zeb2</italic> instead of a member of one of the larger gene families that were implicated like cadherins, matrix-metalloproteinases, or BMPs. We used si-RNA to knock down <italic>Zeb2</italic> expression in the adherent pituitary stem cell colonies derived from normal mice and found that this was sufficient to cause reduced <italic>Gli2</italic> expression, increased <italic>Cdh1</italic> expression and alter colony morphology such that they resemble colonies derived from <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant mice. This appears in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) A better characterization of the Sox2 and Prop1-expressing cells postnatally is required.</italic></p><p>We created a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that shows immunohistochemical staining for SOX2, SOX9 and PROP1 in normal and <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant mice in postnatal pituitary development. We quantified the fraction of cells that are double positive, and the data reveal reduced co-expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants. This is consistent with the idea that the SOX2 positive cells in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutants are failing to engage in the transition from stem cell towards differentiation.</p><p><italic>3) It is unexpected to see formation of the same number of colonies in vitro, when in vivo the proportion of Sox2 positive cells is increased in Prop1 mutants. The authors comment that mutant colonies do not have the same morphology as wild-type ones so maybe prevention of the EMT like-transition is perturbing colony formation? Clonogenic differences need to be better presented and discrepancies with Sox2-immunostaining need to be clarified</italic>.</p><p>We changed the presentation of the colony forming properties as suggested by the reviewers. Instead of showing the percentage of the cells that can form colonies, we present the total number of colony forming cells per organ. Because the <italic>Prop1</italic> and <italic>Pit1</italic> mutant pituitaries lack the cells that make GH, PRL and TSH, the representation of CFC/organ is probably more appropriate. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Panel A which illustrates significantly fewer CFC/<italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitary and no change in CFC/<italic>Pit1</italic> mutant pituitary. Although there are more <italic>Sox2</italic> expressing cells in <italic>Prop1</italic> mutant pituitaries, fewer have clonogenic potential, likely because of the reduced number of SOX2, SOX9double positive cells as described above for point 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
