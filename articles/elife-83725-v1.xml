organizing centers (SMOCs) known as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes recruit caspases to undergo proximity-induced autoprocessing into an enzymatically active form that cleaves downstream targets. Binding of bacterial LPS to its cytosolic sensor, caspase-11 (Casp11), promotes Casp11 aggregation within a high-molecular-weight complex known as the noncanonical inflammasome, where it is activated to cleave gasdermin D and induce pyroptosis. However, the cellular correlates of Casp11 oligomerization and whether Casp11 forms an LPS-induced SMOC within cells remain unknown. Expression of fluorescently labeled Casp11 in macrophages revealed that cytosolic LPS induced Casp11 speck formation. Unexpectedly, catalytic activity and autoprocessing were required for Casp11 to form LPS-induced specks in macrophages. Furthermore, both catalytic activity and autoprocessing were required for Casp11 speck formation in an ectopic expression system, and processing of Casp11 via ectopically expressed TEV protease was sufficient to induce Casp11 speck formation. These data reveal a previously undescribed role for Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing in noncanonical inflammasome assembly, and shed new light on the molecular requirements for noncanonical inflammasome assembly in response to cytosolic LPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>noncanonical inflammasome</kwd><kwd>caspase-11</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>caspase-1</kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI128530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodsky</surname><given-names>Igor E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01139102A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodsky</surname><given-names>Igor E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014599</institution-id><institution>Mark Foundation For Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodsky</surname><given-names>Igor E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship, 916272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akuma</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Martin and Pamela Winter Infectious Disease Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Exconde</surname><given-names>Patrick M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI118861</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Sunny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI123243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Sunny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Sunny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100021144</institution-id><institution>United Negro College Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMS Ernest E.

Such swift responses are critical for efficient host defense in the face of pathogens that have the capacity to replicate rapidly and suppress or evade immune detection. A common feature of PRR activation is their inducible assembly into higher-order oligomeric protein complexes, termed supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs), which mediate the effector function of the PRR signaling pathway in response to microbial infection or pathologic stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Caspases-1 and -11 are inflammatory caspases that are recruited into inflammasome SMOCs in response to the cytosolic presence of pathogen-derived signals or molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). Inflammatory caspases are zymogens that contain a C-terminal enzymatic domain and an N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which promotes SMOC formation through homotypic interactions with other CARD-containing adapter proteins as well as homodimerization with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ting and Davis, 2005</xref>). The C-terminal enzymatic domain of caspases is comprised of large (17–20 kDa) and small (10–12 kDa) subunits separated by an interdomain linker (IDL), which contains the self-cleavage site that undergoes autoprocessing following caspase oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ross et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Caspase-1 is recruited to canonical inflammasome complexes that typically contain a sensor protein of the NLR family, the adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). In contrast, caspase-11 (Casp11) binds directly to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>) and does not require a known sensor or adapter for activation of pyroptosis via a pathway termed the noncanonical inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kayagaki et al., 2011</xref>). Recruitment of Casp1 and Casp11 to their respective SMOCs results in their autoprocessing, a process termed proximity-induced activation, enabling their cleavage of downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salvesen and Dixit, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi, 2004</xref>). Casp11-dependent cleavage of its target, gasdermin D (GSDMD), leads to cell lysis, as well as release of inflammatory cellular contents, thus triggering pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aglietti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, Casp1 and Casp11 play important roles in antimicrobial host defense, but they can also promote autoinflammatory disease when dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henao-Mejia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Inducible dimerization is used to model assembly of functional caspase complexes within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oberst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Caspases whose N-terminal domain is replaced with a dimerizable domain, such as FKBP506, undergo autoprocessing and exhibit catalytic activity toward their substrates in the presence of dimerizing agents. Interestingly, Casp11 mutants, whose autoprocessing site is ablated, have significantly reduced protease activity toward their substrates and have defective ability to induce cell death, despite being dimerized and having an intact catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, CRISPR targeting of Casp11 autoprocessing or catalytic activity demonstrates that both are important for Casp11-dependent pyroptosis and lethal sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The observation that autoprocessing is needed to generate a fully functional Casp11 complex despite being dimerized and catalytically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>) implies that formation of a functional Casp11 SMOC involves additional steps beyond inducible dimerization. Interestingly, while non-cleavable Casp8 is active in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2003</xref>) or in the presence of kosmotropic salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pop et al., 2007</xref>), autoprocessing is also required for full Casp8 activity toward its substrates within cells, implying that autoprocessing stabilizes the active form of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oberst et al., 2010</xref>). This parallels recent findings with Casp1, which requires autoprocessing for robust cleavage of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz et al., 2010</xref>) and GSDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2020</xref>). However, while ASC fluorescent reporters have enabled the dynamic tracking of canonical inflammasome assembly within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tzeng et al., 2016</xref>), the cellular correlates of Casp11 oligomerization within cells in response to cytosolic LPS remain poorly defined.</p><p>Here, we find using fluorescent Casp11 reporter fusions that cytosolic LPS induces Casp11 assembly into large perinuclear specks, the first time, to our knowledge, that LPS-induced noncanonical inflammasome speck assembly has been directly observed within cells. Unexpectedly, Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing were required for cytosolic LPS-inducible Casp11 speck formation in macrophages, suggesting that both catalytic activity and autoprocessing act <italic>upstream</italic> of Casp11 oligomerization to facilitate assembly of the fully activated Casp11 SMOC in response to cytosolic LPS. Intriguingly, both Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing were required for spontaneous as well as LPS-induced speck assembly in HEK293T cells, consistent with a model whereby higher-order oligomerization of Casp11 requires catalytic activity and autoprocessing. Consistently, inducible IDL processing of Casp11 by an exogenous protease was sufficient to mediate speck formation in 293T cells. Surprisingly, the Casp11 CARD was neither required nor sufficient for spontaneous Casp11 oligomerization, as inducible dimerization of Casp11 by a chemical dimerizer in the absence of the CARD promoted speck formation, and a CARD-less Casp11 p20/p10-mCherry construct also exhibited speck formation in a manner that also required catalytic activity. Altogether, we demonstrate that Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing act upstream of Casp11 oligomerization to mediate assembly of the fully functional Casp11 SMOC in response to cytosolic LPS. Our findings uncover a previously undescribed property of caspase-containing SMOCs and imply that Casp11 activation involves a feed-forward mechanism whereby self-processing of Casp11 facilitates assembly of the fully competent pyroptosis-inducing Casp11 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Caspase-11 catalytic activity is required for cytosolic LPS-induced speck formation</title><p>Upon sensing cytosolic LPS, Casp11 oligomerizes into high-molecular-weight complexes known as noncanonical inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). To better understand the oligomerization dynamics of the Casp11 inflammasome, we generated a lentiviral construct encoding C-terminal fusions of mCherry with full-length Casp11 (Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry), along with corresponding mutant constructs ablating catalytic activity (Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry), or the IDL autoprocessing site (Casp11<sup>D285A</sup>-mCherry), and transduced these constructs into <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Interestingly, Casp11<sup>D285A</sup>-mCherry expression failed to completely ablate pore formation despite abrogating GSDMD cleavage, indicating that tagged Casp11-mCherry carries out GSDMD cleavage in a manner dependent on its autoprocessing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). We next utilized confocal microscopy to assess Casp11-mCherry localization at basal state and in response to cytosolic LPS. As expected, <italic>Casp11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDMs transduced with Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry, Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry, or Casp11<sup>D285A</sup>-mCherry exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the absence of LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry coalesced into large specks in response to transfection of LPS, consistent with the concept that Casp11 assembles into an LPS-induced higher-order complex, or SMOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In contrast, Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry and Casp11<sup>D285A</sup>-mCherry-transduced cells were unable to form specks in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). These findings imply that CARD-dependent binding of Casp11 to LPS is not sufficient to mediate Casp11 speck formation within cells, and that Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing facilitate higher order assembly of noncanonical inflammasomes. As these experiments utilized delivery of purified LPS into the cytosol, we infected Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry- and Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry-expresssing BMDMs with an intracellular Gram-negative pathogen, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, which is known to activate the noncanonical inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Case et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casson et al., 2013</xref>), in order to test the ability of Casp11 to form specks in the context of bacterial infection. Notably, cells expressing Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry exhibited speck formation upon infection with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, similarly to cells exposed to transfected LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>).

Consistent with previous observations, co-expression of Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry and GSDMD led to dose-dependent GSDMD cleavage and cell death that required Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (zVAD) blocked spontaneous speck assembly and autoprocessing by Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>).

To address this question, we employed transient co-transfection of wild-type and mutant versions of labeled and unlabeled Casp11, and initially co-transfected a fixed amount of mCherry-tagged Casp11<sup>WT</sup> or Casp11<sup>C254A</sup> with increasing amounts of unlabeled WT Casp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, in the absence of unlabeled WT Casp11, Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry exhibited autoprocessing and speck formation that was absent in Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, left lanes, C</xref>). Increasing levels of unlabeled Casp11 did not affect processing of Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry, though it did increase processing of Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Increasing levels of unlabeled Casp11 had a relatively limited effect on speck formation by Casp11<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry, except at the very highest dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). In contrast, and consistent with our observations in stable 2xFLAG-Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-expressing cells, co-transfection of unlabeled Casp11 significantly increased speck formation by Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that WT Casp11 rescues oligomerization of catalytically inactive Casp11-mCherry species by enabling recruitment of the mutant protein to WT complexes. Intriguingly, mutating the IDL autoprocessing site of Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry to yield an inactive, IDL-uncleavable mutant Casp11<sup>C254A/D285A</sup>-mCherry prevented IDL processing but did not prevent formation of mCherry specks in the presence of unlabeled WT Casp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>).

Our findings suggested that homodimerization might serve to nucleate inflammasome assembly, and that catalytic activity-dependent Casp11 oligomerization occurs subsequent to initial dimerization. To determine whether catalytic activity mediates higher-order Casp11 oligomerization downstream of initial dimerization, or whether speck formation proceeds downstream of homodimerization independently of catalytic activity, we replaced the endogenous CARD with a DmrB dimerization domain to generate dimerizable Casp11<sup>WT</sup>- and Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry that could undergo inducible dimerization in the presence of a chemical dimerizer (AP20187) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, DmrB-(ΔCARD)-Casp11-mCherry displayed basal levels of speck formation above background, which was significantly increased by addition of dimerizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Critically, both baseline and dimerization-induced speck formation of DmrB-(ΔCARD)-Casp11-mCherry required catalytic activity, consistent with our finding that catalytic activity is essential for Casp11 speck formation in response to cytosolic LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Importantly, DmrB-(ΔCARD)-Casp11-mCherry-induced GSDMD cleavage required dimerization and catalytic activity, indicating that these constructs are functional and consistent with previous observations that dimerization induces catalytic activity of initiator and inflammatory caspases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Our observation that CARD-deficient dimerizable Casp11 had some capacity to form specks raised the question of whether low-level spontaneous dimerization of the DmrB domain was leading to subsequent higher-order speck formation or whether the CARD itself was in fact dispensable for speck formation in this setting. Surprisingly, CARD-less Casp11-mCherry spontaneously assembled into specks in the transient 293T transfection system, and this was abrogated by mutation of the catalytic cysteine, further supporting the model that higher-order oligomerization of Casp11 in response to LPS requires its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Moreover, a CARD-only-citrine fusion protein was unable to form specks, in contrast to the corresponding full-length Casp11-citrine fusion, further demonstrating that the enzymatic domain is vital for Casp11 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that higher-order oligomerization of Casp11 requires the catalytic activity and autoprocessing function of the enzymatic domain, and that the CARD is insufficient to mediate SMOC formation in response to cytosolic LPS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Catalytic activity is required for caspase-11 speck formation downstream of homodimerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of fluorescent Casp11 constructs that allow for inducible dimerization by the chemical dimerizer AP20187 (created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioRender.com">BioRender.com</ext-link>).

Dysregulation of Casp11 contributes to severe inflammatory disorders such as endotoxic shock and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kajiwara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Napier et al., 2016</xref>). LPS binds to the CARD of Casp11 and promotes its assembly into a large oligomeric complex termed the noncanonical inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). Given their critical roles in innate immune responses to disease states resulting from infection, autoinflammatory disease, and sepsis, there is substantial interest in understanding how assembly of such higher-order oligomeric complexes, also known as SMOCs, is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Dimerization of Casp11 is sufficient to induce its protease activity and autoprocessing, which is required for its ability to cleave GSDMD, suggesting that activation of the fully competent oligomeric complex occurs subsequent to initial clustering of Casp11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Genetic studies further reveal that both catalytic activity at C254 and autoprocessing at D285 within the IDL region between the two enzymatic subunits are required for Casp11-mediated processing of GSDMD and inflammatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). However, the requirement for Casp11 autoprocessing in order to cleave GSDMD, even when dimerized and catalytically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>), implies that dimerization alone is not sufficient for complete activation of Casp11. This requirement for both dimerization and autoprocessing in Casp11 activation parallels human CASP8 and CASP1, which also require dimerization and autoprocessing for full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oberst et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that initial dimerization and subsequent oligomerization might be two distinctly regulated steps in noncanonical inflammasome activation. Notably, in contrast to other caspases, Casp11 acts as its own sensor and adapter for assembly of the LPS-induced noncanonical inflammasome. We therefore sought to dissect the cell biological roles of catalytic activity and autoprocessing in assembly and activation of the Casp11 inflammasome.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that cytosolic LPS induces assembly of perinuclear Casp11 clusters in BMDMs, similar to ASC inflammasome specks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tzeng et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly, the catalytic cysteine and IDL cleavage site of Casp11 were required to form LPS-induced Casp11 specks in macrophages. This implies that CARD binding to LPS is insufficient to mediate Casp11 SMOC formation. Consistently, the CARD domain alone was unable to mediate speck formation in response to LPS, indicating an important role for the enzymatic domain in mediating assembly of the Casp11 inflammasome complex. Importantly, however, Casp11 catalytic activity was dispensable for speck formation when BMDMs were infected with the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, suggesting that additional mechanisms may exist to induce Casp11 speck formation without the need for autoprocessing in the setting of bacterial infection, potentially via the ability of bacteria serving as platforms to facilitate higher-order oligomerization. Additionally, the GBPs have been implicated in liberating LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, as well as allowing for enhanced access to bacterial LPS by Casp11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finethy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meunier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pilla et al., 2014</xref>). GBP recruitment to the bacterial surface in the context of infection may bypass the requirement for Casp11 catalytic activity. Further studies are needed to fully determine how bacterial infection induces formation of the Casp11 inflammasome. Nonetheless, our findings collectively highlight a key role for Casp11 enzymatic activity and autoprocessing in initiating assembly of a fully active noncanonical inflammasome in response to cytosolic LPS.</p><p>HEK293T cells have been used extensively to dissect the molecular and cellular determinants of inflammasome assembly and innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evavold et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaberi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tenthorey et al., 2014</xref>). Ectopic expression of Casp11-mCherry fusion proteins in HEK293T cells, along with corresponding catalytically inactive and autoprocessing-deficient mutants, showed that both Casp11 catalytic activity and autoprocessing are required for spontaneous recruitment of Casp11 into oligomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, the requirement for catalytic activity and autoprocessing in speck formation was observed in spontaneous speck forming assays in HEK293T cells, in LPS-transfected primary BMDMs, and inducible speck forming assays in HEK293T cells stably expressing Casp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that spontaneous speck assembly in HEK293T cells follows similar rules to LPS-induced speck assembly in macrophages and HEK293T cells, and that the spontaneous HEK293T system can be used to understand how the noncanonical inflammasome is assembled in response to cytosolic LPS.</p><p>Casp11 processing by the exogenous TEV protease restored speck formation of Casp11 whose endogenous IDL cleavage site was replaced with that of the TEV protease cleavage site, indicating that Casp11 processing is sufficient for speck formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). Surprisingly, the Casp11 catalytic residue Cys-254 was still required for speck assembly of TEV-cleavable Casp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>), suggesting that Casp11 must either undergo processing at an additional site, such as D80 of the CARD domain linker (CDL) or that the catalytic Cys-254 residue plays an alternate role in speck assembly. Notably, the CDL of Casp1 is a negative regulator of Casp1 activity, whereas the CDL of Casp11 was previously suggested to have no impact on Casp11 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the alternate target of Casp11 outside of the IDL processing site is currently not clear. Importantly, mutant Casp11<sup>C254A</sup> was able to bind to both Casp11<sup>WT</sup> and Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>, indicating that loss of binding per se was not the basis for the inability of Casp11<sup>C254A</sup> to undergo oligomerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Regardless, our studies demonstrate that in the presence of a functional catalytic site, autoprocessing is sufficient to form the Casp11 speck, thereby implicating autoprocessing in oligomerization of noncanonical inflammasome complexes.</p><p>Our studies find that Casp11<sup>WT</sup> can rescue speck formation of catalytically inactive Casp11 expressed in the same cells. This occurred in both cells stably expressing Casp11<sup>C254A</sup> mutant protein, as well as in transient co-transfection of WT and mutant Casp11. However, exogenously expressed TEV protease was unable to perform this function despite robust processing of Casp11-mCherry, suggesting that rather than solely inducing cleavage of the catalytically inactive variant, co-expressed Casp11<sup>WT</sup> was recruiting inactive Casp11 into a complex formed by Casp11<sup>WT</sup>. Indeed, Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry did not require the ability to be processed to form specks in the presence of Casp11<sup>WT</sup>, whereas both catalytic activity and processing were necessary within the same molecule for Casp11 to induce speck formation of catalytically inactive Casp11<sup>C254A</sup>-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggest that intra-molecular <italic>cis-</italic>processing, or a combination of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-processing, may initiate or drive assembly of higher-order Casp11 oligomeric complexes via a feed-forward mechanism whereby Casp11 dimerization and <italic>cis</italic>-processing, downstream of LPS binding, propagates the assembly of a fully active Casp11 SMOC. Notably, recent cryo-EM analyses revealed that human NLRP1 and CARD8 propagate their inflammasomes through a similar autoprocessing-dependent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, cooperative assembly has been proposed for Casp8 assembly onto the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism may generally apply to other oligomeric caspase complexes.</p><p>Catalytically inactive recombinant Casp11 purified from insect cells underwent aggregation into higher-molecular-weight complexes in the presence of lysates from Gram-negative bacteria or purified LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). These studies utilized highly purified components to define mechanics of Casp11 assembly in vitro. Here, we utilized a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to visualize the behavior of Casp11 within individual cells. Based on the behavior of analogous ASC specks, we interpret the Casp11 specks that we observe to be higher-order oligomeric Casp11 structures. It is possible that regulatory mechanisms within the cytosol of intact cells limit the aggregation of catalytically inactive or non-cleavable Casp11. A previous study found that EGFP-tagged Casp11 exhibited speck formation in WT and catalytically inactive Casp11-expressing 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, these Casp11-EGFP specks appear smaller (&lt;1–2 μm) and less defined than the spherical perinuclear specks (2–5 μm) we observed in Casp11-mCherry or Casp11-Citrine-expressing cells. Moreover, our observations in HEK293T cells recapitulate the endogenous behavior of the Casp11 SMOC in macrophages, as catalytic activity is required for LPS-induced Casp11 assembly in macrophages as well as spontaneous Casp11 speck assembly in 293T cells.</p><p>While guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) facilitate Casp11 activation in response to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Man et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meunier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wandel et al., 2020</xref>), and in some settings, NLRP3-dependent detection of bacterial mRNA potentiates Casp11 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moretti et al., 2022</xref>), Casp11 contains all of the properties of an inflammasome sensor, adaptor, and effector within a single protein. Interestingly, while the Casp11 CARD is sufficient to bind LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2014</xref>), it is not sufficient for spontaneous Casp11 oligomerization in HEK293 cells, further supporting the finding that critical oligomerization functions are provided by catalytic activity and autoprocessing. Indeed, we found that homodimerization of CARD-less Casp11 promoted speck formation, and that this also required catalytic activity, implying that catalytic activity and autoprocessing mediate Casp11 oligomerization following initial dimerization.</p><p>Precisely how autoprocessing mediates Casp11 higher-order oligomerization remains to be determined. Initial Casp11 homodimerization and autoprocessing may induce a conformation change that enhances the binding affinity between different homodimers, resulting in a shift in the equilibrium to favor sequential recruitment of further monomers to propagate the fully assembled oligomeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest a model in which CARD-mediated LPS binding induces initial dimerization of Casp11, which then undergoes IDL processing to promote oligomerization to generate a GSDMD processing-competent complex. As both the Casp11 N- and C-termini were found in the speck, the composition of the speck may be a mixture of unprocessed, or partially processed, and fully processed Casp11 molecules. Future studies on the oligomeric structure of Casp11 are likely to reveal important information about how the individual Casp11 monomers interact with one another and how CARD-LPS interactions facilitate Casp11 oligomerization. Our findings provide new insight into the assembly of higher-order caspase complexes and reveal a role for catalytic activity and autoprocessing upstream of noncanonical inflammasome assembly in response to cytosolic bacterial LPS.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of caspase-11 inflammasome assembly (created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioRender.com">BioRender.com</ext-link>).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83725-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC, grown in complete DMEM (supplemented with 10% v/v FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin), and maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Cells were washed 3× with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% TritonX in PBS at RT for 10 min. Then, cells were washed 3× with PBS and blocked with 10% BSA at RT on a shaker for 1 hr. Cells were washed 3 × 5 min with 0.2% Tween-20 and 1.5% BSA in PBS on a rocker. Cells were incubated with anti-FLAG-FITC antibody for 1 hr in the dark, and then washed 4 × 5 min with 0.2% Tween-20 and 1.5% BSA in PBS on a rocker. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with DAPI-containing mounting media and dried overnight. For colocalization studies, 2xFLAG-Casp11-expressing HEK293Ts were seeded as described above, transfected with Casp11-mCherry plasmids using FuGENE HD, and incubated for 24 hr prior to fixation and staining as described in this section. All slides were imaged on Zeiss LSM 980 Confocal using the ×63 objective. Slides were imaged at a single z-plane per field with lasers optimized for FITC (488-green), mCherry (561-red), and DAPI (405-blue) emission spectra.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>Legionella</italic> intracellular infection</title><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> serogroup 1 strains were used in all experiments.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded in poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) F-bottom 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight in complete DMEM. The next day, mammalian expression plasmids containing indicated mCherry-tagged or -untagged caspase-11 DNA constructs were co-transfected into the cells at increasing doses (0–250 ng per well), together with a fixed dose of GSDMD (50 ng), using the transfection agent polyethylenimine (PEI; Sigma-Aldrich) at a 1:1 ratio (w/w DNA:PEI). After 14 hr, cells were lysed with CTG2.0 reagent mix and incubated in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Luminescence was read on a luminometer, and values were normalized to cells treated with 1% TritonX-100 (min cell viability; negative control) and mock-transfected cells (max cell viability).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>BMDMs were seeded in clear TC-treated 96-well plates (6.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) and transfected with LPS in the absence or increasing doses of zVAD-fmk (caspase-11 inhibitor), as indicated. HEK293T cells were seeded in poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated TC-treated 24-well plates (2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) and transiently transfected with appropriate constructs. At the indicated timepoints, whole-cell extracts (XT) and/or supernatants (sup) were harvested and immunoblotted for various proteins as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjanes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harberts et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, plates were centrifuged (250 × <italic>g</italic>) to rid supernatants of cell debris. Proteins in supernatants were then precipitated by incubating with 0.61 N trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC; Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 1 hr on ice. Precipitates were washed with acetone by centrifugation (×3) at 4°C and resuspended in protein sample buffer (125 mM Tris, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.06% bromophenol blue, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM dithiothreitol). Proteins from combined supernatant and lysate samples were precipitated using methanol and chloroform. Lysates were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% TritonX-100, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1×PIC and 1×protein sample buffer and rocked gently for 10 min at 4°C. Protein levels were normalized using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples from lysates and/or supernatants were then prepared for SDS-PAGE by boiling and centrifugation (tabletop max speed; 5 min) before they were run on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with the following antibodies: caspase-11 rat (1:1000; Novus Biologicals 17D9), mCherry rabbit (1:1000; Abcam EPR20579), GSDMD rabbit (1:500; Abcam EPR19828), FLAG (1:1000; Cell Signaling 2368S). β-actin mouse monoclonal Ab (1:2500; Sigma-Aldrich AC74), or GAPDH rabbit monoclonal Ab (1:2500; Cell Signaling Tech 14C10). Blots were then incubated in species-specific, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2500) and imaged on the Odyssey M Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) or by chemiluminescence using Pierce SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (ThermoFisher #34095).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Casp11 immunoprecipitation</title><p>HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged construct for 48 hr.

To address this question, we have utilized a stably-expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged CASP11 construct in HEK cells. Critically, the N-terminal FLAG CASP11-expressiing HEK cells also display speck formation that is not observed in the presence of the caspase inhibitor zVAD or with the catalytic mutant C254A CASP11, matching our BMDM data as well as the data observed with the C-terminal CASP11-mCherry construct. Importantly, in the stable expression system, we do not observe spontaneous speck formation, but rather, observe LPS-inducible speck formation, consistent with our findings in BMDMs. Altogether, these data conclusively demonstrate that the location of the tag does not influence the behavior of CASP11 specks, and that catalytic activity is important for LPS-induced speck formation regardless of the tag location. These data are now found in new Figure 3 and discussed on pp. 6-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Whether intracellular pathogens yield the same results as seen from LPS.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate this question, and also believe it is important. We therefore tested whether the intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> also induces Casp11 specks (new Figure 1F and G). Indeed, consistent with our initial observations, <italic>Legionella</italic> infection induces Casp11 specks in BMDMs expressing Casp11-mCherry. However, unlike cytosolic LPS, we observed that <italic>Legionella</italic>-induced speck formation is independent of catalytic activity, suggesting that whole organisms might initiate and propagate the noncanonical inflammasome through additional mechanisms beyond catalytic activity and autoprocessing. These data are now included in Figure 1 and discussed further in the results (p. 5) and discussion (p. 11) sections of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Further explore and address concerns regarding the results presented in Figures 4/5 (trans/cis cleave).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data do not definitively demonstrate that <italic>‘cis’</italic> cleavage is occurring exclusively. Our data do demonstrate that the same molecule needs to be catalytically active and competent for processing in order to form specks and to recruit a catalytic mutant to the speck. We have therefore modified our discussion of these data to focus on autoprocessing generally, and raise the possibility of <italic>‘cis’</italic> cleavage as being important in speck formation in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very well-designed and timely study, nevertheless, there are a few aspects that can be strengthened.</p><p>In Figure 1, cytotoxicity induction for a transduced system is pretty low.

A more defined analysis of pyroptosis may also be useful for the suggestions made for Figures 4 and 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion. The relatively low cytotoxicity is due to the low transduction efficiency of primary BMDMs, as the overall number of transduced primary BMDMs is quite low, thereby leading to low cell death signal in a bulk assay such as LDH. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have instead utilized a single cell-based membrane integrity/pore formation assay based on live/dead zombie dye uptake. The new data are included in new Figure 1B of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 (and related supplementary figures), since the authors used a pan-caspase inhibitor, it would be important to show that death is driven by pyroptosis (either by using glycine, and/or HEK cells not transfected with GSDMD).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which describes experiments involving co-transfection of Casp11-mCherry with GSDMD constructs into HEK293T cells, the cytotoxicity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and cell viability (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C) were both normalized to similarly treated 293T cells lacking GSDMD. Thus, any elevated cell death can robustly be attributed to casp11-mediated pyroptosis. Studies in Figure 2D-F involve transfection of HEK293T cells with Casp11-mCherry alone; as HEK293T cells lack robust constitutive levels of other pyroptosis machinery, these cells do not undergo pyroptosis. Nonetheless, zVAD demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of Casp11 self-cleavage (as shown by diminishing levels of p10-mCherry in Figure 2D). Thus, although zVAD is a pan-caspase inhibitor, we concluded that its impact on CASP11-mCherry speck formation (Figure 2E, F) is due to Casp11 antagonism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data shown in Figure 3D, F are very interesting but challenge the model proposed. It is important to better highlight, both in the abstract and the introduction, that cleavage of casp11 itself is not sufficient to induce the oligomerization/speck formation and that additional roles are played by Cys-254.

The authors may want to discuss this evidence together.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and agree that the autoprocessing mutant does not have quite as strong a phenotype in downstream outcomes (LDH release or live/dead dye uptake) as it has on speck formation. This is consistent with findings in the literature for other caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-1. We have updated the manuscript to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 lacks the analyses of the level of pyroptosis, which should be not paired with the presence of mCherry specks when C254A-expressing cells also express wt Casp11.

We have included two new figures to test whether pyroptosis and GSDMD cleavage are impacted in cells co-expressing C254A-mCherry and unlabeled WT Casp11 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C and Figure 5E). Importantly, activity of WT Casp11 is neither enhanced nor inhibited by co-transfection with catalytically inactive or noncleavable caspase-11 mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an elegant study, the manuscript and figures are clear, and conclusions are supported by data.</p><p>One experiment would be to try to biochemically crosslink and isolate endogenous, untagged Casp11 specks upon LPS transfection of primed macrophages (e.g. after priming through IFNs or TLRs). This would mimic the natural upregulation and activation of endogenous Casp11.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We are in the process of establishing systems to isolate and biochemically characterize endogenous Casp11 oligomers. Nonetheless, we believe that more extensive biochemical analysis of Casp11 oligomers is outside the scope of this current work, whose focus is on the cell biology of Casp11 oligomerization in response to cytosolic LPS. We believe that our new experiments to address reviewers’ concerns provide new insight and strong support for the catalytic activity model. Our future studies will involve more biochemical analysis of endogenous Casp11 complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another question is whether this model applies to human orthologues, Casp4/5.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting and important question. Whether the human orthologs also behave this way, and whether other initiator or inflammatory caspases also behave this way are important questions. However, here too we believe that experimentally addressing this question will involve extensive further analysis that is beyond the scope of the current work, and is being pursued in ongoing studies in our labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And finally, what happens after actual intracellular pathogen detection when the pathogen itself serves as a signalling platform? Are specks stills formed (or even needed)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question, which we agree is important to address here. We have tested whether an intracellular pathogen can induce specks (Figure 1F-G). Like purified LPS, non-flagellated <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> induces Casp11 specks in BMDMs. Interestingly, catalytic mutant Casp11-mCherry also formed specks robustly in the presence of intracellular <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, suggesting that other structural components of the whole bacteria might dictate Casp11 oligomerization in a manner that supersedes Casp11 catalytic activity. This is discussed in the new Results section for Figure 1 (p. 5), as well as in the Discussion section (p. 11).</p></body></sub-article></article>
