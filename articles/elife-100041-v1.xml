biodiversity and ecosystem functioning stands as a cornerstone in ecological research. Extensive evidence now underscores the profound impact of species loss on the stability and dynamics of ecosystem functions. However, it remains unclear whether the loss of genetic diversity within key species yields similar consequences. Here, we delve into the intricate relationship between species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem functions across three trophic levels – primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers – in natural aquatic ecosystems. Our investigation involves estimating species diversity and genome-wide diversity – gauged within three pivotal species – within each trophic level, evaluating seven key ecosystem functions, and analyzing the magnitude of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEFs). We found that, overall, the absolute effect size of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions mirrors that of species diversity in natural ecosystems. We nonetheless unveil a striking dichotomy: while genetic diversity was positively correlated with various ecosystem functions, species diversity displays a negative correlation with these functions. These intriguing antagonist effects of species and genetic diversity persist across the three trophic levels (underscoring its systemic nature), but were apparent only when BEFs were assessed within trophic levels rather than across them. This study reveals the complexity of predicting the consequences of genetic and species diversity loss under natural conditions, and emphasizes the need for further mechanistic models integrating these two facets of biodiversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When we speak about the loss of biodiversity, we often think of the loss of different species from an ecosystem. However, when ecosystems start to lose biodiversity, often, the first thing lost is diversity within species. This is, individuals of the same species become more like one another, leading to a loss of variety within a species.</p><p>This can cause issues at the species level as a lack of variation means that the species as a whole is less able to adapt to new environmental challenges, which can potentially lead to extinction. Humans are driving a loss of biodiversity worldwide, but it is unclear how the loss of diversity within a species affects ecosystems.</p><p>To answer this question, Fargeot et al. analyzed a complete food chain in an aquatic ecosystem in the wild, quantifying species diversity and using genetic tools to quantify within-species diversity. The researchers also quantified seven ecosystem functions associated with the ecosystem's productivity (how much biomass the ecosystem produces) and its ability to degrade dead organic matter.</p><p>Fargeot et al. found that the effects of losing within-species diversity in the ecosystem were as impactful as losing species diversity. The scientists also discovered that the relative impact of within- and between-species diversity on ecosystems were opposite. Losing species surprisingly increased the rate of ecosystem function, which also increased the amount of biomass produced and the amount of degraded organic matter. Conversely, losing diversity within species slowed down these ecosystem functions and thus decreased the services they can provide to humans.</p><p>These findings imply that measuring the loss of both within-species and between-species diversity is necessary to fully understand the effects of biodiversity loss. This will inform both conservation and agricultural efforts, where within-species diversity is often ignored.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>crustaceans</kwd><kwd><italic>Alnus</italic></kwd><kwd>fish</kwd><kwd><italic>Phoxinus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Gammarus</italic></kwd><kwd>riparian trees</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE02-0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Blanchet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Blanchet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic diversity is strongly associated with ecosystem functions across natural trophic chains, showing that it can be as important as species diversity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diversity <italic>within</italic> and <italic>among</italic> species are both important to ensure and stabilize ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>). Studies on the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEFs) have primarily focused on the interspecific (species) facet of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balvanera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooper et al., 2005</xref>). However, the intraspecific (genetic) facet of biodiversity has also recently been shown to have substantial effects on ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crutsinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes and Stachowicz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reusch et al., 2005</xref>). Recent meta-analyses have shown that genetic diversity of plant and animal populations affect ecosystem functions, and that the magnitude (and shape) of intraspecific BEFs is similar to that of species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Although natural assemblages encompass both intra- and interspecific diversity, most studies investigating BEFs are considering each biodiversity facet separately (but see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fridley and Grime, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prieto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grele et al., 2024</xref>). This makes it difficult to differentiate the relative role of genetic and species diversity in ecosystem functions, impeding general predictions regarding the consequences of biodiversity loss as a whole on ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchet et al., 2023</xref>). For instance, we are currently unaware whether the loss of genetic diversity within a few species in an assemblage is as detrimental for ecosystem functions as a species loss, or whether the combined loss of genetic and species diversity may have non-additive consequences for ecosystem dynamics. Although these biodiversity loss scenarios are realistic, our knowledge on the relative role of genetic vs. species diversity in ecosystem functions are still too scarce to provide reliable predictions.</p><p>The few studies investigating the combined effects of genetic and species diversity on ecosystem functions were all conducted experimentally by manipulating the genetic and species diversity of assemblages under controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fridley and Grime, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargrave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prieto et al., 2015</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grele et al., 2024</xref>). Our understanding of genetic (intraspecific) and species (interspecific) BEFs therefore relies on simplified ecosystems that often lack variation in other factors (including spatial scales, abiotic factors, etc.), and in which feedbacks between ecosystem functions and biodiversity are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prunier et al., 2023</xref>). However, knowledge acquired from BEFs at the interspecific level reveals that environmental variation can either reduce or enhance the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functions, hence generating large variance in the magnitude and direction of BEFs measured in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Plas, 2019</xref>). One can therefore predict that, under natural conditions, the relative influence of genetic and species diversity on ecosystem functions may deviate from what has been quantified under controlled conditions, although it is difficult to predict the direction of this deviation as field studies (in particular for genetic BEFs) are too scarce to generate clear predictions. Therefore, we need further realistic field studies of BEFs, embracing the whole diversity of life forms (from genes to species) and across realistic environmental gradients to test whether – under natural conditions – species and genetic BEFs are of similar magnitude.</p><p>BEF studies often consider a single trophic level, despite accumulating evidence that biodiversity at a given trophic level can propagate across trophic levels, generating ‘multi-trophic BEFs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefcheck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soliveres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seibold et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, studies testing the joint effects of genetic and species diversity on ecosystem functions have mostly considered the effect of primary producer diversity on their own productivity (‘<italic>within-trophic level BEFs’</italic>, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hargrave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prieto et al., 2015</xref>). However, genetic and species diversity within a given trophic level may have propagating effects on the ecosystem at other trophic levels (hereafter, ‘<italic>between-trophic level BEFs’</italic>). Indeed, it is predicted that a genetically diverse predator population shares their resources more efficiently than a genetically poor predator population, which might permit a higher prey species coexistence and hence a larger prey biomass (<italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs due to genetic diversity, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raffard et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, a species-rich community of primary producers likely exhibits higher primary production, as organisms in species-rich communities share basal resources more efficiently than in species-poor communities (<italic>within-trophic level BEFs due to species diversity</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balvanera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooper et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, the relative impact of genetic and species diversity should be inconsistent across trophic. At higher trophic levels (e.g. predators), species richness is generally lower, which should increase the likelihood for genetic diversity (of a few species) to have strong effects on functions. A simple prediction might therefore be that the relative impact of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions should increase with increasing trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchet et al., 2020</xref>). Studies considering genetic and species BEFs under a realistic multi-trophic scenario may thus help understanding the trophic contexts under which either genetic or species diversity is more impactful on ecosystem functions than the other, and to test whether genetic and species effects can propagate across trophic levels or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seibold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we conducted a field study to test the relative importance of genetic and species diversity for ecosystem functions across multiple trophic levels in a natural landscape. We focused on three trophic levels from river ecosystems; riparian trees (primary producers), macroinvertebrate shredders (primary consumers), and fish (secondary consumers). For each trophic level, we quantified the species diversity of each community, as well as the genetic diversity of a single target and dominant species (<italic>Alnus glutinosa</italic>, <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp., and <italic>Phoxinus dragarum</italic> respectively). We further estimated several ecosystem functions, including leave decomposition of riparian trees, biomass (as productivity estimates) of each target species, and total biomass of each community within each trophic level. We relied on causal analyses, taking into account the direct and indirect effects of the environment (through biodiversity) on ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2016</xref>) to test (i) whether BEFs measured at the genetic level (<italic>genetic</italic> BEFs) are similar in magnitude and direction to BEFs measured at the species level (<italic>species</italic> BEFs); and (ii) whether <italic>within-trophic level</italic> BEFs are similar in magnitude than <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs. We also tested whether the relative effects of species and genetic diversity on ecosystem functions (within or between trophic levels) are consistent across the three trophic levels (primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers), in order to generalize findings along the trophic chain. We predicted that – contrary to what has been observed under controlled conditions – <italic>genetic</italic> BEFs and <italic>species</italic> BEFs will not be similar in magnitude, especially because environmental variation may modulate each of them differentially. We further expected that significant genetic and species BEFs will be observed both <italic>within-</italic> and <italic>between</italic>-trophic levels, leading to <italic>within-</italic> and <italic>between</italic>-trophic levels of similar magnitude. Finally, we predicted that the magnitude of <italic>genetic</italic> BEFs will be higher (than that of <italic>species</italic> BEFs) at the highest trophic level (secondary consumers) than at the lowest trophic level (primary producers), mainly because species richness at higher trophic levels presents a lower gradient than at the lowest trophic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Location of sampling sites and illustration of the trophic chain.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Distribution of the 52 sampling sites (black dots) spanning an east-west gradient at the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains (France).

Overall, direct environmental effects on ecosystem functions did not predominate, and environmental effect sizes were similar (in strength) to that of biodiversity effects, showing the non-negligible role of biodiversity for ecosystem functions in the wild.</p><p>Individual effect sizes (Zr) measured between BEFs (biodiversity and ecosystem functions relationships) were weak to moderate, irrespective of the considered ecosystem function and of the type of BEFs (<italic>genetic/species BEFs</italic>, <italic>within-trophic level/between-trophic level</italic> BEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Indeed, for BEFs measured within the same trophic level, the effects of species diversity across multiple ecosystem functions were moderately negative on average, whereas the effects of genetic diversity were moderately positive. This suggests an antagonistic effect between the genetic and the species components of biodiversity in the modulation of ecosystem functions within one trophic level. This antagonistic effect was not identified for BEFs measured across trophic levels, since in these cases the influence of both genetic diversity and species diversity across multiple ecosystem functions was generally not different from zero. These conclusions hold true across three trophic levels (plants, invertebrates, and fish), indicating that the relative effects of genetic and species diversity on ecosystem functions are not limited to a specific trophic level.</p><p>Our study is one of the few field-based study revealing BEFs across an entire (riverine) food chain spanning from primary producers to secondary consumers. Indeed, most previous BEF studies in the field focused on a single trophic level, and predominantly on terrestrial primary producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Plas, 2019</xref>, but see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moi et al., 2021</xref>). This permitted encompassing a broad range of ecosystem functions that depict the overall functioning of a riverine ecosystem (rather than focusing on a single compartment). Moreover, we focused both on the effects of genetic and species diversity on these ecosystem functions, which has rarely (if not ever) been evaluated so far and which provides an exhaustive overview of BEFs in the wild. Our causal analyses also statistically took into account the direct (and indirect) effect of environmental factors on ecosystem functions, which is a prerequisite to isolate biodiversity effects. Nonetheless, causal relationships obtained from observational data (rather than from experimental data) are notoriously difficult to infer and must therefore be interpreted with care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, the BEFs we estimated display strong variability (ranging from negative to positive values) and a very few of them (4 out of 34) were statistically significant according to conventional thresholds. Although the statistical inferences made in this study are based on a large sample size, it is noteworthy that the general patterns we will describe hereafter (and their interpretation) have to be considered with care, as we cannot rule out the possibility that some patterns might arise because of statistical biases rather than biological reality. Nonetheless, we – as ecologists – feel important to provide such a general picture from field data (even if partially distort by statistical limits), as this represents basic patterns that we have to understand.</p><p>We revealed that direct environmental effects on ecosystem functions were (in average) not stronger in intensity than biodiversity effects, which is coherent with previous syntheses on species BEFs in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, environmental factors used to describe sampling sites in this study were not strong predictors of species and genetic biodiversity. Two non-exclusive hypotheses may explain this observation: (i) using PCA axes to resume environmental gradients may blur some specific environment-biodiversity links, and (ii) as shown and explained in a companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>), the east-west gradient used in this study (rather than a classical upstream-downstream gradient) intrinsically limits the potential for strong environmental effects on biodiversity (which was the purpose of this sampling design). Nonetheless, after accounting for these environmental covariates, we found that most individual BEFs (either <italic>genetic</italic> or <italic>species</italic>, <italic>within-trophic levels</italic> or <italic>between-trophic levels</italic> BEFs) were weak to moderate in magnitude, and that they operated almost equally in both direction (i.e. positive and negative association between BEFs). As such, the distribution of individual effect sizes was centered around 0, for both <italic>genetic</italic> and <italic>species</italic> BEFs. Accordingly, there were only four individual BEFs that were significant, three out of them were negative and one was positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This general pattern (low to moderate BEFs with both positive and negative direction) is actually consistent with the most exhaustive meta-analysis having synthesized the magnitude and direction of <italic>species</italic> BEFs in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Plas, 2019</xref>) and with recent conceptual works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>) concluding that strong and positive BEFs should not be the norm in natural ecosystems, but rather that a mix of positive, neutral, and negative BEFs are expected. Our empirical findings are consistent with this conclusion.</p><p>We focused both on <italic>within-trophic level</italic> and <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs, which likely encompasses a broad array of mechanisms sustaining potential associations between BEFs. For instance, two out of the four significant BEFs we reveal are negative association between species diversity (fish or tree species diversity respectively) and the biomass production of one of the target species (<italic>Phoxinus</italic> sp. and <italic>Alnus</italic> sp. respectively). These <italic>within-trophic level</italic> BEFs can – for instance – arise either because, if resources are limited, increased number of species within a patch limit the biomass production of each individual species, or because of a poorer competitive ability of the target species under some environmental conditions, which favors the settlement of additional species. Teasing apart these two hypotheses is difficult and further studies are needed to isolate underlying mechanisms. The other two significant BEFs concerned the association (either positive or negative) between the genetic diversity of a target species (<italic>Alnus</italic> sp. or <italic>Phoxinus</italic> sp.) with the biomass production of another target species (<italic>Phoxinus</italic> sp. or <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp<italic>.</italic>, respectively). These <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs likely arise through indirect effects implying the diversity and availability of (prey) resources. An obvious limit of this field-based study is the impossibility to tease out these mechanisms. Another limit is associated with the fact that, although environmental covariates were taken into account in causal models, they were synthetized by two PCA axes, and we cannot ensure that all potential environmental covariates have been taken into account (see above). This can influence the actual estimates of BEFs in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that we have previously shown that – in this dataset – species and genetic diversity were not correlated one to each other and that each biodiversity facet was sustained by different environmental predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This implies that environmental and biodiversity effects inferred in this study should not be strongly distorted by collinearities and can – in theory – be interpreted independently one from each other (e.g. the positive effect <italic>Phoxinus</italic> genetic diversity on <italic>Phoxinus</italic> biomass is independent from the negative of fish species diversity as the two estimates of biodiversity do not covary, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><p>Keeping limitations associated with field-based studies into account (see above), revealing associations between ecosystem functions and species and genetic biodiversity (or the lack of) in natural ecosystems, is an important step forward to set theoretical and experimental approaches aiming at understanding this complex biological reality. Beyond individual BEF case studies (that were not the main aim of this study), their aggregation across trophic levels and biodiversity facets revealed a clear (and statistically supported) pattern whereby, within trophic levels, genetic and species diversity display antagonistic association with ecosystem functions; the global effect of species diversity across multiple ecosystem functions was negative, whereas the global effect of genetic diversity was positive. This pattern emerges from the ‘cumulative’ effects of weak to moderate associations between BEFs that consistently point toward the same direction (positive for genetic diversity, negative for species diversity), emphasizing the meaningfulness of meta-regressions (and more generally approaches based on effect sizes rather than on p-values) to reveal biological patterns. We hereafter discuss the ecological relevance of this general pattern.</p><p>Our results confirm a previous meta-analysis demonstrating that genetic and species diversity modulates ecosystem functions with a similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>), and results from few experimental studies that manipulated both the genetic and species components of biodiversity under controlled conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prieto et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, within trophic levels, the absolute mean effect size of genetic and species diversity across ecosystem functions were of the same magnitude (|Zr|=0.168 and 0.185 for genetic and species diversity effects respectively), and slightly greater than the effect sizes reported under controlled conditions (|lnRR|=0.132 and 0.134 for genetic and species diversity effects respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>) and those more generally reported for <italic>species</italic> BEFs (|Zr|=0.101, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balvanera et al., 2006</xref>). Although comparing effect sizes among studies that strikingly differ in their spatial coverage (small or large spatial scale), their taxonomic focus (e.g. primary producers vs. predators, species vs. genetic diversity, etc.) and/or their approaches (experimental vs. observational studies) is questionable (especially given the non-linear nature of BEFs), our findings suggest for the first time that under natural conditions, the effects of genetic and species components of biodiversity on ecosystem functions are comparable. However, our study goes two steps further as (i) it extends the conclusion made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>, to multiple trophic levels and (ii) it suggests that the effects of genetic and species BEFs can actually operate in opposite directions.</p><p>As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raffard et al., 2019</xref>, the vast majority (91% of 23 reviewed studies by 2019, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wan et al., 2022</xref>) of studies investigating the effects of genetic diversity on ecosystem functions have focused on primary producers, and all of them were based on experiments, which is also the case for most studies manipulating both genetic and species diversity. These trends strongly hamper any generalization. On the contrary, our findings provide a solid support for broadening the conclusion that both genetic and species diversity can influence ecosystem functions in the wild. More strikingly, our results suggest that, although the absolute effect sizes of genetic and species BEFs are of similar magnitude, for <italic>within-trophic level</italic> BEFs, the direction of their effects is opposite; species diversity (in general) reduces the rate of ecosystem functions, whereas genetic diversity enhances the same functions. For instance, all other things being equal, higher fish species diversity is associated with a lower productivity (biomass) in <italic>P. dragarum</italic> (see above for potential explanations), whereas its own genetic diversity tends to be associated with a higher productivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In this specific case, genetic and species diversity of the same trophic group (fish) tended to have opposite effects on the same function (productivity of <italic>P. dragarum</italic>). However, in most cases this was not the case as genetic diversity was positively associated with some functions, whereas species was negatively associated with other functions. The distinction between these two patterns is important as in the latter case (genetic and species diversity are associated with different functions) managing/conserving the intra- and interspecific diversity of a single trophic group (e.g. trees) can alter more than one ecosystem function, and sometimes functions that are even not directly associated to the managed trophic group. Moreover (and importantly), as genetic and species diversity have been found to be uncorrelated spatially in this landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>), covariation among diversity estimates cannot explain these patterns. These antagonistic effects of genetic and species diversity on ecosystem functions parallel previous experimental findings on plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hazard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). It is now essential to understand the mechanisms sustaining these antagonistic effects as a step forward.</p><p>S<italic>pecies</italic> BEFs were on average negative (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for individual estimates), which contrasts with the general view that species biodiversity favors ecosystem functions, although it is not that surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, the net effect of species biodiversity on ecosystem functions results from the combined effects of both negative factors, arising from antagonistic interactions such as negative complementarity or negative selection effect, and positive factors, arising from beneficial interactions such as niche complementarity or facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loreau and Hector, 2001</xref>). We can speculate that, in our case, the net effect of interspecific interactions mostly results from negative complementarity among species (or strong negative selection effect), whereas the net effect of intraspecific interactions may result from facilitative interactions and/or improved niche complementarity with increased genetic diversity. Intraspecific competition is generally stronger than interspecific competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connell, 1983</xref>), and intraspecific interactions could be expected to lead more frequently to negative complementarity (and hence negative <italic>genetic</italic> BEFs) than interspecific interactions. Since we observe the opposite, we can hypothesize that genetic diversity is essential to increase niche complementarity within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolnick et al., 2003</xref>) and hence to reduce the pervasive effects of intraspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prunier et al., 2023</xref>). Given the empirical nature of our study and the fact that our meta-regressive approach includes several types of BEFs (e.g. species richness acting either on the biomass of a single focal species or on the biomass of an entire focal community), it is hard to tease apart specific and underlying mechanisms. Theoretical approaches, modeling simultaneously the genetic and species components of biodiversity, would be extremely useful to reveal the mechanisms sustaining opposite effects of intra- and interspecific diversity on ecosystem functions.</p><p>These antagonistic effects were observed only for BEFs measured <italic>within</italic> trophic levels, not for those measured <italic>between</italic> trophic levels. An overall <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEF not different from zero suggests that biodiversity at a trophic level has only limited impact on ecosystem functions at another trophic level. For example, the biomass of <italic>P. dragarum</italic> was primarily influenced by genetic and species diversity in fishes, rather than the diversity of their preys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, for both genetic and species estimates of biodiversity, there was a substantial variation in effect sizes for <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs that ranged from negative to positive BEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that biodiversity effects across trophic levels may be more variable in their direction than within-trophic level BEFs, which appear as more constrained. Variability in the magnitude and direction of effect sizes for <italic>between-trophic level</italic> BEFs likely blur a more general trend, but this variation is actually expected under natural conditions in which interactions involve multiple prey and predator species, fostering co-adaptation among communities from different trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubree et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poisot et al., 2013</xref>). In these cases, trophic complementarity between two trophic levels (i.e. the originality of a species based on the identity of the species it interacts with) might be a stronger determinant of ecosystem functions than complementarity measured at either one of the two trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poisot et al., 2013</xref>). Quantifying trophic complementarity among our three target species (and communities) using stable isotope or gut content analyses for instance would be extremely valuable to assess whether this complexity can better explain BEFs between trophic levels than diversity measured at one of the trophic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubree et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The empirical patterns we revealed here were all extremely consistent across the three trophic levels, hence allowing generalization. It is noteworthy that, although statistically strong and consistent, these patterns must be interpreted with care as field-based approaches are limited in properly taking into account the environmental heterogeneity of natural ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>). BEFs were not particularly stronger at any specific trophic level and the relative effects of genetic and species diversity were not dependent on the trophic level at which the function was estimated. We may have expected a stronger top-down regulation (i.e. biodiversity of predators has more effects than biodiversity of preys) of ecosystem functions since previous studies showed that biodiversity loss should have greater consequences for multi-functionality when it occurs at higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefcheck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seibold et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, increased genetic diversity within a predatory fish species has experimentally been shown to indirectly increase the rate of litter decomposition by increasing the diversity of shredders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raffard et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the relative effects of genetic and species diversity on functions may have varied among trophic levels, and in particular the relative importance of genetic diversity may have been higher for species-poor trophic levels (i.e. fish community) because of a ‘compensatory effect’. We found no evidence for these potential trophic-level dependencies, but instead found extremely consistent patterns, which, from a broader perspective, reveal the importance of integrating both multi-trophic and multi-faceted approaches in predicting the overall consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning.</p><p>To conclude, we found that the genetic (intraspecific) and species (interspecific) facets of biodiversity are both important drivers of multiple ecosystem functions in a natural and multi-trophic context. In the wild, these two facets of biodiversity can, as expected, generate low to moderately high impacts on ecosystem functions measured across three trophic levels, and they can operate in opposite directions (but on different functions; genetic diversity is positively associated with some functions, species diversity is negatively associated with other functions). This shows the importance for managers to develop integrative conservation plans spanning the entire diversity of life (from genes to species). For instance, genetic diversity loss often precedes species loss, and our results suggest that – in mountain streams – losing genes may actually be particularly detrimental for the performance of ecosystem functions. As such, it appears essential to maintain populations with high levels of genetic diversity in these ecosystems. Future studies should (i) extend these findings to other ecosystems and by quantifying natural genetic variation in more than a single species per trophic level, (ii) generate theoretical predictions regarding the mechanisms sustaining the antagonistic effects of genetic and species diversity on functions we revealed, and (iii) use a broader integrative approach for estimating biodiversity across facets (<italic>inclusive</italic> biodiversity) by using either a trait-based approach or a genetic-based approach as recently proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchet et al., 2023</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling sites and trophic chain</title><p>We sampled 52 sites in Southern France from the Adour-Garonne watershed, and distributed along an east-west gradient in the Pyrenees Mountains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchet, 2024</xref>). We acquired data on species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem functions at three trophic levels (primary producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Riparian trees (57 species in the sampled area) provide organic matter in the form of fallen leaves as a food source for decomposers. We selected the common alder <italic>A. glutinosa</italic> for acquisition of genetic data due to its dominance at most sites and its functional relevance, as its roots serve as shelters for many aquatic species and are involved in nitrogen fixation. Macroinvertebrate shredders (101 genera in the sampled area) are primary consumers using leaves as resources, and converting them into accessible organic matter for other species. We focused on the most abundant Gammarid (Crustacean) species for genetic data acquisition, referred to as <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. This species has not yet been formally named although it is phylogenetically distinct from its closest relative, <italic>Gammarus fossarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carnevali, 2022</xref>; Piscart, unpublished data). This species is particularly efficient at decomposing tree leaves, in particular those from <italic>Alnus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macneil et al., 1997</xref>). Fish (20 species in the sampled area) are secondary consumers feeding on invertebrates (among others). We used the minnow <italic>P. dragarum</italic> as the fish target species as it is an abundant and important predator strongly impacting invertebrate communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raffard et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Biodiversity estimates</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Species datasets</title><p>At each site, we collected data on the abundance of all species within each trophic level, at one occasion for trees (July-August 2021) and two occasions for invertebrates (July and November 2020) and fishes (mid-July to mid-August 2020 and 2021), to obtain accurate biodiversity estimates. We identified tree species along a 200 m transect of each river bank, excluding trees with trunk smaller than 2 cm in diameter and more than 1 m away from the bank. The abundances of trees were estimated as the total number of individuals per species and per site. For invertebrates, we identified shredders to the genus level (or to the family level for some groups such as chironomids) sampled from two types of standardized traps installed in four micro-habitats distributed along the 200 m transect used to identify trees: natural coconut brushes (15*5.5 cm, bristles length 7.5 cm) recovered after 1.5 month of colonization, and litter bags (15*11 cm, 0.8 cm mesh size) filled with senescent <italic>Alnus</italic> leaves from each site and recovered after 9 days of colonization (see below). We calculated abundances of each genus by summing the number of individuals per genus found in the coco brushes and the litter bags, and we averaged the abundances over the two sampling occasions to get a single estimate per genus per site. For fish, we collected all specimens during single-pass electric fishing sessions over a mean area of ~469.9 m<sup>2</sup> (±174 m<sup>2</sup>) distributed along the 200 m transect. We anesthetized, identified, and counted individuals at the species level. We calculated fish abundances as the number of individuals per species and per m², and we averaged the abundances over the two sampling occasions as for invertebrates. Fish species number varies from 1 to 11, invertebrate genus number varies from 15 to 42, and the tree species number varies from 7 to 20 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>, for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Genetic datasets</title><p>At each site, we collected tissue from up to 32 individuals of each of the three target species, a sample size having found sufficient for estimating the genomic diversity of populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hale et al., 2012</xref>). We collected fresh leaves of <italic>A. glutinosa</italic> in May 2020, specimens of <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. in February 2020, and a piece of pelvic fin from <italic>P. dragarum</italic> individuals in summer 2020. The DNA of these samples was extracted using commercial kits for <italic>Alnus</italic> and <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. and a salt-extraction protocol for <italic>P. dragarum</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>, for details). For each specimen, DNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA). Sequencing was performed based on equimolar pools of DNA (‘pool-seq’ approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlötterer et al., 2014</xref>) from each population and each species. For <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp., we also obtained an ~600 bp mitochondrial sequence from the COI mitochondrial gene from each individual to ensure identification and avoid mixing individuals from different species. <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. was found allopatric in most sites, but for a few sites from the eastern part of the area in which two species were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carnevali, 2022</xref>). In this latter case, we conserve only the target species for creating the DNA pools. We created one DNA pool per site per species (52 pools for <italic>A. glutinosa</italic>, 47 pools for <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp., and 44 pools for <italic>P. dragarum</italic>) and performed double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing for <italic>A. Glutinosa</italic> and <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. (respectively, PstI/MseI and Pst/HindIII enzymes) and normalized genotyping-by-sequencing for <italic>P. dragarum</italic> (MsII enzyme). Library preparation and pool-sequencing were executed by LGC Genomics (Biosearch Technologies, Germany) on an Illumina NovaSeq (2×150 pb). Data processing was performed following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Kort et al., 2018</xref>, except that read mapping was performed on reference genomes. The genome of <italic>A. glutinosa</italic> was already available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griesmann et al., 2018</xref>), and we assembled reference genomes from Illumina short-read sequencing and PacBio long-read sequencing for <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. (available upon request) and <italic>P. dragarum</italic> (accession number on DDBJ/ENA/GenBank: JARPMJ000000000), respectively. SNP calling was performed with (i) filtering of raw sequencing files; (ii) indexing of reference genomes; (iii) mapping reads to the reference; (iv) filtering for unpaired and badly/non-mapped reads; (v) assembling all read information in a single file per population and per species; and (vi) calculating SNP allelic frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Kort et al., 2018</xref>). The total numbers of SNPs retrieved were 583,862 for <italic>A. glutinosa</italic>, 331,728 for <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp., and 414,213 for <italic>P. dragarum</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fargeot et al., 2023</xref>, for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Species and genetic diversity estimates</title><p>We calculated α-diversity per site using the Shannon entropy from the ‘hillR’ R package for both species and genetic diversity. The Shannon entropy is a metric of evenness that takes into account the distribution of allele or species abundances within each site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chao et al., 2014</xref>) by weighting each species/allele by its proportional abundance (q=1). Results were similar when using the Simpson’s diversity index (q=2, results not shown). It is noteworthy that – given the spatial extent of the sampling area and the number of sampling sites – genetic and species diversity estimated in this study constitutes a fair representation of the biodiversity found in the rivers from the Pyrenean Piedmont, covering a wide range of biological complexity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Ecosystem function measurements</title><p>At each site, we measured seven ecosystem functions. We collected biomass production data of all species at each trophic level (hereafter ‘total biomass’) and the biomass production of each target species as estimates of productivity, as well as the decomposition rate of <italic>Alnus</italic> leaves. Productivity – as we quantified it – is obviously affected by local environmental characteristics, and for this reason, we took into account these potential environmental effects (see hereafter). For riparian tree biomass, we used the trunk diameter of each single tree as a proxy of individual tree biomass, and we summed the trunk diameters of all trees found along the transect (divided by the length of the transect) to estimate the total tree biomass per site and per meter of bank. The same approach was used to estimate <italic>A. glutinosa</italic> biomass. For macroinvertebrate shredders, we estimated the total invertebrate biomass by drying all individuals for 24 hr at 60°C before weighing them (10<sup>–4</sup> g precision). The same procedure was used to estimate the biomass of <italic>Gammarus</italic> sp. For both estimates, we averaged biomasses over the two sampling sessions. For fish, (fresh) total fish biomass was estimated as the total weight of all individuals (0.01 g precision) per site, whereas <italic>P. dragarum</italic> biomass was the mass of all <italic>P. dragarum</italic> specimens per site. Fish biomasses were averaged over the two sampling sessions.</p><p>For the decomposition rate, we quantified leaf mass loss in litter bags placed in four micro-habitats per site twice (July and November 2020). We gathered and dried senescent leaves during fall 2019 from five <italic>Alnus</italic> trees per site to limit individual-specific effects on decomposition. Litter bags were 15 cm × 11 cm pockets of plastic-wire mesh (mesh size; 8 mm to allow invertebrates colonization) in which we introduced 4 g of dried leaves before closing the bags with staples. We installed three bags per micro-habitat (12 per site) that we removed sequentially after ~9 days, ~18 days, and ~27 days respectively to estimate decomposition rates. Bags were brought back to the laboratory, the remaining leaves were cleaned, dried, and weighed. Decomposition rate was estimated as the slope of leaf mass loss over time (obtained from a linear model) that we averaged across replicates and temporal sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raffard et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Environmental data</title><p>A major challenge for inferring BEFs from empirical data is to take into account the direct and indirect (through biodiversity) effects of environmental factors on ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>).

Further, pSEM uses local estimates of each linear structural equation separately (i.e. parameters are estimated from a series of independent models forming a general causal graph), which allows the inclusion of a large number of parameters despite modest sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shipley, 2009</xref>). We ran a pSEM for each ecosystem function separately (i.e. seven pSEMs, see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In each pSEM, the ecosystem function was the dependent variable whereas the six biodiversity estimates (species and genetic diversity estimated for each trophic level) and the two synthetic environmental variables were the predictors. In each model, environmental predictors were allowed to explain each biodiversity estimate (indirect effects of environmental variables through their influence on biodiversity, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For some functions (in particular those associated with plant biomass), irrelevant biodiversity-functions links were not included (e.g. the impact of fish or invertebrate diversity on tree biomasses), which results in 34 BEFs (out of the 42 possible links) having been included in the meta-regression (see hereafter).</p><p>From each pSEM, we retrieved the local parameter (standardized estimate, an equivalent to a coefficient of correlation) associated with the direct effect of each biodiversity estimate (six per function, but for some functions for which ecology-irrelevant BEFs were excluded) on the function (colored arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which provides both the magnitude and the direction of each BEF. To smoothen comparison, we calculated a standardized effect size for each BEF by applying the Fisher’s Z transformation (Zr) to the standardized estimates. Positive Zr indicate positive associations between BEFs, whereas negative Zr indicate negative relationships. The higher the absolute value of Zr, the higher the strength of the association. Zr therefore indicate both the direction (positive or negative) and the magnitude of the associations.

Here below we reply to the comments that you and the reviewer have made. We understand the critics related to the issue of the interpretation of causal relationships from observational data. We now added an entire paragraph (in the second paragraph of the Discussion) that explicitly call for a cautionary interpretation of our results. We also tried to refrain the use of certain words (e.g., “we demonstrate”) when we think it is hard to conclude. This a tricky exercise as on the one hand we gathered a large and strong database (which had been underlined by the reviewers) that should supposedly strengthen statistical inferences, but on the other hands, the inferences we’ve made are based from observational data, which obviously comes from biases (even if partially controlled statistically). We hope that you’ll find our adding appropriate to find the good balance between a strong dataset and fragile interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work used a comprehensive dataset to compare the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity within each trophic level and across three trophic levels. The results stated that species diversity had negative effects on ecosystem functions, while genetic diversity had positive effects. Additionally, these effects were observed only within each trophic level and not across the three trophic levels studied. Although the effects of biodiversity, especially genetic diversity across multi-trophic levels, have been shown to be important, there are still very few empirical studies on this topic due to the complex relationships and difficulty in obtaining data. This study collected an excellent dataset to address this question, enhancing our understanding of genetic diversity effects in aquatic ecosystems.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study collected an extensive dataset that includes species diversity of primary producers (riparian trees), primary consumers (macroinvertebrate shredders), and secondary consumers (fish). It also includes genetic diversity of the dominant species in each trophic level, biomass production, decomposition rates, and environmental data. The writing is logical and easy to follow.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The two main conclusions-(1) species diversity had negative effects on ecosystem functions, while genetic diversity had positive effects, and (2) these effects were observed only within each trophic level, not across the three levels-are overly generalized. Analysis of the raw data shows that species and genetic diversity have different effects depending on the ecosystem function. For example, neither affected invertebrate biomass, but species diversity positively influenced fish biomass, while genetic diversity had no effect. Furthermore, Table S2 reveals that only four effect sizes were significant (P &lt; 0.05): one positive genetic effect, one negative genetic effect, and two negative species effects, with two effects within a trophic level and two across trophic levels. Additionally, using a P &lt; 0.2 threshold to omit lines in the SEMs is uncommon and was not adequately justified. A more cautious interpretation of the results, with acknowledgment of the variability observed in the raw data, would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>There is actually no objective justification for having chosen p&lt;0.20. This is a subjective threshold that has been chosen to simplify the visual interpretation of causal graphs while highlighting the most biologically relevant links. We have now added a sentence stating explicitly the subjective nature of the threshold. We understand the point you raised regarding the cautionary interpretation of the results. We have now added a paragraph (just before the detailed discussion) explicitly calling for a cautionary interpretation of the results (see l. 414-424). We think this paragraph prevails for the entire discussion. Our message in this paragraph is that inferences that we’ve made can arise from both a biological reality and statistical artefacts. We can not really tease apart at this stage, and our interpretation of the results therefore has to be taken with care. We hope you’ll find the statement adequate. We prefer advertising the readers from the start rather than including cautionary note all over the discussion. We feel it was more logical and comfortable. We have also modified the text from place to place to avoid strong statement such as “we demonstrated” when we think the demonstration can not be considered as solid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>In addition to the comments from the reviewer, we have the following comments on your paper:</p><p>(1) It would be important to clarify that there could be different interpretations about one of the major findings: for within-trophic BEF relationships, genetic and species diversity have the opposite effects on ecosystem functions (i.e., positive and negative effects for genetic and species diversity, respectively). (1) One possibility is that for each specific ecosystem function, genetic and species diversity have the opposite effects. (2) The other possibility is that genetic diversity has positive effects on some functions, while species diversity has negative effects on other functions. These two possibilities can have quite different implications about the generalizability of the conclusion, mechanisms involved, and practices for ecosystem management. Therefore, it would be important to clarify that the findings from this paper are more about the second rather than the first possibility both in the discussion and conclusion sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, true, this is an important distinction and we agree with your conclusion. We have added a section in the Discussion (l. 537-545) and a note in the Conclusion (l. 625-627).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please take special caution when comparing the findings from this observational study vs. previous experimental works. (1) The different ranges of diversity in the observational vs. experimental works, together with the nonlinear nature of the BEF relationship challenge the direct comparisons of their results. That is, even if their true BEF relationship are identical, focusing on different sections of a nonlinear curve can give us different results of the estimated BEF relationships. This challenge is further aggravated when involving both genetic and species diversity because these two facets have different biological meanings as the authors have already noted. Using standardized effect size or explained variance, as this paper did, may partially get around but not truly resolve this issue. It would be important to add clarifications to make the comparisons between genetic and species diversity effects more understandable in a biological or ecological context. One possibility could be to state that both genetic and species diversity measured in this study well represent their natural gradients in this aquatic ecosystem, so that the standardized effect sizes quantify how these natural diversity gradients associate with ecosystem functions. This further points to the issue about the representatives of the genetic diversity sampled from up to 32 individuals for each species per site, which would also need clarification. We suggest the authors to identify these challenges in the discussion, so that future studies can be aware of these or even find alternative solutions. (2) The species diversity effects have quite different meanings between this study and previous observational and experimental studies. The negative effects are for the biomass of one target species from this study, while the species diversity effects are usually for the biomass of all species within a community. These two scenarios are not directly comparable. The negative relationship between species diversity and a target species' biomass can simply arise from a sampling process, for example, given the same community biomass, the more species occur in a community, the less biomass allocated to a single species, without assuming any biological interactions or species differences. And this study cannot exclude this possibility. Note that this null, sampling process is not equal to a negative covariance between biomass of a focal species and biomass of the community involving the species as stated in lines 446-448. To avoid possible mis-interpretation, we suggest the authors to revise or remove the comparison appearing in the paragraph starting from line 515.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these comments. Although we agree with the two points raised by the Editor, we must admit that we found them difficult to answer properly. See our detailed responses hereafter.</p><p>Point (1): this is true that comparisons with previous studies is tricky, especially when these comparisons also include both genetic and species components. This is a problem (a limit) for almost all comparisons in biology. We added a few lines to warn readers that these comparisons are not without any limits (see l. 414-424). Regarding the fact that « genetic and species diversity measured in this study well represent their natural gradients in this aquatic ecosystem »: all is about scales. The genetic and species diversity measured in this study are obviously representative of communities and populations of the upstream (piedmont) part of the Garonne River basin as our sampling design covers all the east-west gradient. On the other hand, these communities and populations are not representative of the entire Garonne River basin, as we lack all the downstream part of the network. We added a sentence to specify that the sampling communities are specific of this specific ecosystem (rivers from the piedmont, see l. 224-226). Regarding « the issue about the representatives of the genetic diversity sampled from up to 32 individuals », we must admit that we are surprised by this comment as it is a very classical way for estimating genomic diversity. Although there is no clear rule, 30 individuals per site is generally assumed (and has been shown) to be an appropriate sample size (especially given that we used here a genome-wide approach). We added a reference to justify the sample size.</p><p>Point (2): We understand the point raised by the Editors. Regarding your note “Note that this null, sampling process is not equal to a negative covariance between biomass of a focal species and biomass of the community involving the species as stated in lines 446-448.”: this is true, we rephrase this sentence to be more neutral. Regarding the paragraph starting l. 515 (now 550), we refrained to remove this paragraph as it provides some mechanistic explanation for underlying patterns, which we think is important even if incomplete or speculative. The confusion probably arises because here we discuss all type of negative BEFs, including the effect of species diversity on the biomass of the community, on the biomass of focal species (including those from other trophic levels) and the litter degradation. Our discussion is very general, whereas you seem to focus on a specific case of negative species-BEFs. To highlight this further and warn readers about possible conclusions, we added the following sentence: “Given the empirical nature of our study and the fact that our meta-regressive approach includes several types of BEFs (e.g., species richness acting either on the biomass of a single focal species or on the biomass of an entire focal community), it is hard to tease apart specific and underlying mechanisms” (l. 573-576).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please clarify how you derived the 95% CI in Fig. 5. For example, how did you involve the uncertainties of each raw effect size (e.g. each black triangle in Fig. 5a) when calculating their mean and 95% CI in each group (e.g., the red triangles and error bars in Fig. 5a)?</p></disp-quote><p>Estimates and 95%-CI from Figure 5 are derived from the mixed-effect models described from l. 314. They are hence marginal effects derived from the models, and 95%-CI include all error terms (fixed and random). We now specify in the Figure caption that estimates and 95%-CI are marginal effects derived from the mixed-effect models.</p></body></sub-article></article>
