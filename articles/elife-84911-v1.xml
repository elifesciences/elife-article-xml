Thus, how to avoid systematic erasing of previously encoded memories? While it has been proposed that a dual-learning system with ‘slow’ learning in the cortex and ‘fast’ learning in the hippocampus could protect previous knowledge from interference, this has never been observed in the living organism. Here, we report that increasing plasticity via the viral-induced overexpression of RGS14414 in the prelimbic cortex leads to better one-trial memory, but that this comes at the price of increased interference in semantic-like memory. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings showed that this manipulation also resulted in shorter NonREM-sleep bouts, smaller delta-waves and decreased neuronal firing rates. In contrast, hippocampal-cortical interactions in form of theta coherence during wake and REM-sleep as well as oscillatory coupling during NonREM-sleep were enhanced. Thus, we provide the first experimental evidence for the long-standing and unproven fundamental idea that high thresholds for plasticity in the cortex protect preexisting memories and modulating these thresholds affects both memory encoding and consolidation mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundacion Alfonso Martin Escudero Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro Lobato</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001710</institution-id><institution>Branco Weiss Fellowship – Society in Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Genzel</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VIDI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Genzel</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing cortical plasticity leads to better one-trial memory but more interference effects on semantic-like memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since patient H.M. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>) we know that memories are supported in the brain by a dual-learning system, but why this is the case remains unclear. Initially memories are stored in the hippocampus via synaptic changes in this more plastic brain area, known as the ‘fast learner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marr, 1970</xref>). Later during sleep these hippocampal representations support reactivations of recent memories in the neocortex, the ‘slow learner’ in the brain. Neocortical synapses are less plastic and therefore are thought to change only a little on each reinstatement. Therefore, remote memory is based on over time accumulated neocortical changes, potentially enacted during post-training consolidation mechanisms during sleep. Computational models testing why we have a dual-learning system have proposed that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marr, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marr, 1971</xref>). Further, the hippocampus would then still permit rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure and therefore the dual system would protect our memories from interference when new memories would overwrite existing ones without the dual system. Although these theories provide remarkable insights about learning and knowledge extraction, they remain computational models with – until now – no direct experimental support, due to the lack of a valid behavioral paradigm that enables examining structured knowledge extraction in rodents as well as interference effects.</p><p>To test if naturally restricted plasticity in the neocortex protects from memory interference, we artificially increased plasticity in the prelimbic cortex via the overexpression of an established plasticity-enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14414) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2019</xref>). The overexpression of RGS14414 is known to lead to increased BNDF and dendritic branching in the targeted area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2019</xref>) and thereby increase plasticity locally. This increased local plasticity makes memories, that usually would not be retained, last longer and can rescue memory-deficits accompanying aging or diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Aranda et al., 2009</xref>). However, until now, the prefrontal cortex had not been targeted and it remained unknown how increasing plasticity would affect previously acquired knowledge. We combined this plasticity manipulation in the prefrontal cortex with a novel behavioral task – the Object Space task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref>) – that allows the testing of semantic-like as well as simple memories in rodents.</p><p>The Object Space task is based on the natural tendency of rodents to explore more novel objects in more novel locations. Most object-exploration tasks use this tendency to test if animals remember the previous trial, in contrast the Object Space task consists of multiple trials – for rats five training trials – with conditions differing in the underlying statistical structure of possible object-locations in these trials. The key condition testing for the behavioral expression of semantic-like memory (Overlapping) has one location that always contains an object, while the second object can be in one of three other locations. Critically, the final training and test trial 24 hr later have the same spatial configuration, thus the animal will only show preferred exploration of the less often presented location, if they created a cumulative memory over multiple trials. The main control condition (Stable) has the same configuration for the five training trials and one new location at test. Thus, this simple-memory, control condition can be solved by either remembering the final trial or multiple trials.</p><p>Here, we adapted the Object Space task to be able to contrast how later experiences interfere with the memory of the training trials. For this, the effect of the 24 hr trial, which now functions as interference trial violating previous trained location-rules, on a newly added test trial 48 hr later (72 hr after original training) was investigated. We show that increased cortical plasticity leads to better one-trial memory performance in a simple, one-trial object location task. However, we observed that such enhanced fast learning is associated with impaired semantic-like, cumulative memories tested in the Object Space Task. In alignment with these findings, pharmacological experiments confirmed that these results were an outcome of local changes in the prelimbic cortex. Next, we assessed the learning rate by devising a computational model and this model revealed that an increased learning rate in the intervention group augmented the influence of recent in contrast to remote memories on behavior. Finally, electrophysiological experiments showed that increased plasticity leads to (1) less NonREM sleep and smaller delta waves, (2) more neurons with slower firing rates, (3) increased hippocampal-cortical connectivity measured in theta-coherence, delta-spindle-ripple coupling and increased granger causality during ripple events and (4) off-target changes in hippocampal ripples.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increasing cortical plasticity leads to more memory interference</title><p>Prelimbic plasticity was increased by the overexpression of RGS14414 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Aranda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and initially two behavioral experiments were performed using the Object Space task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref>). In this task, the condition Overlapping tests for the extraction of an underlying structure across five training trials, while the Stable condition tests for the simple memory of the last experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In both experiments, we examined the effect of an interference trial 24 hr after initial training, with object configurations violating previously trained rules, on a test trial 48 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The design was such that in the Overlapping condition remembering the training resulted in positive discrimination indices at test, in contrast the interference would lead to 0. In the control condition Stable remembering both the training or the interference would result in positive discrimination indices. Performance on the interference trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) tests the memory for the original training trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref>). Both groups performed above chance for both conditions, evidence that later differences were not due to differences in the original memory but instead effects of the interference trial.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Half the animals were injected with a lentivirus for the overexpression of RGS14414 increasing plasticity in the prelimbic cortex, the other half had a control virus.

The results in the Overlapping condition emphasize that in controls cumulative memory expression was protected from interference, but after increasing plasticity in the cortex interference effects were observed. Further, the simple memory in the Stable condition did not last until test in controls, however after increasing plasticity the memory lasted longer.</p><p>To show that these effects were a result of the interference, we conducted three control experiments. Firstly, we performed a behavioral control, in which animals did not experience the interference trial. Secondly, we performed a pharmacological control, in which animals did experience the interference, but any subsequent plasticity-related changes were inhibited in the cortex via the infusion of anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. In these experiments RGS14-overexpressing animals showed discrimination indices comparable to controls emphasizing the determinant role of the interference trial in producing opposite outcomes. Thirdly, we added an additional control, in which animals did not receive pretraining on the Object Space Task conditions, but instead were only exposed to an object configuration for one-trial. When tested 48 hr later, increased cortical plasticity led to an enhanced one-shot memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>Together, the behavioral and pharmacological results show that increasing cortical plasticity with RGS14-overexpression caused larger interference effects in a semantic-like memory task. Increased interference in this case was due to better memory for one-trial experiences and local changes in the prelimbic cortex. Thus, our experimental results verify for the first time the hypothesis that lower cortical plasticity is critical to protect previous knowledge from interference effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Memory interference is due to a higher learning rate</title><p>To characterize the build-up of a memory trace and its expression in the Object Space Task, we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref>) a computational model that progressively learns place–object associations and makes decisions about which proportion of time to spend exploring each object in order to minimize uncertainty about these place–object associations. The model employs two parameters: a learning rate α, which determines the balance between recent and remote memories, and a parameter β, which determines the balance between neophilic (preference for more novel object location) and neophobic (aversion for more novel object location) exploratory behaviors. Here, we fitted our model on the behavioral data-set to find for each individual subject the values of the model parameter set α and β that best fit the data. There was no difference in memory expression (β). However, RGS14-overexpressing animals had systematically higher learning rate (α) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, p&lt;0.05). This indicates that exploration behavior in RGS14-overexpressing animals was driven more by recent than remote memories in contrast to controls.</p><p>Thus, the modeling results show that increasing cortical plasticity with RGS14-overexpression caused larger interference effects in a semantic-like memory task due to a higher learning rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased cortical plasticity results in shorter NonREM bouts and smaller delta-waves</title><p>Sleep is supposedly the price the brain pays for plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>). The idea is that during a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout the brain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. Therefore, subsequently during sleep, previous waking activity would lead locally to larger delta-waves (1–4 Hz) and spontaneous activity during these oscillations in NonREM sleep should renormalize net synaptic strength and restore cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huber et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To test this, after viral-injection rats were implanted with hyperdrives containing 16 tetrodes targeting the hippocampus and prelimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We recorded each day 7 hr of neural activity during training as well as sleep in the Object Space task (OS) and compared this to a home cage control (HC). Surprisingly, RGS14-overexpressing animals showed less NonREM sleep (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> combining all sleep periods in the 7 hr recording day), which can be attributed to shorter bout lengths (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). They also had slightly longer REM bout lengths (p=0.048, sleep stages over time <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sleep and Firing Rates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Animals received RGS14 overexpressing (n=4) or control (n=4) virus and were implanted with a hyperdrive (10 tetrode prelimbic, 6 tetrodes hippocampus) three weeks later.

We detected delta-waves in the cortex and hippocampus, surprisingly in both groups the hippocampus presented with a higher rate of delta-oscillations (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, RGS14 showed even higher rates than controls in the hippocampus (p&lt;0.0001). But only in controls, we observed that cortical delta-waves occurred more after learning (OS vs HC, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) while their intrinsic frequency decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, delta amplitudes presented with a different pattern. In controls, delta-waves were smaller in the hippocampus in contrast to the cortex (p&lt;0.0001), but in RGS14-overexpressing animals cortical delta-waves were as small as their respective hippocampal delta-waves and significantly smaller than cortical delta-waves in controls (p&lt;0.0001). In both groups and brain areas delta amplitude increased after learning (all OS vs HC p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Combining this analysis with analysis of neuronal activity (spikes) lets us determine more accurately the length of the respective on and off periods underlying the delta wave. RGS14-overexpressing animals presented with longer off periods than controls (p&lt;0.01). However, known homeostatic changes, where off-period durations decrease over longer sleep periods, remained the same in both groups (Post Trial period X type interaction p&lt;0.0001 but no interaction with group all p&gt;0.8).</p><p>In sum, in controls we could confirm the proposition that learning and therefore plastic changes lead to a homeostatic response with increases in delta wave activity. However, we show that artificially increasing plasticity in the prelimbic cortex does not lead to a simple enhancement of this effect. Instead, we observed in RGS14-overexpressing animals that cortical delta-waves become as small as hippocampal delta-waves, off-periods become longer and less NonREM sleep is obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>More neurons with slower firing rates after plasticity-increase</title><p>Next, we focused on neuronal firing of individual neurons in the prelimbic cortex. We first determined the firing rate of each neuron during task performance and noticed that RGS14-overexpressing animals showed more neurons with low firing rates (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). When splitting neurons in controls into pentiles according to their firing rate and applying the same margins to RGS14-overexpressing animals, the two lowest firing rate groups represented 40% of the neurons in controls but 75% in RGS14 (p=0.0005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, same for split performed on wake in sleep box or sleep states see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Moving to neuronal firing during sleep, only faster-firing neurons showed decreases in firing rate across different wake and sleep states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and this was the same for both groups. Spikes were less phase-locked to the slow oscillations in RGS14-overexpressing animals, which was seen for all firing rate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, p&lt;0.0001). However, faster-firing neurons contributed the most spiking activity to the upstate and with a decrease of these neurons in RGS14, these animals presented less spikes in the upstate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This decrease in upstate activity likely underlies the decrease in delta-wave amplitude.</p><p>To ensure firing rate differences were not a result of differences in learning itself, firing rates during the period before the first trial was calculated. Most animals did not sleep in this period, thus we focused on wake firing rates and the same difference was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, p&lt;0.0001). Next, firing rates during the OS trials as well as during the periods directly after the trials (PT 1–8 wake and NREM) were normalized to pre-task rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In RGS14 there was a larger increase in firing rates from pre-task in comparison to controls (p&lt;0.0001), further evidence that in RGS14 neurons were more plastic and changed more due to experience. Interestingly, RGS14 generally increased their firing rates over the day and presented with higher rates in comparison to pre-task during all time periods (one-sample t-test to 1 p=0.003–0001). In contrast, for Veh during task there was an increase (p=0.0004) but then during following NonREM a decrease in firing rates (p=0.0005) in comparison to pre-task. There was no change for PT wake. These effects were not seen on home cage days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, RGS-overexpressing animals had more prelimbic neurons with slower firing rates. These results provide the first causal evidence that increasing synaptic plasticity shifts the neural firing towards the slow firing end of the neural firing spectrum. Furthermore, because it is the faster-firing neurons that dominate upstate spiking activity and therefore delta amplitude, the slowing of firing rates in the more plastic neurons is most likely the cause of the smaller delta waves seen in these animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increased hippocampal-cortical connectivity during wake and sleep</title><p>Interactions between the hippocampus and cortex are critical during encoding as well as consolidation of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Our data strongly suggests that restricted cortical plasticity is needed to protect memories from interference, the first experimental confirmation of Marr and McClellands ideas that have fundamentally shaped our concepts of memories. Increasing plasticity enhanced one-trial memory, increased memory interference in our semantic-like memory paradigm and learning-rate in our modeling approach. Signatures of cross-brain connectivity – hippocampal-cortical theta coherence, NonREM oscillation coupling, granger causality analysis of ripple events – were all increased after our plasticity manipulation. However, experience-dependent increases, that were present in controls, were lacking in RGS14 animals, because they were already seen in the home cage condition. Increased plasticity in the prelimbic cortex also changed hippocampal ripple oscillations, arguing for a top-down control of the cortex on this oscillation. In controls, we observed that complex learning (Overlapping and Random conditions) but not home cage or simple learning (Stable) led to increased neural response to ripples as well as more ripples that followed delta-waves. In RGS14, these effects were present in all conditions, emphasising that after increasing plasticity even insignificant experiences induce consolidation markers and are retained. Finally, increasing plasticity led to a decrease in firing-rates and smaller delta waves in the cortex, in both cases effects that made the cortical signal more hippocampal-like.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effects of different types of learning</title><p>The Object Space Task, applied here, allows to separate different types of learning. First off, the simple memory condition Stable, which has the different objects placed at the same two locations throughout training and at test one new location is used, is similar to classic reference memory such as the watermaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samanta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Genzel et al., 2017</xref>). Since the different trials have the same configurations, the animal can use both a cumulative memory across trials as well as a recency memory of the last trial to still perform above chance at test. In contrast, in the Overlapping and Random conditions the objects will be presented in different locations from trial to trial, this trial-by-trial novelty should encourage the animal to consolidate these experiences during sleep and abstract the underlying cumulative statistical distributions. In Overlapping this distribution is skewed, such that one location will always contain an object. Thus, we can test for the behavioral expression of the cumulative memory, by presenting the same spatial configuration at test as it was presented during the final trial. Now, only if the animal extracted the cumulative statistics during all training trials, will there be a preference for the less often shown location at test.</p><p>By contrasting these different conditions, we can extrapolate which effects are driven by which type of learning or experience. Changes induced by all OS conditions in comparison to Home Cage, should represent more general experience-dependent effects enabling simple memory consolidation or homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> black arrows). Here, these were (1) increased hippocampal-cortical theta-coherence during task and REM, (2) increased delta-amplitude in NonREM and (3) increased spindle and delta rate leading to more oscillatory coupling events. In contrast, changes seen specifically after Overlapping and Random should represent semantic-like memory consolidation with the comparison and integration of new (current trial) and old (previous trials) information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> Orange arrows). Here, these were (1) increased number of neurons responsive to ripples and (2) increased fraction of ripples following a delta-wave. Finally, contrasting Overlapping and Random would allow to isolate representations of the different statistical distributions. This would be applicable to for example decoding analysis including individual neural data. Regrettably, we did not record from enough neurons to allow for such an analysis here.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary of results.</title><p>Top: effects of experience (black arrow, all OS vs HC) and complex learning (orange arrows, Overlapping/Random) in controls.

Different types of interactions between delta-waves, spindles and ripples have been reported and emphasized by different labs. These are interactions between two oscillations such as delta followed by spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mölle et al., 2002</xref>), delta followed by ripple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>), ripple followed by delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>), and spindles with a ripple in their troughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>), but also three-oscillation interactions such as delta followed by spindle with a ripple in the trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>), delta followed by ripple then spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>), ripple followed by delta and then spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>). Until now, experiments tended to report only on one type of oscillation, making it difficult to compare results and create a framework for potential different or common functions of these different oscillation-couplings.</p><p>We had previously already observed that the increase of delta and spindles and their coupling was linked to general experience (also seen after novelty exposure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleman-Zapata et al., 2022</xref>) and delta-spindle coupling is most often reported by researchers investigating human subject and applying simple memory paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian et al., 2022</xref>). This fits to our current results, where general coupling increased after our simple memory condition Stable. Of note, this general increase of delta and spindles also led to an increase of all delta-spindle-ripple coupling types. In contrast ripples following delta coupling increased specifically after the complex learning conditions. Previously this coupling was described together with prelimbic reactivations when animals learn complex rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>). It would be tempting to speculate that delta-spindle and spindle with ripple coupling would facilitate simple learning while delta-ripple would correspond to consolidation of complex memories that rely on the comparison of new memories to other previously encoded experiences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RGS14-overexpression leads to learning after all experiences</title><p>Our hypothesis was that increasing cortical plasticity leads to “overlearning”. Instead of distinguishing salient information and selectively consolidating, all experiences would be treated equal, consolidated and retained on the long-term in the cortex. Therefore, signatures of learning should already be present in control conditions such as Home Cage. We confirmed this hypothesis, both experience and complex-memory dependent learning effects observed in controls were already present in Home Cage in RGS14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> light purple arrows). RGS14-overexpressing animals showed more hippocampal-cortical theta-coherence, increased oscillatory coupling rate and increased fraction of ripples following delta-waves. Thus, in RGS14 encoding and consolidation is already by default ‘turned-on’ instead of being experience or learning dependent. This overlearning would explain the increased interference effects seen behaviorally.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>RGS14-overexpression make the cortex hippocampal-like</title><p>Interestingly, while most signatures of learning were increased, some seemed to show more complex interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> dark purple arrows). In line with predictions by the SHY hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>) RGS14-overexpressing animals showed longer off-periods during NonREM sleep. However, contrary to predictions by the SHY hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>), delta waves were smaller in RGS14-overexpressing animals. The cause is likely the general decrease in firing rates accompanying increased plasticity. Slower-firing neurons were less phase locked to the slow oscillation and less neuronal firing in the upstate led to smaller delta waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously proposed that the brain shows log-normal distributions and slow-firing neurons are more plastic than fast-firing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). Slow-firing neurons, due to potentially weaker synapses, would be more sensitive to plastic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). The current evidence, however, was mainly correlational and was only presented for the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016</xref>). Our results provide the first causal evidence that increasing synaptic plasticity in the cortex shifts the neural firing towards the slow firing end of the neural firing spectrum. Due to insufficient yield of the hippocampal tetrodes, we could not compare cortical to hippocampal firing rates directly in our recordings. However, others have shown faster firing rates in the entorhinal cortex in comparison to the hippocampus, and within the hippocampus faster firing rates in CA1 in comparison to CA3 and DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>), potentially mirroring expected differences in plasticity. Interestingly, the change induced in our experiment – slowing of firing rates in RGS14 by one log magnitude – matches the firing rates reported for CA1 in comparison to entorhinal cortex in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>. Thus, our firing-rates would indicate we did what we set out to do: turning the slow learner (cortex) into a fast learner (hippocampal-like neuronal firing). Interestingly, this was also seen in delta-amplitudes, where in RGS14 cortical delta-waves became as small as hippocampal delta-waves. Thus, our results highlight the complex interaction of proposed plasticity-related mechanisms present in firing-rates and sleep oscillations. It seems that slight changes in plasticity – as one would expect to occur during normal learning and experiences – lead to shifts as proposed by the SHY hypothesis. However, larger plasticity differences as expected for different brain areas or induced with artificial manipulations as applied here, lead to much larger shifts – in the case of delta-waves even in the opposite direction as natural learning – and complex interactions.</p><p>Interestingly, the change in firing-rate also influenced neuronal response to ripples. Overall ripple response was less in RGS14, despite ripple response per firing-rate group being similar in controls and RGS14. The slowest firing neurons generally did not show large ripple responses in both groups and RGS14 had more of these neurons, which is likely the reason for the overall decreased ripple-response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Top down control of ripples</title><p>While RGS14-overexpressing animals had more ripples and cortical-hippocampal interactions, the response of cortical neurons to ripples remained lower than in controls. The current prevalent view on hippocampal ripple oscillations is that they are essential for memory consolidation. Furthermore, it is believed that they are generated mainly as an outcome of the local synaptic interactions within the hippocampus inducing changes in several cortical areas and supporting the broadcasting of information from the hippocampus to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). Our results imply that there is an important top-down, cortical influence on this oscillation beyond the known local hippocampal mechanisms. Such a top-down influence has previously been shown for hippocampal theta sequences and ripples during task execution by inhibiting the prefrontal cortex with DREADDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt and Redish, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, and in alignment with existing results, it shows that hippocampus doesn’t reactivate random incoming sensory information, instead it orients itself to the previous knowledge acquired by the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Ikemoto, 2016</xref>). Fitting to this notion, we saw in controls that more hippocampal ripples followed cortical delta-oscillations after the Overlapping and Random condition in comparison to Stable or Home Cage. It has been proposed that the preceding delta-wave would carry the existing information that will then be updated by the incoming ripple information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Genzel et al., 2014</xref>). This would be needed in the Overlapping and Random condition to enable comparison of the current configuration to the previous configurations and thus the extraction of the statistical regularities. In RGS14 the control conditions (Home Cage and simple memory Stable) also showed this increase, further underlining the idea that in RGS14 all information is treated as salient independent of its relevance, which then would lead to increased interference effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>RGS14</title><p>Previous experiments using the plasticity-enhancer RGS14 in the peri-rhinal and visual cortex, showed increased conversion of short-term memory (40 min) to long-term memory (24 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2019</xref>). As in this study, treatment did not affect other behavioral parameters such as overall exploration times in a simple object exploration paradigm. They could show that overexpression of RGS14 led to increased BNDF at 60 min and 24 hr post training, which led to better long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navarro-Lobato et al., 2021</xref>). The increase in BDNF in RGS14 resulted in more neurites and dendrite branching in pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masmudi-Martín et al., 2019</xref>). It would be tempting to speculate that the increased dendritic branching led to the decreases in firing rates. Increased branching with more synaptic connections would make it less likely for inputs to be synchronized and thus the neuron would be less likely to fire an action potential.</p><p>These previous experiments imply that the main effects of RGS14 on memory are the result of increased cellular plasticity and especially increased BDNF at encoding but also during consolidation. In the current results RGS14 overexpression had multiple effects in the brain, thus we cannot conclude if effects on behavior were directly due to the increase in cellular plasticity in the prelimbic cortex or indirectly induced by changing, for example, sleep-oscillations implicated in memory consolidation. This also is the case for the anisomycin treatment, which inhibits cellular consolidation via inhibition of protein synthesis. We did not record neural activity during the treatment; therefore, we cannot exclude that effects other than the inhibition of protein synthesis could negatively impacted consolidation after the interference trial and have contributed to the results. However, the main aim of the treatment was to impact the consolidation and thus retention of the interference memory, which was achieved.</p><p>Of note, with the current approach, we cannot disentangle if we see increased interference effects in RGS14 since they remember the interference-trial better than the original training and thus their behavior is more driven by the interference experience. Or if the effect is caused by the interference memory overwriting and thus eliminating the original training memory. Furthermore, the Granger analysis of directionality should be interpreted with caution since Granger can lead to spurious results especially in oscillating networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kispersky et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, we could show that increasing plasticity in the prelimbic cortex enhances the ability to retain one trial information but this negatively impacts abstracted, cumulative memory representations and the ability to distinguish learning experiences, confirming long-standing but unproven memory system theories. Furthermore, changes in cortical plasticity affect neuronal firing rates, hippocampal-cortical connectivity, cortical delta waves and hippocampal ripples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A total of 72 rats were used in this experiment: 64 in the behavioral experiment and 8 in the electrophysiological recordings.

Briefly, animals were handled for 5 consecutive days before and after surgery recovery. Then, rats were accommodated in the experimental room and habituated to the open field across 5 sessions (one per day). In the first session, animals explored the open field with their cagemate for 30 min. In the rest of the session, each individual freely explored the open field for 10 min. Two Duplo objects were included in the open field center in the last two sessions to facilitate a better exploration time in the subsequent task.</p><p>The OST consists of two phases: a training phase of five training trials in which animals are exposed to two identical objects (different across trials) for 5 min (45–55 min intertrial time); and a interference/test phase consisting of a single 10 min' trial performed 24 hr and 72 hr after training. In the stable condition, both object locations were fixed during the training trials, and one object location was moved during the interference and tests sessions. In the overlapping condition, one object location was fixed, and the other one moved across training trials. In the interference and test sessions, the same object-location pattern from the last training trial was repeated.</p><p>The open field was a wooden square 75x75 x 60 cm.

In addition, the open field base colors changed across task sessions (white, blue, green, brown). The objects used vary in material (plastic, glass, wood, and metal), size, and colors. For electrophysiological recordings, not plastic objects were used to prevent static interference. All object bases were attached to 10 cm x 10 cm metal plates. Circular magnets were installed in the corners underneath the open field floor to prevent object movements during exploration.

The discrimination index (DI) was computed by subtracting the familiar object location exploration time to the novel object location and dividing it by the total exploration time. For Overlapping it is moved location – stable location, for Stable it is location-to-be-moved-at-test – stable location and for random which is assigned as moved and stable is random. A DI &gt;0 means a preference for the new object location and consequently memory from the previous episode. A DI = 0 shows no preference for either the new object location or the fixed one. DI &lt;0 means a preference for the stable object location.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Model</title><p>The same computational model as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref> was used (see article for more detailed methods). In short, the model learns place-object associations and then translates this memory into an exploratory behavior: the objects that were stably found at the same location have a very low uncertainty and are thus either less attractive or more attractive (depending on the individuals) during exploration than objects found at changing locations (high uncertainty in place-object association). The source code of the computational model and model simulation/fitting procedures is available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MehdiKhamassi/ObjectSpaceExplorationModel">https://github.com/MehdiKhamassi/ObjectSpaceExplorationModel</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lobato, 2023a</xref>).</p><p>The model employs two different parameters: a learning rate α, which determines the speed of memory accumulation; an inverse temperature β, which determines the strength and sign of memory expression during exploratory behavior.</p><p>A low learning rate α (i.e. close to 0) means that the model will need numerous repetitions of the same observation (i.e. in the Object Space Task, many trials observing the same place-object association) to properly memorize it. In contrast, a high learning rate α (i.e. close to 1) means that the model quickly memorizes new observations at the expense of old observations which are more quickly forgotten. As a consequence, with a low learning rate the exploratory behavior generated by the model will mostly reflect remote memories but not recent ones (semantic-like memory). Conversely, with a high learning rate, exploratory behavior in the model will mostly reflect recent memories but not remote ones (episodic-like memory).</p><p>Finally, an inverse temperature β close to zero means that the model does not strongly translate memories into object preferences for exploration, thus showing little object preference. In contrast, a high inverse temperature will mean that the model’s exploratory behavior is strongly driven by differences in relative uncertainty between place-object associations. A high positive inverse temperature (<italic>β</italic>&gt;0) will result in neophilic behavior: the model spends more time exploring objects associated with high uncertainty (i.e. novelty or constantly changing location); a high negative inverse temperature (<italic>β</italic>&lt;0) will result in neophobic behavior: the model spends more time exploring objects with low uncertainty (stable/familiar objects).</p><p>The model was fitted to each mouse’s trial-by-trial behavior using a maximum likelihood procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genzel et al., 2019</xref>, and similar to state-of-the-art model fitting methods in cognitive neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson and Collins, 2019</xref>).

Using a 10 s sliding window, an experienced researcher created the hypnogram and 1 s epoch vector indicating brain states. The absences of movement in the accelerometer discriminate between wakefulness and sleep. During sleep periods, a dominant theta frequency in the dorsal hippocampus in the absence of spindles and delta waves indicated REM sleep. NonREM sleep was classified when slow oscillations were detected in the prelimbic cortex.

The coherence analysis focused on two periods of interest namely, WAKE and REM periods. Since REM sleeping periods might occur several times over several sleeping cycles, REM periods from pre and posttrial sleep were first extracted and concatenated together before running the analysis. For both Wake and REM periods, the power and cross-power spectra were computed on overlapping time windows of 1 s with 80% overlap. Then, the theta coherence was computed as the average value over the theta frequency range (5–12 Hz) for the Object Space (Stable, Overlapping and Random) and home cage conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Detection of spindles and delta waves</title><p>The downsampled prelimbic cortex channel (1 kHz) was loaded into the Matlab workspace and using a third-order Butterworth filter the signal was filtered to 9–20 Hz for detecting spindles and to 1–6 Hz for detecting delta waves. The NonREM bouts were then extracted from the filtered signal and concatenated. The functions FindSpindles and FindDeltaWaves from the Freely Moving Animal (FMA) toolbox <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net">http://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net</ext-link> were modified and used to detect the start, peak and end of spindles and delta waves respectively. The optimal threshold was found for each animal by visually inspecting the detections and modifying the default parameters of the functions when needed. The results were saved as timestamps with respect to the concatenated NonREM signal in seconds. They were then used to find the timestamps with respect to the recorded signal.

Using a third-order Butterworth bandpass filter, the epochs of HPC signal were filtered to a frequency range of 100–300 Hz. A custom MATLAB function was used for detecting the start, peak and end of the ripples by thresholding voltage peaks which lasted a minimum duration of 30ms above the threshold. The start and end of the ripple were determined as half the value of the selected threshold. Values equivalent to 5 times the standard deviation of concatenated NonREM bouts were computed individually for presleep and all post trials in a study day. The average of these values was calculated to find a single detection threshold per study day. An offset of 5 microV was added to the threshold to reduce false positives.

Namely, the amplitude of the events was calculated by computing the envelope of the filtered trace using a Hilbert transform. The absolute value of the result was taken and its maximum was found.

The time difference between the peaks of these events was compared to a fixed duration to establish if there was a sequential relationship in the following combinations of oscillations: Delta-Spindle (D-S), Delta-Ripple (D-R), Ripple-Delta (R-D), Ripple-Delta-Spindle (R-D-S), Delta-Ripple-Spindle (D-R-S). For D-S a sequence was considered when the duration between events was between 100–1300ms, for D-R it was 50–400ms and for R-D it was 50–250ms. To find R-D-S sequences, the results of R-D and D-S were compared to find delta waves preceded by a ripple and followed by a spindle. To find D-R-S sequences, the results of D-R and R-S (events between 2-1000ms) were compared to find ripples preceded by a delta wave and followed by a spindle. To find the Delta-Spindle with Ripple sequences, the results of D-S and spindles co-occurring with ripples (see next subsection) were matched to find spindles preceded by a delta and co-occurring with a ripple.

(2) One of the events had to start or end within the duration of the other.

All ripples across animals and conditions were combined per treatment and their amplitude was computed by finding the maximum of their envelope computed with a Hilbert transform. The median ripple amplitude was calculated and the corresponding two-second-long windows of the 2000 ripples which amplitude was the closest to the median amplitude were included in the following analysis. A notch filter at 50 Hz was applied to the ripple-centered windows using the ft_preprocessing function from the Matlab-based Fieldtrip toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>. The Short-time Fourier transformation was calculated to detect the changes of spectral power in hippocampus and prelimbic cortex with respect to a time window of ±1 s around each ripple. This was computed using the ft_freqanalysis function from Fieldtrip with a 100ms Hanning window and time steps of 10ms, for a frequency range from 100 to 300 Hz with a 2 Hz step for hippocampus and from 0.5 to 20 Hz with a step of 0.5 Hz for prelimbic cortex. The resulting spectrograms were averaged and displayed. To statistically compare spectrograms between treatments, a nonparametric permutation test to correct for multiple comparisons with two-tailed pixel-based statistics was computed using 500 permutations and a p-value of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To determine the predictive power between brain regions during ripples, the time-frequency Spectral Granger Causality was computed for each directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhamala et al., 2008</xref>). A window with length of 2.2 s centered around each ripple peak was extracted for the simultaneous hippocampal and prelimbic cortex signals. The length of this window was chosen to at least capture one cycle of 0.5 Hz activity. A two-second-long time-frequency non-parametric Spectral Granger causality was computed by implementing a Short- time Fourier transform with a 500ms Hanning window with 10ms steps using the Fieldtrip functions ft_freqanalysis and ft_connectivityanalysis respectively. To determine statistical differences between granger spectrograms, we created randomized trials by taking 400 random ripples per treatment and computing their time-frequency granger causality as described above. The result was stored, and the procedure was repeated 30 times to give a total of 30 randomized trials per treatment. We then used the trials of the rgs14 and control treatments to determine significant statistical difference in each pixel of the time-frequency matrix by applying a nonparametric permutation test to correct for multiple comparisons with a two-tailed pixel-based correction, using 500 permutations and a p-value of 0.05.

The sleep and trial recordings of each tetrode of the prelimbic cortex were extracted and concatenated chronologically to allow tracking the individual neuronal activity across the whole study day. The tetrode recordings were preprocessed by applying a bandpass filter between 300 and 3000 Hz. For each tetrode, multiple spike sorting algorithms were run using the SpikeInterface python-based framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buccino et al., 2020</xref>. The spike sorters used were Tridesclous, SpikingCircus, Klusta, HerdingSpikes, Ironclust, and MountainSort4. The default parameters included in SpikeInterface per spike sorter were used. Agreement between the spike sorters was computed and only putative neurons that were detected by at least two spike sorters were considered. When a tetrode didn’t have any consensus, the detections of the MountainSort4 spike sorter were used given that this spike sorter had better scores according to the SpikeForest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Magland et al., 2020</xref> metrics and our own examinations.

Neurons labeled as ‘good’ were used for further analysis. A preliminary waveform per neuron was defined with an 82-sample window with 40 samples before and 41 samples after the spike timestamp (ST). For each neuron, STs were randomly permuted and a total of 2000 were selected. The permutation was done in order to avoid bias when selecting waveforms. These 2000 waveforms were averaged to obtain the mean spike waveform per neuron. Since tetrodes were used to record neuronal activity during the task and sleep, there were 4 average waveforms to choose from. The one with the highest peak amplitude was chosen. For each neuron, all STs were stored. Further, each neuron was assigned a unique ID. This process was performed for all neurons of all rats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-3"><title>Neuron classification</title><p>The average neuron waveforms calculated from rats 1, 2, 6, and 9 were categorized as ‘Vehicle’ and stored in a 139 (t1) ×82 matrix, with 139 being the total number of putative neurons and 82 being the number of samples as mentioned before. Similarly, ‘RGS14’ data from rats 3, 4, 7, 8 was stored as a 353 (t2) ×82 matrix. Variables t1 and t2 were the total counts of neurons for the respective treatments. The bz_CellClassification.m script from Buzsaki lab’s GitHub was used to compute the trough-to-peak delay time and the spike width for the spike waveform of each putative neuron. The function ClusterPointsBoundaryOutBW.m of the same repository was modified to incorporate visualization of interneuron and pyramidal data for both treatments. Neurons were then visualized in a 2D plane with x and y axes as trough-to-peak delay and spike width respectively. The set of coordinates of all putative neurons were fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with two components in order to find the centroids of the clusters of pyramidal cells and interneurons. The cluster which contained spikes with high values of spike width and trough-to-peak delay was labeled as the pyramidal neurons cluster, while the remaining one was labeled as the interneurons cluster. For both clusters, a threshold of mean +/- 2 SD with respect to their centroids was used to filter out the outliers. Next, the firing rates of the remaining neurons were calculated as is described in the following paragraph and those with extreme firing rate values were reinspected in the Phy interface by another experimenter to potentially discard remaining false positives. After this procedure there were a total of 101 pyramidal neurons for the RGS14 treatment and 57 for Vehicle. The total number of interneurons were 18 for RGS14 and 7 for Vehicle. In the following analyses, only pyramidal neurons were used given the low number of interneurons detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4"><title>Firing rate analysis</title><p>The spikes of each neuron were grouped by the sleep stage during which they fired. The total number of spikes of a neuron during a specific sleep stage were determined by counting all the spikes occurring during the sleep stage in question across pre-trial sleep, post-trial sleep and trials periods of a single day. The cumulative amount of time spent in a specific sleep stage during the day was determined similarly. Using these two values, the firing rate of a neuron during a sleep stage was computed by dividing the total number of spikes during the sleep stage by the cumulative amount of time spent in seconds in the sleep stage. The firing rate during each sleep and wake stage was calculated for all neurons. The firing rates of neurons during the ‘Wake’ stage in the vehicle control condition were divided into five quantiles based on their magnitudes (0–20%, 20–40%, 40–60%, 60–80%, 80–100%), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. The upper-limit values of firing rate differentiating the groups in Vehicle were then used as a threshold to divide the neurons in the RGS treatments in five groups as well. The spike timestamps during NonREM sleep were collected across the whole study day for each neuron and the corresponding slow oscillation phases during each spike timestamps were extracted. The slow oscillation phase during spikes was calculated as described above for ripples and spindles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-5"><title>Detection of ON and OFF periods during NonREM sleep</title><p>The spiking activity of neurons was extracted for each NonREM bout of every pre and post-trial during a study day. The spike timestamps of the multiple neurons firing during a NonREM bout were combined to generate a single spike train of multiunit activity (MUA). A binary array with the length of the NonREM bout and a sampling rate of 30 kHz was created, where 1 meant a spike occurred during that timestamp and 0 meant absence of spike. The start and end of OFF periods were detected by calculating the inter-spike-interval (ISI) between spikes and finding values above 50ms. The remaining periods were considered for ON period detection. Only ON periods with a duration between 50 and 4000ms were kept. A minimum number of 10 spikes per ON period was required to include it in the analysis. Durations of all ON and OFF periods found during a pre or post-trial were computed and their mean value was stored. This was repeated for all study days in which pyramidal neurons were detected. Only ON and OFF periods of study days including a minimum of 7 neurons were included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-6"><title>Cortical activity during ripples</title><p>Using the spike timestamps during NonREM sleep, the cortical pyramidal neuron response to hippocampal ripples was computed in a 2 s window defined around the peak of each ripple. For each ripple the activity of all pyramidal neurons detected during that day was extracted. The spikes timestamps in the 2 s window were normalized to vary from –1 to 1 s, where 0 was the ripple peak. After concatenating the normalized timestamps across all ripple-centered windows per neuron, they were binned in 10ms bins and the number of spikes was determined for each bin. Hence, for each neuron, a [1x200] column vector was obtained. This vector was then z-normalized. The final z-scored vector was found by averaging the z-scored vector over all neurons. The data was smoothed twice using the MATLAB smooth function. To visualize the activity of prelimbic cortex pyramidal neurons around the ripple, the firing activity of a neuron was determined from a 50ms window around the peak of the ripple (–20 to +30ms) by quantifying the number of spikes. After compiling the firing activity around the ripple peak for each neuron the values were sorted in an ascending order and was visualized using the MATLAB imagesc function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Figures</title><p>Figures were generated in GraphPad Prism (truncated violin plots with high smoothing).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Central Commissie Dierproeven (CCD) and conducted according to the Experiments on Animals Act (protocol codes, 2016-014-020 and 2016-014-022).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84911-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/7xw43/">https://osf.io/7xw43/</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Usman Farooq (Reviewer #2); Marcos Frank (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In their study, Navarro Lobato et al. explored the relationship between plasticity and memory in the hippocampo-cortical network. To this end, virally-expressed RGS was injected into the medial prefrontal cortex of rats, and animals were trained on behavioral assays to test different types of memories, namely semantic and episodic. The study reports that enhanced plasticity in the prefrontal cortex led to the interference of recent memories, providing evidence that too much plasticity – and consequently fast learning – was detrimental to the acquisition of semantic-like memories in the cortex. This increased plasticity was also associated with changes in sleep physiological patterns and hippocampal-cortical coupling.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that the study is of potential interest, they raised several major concerns, which are summarized below. They have agreed that the below concerns must be addressed to warrant the publication of the study.</p><p>1. It is important to clarify the behavioral results by providing a more detailed description of the task parameters (for example the type of objects used, etc.). Furthermore, the lack of discrimination in control animals is surprising and seems at odds with previously published results. Last, whether increased plasticity leads to increased interference and/or enhanced one-shot is unclear.</p><p>2. The study should provide more details on RGS over-expression, the exact site of injection, possible resulting anatomical changes (e.g. dendrites, at least a discussion on this point if no data are available), and justification that RGS does not lead to a ceiling effect in some task parameters (and not directly improve plasticity).</p><p>3. Electrophysiological results do not compare overlapping and stable conditions (while it seems these data were collected), these results should be presented or, at least, this choice of the presentation should be discussed.</p><p>4. The study should provide evidence that the reported decrease in firing rates does not depend on differences in behavior.</p><p>5. The relationship between plasticity and firing rates should be toned down, especially since the discussion is based on hippocampal data, for which the physiology may be different as in the cortex.</p><p>6. The study should provide a better characterization of changes during sleep, especially UP/DOWN state duration, REM sleep duration, and firing rates, as well as a comparison of PFC and hippocampus.</p><p>7. If possible, the study should include some physiological characterization of anisomycin-treated animals.</p><p>8. Potential alternative interpretations should be discussed, for example, the consequence of RGS over-expression on sleep architecture and physiology, which would itself change learning (not just a change in plasticity).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) This is a difficult paper to read, as the authors present a mixture of results and discussion while describing figures in the text, with relatively little space to present the results. The presentation can be significantly improved to enhance readability by devoting the Results section to primarily describe results, and moving the interpretation/ speculation to the Discussion section as much as possible. In addition, it will be valuable to describe in detail the Object-Space task with a test trial after 24 hours as per the original experimental design (Genzel et al. 2019), before moving on to the interference condition. Finally, dividing multiple-graph panels into labelled sub-panels that are referenced in the Legend (eg., Figure 4) will be useful.</p><p>2) For the behavioral results in Figure 1C, the Overlapping condition is supposed to show slowly increasing DI corresponding to accumulated memory as per the text/ legend. Statistics need to be presented here, and it instead looks like there is an increase in DI for the Overlapping condition only on the 5th training trial. Further, the interference trial after 24 hours and the test trial after 48 hours should correspond to the test trial in the original design, where an increase in DI is expected, but none seems to be observed here. As noted in the Public review, the authors need to discuss this in detail.</p><p>3) Relatedly, please explain the colors and shades used in Figure 1D in detail, or change the color scheme. The dark gray alluded to here (Experiment 2 Control) looks like violet.</p><p>4) Line 196-198: &quot;Furthermore, because it is the faster-firing neurons that dominate upstate spiking activity and therefore δ amplitude, the slowing of firing rates in the more plastic neurons is most likely the cause of the smaller δ waves seen in these animals&quot;. Can a reference be provided for the first part of the statement?</p><p>Also, reference 14 relates to hippocampal slow-firing neurons (as noted above), so any conclusions regarding slow-firing cortical neurons being more plastic need to be justified.</p><p>5) For physiological differences, is there any reason why data is not presented comparing the Stable and Overlapping OST condition since this is the central point of the manuscript? As per Methods on pg. 500-506, recordings were obtained separately for each condition.</p><p>6) The Granger analysis of directionality should be interpreted with caution since Granger can lead to spurious results (Kispersky et al. 2011), especially in oscillating networks.</p><p>7) In Figures S6 and S7, none of the axes labels and axes tick labels are visible – they are too small.</p><p>8) In Figure 4, there is no scale bar for the color plots. In Figure 4C, please explain the acronyms B, Pre, Post.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Check the whole manuscript for grammar e.g., these theories 'provides'… they 'remains' (page 2, lines 46-49)</p><p>– Describe the object space task in more detail (specifically why the interference protocol was designed this way) in the main manuscript as it is crucial to the manuscript</p><p>– Which statistical tests were used to test for the hypothesis? Please provide details alongside each test (t-test statistics, sample size, etc.)</p><p>– How is this a semantic-like task? Please describe/explain in the manuscript.</p><p>– As a host of electrophysiological changes have been observed, a cartoon model might help show how they all fit together to support the hypothesis of the authors</p><p>– Are hippocampal firing rates different or only prelimbic?</p><p>– Why were the electrophysiological differences of the object space task not compared with the random condition but the home cage condition instead? To determine the neural signature of increased plasticity due to the task in the RGS14414 group wouldn't that comparison be best?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting and thoroughly performed study that addresses very important questions in the field. The authors use a viral-vector-based strategy to over-express a construct that increases dendritic arborization, and spine formation (in the cortex) and is known to boost certain forms of memory. This is interpreted as a means of increasing cortical plasticity. Then, through a combination of behavioral tasks, electrophysiology, and sleep analyses, they report numerous changes in cortical and hippocampal activity. There are a few areas of improvement that would greatly strengthen the study.</p><p>1. Can the authors address the mechanism governing the effect of RGS? It seems that (based on other studies) transfected brain areas show a general increase in dendritic arborization, spine increase, etc., but it's not clear how this translates to 'experience-dependent' plasticity per se. It seems like non-specific effects, akin to what happens when neurotrophins are injected into V1. The result of the latter is not always normal, or like what happens with naturally occurring plasticity. This may be occurring in this experiment as well, as RGS appears to generally increase hippocampal-cortical connectivity in a manner different than what is driven by the experience. Also, considering that a Lenti virus was used, which can lead to random genome integration, some discussion would be helpful.</p><p>2. Is there any histology showing the localization of the RGS transfection?</p><p>3. It seems the best control for the effects of RGS is to use a compound that targets the same pathways. For example, Navarro-Lobato recently used the knockdown of 14-3-3ζ gene for this purpose (JNS 2021). I ask because anisomycin probably involves other pathways (protein synthesis inhibition, apoptosis).</p><p>4. What happened to firing rates during REM sleep? Cortical neurons change their activity in REM sleep, possibly more so after 'plasticity'. These analyses would be very helpful.</p><p>5. Can the authors present data on the duration of NREM up and down states? I ask because this parameter has been measured previously (Vyazovskiy) in the context of sleep need and plasticity.</p><p>6. Is it possible that the lack of experience-dependent changes in the RGS animals (in some parameters) is due to a ceiling or masking effect? That RGS saturates the capacity for further change?</p><p>7. It would be helpful to indicate in the figure legends for the supplementary figures when the data are from RGS or controls.</p><p>8. What happened to EEGs, FRP's, etc., in the anisomycin-treated rats? This would help one determine if the cortex was abnormal in some way.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84911.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In their study, Navarro Lobato et al. explored the relationship between plasticity and memory in the hippocampo-cortical network.

In the previous publication with the same task, a 24h test trial was used (not 72h after training as here). Actually, the interference trial in this project is behaviourally the same as the test trial in the previous publication. The reason we call it interference and not test, is simply because our main interest in the current project was how this trial affects the 72h test trial. However, we can analyze the behaviour in that trial to “replicate” our previous findings. This data was already included in the supplement (Figure S1) but we now expanded the figure to include a bar graph version that is similar to the Plos Bio figure of the original report. Here you can see that in vehicles we replicate previous findings and they are above chance, further there is not difference between the groups (that could have influenced our results at 72h). We also now include examples of objects used in this figure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and expanded the task description in the introduction and discussion. Finally, we agree that we cannot differentiate between increased interference/overwriting vs stronger behavioural control of the one-shot memory, which we now mention in the discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84911-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We do not have data on anatomical changes but now include a paragraph in the discussion citing previous data and findings. We expanded the discussion on how RGS on one hand shows “overlearning” but on the other hand more complex interactions of some learning mechanisms. Further, we include discussion on other parameters such as overall exploration time and how RGS14 does not change these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Electrophysiological results do not compare overlapping and stable conditions (while it seems these data were collected), these results should be presented or, at least, this choice of the presentation should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our starting hypothesis was that RGS14 animals show “overlearning”, so every experience is treated as a salient learning experience. Therefore, we expected the biggest difference between treatments for the home cage condition (HC) and thus focusses on the HC vs OS analysis. Since as predicted this analysis provided the main effects and a large volume of results, we did not delve in more depth in the conditions.</p><p>However, in the meantime in a different project with the same task (including conditions HC, overlapping and stable but no RGS treatment or random training condition) we have explored the condition effect in more detail and found a specific effect of the percentage of ripples that occur after a δ wave in the Overlapping training condition. Since the reviewers pointed out this shortcoming, we now applied the same analysis to the RGS data-set and are happy to report that we find the same effect (included in the revision). We further now split the ripple-response analysis for condition and can also report differences there. Therefore, we would like to thank the reviewers for encouraging us to continue with the analysis of the data in more detail, considering new findings in our other projects. We have added a new figure and expand on this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The study should provide evidence that the reported decrease in firing rates does not depend on differences in behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Firing rate were shown for different wake and sleep states (normalized to task wake) in the supplement. We now added firing rate group analysis for wake in the sleep box (no specific behaviour), NREM and REM (Figure 1S1 and2). All analysis confirms the initial finding from task wake, therefore differences in firing-rates are not due to differences in behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The relationship between plasticity and firing rates should be toned down, especially since the discussion is based on hippocampal data, for which the physiology may be different as in the cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>We adapted the discussion on firing rates and now include also more referencing to the original review proposing the idea that goes beyond hippocampus. We also now point out that the previously cited paper is focussed on the hippocampus. Overall, we expanded the discussion including also the new results in regards to hippocampal δ-waves and reported hippocampal-firing-rates (see answer to next comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The study should provide a better characterization of changes during sleep, especially UP/DOWN state duration, REM sleep duration, and firing rates, as well as a comparison of PFC and hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>We added REM bout duration (overall REM sleep duration was already included in the original figure 1) and are happy to report that there is a significant difference. We had originally not followed up on bout duration since there was no effect in overall duration. Regrettably we cannot add a PFC and HPC comparison for the firing rates, since we did not have sufficient tetrodes correctly placed in the hippocampus to record enough neurons to make this analysis reliable.</p><p>However, we now expand the discussion on the hippocampal and cortical firing rates and now mention that the magnitude of change we see in RGS14 would mirror the firing rate changes we would expect for the hippocampus according to the literature.</p><p>A HPC-PFC comparison we could add, was the analysis of δ-waves. Interestingly, in controls hippocampal δ waves are smaller than cortical ones. Further, the decrease in amplitude we already reported for RGS14, cortical δ-waves, corresponds to the normal size of hippocampal δ-waves (see new Figure 2). Thus, in RGS14 cortical and hippocampal firing-rates and δ-amplitudes are the same, which is not the case for controls. This is further evidence that with our manipulation we turned our “slow learning” cortex into a plastic, hippocampal-like structure.</p><p>Finally, we also added the on/off period analysis. Interestingly, in RGS14 off periods are longer, fitting to the SHY hypothesis. Further, we can replicate the observed time course of on/off durations reported previously (included in new Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. If possible, the study should include some physiological characterization of anisomycin-treated animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Regrettably, it was not possible to include electrophysiology in the anysomycin treated animals. We currently do not have implants that combine tetrodes with canula. We now include in the discussion a comment in that regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Potential alternative interpretations should be discussed, for example, the consequence of RGS over-expression on sleep architecture and physiology, which would itself change learning (not just a change in plasticity).</p></disp-quote><p>We now included this in the discussion, mentioning that we cannot disentangle if our results are due to direct changes in cellular plasticity or via changes in e.g. oscillatory coupling or sleep architecture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) This is a difficult paper to read, as the authors present a mixture of results and discussion while describing figures in the text, with relatively little space to present the results.

We now included stats (significant condition and condXtrial interaction but no effect or interaction with treatment) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> the same training figure without Stable, it makes it a bit easier to see that there is an increase starting trial 2.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84911-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Relatedly, please explain the colors and shades used in Figure 1D in detail, or change the color scheme.

We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion, since the model made us aware which of our results from the supplement should rather be included in the main figures.

To determine the neural signature of increased plasticity due to the task in the RGS14414 group wouldn't that comparison be best?</p></disp-quote><p>As can be seen in the new analysis, random actually behaves like overlapping. It makes sense since in both cases objects are moving and potentially a statistical pattern can be detected. This is also seen in similar learning rates for both conditions in the computational model in the original Plos Biology article. Stable is less of a learning incentive, since less novelty is present during the task. But they are still experiencing something and are still learning a simple task. We now expanded this in the discussion with an explanation of the different possible contrasts with these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very interesting and thoroughly performed study that addresses very important questions in the field. The authors use a viral-vector-based strategy to over-express a construct that increases dendritic arborization, and spine formation (in the cortex) and is known to boost certain forms of memory.

Naturally occurring plasticity would be selective for experience and using general “plasticity enhancers” would break down the natural regulation and processes. We tried to emphasize this more in the discussion by showing where RGS seems to be learning in “overdrive” and where effects break down due to the sledge-hammer approach (dark purple in the new comic summary).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is there any histology showing the localization of the RGS transfection?</p></disp-quote><p>We now included an overview picture with injection site in the supplement (Figure 2S3) to complement the transfection picture in Figure 1. There is a lot of background in the immune signal, which is why positive transfection can only be confirmed in zoomed in pictures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It seems the best control for the effects of RGS is to use a compound that targets the same pathways. For example, Navarro-Lobato recently used the knockdown of 14-3-3ζ gene for this purpose (JNS 2021). I ask because anisomycin probably involves other pathways (protein synthesis inhibition, apoptosis).</p></disp-quote><p>With the manipulation we aimed at generally inhibiting consolidation of the interference trial and not subtly disentangle how RGS14 works. We use RGS14 simply as a tool to manipulate plasticity but are not specifically interested how it does this (we leave this to the experts in Malaga). This is why we chose to use a “consolidation inhibitor” as is used most often in the memory field, anisomycin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What happened to firing rates during REM sleep? Cortical neurons change their activity in REM sleep, possibly more so after 'plasticity'. These analyses would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>This was added to the supplement, the same effects were seen. Already previously in the supplement we presented how each neuron group modulated their firing rate over the different states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the authors present data on the duration of NREM up and down states? I ask because this parameter has been measured previously (Vyazovskiy) in the context of sleep need and plasticity.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We added the analysis and as SHY predicts we see longer Off-periods in RGS14 and we can replicate the time-course finding where off-periods become shorter over long sleep periods. We added the results to Figure 2 (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Is it possible that the lack of experience-dependent changes in the RGS animals (in some parameters) is due to a ceiling or masking effect? That RGS saturates the capacity for further change?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added to the discussion that we cannot disentangle some of the effects. On one side the cellular consolidation vs sleep consolidation but then also increase interference memory vs actually overwriting the old memory (see also previous answers to comments of other reviewers). Overall, behaviour in the task was similar (exploration times etc) as was previously reported. We now include this also in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be helpful to indicate in the figure legends for the supplementary figures when the data are from RGS or controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this where it was missing and apologize for the oversight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. What happened to EEGs, FRP's, etc., in the anisomycin-treated rats? This would help one determine if the cortex was abnormal in some way.</p></disp-quote><p>Regrettably we do not have combined anysomycin – electrophysiolgical data. We currently do not have an implant that can combine cannulas and recordings. However, we now add this to the discussion and also that our general aim was to inhibit consolidation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
