Notably, some viruses (e.g. bacteriophage) exhibit alternative life cycles, such as chronic infections without cell lysis. However, the impact of chronic infections and their interactions with the host organisms remains largely unknown. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis, and transcriptomics assays, we found these bacteriophages were released via a chronic style without host cell lysis, which might reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through the potential auxiliary metabolic genes. The findings presented here, together with recent discoveries made on the reprogramming of host energy-generating metabolisms by chronic bacteriophages, shed light on the poorly explored marine virus–host interaction and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of chronic viruses in marine ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deep-sea

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities on this planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suttle, 2007</xref>), and potentially play a role in shaping microbial abundances, community structure, and the evolutionary trajectory of core metabolisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). The effect of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) on their specific hosts and within the microbial community is largely determined by their lifestyle. Traditionally, most bacteriophage life cycles are classified as being either lytic or lysogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Toit, 2017</xref>). During the lytic cycle, phages hijack the host’s metabolic machinery for replication of their own genome and the production of progeny particles that are released through lysis. In contrast, during lysogeny, phages integrate their genomes into the host chromosome (or exist in the extrachromosomal form) and enter a dormant state, with the potential to re-enter a lytic cycle and release progeny by environmental changes at a later stage. Currently, more and more attention has been paid to chronic life cycles where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964</xref>), which was different from the lysogenic life cycle that could possibly lyse the host under some specific conditions. During a chronic cycle, progeny phage particles are released from host cells via extrusion or budding without killing the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Putzrath and Maniloff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Russel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>), instead of lysis of the host cell. Chronic infections are common among eukaryotic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Godkin and Smith, 2017</xref>), however, to our best knowledge, only few phages have been described for prokaryotes in the pure isolates up to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The best-studied examples of chronic infection are those from filamentous single-stranded DNA phages that to date have primarily been identified in the order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, which currently involves three families (<italic>Inoviridae</italic>, <italic>Paulinoviridae</italic>, and <italic>Plectroviridae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>). One of the most distinctive features of inoviruses is their ability to establish a chronic infection whereby their genomes may either integrate into the host chromosome or reside within the cell in a non-active form, and inoviruses particles are continuously released without killing the host. In addition, tailless phages enclosed in lipid membrane are also released from hosts during chronic life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies indicate that chronic cycles are more widespread in nature than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mäntynen et al., 2021</xref>), and the abundance of inoviruses in ecosystem may have been far underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roux et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a large percentage of phages in nature are proposed to replicate through chronic life cycles, but whether chronic cycles are associated with specific environments or ecological conditions remains to be thoroughly explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Marine ecosystems always influence the operating conditions for life on earth via microbial interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falkowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wigington et al., 2016</xref>), which are modulated by viruses through impacting their lifespan, gene flow, and metabolic outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suttle, 2005</xref>). A majority of these viruses are bacteriophages, which exist widely in oceans and affect the life activities of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breitbart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gregory et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Huerta et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to core viral genes encoding viral structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brum et al., 2016</xref>), bacteriophages also encode various auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brum and Sullivan, 2015</xref>) that provide supplemental support to key steps of host metabolism. For instance, AMGs of marine bacteriophages have been predicted to be involved in photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mann et al., 2003</xref>), nitrogen cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahlgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gazitúa et al., 2021</xref>), sulfur cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anantharaman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roux et al., 2016</xref>), phosphorus cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zeng and Chisholm, 2012</xref>), nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dwivedi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enav et al., 2014</xref>), and almost all central carbon metabolisms in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurwitz et al., 2013</xref>). However, AMGs of chronic phages have not been reported. Thus, it is worth exploring whether chronic phages could carry AMGs and assist host metabolism during chronic infection.</p><p>The deep sea harbors abundant and undiscovered viruses, which potentially control the metabolism of microbial hosts and influence biogeochemical cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to the vast majority of deep-sea microbes cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, most bacteriophages could not be isolated. Thus, it is of great significance to further identify unknown phages in the deep sea and explore their relationship with microbial hosts and even marine ecosystems. Here, we report that polysaccharides can induce deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> bacteria (difficult-to-cultivate microorganisms) to release some chronic bacteriophages. These chronic bacteriophages might assist host polysaccharides metabolism via corresponding potential AMGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polysaccharides promote the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 and stimulate the expression of phage-associated genes</title><p>As a primary carbon source, polysaccharides are a ubiquitous energy source for microorganisms in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>).

As expected, growth assays showed that two kinds of polysaccharides including laminarin and starch could promote strain WC36 growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, supplementation of 10 g/l laminarin and 10 g/l starch in rich medium resulted in ~7- and ~4-fold growth promotion, respectively, compared to cultivation in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polysaccharides promote the deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 growth and stimulate the expression of phage-associated genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA gene sequences from strain WC36, strain zth2, and some <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>–<italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic>–<italic>Chlamydia</italic> (PVC) group bacteria. <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATCC 14579 was used as the outgroup.

In addition to the upregulation of genes related to glycan transport and degradation, when 10 g/l laminarin was added in the rich medium, the most upregulated genes were phage associated (e.g. phage integrase, phage portal protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which were expressed at the background level in the rich medium alone. Consistently, qRT-PCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) confirmed upregulation of some genes encoding phage-associated proteins, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the metabolism of polysaccharides in strain WC36 might be closely connected with the phage production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36</title><p>To test our hypothesis that polysaccharides might induce strain WC36 to release bacteriophages, we grew strain WC36 in rich medium supplemented with or without laminarin or starch and isolated bacteriophages from the cell suspension supernatant according to established standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the growth curve of strain WC36, we found that the growth rate of strictly anaerobic strain WC36 was relatively slow. Therefore, different to the typical sampling time (24 hr) for bacteriophage isolation from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang and Paul, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weinbauer et al., 1999</xref>), we selected a longer sampling time (10 days) to extract bacteriophages. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation showed that many different shapes of phage-like structures indeed existed in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium supplemented with laminarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panels II–IV) or starch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panels V–VIII). In contrast, we did not observe any phage-like structures in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panel I). We also tested and confirmed that there were not any phage-like structures in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/l laminarin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or in 10 g/l starch alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), ruling out the possibility of phage contamination from the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch). These results suggest that polysaccharides indeed stimulate the production of various bacteriophages from strain WC36. Correspondingly, in the presence of laminarin, different forms of bacteriophages were observed by TEM, with filamentous ones dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The length of these filamentous phages was about ~0.4 to ~8.0 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panel II), and the size of the hexagonal phages was less than 100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panel IV). In the presence of starch, in addition to filamentous and hexagonal phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panels V, VI, and VIII), we also observed a kind of icosahedral <italic>Microviridae</italic>-like phage with a diameter of 25–30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, panel VII).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of phages extracted from the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium supplemented with or without polysaccharide.

Meanwhile, we also checked the polysaccharides (laminarin/starch) in rich medium directly by TEM and did not find any phage-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, based on TEM observation of ultrathin sections of strain WC36 cultured in medium supplemented with polysaccharide, we even observed filamentous phages that were being released from or entering into host cells via a kind of extrusion or budding structure around bacterial cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, panels II–IV; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>, panels II and III), which were typical cellular structures in host cells used for chronic bacteriophage release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krupovic, 2018</xref>).

Strain WC36 showed stable growth after it entered the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Regardless of whether the laminarin was present, the bacterial cells kept their cell shape intact, indicating they were still healthy after 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, panels I–III). Apparently, the replication and release of bacteriophages in strain WC36 did not kill the host cell, consistent with the key feature of chronic bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Howard-Varona et al., 2017</xref>).

Therefore, we sought to ask whether bacteriophages could reprogram polysaccharide metabolism in deep-sea bacteria. For this purpose, we sequenced the genomes of the bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2. Eventually, two incomplete assembled genomes (Phage-WC36-1, 6.3 kb; Phage-WC36-2, 28.3 kb) were obtained from the bacteriophages of strain WC36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary file 3 and 4</xref>). Meanwhile, two incomplete assembled genomes (Phage-zth2-1, 6.3 kb; Phage-zth2-2, 40.4 kb) were obtained from the phages of strain zth2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp5">Supplementary file 3 and 5</xref>).

These analyses both showed that the bacteriophage genomes are completely outside of the host chromosomes. Through comparison of genome sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), IMG database analysis, and phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we confirmed that Phage-WC36-1 was the same as Phage-zth2-1 (inoviruses, belonging to the family <italic>Inoviridae</italic>, order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, class <italic>Faserviricetes</italic>), indicating that inoviruses might be common in the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> phylum. Inovirus members were the dominant population in the active group of viruses from deep-sea sediments, and encode some proteins contributing to host phenotypes and ultimately alter the fitness and other behaviors of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelhardt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mai-Prochnow et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition to genes encoding phage-associated proteins within the assembled bacteriophage genomes, there are also many genes encoding proteins associated with polysaccharide transport and degradation, which were potential AMGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shaffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pratama et al., 2021</xref>). These polysaccharide metabolizing proteins include TonB-system energizer ExbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koebnik, 2005</xref>), O-polysaccharide acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lunin et al., 2020</xref>), glucosaminidase, glycoside hydrolase family 127 protein (best BLASTP hit <italic>E</italic>-value 3<italic>e</italic>−25), and transglycosylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). GH127 is one of the CAZymes, which are specifically responsible for degrading polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>). Energizer ExbB is an important part of the TonB-system, which is often present in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and responsible for transport of oligosaccharides from the outer membrane into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foley et al., 2016</xref>). It is absent in the strain WC36 and zth2 genomes, however. In natural ecosystems, viral infections indirectly influence microbial metabolic fluxes, metabolic reprogramming, and energy homeostasis of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howard-Varona et al., 2020</xref>). For example, cyanoviruses possess AMGs encoding core photosynthetic reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>) which are highly expressed during infection, thus stimulating photosynthesis and enhancing viral abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lindell et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, these potential AMGs encoding TonB-system energizer ExbB and glycoside hydrolases might reprogram the polysaccharide metabolism of host cells (strains WC36 and zth2) by providing supplemental support to key metabolic processes. The above results provide stronger evidence that the relationship between Phages-WC36 and their host is not a fight to the death between enemies, but in contrast a mutualistic relationship between partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shkoporov et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides contain potential AMGs associated with polysaccharide degradation, which may play a key role in the degradation and utilization of polysaccharide by host cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Genomic organization of bacteriophages released from <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2 cultured in rich medium supplemented with polysaccharide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the genomic composition of Phage-WC36-1 and Phage-zth2-1.

Based on our results, we hypothesized that these chronic phages might assist the host to metabolize polysaccharides in this ‘selfishness’ mechanism, thus helping their hosts to grow and proliferate, so they could reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. In addition, we found that nucleic acids could induce a deep-sea wall-less bacterium (<italic>Hujiaoplasma nucleasis</italic> zrk29) to release chronic bacteriophages, which might support strain zrk29 to metabolize nucleic acids without lysing host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>).

Therefore, the mutualism between chronic phages and hosts may be widespread in the deep-sea microbes.

To assess the effect of laminarin on the growth of strain zth2, 100 µl of freshly incubated cells were inoculated in a 15-ml Hungate tube containing 10 ml rich medium supplemented with or without 3 g/l laminarin. Each condition was performed in three replicates. All the Hungate tubes were incubated at 28°C. The bacterial growth status was monitored by measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> value via a microplate reader (Infinite M1000 Pro; Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) every day until cell growth reached the stationary phase.</p><p>For transcriptomic analysis, a cell suspension of strain WC36 was harvested after culture in 1.5 l rich medium either without supplementation or with 10 g/l laminarin for 10 days. A cell suspension of strain zth2 was harvested after culture in rich medium either without supplementation or with 3 g/l laminarin for 4 days. Thereafter, these collected samples were used for transcriptomic analysis by Novogene (Tianjin, China). The detailed sequencing information was shown as below: (1) Library preparation for strand-specific transcriptome sequencing. A total amount of 3 μg RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The rRNA is removed using a specialized kit that leaves the mRNA. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5×). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNaseH<sup>−</sup>). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. In the reaction buffer, dNTPs with dTTP were replaced by dUTP. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3′ ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure was ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150–200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then 3 μl USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37°C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95°C before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. (2) Clustering and sequencing. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and paired-end reads were generated. (3) Data analysis. Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were firstly processed through in-house perl scripts. In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing ploy-N and low quality reads from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30, and GC content the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on the clean data with high quality. Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from genome website directly. Both building index of reference genome and aligning clean reads to reference genome were used Bowtie2-2.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene. And then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. FPKM, expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced, considers the effect of sequencing depth and gene length for the reads count at the same time, and is currently the most commonly used method for estimating gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>). (4) Differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis of two conditions/groups (two biological replicates per condition) was performed using the DESeq R package (1.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). DESeq provide statistical routines for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using a model based on the negative binomial distribution. The resulting p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted p &lt; 0.05 found by DESeq were assigned as differentially expressed. (For DEGSeq without biological replicates) Prior to differential gene expression analysis, for each sequenced library, the read counts were adjusted by edgeR program package through one scaling normalized factor. Corrected p-value of 0.005 and log<sub>2</sub> (Fold change) of 1 were set as the threshold for significantly differential expression. (5) GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was implemented by the GOseq R package, in which gene length bias was corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Young et al., 2010</xref>). GO terms with corrected p-value less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differential expressed genes. KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanehisa et al., 2008</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanehisa et al., 2008</xref>).

Total RNAs from each sample were extracted using the Trizol reagent (Solarbio, China) and the RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). Then RNAs from corresponding sample were reverse transcribed into cDNA and the transcriptional levels of different genes were determined by qRT-PCR using SybrGreen Premix Low rox (MDbio, China) and the QuantStudioTM 6 Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The PCR condition was set as following: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. 16S rRNA was used as an internal reference and the gene expression was calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method, with each transcript signal normalized to that of 16S rRNA.

Briefly, 1 μg/ml DNase I and RNase A were added to the concentrated phage solution for nucleic acid digestion overnight at 37°C. The digestion treatment was inactivated at 80°C for 15 min, followed by extraction with a Viral DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, genome sequencing was performed by Biozeron Biological Technology Co Ltd (Shanghai, China). The detailed process of library construction, sequencing, genome assembly, and annotation was described below: (1) Library construction and Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Briefly, for Illumina pair-end sequencing of each phage, 1.0 μg genomic DNA was used for the sequencing library construction. Paired-end libraries with insert sizes of ~400 bp were prepared following the standard procedure. The purified genomic DNA was sheared into smaller fragments with a desired size by Covaris, and blunt ends were generated using the T4 DNA polymerase. And the desired fragments were purified through gel electrophoresis, then enriched and amplified by PCR. The index tag was introduced into the adapter at the PCR stage and we performed a library quality test. Finally, the qualified Illumina pair-end library was used for Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing (150 bp*2, Shanghai BIOZERON Co, Ltd). (2) Genome assembly. The raw paired end reads were trimmed to remove the Illumina adaptors and to retain high-quality reads (score of &gt;30 and length of &gt;36 bases), as recommended by the Trimmomatic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/">version 0.36</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) with parameters (SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:15, MINLEN: 75).

Some preliminary evidence for the potential role of auxiliary metabolic genes in aiding phage and/or host proliferation is also provided. The hypothesis being tested is fully supported with solid and convincing evidence and the findings are potentially generalizable with implications for our understanding of polysaccharide-mediated virus-host interactions and carbon cycling in marine ecosystems more broadly.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper synthesizes sequencing and phylogenic analyses of two Lentisphaerae bacteria and three phage genomes; electron microscopy imaging of bacterial/phage particles; differential gene expression analyses; differential growth curve analyses, and differential phage proliferation assays to extract insights into whether laminarin and starch can induce both host growth and phage proliferation. The data presented convincingly demonstrate that both host culture density and phage proliferation increase as a result having host, phage, and polysaccharide carbon source together in culture.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The AMG-centered elements of the article would be strengthened by more &quot;mechanistic&quot; experiments focusing on identifying &quot;HOW&quot; the polysaccharide processing, transport, and metabolism genes are being used by the phages to either directly increase viral infection/replication or else to indirectly do so by supporting the growth of the host (via mutualism). The concept of &quot;selfishness&quot; in bacterial systems and its potential role in viral life cycles could be more developed. Selfish bacteria are active throughout the water column of the ocean.

It is plausible that phages may be either hijacking such polysaccharide sequestration mechanisms to improve infectivity and ENTRY or else helping their hosts to grow and proliferate so they can reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. The current work does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct mechanistic possibilities. The paper would be strengthened by a more detailed/clear discussion of this possibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92345.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Rikuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Tianhang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Chaomin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This manuscript presents useful findings on several phage from deep sea isolates of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2 that further our understanding of deep sea microbial life.

Indeed, these AMGs may be only common in virulent phages, while have never been reported in chronic phages. In virulent phages, these genes typically act as lysozymes, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection. However, the chronic phages do not lyse the host. Therefore, the persistence of these genes in chronic phages may be due to their ability to assist the host in metabolizing polysaccharides. Finally, according to your suggestions, we have weakened the role of AMGs and added “potential” in front of it.

It is reported that filamentous phages could recognize and bind to the host pili, which causes the pili to shrink and brings the filamentous phages closer to and possibly through the outer membrane of host cells. The possible mechanism of other chronic phages release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. Thus, these chronic phages may have a wider host range. However, we were unable to further reveal the infection mechanism due to some techniques absence. Therefore, according to your suggestions, we have deleted this section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have previously reviewed this manuscript as a submission to another journal in 2022.

We added this sentence as “Currently, more and more attention has been paid to chronic life cycles where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964), which was different from the lysogenic life cycle that could possibly lyse the host under some specific conditions.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 66-69).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: Line 72.

Given that some filamentous phages also have a chronic life cycle that is not explicitly reported, we cannot accurately estimate their numbers. According to your suggestions, we have modified these descriptions as “however, to our best knowledge, only few phages have been described for prokaryotes in the pure isolates up to date (Roux et al., 2019; Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 73-75). In addition, the number of chronic phages in the biosphere cannot be accurately estimated, according to the latest report (Chevallereau et al., 2022), which showed that “a large fraction of phages in the biosphere are produced through chronic life cycles”. Therefore, we have modified this description as “Therefore, a large percentage of phages in nature are proposed to replicate through chronic life cycles” in the revised manuscript (Lines 87-88).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: Line 93.

I see the phage upregulation in Figure 1, however in the text and figure it would be good to also elaborate on what the background expression generally looks like. Perhaps a transcriptomic read normalization and recruitment to the genome with a display of the coverage map, highlighting the prophage would be helpful. Are the polysacharides directly influencing phage induction or is there some potential for another cascading effect?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have elaborated all expressions of phage-associated genes under different conditions in the Supplementary Table 1, which showed that the background expressions were very low. The numbers in Fig. 1C were the gene expressions (by taking log2 values) of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin compared with the rich medium alone.</p><p>In addition, our qRT-PCR results (Fig. 1D) also confirmed that these genes encoding phage-associated proteins were significantly upregulated when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium. According to your suggestions, we have modified this description as “In addition to the up-regulation of genes related to glycan transport and degradation, when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium, the most upregulated genes were phage-associated (e. g. phage integrase, phage portal protein) (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table 1), which were expressed at the background level in the rich medium alone.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 136-140). Based on the present results, we speculate that polysaccharides might directly induce phage production, which needs to be verified by a large number of experiments in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: Line 179. We need some assurance that phage was not introduced by your laminarin or starch supplement. Perhaps a check on the TEM/sequencing check of supplement itself would be helpful? This may be what is meant on Line 188 &quot;without culturing bacterial cells&quot; however this is not clearly worded if that is the case. Additional note, further reading reinforces this as a key concern. Many of the subsequent results are consistent with a contaminated starch stock.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments.

It would be informative to sequence in-bulk each of your treatments as opposed to just sequencing the viral isolates (starch and no host included) to see what viruses can be identified in each.

For genomic sequencing, strains WC36 and zth2 were grown in the liquid rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin and starch and harvested after one week of incubation at 28 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated by using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Thereafter, the genome sequencing was carried out with both the Illumina NovaSeq PE150 (San Diego, USA) and Nanopore PromethION platform (Oxford, UK) at the Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. A complete description of the library construction, sequencing, and assembly was performed as previously described (Zheng et al., 2021). We used seven databases to predict gene functions, including Pfam (Protein Families Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/">http://pfam.xfam.org/</ext-link>), GO (Gene Ontology, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link>) (Ashburner et al., 2000), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) (Kanehisa et al., 2004), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/</ext-link>) (Galperin et al., 2015), NR (Non-Redundant Protein Database databases), TCDB (Transporter Classification Database), and Swiss-Prot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/</ext-link>) (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000). A whole genome Blast search (E-value less than 1e-5, minimal alignment length percentage larger than 40%) was performed against above seven databases.</p><p>The completeness of the genomes of strains WC36 and zth2 were 100%, which were checked by the CheckM v1.2.2. The size of the genome of strains WC36 and zth2 were 3,660,783 bp and 3,198,720bp, respectively. The complete genome sequences of strains WC36 and zth2 presented in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database with accession numbers CP085689 and CP071032, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, to verify whether the absence of microbial contamination in phage sequencing results, we used the new alignment algorithm BWA-MEM (version 0.7.15) to perform reads mapping of host WGS to these phages. We found that all the raw reads of host strains (WC36 and zth2) were not mapping to these phages sequences (Response Figure 3, shown as below). In addition, we also performed the evaluation of the assembly graph underlying the host consensus assemblies. Clean reads were mapped to the bacterial complete genome sequences by the Bowtie 2 (version 2.5.0), BWA (version 0.7.8) and SAMTOOLS (version 0.1.18). The results showed that the total mismatch rate of strains WC36 and zth2 were almost 0% and 0.03%, respectively (Response Table 1, shown as below). In addition, we also collected the cells of strains WC36 and zth2, and then sent them to another company for whole genome sequencing (named WC36G and ZTH, GenBank accession numbers CP151801 and CP119760, respectively).

How are you specifically defining AMGs in this study? Most of these are well-known and studied phage genes with specific life cycle functions and could not be considered as polysaccharide processing AMGs even though in host cells many do play a role in polysaccharide processing systems. A substantially deeper literature review is needed in this section, which would ultimately eliminate most of these from the potential AMG pools. Further, the simple HMM/BLASTp evalues are not sufficient to support the functional annotation of these genes. At a minimum, catalytic/conserved regions should be identified, secondary structures compared, and phylogenetic analysis (where possible) developed etc... My recommendation is to eliminate this section entirely from the manuscript.</p><p>Categorically:</p><p>- Glycoside hydrolase (various families), glucosaminidases, and transglycosylase are all very common to phage and operate generally as a lysins, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00745">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00745</ext-link> (and citations therein) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2023.10.018">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2023.10.018</ext-link> etc... In order to confirm these as distinct AMGs we would need a very detailed analysis indicating that these are not phage infection cycle/host recognition related, however I strongly suspect that under such interrogation, these would prove to be as such.</p><p>-TonB related systems including ExbB are well studied among phages as part of the trans-location step in infection. These could not be considered as AMGs. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00428-19">https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00428-19</ext-link>.

I suspect the latter is also the case here and this is a tail fiber gene.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions, we have reanalyzed these AMGs and made some modifications (the new version Fig. 5A, shown as below). These genes encoding proteins associated with polysaccharide transport and degradation may be only common in virulent phages, and have never been reported in chronic phages. Unlike virulent phages, these genes typically act as lysozymes, facilitating the release of virions from the host cell upon lysis, or injection of viral DNA upon infection, chronic phages do not lyse the host. It is reported that, filamentous phages could recognize and bind to the host pili, which causes the pili to shrink and brings the filamentous phages closer to and possibly through the outer membrane of host cells (Riechmann <italic>et al</italic>., 1997; Sun <italic>et al</italic>., 1987). The possible mechanism of other chronic phage release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. It has recently been reported that the tailless <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> phage particles are enclosed in lipid membrane and are released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner (Liu et al., 2022), and the prophage induction contributes to the production of membrane vesicles by <italic>Lacticaseibacillus casei</italic> BL23 during cell growth (da Silva Barreira et al., 2022). Therefore, the persistence of these genes in chronic phages may be due to their ability to assist the host in metabolizing polysaccharides.</p><p>Finally, according to your suggestions, we have weakened the role of AMGs and added “potential” in front of it.</p><p>References related to this response:</p><p>Riechmann L, Holliger P.

This section needs to start with detailed evidence that this phage can even infect this particular strain.

The presence of filamentous phages and hexagonal phages was detected in the supernatant of strain 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and 20 μl/mL Phages-WC36. After 3 passages of serial cultivation in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch, we found that filamentous phages and hexagonal phages were also present in basal medium supplemented with starch, but not in the basal medium, which may mean that Phages-WC36 could infect strain 273 and starch is an important inducer. In addition, the Phages-WC36 used in the growth assay of strain 273 were multiple purified and eventually suspended in SM buffer (0.01% gelatin, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgSO4). Thus, these phages are provided do not contain some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients. In addition, we set up three control groups in the growth assay of strain 273: basal medium, basal medium supplemented with Phages-WC36 and basal medium supplemented with starch. If the Phages-WC36 contains some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients, strain 273 could also grow well in the basal medium supplemented only with Phages-WC36. However, the poor growth results of strain 273 cultivated in the basal medium supplemented with Phages-WC36 further confirmed that there were not some extracellular enzymes and/or nutrients in these phages.</p><p>Finally, the possible mechanism of the chronic phage release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic manner. Thus, these chronic phages may have a wider host range. However, we were unable to further disclose the infection mechanism in this paper. Therefore, according to your suggestions, we have deleted this section entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 27: Line 460.

According to your suggestions, we have added the detailed information about the genome sequencing, annotation, and analysis as “Genome sequencing, annotation, and analysis of strains WC36 and zth2 For genomic sequencing, strains WC36 and zth2 were grown in the liquid rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin and starch and harvested after one week of incubation at 28 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated by using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Thereafter, the genome sequencing was carried out with both the Illumina NovaSeq PE150 (San Diego, USA) and Nanopore PromethION platform (Oxford, UK) at the Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. A complete description of the library construction, sequencing, and assembly was performed as previously described (Zheng et al., 2021b).

It is a really good idea to express individually or in combination on plasmids to see the effects of those polysaccharide-degradation proteins in the host cell. However, at present, we failed to construct the genetic and expression system for the strictly anaerobic strain WC36, which hindering our further detailed investigation of the functions of those polysaccharide-degradation proteins. In our lab, we are trying our best to build the genetic and expression system for strain WC36. We will definitely test your idea in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The paper would also benefit from additional experiments focused on determining how the polysaccharide processing, transport, and metabolism genes are being used by the phages to either directly increase viral infection/replication or else to indirectly do so by supporting the growth of the host in a more mutualistic manner (i.e. by improving their ability to import, degrade, and metabolize polysaccharides).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comments. Indeed, due to the chronic phage genome is not within the chromosome of the host, it is very hard to disclose the exact auxiliary process and mechanism of chronic phages. At present, we are trying to construct a genetic manipulation system for the strictly anaerobic host WC36, and we will gradually reveal this auxiliary mechanism in the future. In addition, combined with the reviewer 1’s suggestions, the focus of revised manuscript is to emphasize that polysaccharides induce deep-sea bacteria to release chronic phages, and most of the content of phage assisting host metabolism of polysaccharides has been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The introduction would benefit from a discussion of what is known regarding phage and/or viral entry pathways that utilize carbohydrate anchors during host entry. The discussion could also be improved by linking the work presented to the concept of &quot;selfishness&quot; in bacterial systems (see for instance Giljan, G., Brown, S., Lloyd, C.C. et al. Selfish bacteria are active throughout the water column of the ocean. ISME COMMUN. 3, 11 (2023) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7</ext-link>). The bacteria under study are gram negative and it was recently demonstrated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726">https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726</ext-link>) that &quot;selfish&quot; bacteria sequester metabolizable polysaccharides in their periplasm to advantage. It is plausible that the phages may be hijacking this &quot;selfishness&quot; mechanism to improve infectivity and ENTRY rather than helping their hosts to grow and profilerate so they can reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. The current work does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct mechanistic possibilities. The paper would be strengthened by at least a more detailed discussion of this possibility as well as the author's rationale for interpreting their data as they do to favor the &quot;mutualistic&quot; interpretation. In the same light, the paper would benefit from a more careful choice of words which can also help to make such a distinction more clear/evident/intentional. As currently written the authors seem to be actively avoiding giving insights wrt this question.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comments. According to your suggestions, we have added the related discussion as “Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that selfish bacteria, which were common throughout the water column of the ocean, could bind, partially hydrolyze, and transport polysaccharides into the periplasmic space without loss of hydrolysis products (Reintjes et al., 2017; Giljan et al., 2023). Based on our results, we hypothesized that these chronic phages might also enter the host through this “selfishness” mechanism while assisting the host in metabolizing polysaccharides, thus not lysing the host. On the other hand, these chronic phages might hijack this “selfishness” mechanism to improve their infectivity and entry, rather than helping their hosts to grow and proliferate, so they could reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. In the future, we need to construct a genetic operating system of the strictly anaerobic host strain WC36 to detailedly reveal the relationship between chronic phage and host.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 305-316).</p><p>References related to this response:</p><p>Reintjes, G., Arnosti, C., Fuchs, B.M., and Amann, R.

For example, if the phage systems studied are truly beneficial/mutualistic for the bacteria then it’s less likely that there would be evidence of targeted immunity against that particular phage that has the beneficial genes that support polysaccharide metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. According to your suggestions, we have carefully analyzed the genome of strain WC36, and found that there were no CRISPR/Cas9-related genes.
