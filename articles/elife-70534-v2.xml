make the correct mRNA product. In one of the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognizes the 5' splice site (5' SS) through a combination of base pairing, protein-RNA contacts, and interactions with other splicing factors. Previous studies investigating the mechanisms of 5' SS recognition have largely been done in vivo or in cellular extracts where the U1/5' SS interaction is difficult to deconvolute from the effects of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors or RNA structure. In this work we used colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to elucidate the pathway of 5' SS selection by purified yeast U1 snRNP. We determined that U1 reversibly selects 5' SS in a sequence-dependent, two-step mechanism. A kinetic selection scheme enforces pairing at particular positions rather than overall duplex stability to achieve long-lived U1 binding. Our results provide a kinetic basis for how U1 may rapidly surveil nascent transcripts for 5' SS and preferentially accumulate at these sequences rather than on close cognates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>snRNP</kwd><kwd>single-molecule fluorescence</kwd><kwd>CoSMoS</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM122735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM126914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Lloyd M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Sarah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM143780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The yeast U1 snRNP recognizes multiple features of target RNAs to reversibly identify splicing-competent 5' splice sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, the introns of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) must be identified and removed with nucleotide precision by the spliceosome to produce mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). The junction between an intron and the upstream exon is marked by the 5ʹ splice site (5ʹ SS) sequence, a motif that is essential for assembly of the spliceosome and both catalytic steps of splicing. Though the 5ʹ SS is marked by a conserved consensus sequence (5ʹ-GUAUGU in yeast, 5ʹ-GURAG in humans), only the first two nucleotides are nearly invariant (99% GU, &lt;1% GC) as they are necessary for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouser and Friesen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konarska, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker and Siliciano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vijayraghavan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). The other positions are degenerate, especially in the human genome where more than 9000 variants of the –3 to +6 region of the 5ʹ SS are utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roca et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this degeneracy, the precise determination of exon-intron boundaries is essential to healthy cellular function. An estimated 50% of all disease-related point mutations alter splicing in some way, with 14% of all disease-related point mutations occurring at splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soemedi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP) is responsible for 5ʹ SS selection during the earliest steps of spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lacadie and Rosbash, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosbash and Séraphin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruby and Abelson, 1988</xref>). The 5ʹ SS consensus sequence is complementary to the 5ʹ end of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lerner et al., 1980</xref>). Since the first 10 nucleotides of U1 snRNA (splice site recognition sequence [SSRS]) are perfectly conserved between yeast and humans, this implies a conserved mechanism of 5ʹ SS selection determined, in part, by base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosbash and Séraphin, 1991</xref>). However, the degeneracy of certain positions within the 5ʹ SS consensus shows that SSRS/5ʹ SS duplexes often form with less than complete complementarity, and a subset of SSRS/5ʹ SS interactions can even occur with noncanonical registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roca and Krainer, 2009</xref>). Additionally, there are many sequences which have a high degree of complementarity to U1 but are not utilized as splice sites (pseudo 5ʹ SS) or only used when nearby canonical 5ʹ SS are inactivated (cryptic 5ʹ SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roca et al., 2013</xref>). Together these observations show that base-pairing strength with the U1 SSRS alone cannot predict 5ʹ SS usage. Since the 5ʹ SS must be transferred from the U1 to the U6 snRNA for splicing to occur, spliced mRNA formation is a convolution of multiple 5ʹ SS recognition events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brow, 2002</xref>). As a result, it is difficult to determine how U1 SSRS/5ʹ SS interactions change between different sequences based on analysis of mRNAs.</p><p>Structural biology of both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) and human U1 snRNP has revealed how snRNP proteins could play key roles in 5ʹ SS recognition in addition to base pairing with the SSRS. In crystal structures of human U1 snRNP bound to a 5ʹ SS-containing RNA oligonucleotide (oligo), the conserved U1-C protein (Yhc1 in yeast) contacts the SSRS/5ʹ SS duplex in the minor groove at the pairing site between the nearly invariant 5ʹ SS G(+1) and U(+2) nucleotides with the snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in cryo-EM structures containing yeast U1 snRNP, Yhc1 contacts the SSRS/5ʹ SS duplex, also near G(+1), while a second yeast splicing factor, Luc7, contacts the snRNA strand opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>). The proximity of Yhc1 and Luc7 to the SSRS/5ʹ SS duplex are also consistent with genetic data supporting roles for these proteins in 5ʹ SS recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fortes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwer and Shuman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>). Filter-binding competition assays using a reconstituted human U1 snRNP showed that U1-C contributes to the affinity and specificity of U1 for 5ʹ SS RNA oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>). However, these assays are difficult to interpret with respect to a mechanism of 5ʹ SS discrimination since it is unclear if equilibrium was reached during the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarmoskaite et al., 2020</xref>), the assay was limited in its ability to directly detect interactions with non-consensus 5ʹ SS, and it provided no information on how or if the kinetics of U1 interactions differed between different 5ʹ SS RNAs. Thus, it is unknown if recognition of 5ʹ SS originates from U1’s failure to bind mismatched RNAs or due to a selection event occurring after association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immobilized yeast U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) forms reversible short- and long-lived interactions with a 5' splice site (5’ SS) oligo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM structure of the yeast U1 snRNP obtained as part of the spliceosome A complex (PDB 6G90).

Our results were consistent with a two-step mechanism for 5ʹ SS recognition by U1 that involves reversible formation of an initial weakly bound complex with RNA that can transition to a more stably bound state, as was proposed previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGrail and O’Keefe, 2008</xref>). Yet, neither our prior experiments nor those from other laboratories could exclude roles for other, non-U1 splicing factors present in the WCE in this process or potential influence of pre-mRNA structure on the observed kinetics.</p><p>In this study, we use CoSMoS to directly observe how individual yeast U1 snRNP molecules interact with short RNA oligos. The short- and long-lived interactions observed in cell extracts with large pre-mRNA substrates are also observed when purified U1 snRNP binds cognate RNAs providing direct evidence for these kinetic features being inherent to 5ʹ SS recognition. By using RNA oligos with varying base-pairing strength to the snRNA as well as with different locations and types of mismatches, we show that 5ʹ SS recognition leading to long-lived complexes occurs subsequent to binding. RNAs with limited pairing to the SSRS are released quickly after association while those with extended complementarity and pairing at certain positions are more likely to be retained and form long-lived complexes. Significantly, formation of long-lived U1/RNA complexes does not always correlate with the predicted thermodynamic stabilities of the SSRS/5ʹ SS RNA duplexes, which likely reflects the importance of snRNP proteins in the process. We propose that U1 uses a multi-step kinetic pathway to discriminate between RNAs and that formation of long-lived complexes is dependent on multiple factors that together favor U1 accumulation on introns competent for splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>U1 forms short- and long-lived complexes with RNAs containing a 5ʹ SS sequence</title><p>Since we wished to study U1/5ʹ SS interactions in the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, we first developed a protocol for purifying fluorophore-labeled U1 snRNP from yeast extract. We genetically encoded a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag on the U1 protein Snu71 and a SNAP-tag on the U1 protein Snp1 in a protease-deficient, haploid yeast strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). TAP-tagged Snu71 has previously been used to purify U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van der Feltz and Pomeranz Krummel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rigaut et al., 1999</xref>), and SNAP-tagged Snp1 has been used to fluorescently label and visualize U1-binding events by single-molecule fluorescence in WCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). Extracts were prepared from the dual-tagged strain, and U1 snRNP purified using published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van der Feltz and Pomeranz Krummel, 2016</xref>). Fluorophore labeling was carried out concertedly with TEV protease cleavage of the TAP tag, and excess fluorophore was removed during calmodulin affinity purification. In these experiments, a tri-functional SNAP-tag ligand containing a Dy649 fluorophore, biotin, and benzyl-guanine leaving group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) was used to simultaneously fluorophore label and biotinylate U1 on the Snp1 protein.</p><p>Purified U1 was characterized by mass spectrometry, and samples contained all known U1 components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Only a small number of peptides from other yeast splicing factors were identified, and these were not present in all replicates. Dideoxy sequencing of the isolated U1 confirmed the presence of the snRNA and SSRS, and the purified U1 was able to restore the splicing activity of WCE in which the endogenous U1 snRNA was degraded by targeted RNase H cleavage of the snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du and Rosbash, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The RNAs are based on the RP51A pre-mRNA 5ʹ SS sequence, a well-studied splicing substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rymond and Rosbash, 1985</xref>) and are identical except for substitutions within the 5ʹ SS region. Importantly, the RNAs contain the entire region known to cross-link with the U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGrail and O’Keefe, 2008</xref>) and all U1-interacting nt that could be modeled into cryo-EM densities of the spliceosome E and A complexes (the ACT1 intron stem loop observed in E complex being an exception) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>). The RNAs also contain all the sites shown to cross-link with U1 snRNP proteins except for non-conserved poly-U tracts located downstream of the 5ʹ SS (+27–46) that likely interact with the RRM domains of Nam8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puig et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Rosbash, 1999</xref>). We omitted this region to avoid potential interferences from 5ʹ SS-independent RRM/RNA interactions and folding of larger RNA substrates into structures that could compete with U1 interactions. The RNAs are predicted to have minimal stable secondary structure by mFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zuker, 2003</xref>) and range from limited complementarity with U1 (no more than two predicted contiguous base pairs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, RNA-control or RNA-C) to a maximum of 10 contiguous potential base pairs (RNA-10).</p><p>We immobilized the purified U1 snRNP with streptavidin on a passivated and biotinylated glass slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>) and readily observed single spots of fluorescence from the Dy649 fluorophore upon excitation at 633 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When a 29-nt RNA oligo containing a consensus 5ʹ SS and Cy3 fluorophore (RNA-4+2) was introduced, spots of Cy3 fluorescence began to transiently appear on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The spots of Cy3 fluorescence colocalized with the immobilized U1 molecules, and spots repeatedly appeared and disappeared from the same U1 molecule. This is consistent with multiple rounds of binding and release of the RNA-4+2 oligo during the experiment. As a control, we added a Cy3-labeled oligo which lacked any significant complementarity to U1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, RNA-C). We observed few Cy3 signals on the surface, and the event density (frequency of colocalized binding events) of RNA-C was 40-fold less than that of RNA-4+2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). While it is possible that non-specific interactions between RNA-C and U1 occurred too rapidly for us to detect, the large differences in event density between RNA-C and RNA-4+2 indicate that the vast majority of the detected binding events represent sequence-specific interactions.</p><p>RNA-4+2 dwell time distributions were analyzed using maximum likelihood methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>). We found that two exponential components were required to explain our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is consistent with the appearance of both short- and long-lived binding events observed in the time trajectories of single U1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The short-lived kinetic parameter (τ<sub>S</sub>) was ~13 s with an amplitude of 0.89 (where amplitude reflects the proportion of this time constant across the entire distribution), while the long-lived kinetic parameter (τ<sub>L</sub>) was much larger (~177 s) but with a smaller amplitude (0.11). When we increased the frame rate fivefold, we observed a similar distribution of signals that yielded similar fit parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). This indicates that τ<sub>S</sub> values of about 10 s can be effectively measured using our imaging protocol but does not preclude the presence of binding events with sub-second lifetimes.</p><p>To further explore the functional dynamics underlying our observations, we compared the likelihood of several kinetic models containing either one or two bound states using hidden Markov modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicolai and Sachs, 2013</xref>). A model featuring an initial short-lived RNA association followed by a transition to a long-live state was the most likely to explain our data, consistent with our dwell time analysis suggesting two bound populations. The most direct interpretation of this finding is that the U1 snRNP undergoes a reversible rearrangement that promotes long-lived lifetimes, a feature likely important for correct recognition of a 5ʹ SS. In this kinetic model, transitions into or out of the long-lived state are slow, and RNA dissociation from U1 occurs nearly 12-fold more rapidly than formation of the long-lived state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We conclude that RNAs can be quickly released by U1 after association even if those RNAs contain a consensus 5ʹ SS as in RNA-4+2. Further, the presence of a consensus site does not result in long-lived complex formation occurring more quickly than dissociation.</p><p>Previous analysis of U1-binding events on immobilized RP51A pre-mRNAs in yeast WCE (yWCE) also resulted in multi-exponential dwell time distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). The exponential fits of dwell times for RNA-4+2 binding to purified, immobilized U1 snRNP and for U1 snRNP (in WCE and without ATP) binding to immobilized RP51A pre-mRNAs containing the same 5' SS have similar parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). In both cases, most binding events are short-lived and with lifetimes of ~12 s. The long-lived kinetic parameter was smaller (64 vs. 177 s) but with a larger amplitude (0.3 vs. 0.1) than the events we observed with purified U1. Longer binding events of ~200 s were observed in WCE with this 5' SS but only when either CBC or BBP were also capable of binding the pre-mRNA.</p><p>Together, our data indicate that short- and long-lived interactions with RNA substrates are an inherent property of U1. Since we purified and immobilized U1 and studied its interactions with small RNAs, the diversity of binding events cannot solely originate from the influence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors present in a WCE or folding/unfolding of large RNA substrates. We do not exactly know how these factors influence U1 binding in complex environments, but they may be the origins of differences we observed between experiments carried out with purified U1 and with U1 present in WCE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Base-pairing potential accelerates U1/RNA complex formation</title><p>We next systematically studied how the base-pairing potential of the RNA oligo influenced binding by U1 snRNP.

All these substrates can form base pairs at the highly conserved G+1 and U+2 positions of the 5ʹ SS, and we extended base pairing outward from these positions toward the 5' and 3' ends of the SSRS.

In the first class, RNA oligos capable of forming &lt;6 contiguous base pairs showed very few colocalized binding events with U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While these oligos may have been able to form sequence-specific interactions with U1, these interactions were either too rapid or infrequent for us to observe. The few measurable events were essentially indistinguishable in frequency to background binding of RNA-C. RNAs capable of forming ≥6 contiguous base pairs exhibited a second class of behavior. These RNAs had a 100-fold increase in detectable U1-binding event density compared to RNAs in the first class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The dependence of the event density on the number of potential base pairs with the snRNA supports that the interactions are not only sequence dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) but are also due to interactions with the U1 SSRS.</p><p>For RNAs with detectable U1 binding, we were able to calculate the observed association rate (k<sub>association</sub>) to U1 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). RNAs capable of forming more potential base pairs with U1 bound more quickly. The correlation of the association rate with extent of base pairing could be due to RNAs with greater complementarity also having a greater probability of nucleating duplex formation due to the increased number of possible toeholds or short stretches of pairing interactions. This hypothesis is consistent with previous single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies and ensemble measurements of DNA and RNA oligo hybridization that show nucleation of nucleic acid duplex formation by base-pairing interactions of only 2–4 nt in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craig et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marimuthu and Chakrabarti, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wetmur, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wetmur and Davidson, 1968</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we observed that oligos capable of pairing toward the 3' end of the SSRS formed observable complexes more quickly than those where the pairing was shifted toward the 5' end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, RNAs-6a, -7a, and -8a vs. -6b, -7b, and -8b). This indicates that the 3' end of the SSRS might be either more accessible to the RNAs or can more easily facilitate nucleation of RNA interactions that lead to the observable binding events. This latter possibility may be related to the increased calculated thermodynamic stability of duplexes with pairing interactions closer to the 3' end of the SSRS due to the presence of a G/C pair in this region: RNAs-6a and -7a are predicted to form more stable duplexes than RNAs-6b and -7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The abundance of short- and long-lived U1/RNA complexes depends on base pairing</title><p>We next studied the dwell times with U1 for the same series of RNA oligos.

RNAs that could only form a few potential base pairs possessed predominantly short-lived dwell times (defined here as τ<sub>S</sub> &lt; 120 s) with a small fraction of long-lived (τ<sub>L</sub> &gt; 120 s) binding events and correspondingly small amplitude for the long-lived kinetic parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). As the number of potential base pairs increased, generally so did the amplitude of τ<sub>L</sub>. It is unlikely that these results arose from presence of two subpopulations of U1 snRNPs in our experiments (one capable of only making short-lived interactions and one capable of only making long-lived interactions) since we would not expect these subpopulations to change in abundance between experiments carried out with the same preparations of U1. Furthermore, hidden Markov modeling of RNA-4+2 (which considers the relationship between consecutive binding and unbinding events) favored a sequential scheme involving RNA binding followed by a transition to long-lived state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), likely due to a conformational change of the U1 snRNP, rather than direct formation of two different bound state complexes.</p><p>Instead, these data are most consistent with a mechanism in which U1 association with RNAs involves multiple steps. All RNAs that we can observe interacting with U1 (those capable of making <underline>&gt;</underline>6 base pairs) can form the short-lived complex. RNAs with a limited number of base pairs (i.e., RNAs-6a, -6b) rarely progress through the second step to form the long-lived complex and most often dissociate from the intermediate state. On the other hand, RNAs with many base pairs (RNAs-7–10) are more probable to transition to the long-lived complex.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note that RNAs in which the base pairing extends to the 3' end of the SSRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, RNAs-8a and -9a) also had a larger average bound time than those capable of forming the same number of base pairs but not reaching the 3' end of the SSRS (RNAs-8b and -9b). This suggests that pairing within the 3'-most nt of the SSRS closest to the zinc finger of Yhc1 is not only important for increasing the rate of U1 binding but also contributes to formation of the longest-lived U1/RNA complexes. Combined, these results support formation of a short-lived, intermediate between U1 and RNAs that is dependent on base pairing for its formation. The RNA can then dissociate from this intermediate or the U1/RNA complex can transition to more tightly bound state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Some U1/5ʹ SS duplexes are destabilized in the U1 snRNP</title><p>In addition to varying amplitudes, the short- and long-lived time constants from the fits (τ<sub>S</sub> and τ<sub>L</sub>) also varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The short-lived dwell time parameter (τ<sub>S</sub>) ranged from 12 to 120 s for RNA oligos capable of forming 6–10 contiguous, potential base pairs. The long-lived dwell time parameter (τ<sub>L</sub>) ranged from 137 to 388 s for RNA oligos capable of forming 7–10 base pairs. For both parameters, RNAs capable of forming more base pairs also tended to have longer dwell times. With the exception of τ<sub>S</sub> for RNA-10, τ<sub>S</sub> and τ<sub>L</sub> parameters only varied within a range of two- to fourfold. This was surprising since a previous single-molecule fluorescence study of RNA oligo hybridization reported a 10-fold decrease in off-rate due to presence of one additional base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisse et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that protein components of the U1 snRNP, in addition to the SSRS/5' SS base-pairing interactions, contribute to the small range in τ<sub>S</sub> and τ<sub>L</sub> we determined. To test this, we constructed a RNA-only mimic of the U1 SSRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this case, binding kinetics would only be influenced by the nucleic acid complexes being formed and not be influenced by snRNP proteins or structural constraints imposed by U1. Unlike U1 snRNP, the surface-immobilized mimic did not efficiently bind to the RNA oligos when they were present in solution at nM concentrations (the upper concentration limit of our single-molecule assay). So, we instead pre-annealed each oligo to the mimic and then measured its off-rate by monitoring disappearance of colocalized oligo fluorescence signals over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lifetimes of 5' splice site (5' SS) oligo/RNA interactions are dependent on base-pairing potential in an RNA-only mimic of the U1 splice site recognition sequence (SSRS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

This signifies that the RNAs are dissociating in a single observable step from the immobilized mimic and that dissociation was occurring from only a single type of RNA/mimic complex. The single-exponential kinetics are in contrast with results obtained for many of the same RNAs with U1 snRNP, for which multi-exponential kinetic equations were required to fit the dwell time data (RNA-7a,b; -8a,b; -9b, and -10). This was true for both a mimic that, like U1, contains pseudouridines in the SSRS as well as for one with uridine substitutions at those positions. While a comparison of the mimic and snRNP data is limited by the different experimental conditions (pre-annealing vs. equilibrium binding), the measured data are consistent with non-identical dissociation pathways for a given RNA oligo between the RNA-only mimic and the U1 snRNP.</p><p>In addition to differences in the dissociation pathways, the amount of time the oligos remained bound differed dramatically between the RNA mimic and U1. Dissociation rates from the mimic varied linearly with base-pairing potential over 20-fold, a larger range than for binding of the same oligos to U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Surprisingly, the lifetimes of many of the RNAs bound to the mimic were also much longer than their lifetimes bound to U1. For example, RNA-10 had a dissociation rate of 5.5×10<sup>–4</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> when bound to the pseudouridine-containing mimic. This corresponds to an average lifetime of 1818 s—more than fivefold larger than the τ<sub>L</sub> obtained for binding of the same RNA to U1. Again, given the limitations of these experiments, the data are consistent with the possibility some U1/5' SS duplexes can be destabilized in the context of the U1 snRNP. Thus, the lifetimes of U1/5' SS interactions in the snRNP cannot be predicted from base-pairing potential or studies of model RNA duplexes alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Long-lived U1/RNA interactions are sensitive to the location and type of mismatches</title><p>Splice sites with perfect and uninterrupted complementarity to U1 are very rare in yeast.

Most 5' SS are interrupted by one or more mismatches in complementarity to the U1 snRNA. We next tested how these mismatches impacted interactions of the RNA oligos with U1 snRNP. We analyzed and compared the binding interactions of RNAs capable of forming various numbers of contiguous base pairs between U1 SSRS nt +3 to +9. We incorporated mismatches systematically at each position resulting in RNAs that can form uninterrupted duplexes of seven or six base pairs (RNAs-7a, -6a, -6b) or interrupted duplexes of a total length of seven nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Whether or not RNAs containing mismatches that disrupt the duplex with the SSRS showed long-lived interactions (like RNA-7a) or only short-lived interactions (like RNA-6a, -6b) depended on the position of the mismatch. Neither RNA oligos containing a C/C mismatch at the +1 site nor an A/A mismatch at the +2 site were able form long-lived complexes with U1. However, RNA oligos containing U/U mismatches at +3 or+4 or a C/C mismatch at +5 could form long-lived complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). From these data we conclude that long-lived complex formation is sensitive to the tested mismatches at some positions (+1, +2) and not others (+3, +4) within a substrate of 7 bp end-to-end length. In addition, the same type of mismatch (C/C) could either prevent or permit long-lived complex formation depending on its position within the 7 bp duplex. Consequently, formation of long-lived U1/5' SS interactions does not correlate with predicted duplex stabilities (cf., RNA-5+1 vs. RNA-2+4, -6a, or -6b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Long-lived U1/RNA interactions depend on base pairing at the G+1 position of the 5’ SS</title><p>We next tested if a single mismatch could eliminate long-lived binding even if all other positions within the 5' SS oligo could potentially pair with SSRS. We incorporated single mismatches at the +1 position of RNA-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This results in a mismatch at the first position of the highly conserved 5' SS GU. All RNAs containing a mismatch at +1 were able to associate with U1 at rates ~100-fold greater than background binding by RNA-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, none of them were able to form appreciable amounts of the long-lived complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The observed distributions of dwell times for RNAs containing mismatches at +1 could still be best fit to two exponential distributions containing short- and long-lived parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). However, the amplitudes of the long-lived parameters were very small as expected from the scarcity of the long-lived events. Consistent with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the predicted thermodynamic stabilities again did not correlate with observation of the long-lived complexes. For example, RNA-2+7 (A+1) containing an A/C mismatch at the +1 position is predicted to form a more stable duplex than RNA-5+1 (ΔG<sup>o</sup> –4.4 to –2.7 kcal/mol). Yet, the amplitude of the long-lived parameter for RNA-5+1 is ~×14 greater than that for RNA-2+7 (A+1). These results show that long-lived complex formation between U1 and the RNA oligos is intolerant of mismatches at the +1 position. Failure of U1 to accumulate on RNAs with mismatches at the +1 site is not due to lack of association. Rather, recognition of a mismatch at +1 involves a discrimination step occurring after association and mismatched RNAs are rapidly released.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Long-lived interactions are greatly stimulated by G at the 5' splice site (5' SS) +1 position.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA oligos tested for interaction with U1 containing mismatches only at the +1 positions and the calculated free energy changes for duplex unwinding/formation based on nearest neighbor analysis.

U1 can form both short- and long-lived, sequence-dependent complexes with RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). RNA binding is accelerated by increased numbers of potential base pairs as well as by their positioning closer to the 3' end of the SSRS—the same region in which the Yhc1 and Luc7 proteins contact the 5' SS/SSRS duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Sequence-dependent interactions with lifetimes of several seconds are only observed with oligos capable of forming duplexes of at least 6 bp in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) while additional potential base pairing increases the probability of forming long-lived interactions lasting several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Relative to an RNA-only mimic, U1 snRNP binds freely diffusing oligos more readily when they are present at nM concentrations and accelerates the release of RNAs capable of forming the largest number of potential base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), indicating that snRNP proteins and/or U1 snRNA structure can destabilize the SSRS/5' SS duplex. Formation of long-lived interactions is dependent on the position of mismatches as well as pairing at the G+1 position rather than predicted thermodynamic stabilities of the RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>These results support a reversible multi-step binding process in which U1 first forms sequence-dependent short-lived interactions with RNAs via the SSRS and then transitions to a more stably bound complex if certain requirements are met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This agrees with previous single-molecule experiments with U1 in WCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>) and biochemical studies of the temperature dependence of yeast U1/RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2004</xref>) while providing further details of the 5' SS recognition process in the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors or confounding effects due to RNA secondary structures. We have not yet identified what specific event or conformational change is associated with long-lived complex formation; however, comparison of cryo-EM densities for free yeast U1 and the U1/U2-containing yeast pre-spliceosome (in which U1 is bound to a 5' SS) reveals that Yhc1 and Luc7 are more ordered in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that a disorder-to-ordered conformational change for Yhc1 and Luc7 results in the short- to long-lived transition inferred from our single-molecule assays. Mismatches at particular positions such as G+1 may inhibit this transition and/or prevent formation of stable contacts between the two proteins or with the RNA. In agreement with the importance of potential Yhc1/Luc7 contacts, mutants of Luc7 located at the Yhc1 interface exhibit numerous genetic interactions with U1 snRNP proteins and splicing factors involved in E complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We also note that interactions between U1 proteins and RNA sequences or structures not included in these experiments, such as RNA hairpins or binding sites for Nam8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaschka et al., 2018</xref>), may influence this process to further tune U1 binding on specific transcripts.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multi-step authentication model for 5' splice site (5' SS) recognition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U1 binding initially occurs by formation of a weakly interacting complex that is dependent on base-pairing potential between the RNA and U1 splice site recognition sequence (SSRS).

This scheme is consistent with 5' SS recognition involving conformational proofreading as has been implicated in many other nucleic acid recognition events including ribosome assembly and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodgers and Woodson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>). In the case of U1, the conformational change that leads to proofreading (rapid release of the RNA) or stable binding may involve rearrangement of Yhc1 and Luc7 as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Thus, the conformational proofreading would involve formation of different states of the U1 snRNP with different kinetic properties. The initial barrier to forming short-lived complexes is low and requires limited complementarity to the SSRS. Formation of this complex is readily reversible which permits rapid surveillance of transcripts by U1 for 5' SS and prevents accumulation of U1 on RNAs lacking features necessary for splicing.</p><p>Passage to the long-lived complex is more stringent and dependent on a G nucleotide at the +1 position as well as increased complementarity. It is likely that the need for pairing with G+1 evolved in U1 due to the importance of this nucleotide in splicing chemistry since G+1 at the 5' SS must form a non-Watson Crick pair with G-1 at the 3' SS during exon ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker and Siliciano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plaschka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, U1-binding kinetics prioritize identification of a nucleotide used for splicing chemistry even though U1 itself does not participate in those steps.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that formation of the long-lived state often correlated with predicted duplex length more so than predicted duplex stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, e.g., RNA-5+1 vs. RNA-6a or -6b). This suggests that 5' SS recognition involves a ‘molecular ruler’ like those observed in other RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macrae et al., 2006</xref>). From our data, we would predict that U1 uses this ruler activity to preferentially form long-lived interactions with RNA duplexes &gt;7 bp in end-to-end length. In terms of U1 snRNP structure, duplexes of 6–7 bp in length are needed to span the distance between the zinc finger of Yhc1 to the second zinc finger of Luc7 and the Yhc1/Luc7 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>)—suggesting a role for duplex length in conformational changes or intermolecular contacts associated with stable 5' SS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>A duplex length requirement of at least 7 bp is surprising since the consensus sequence of the 5' SS indicates only six highly conserved positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). How then would most natural 5' SS in yeast be able to stably bind U1? When predicted end-to-end duplex lengths between the SSRS and yeast 5' SS are analyzed, rather than their specific nucleotide sequences, it is apparent that the overwhelming majority of 5' SS can form extended duplexes with U1 with the caveat that these duplexes may contain one or more internal mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consequently, we would predict that most yeast 5' SS are able to meet duplex length requirements for long-lived complex formation.</p><p>An additional consequence of this length requirement and the duplexes described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is that they also favor base-pairing interactions between the 5' end of the U1 SSRS and the 3' end of the splice site. For example, each of the RNAs in our study capable of forming long-lived interactions also could pair at the +6 position (G/GUAUG<underline>U</underline>) of the 5' SS. This particular position of the 5' SS is important since it also pairs with the ‘<underline>A</underline>CAGA’ sequence of the U6 snRNA (base-pairing position underlined) to promote splicing catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sontheimer and Steitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kandels-Lewis and Séraphin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Abelson, 1996</xref>). As mentioned above for recognition of G+1, the kinetic properties of U1 are, in part, optimized to facilitate interactions between the 5' SS and the splicing machinery that are important for catalysis even after U1 is released.</p><p>Together these observations also suggest that for many consensus SS, U1 can recognize and be retained on introns even if other intron features, such as the branch site, have not yet been transcribed in agreement with models for fast, co-transcriptional recruitment of U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oesterreich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tardiff et al., 2006</xref>). However, on weak SS it is likely that non-U1 splicing factors play a role in bypass of the molecular ruler to permit U1 accumulation. As an example of bypass, we previously observed that pre-mRNAs containing a weak 5’ SS with only a 5 bp end-to-end length can form long-lived complexes with U1 in WCE but only when either the CBC or BBP/Mud2 could also bind the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). One limitation of our model is that we do not yet know if these <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors can also bypass the need for pairing with G+1 in the assays used here. Regardless, it is notable that only the branch site-binding factors, BBP/Mud2, increased the probability of long-lived complex formation and not just its lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson and Hoskins, 2017</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that retention of U1 on transcripts is governed through direct and indirect interactions with intronic sequences involved in splicing chemistry including both the 5' SS and branch site.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Base-pairing potential does not predict U1 interaction kinetics</title><p>Our data show that the lifetime of the U1/5' SS interaction cannot be predicted based on the thermodynamic stability of the base-pairing interactions alone likely due to the influence of snRNP proteins. Rather, strong positional effects lead to prioritization of base pairing at particular positions for stable retention of U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). How kinetic stability of U1 at a particular 5' SS correlates with its subsequent use by the spliceosome has not yet been determined. If 5' SS usage does correlate with U1 lifetimes, then our results would be in strongest agreement with computational models for 5' SS identification that consider positional effects and interdependencies rather than simply the thermodynamic stabilities of the predicted base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yeo and Burge, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Since failure to release U1 can inhibit splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</xref>), we would expect that optimal promotion of splicing by yeast U1 would occur by balancing its recruitment and retention with release. This ‘Goldilocks’ model has previously been proposed for 5' SS recognition by human U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiou et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the lifetimes of the longest-lived U1/RNA complexes were similar to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and lifetimes of the RNAs capable of making 9 or 10 base pairs were much shorter when bound to U1 than expected based on their off-rates from an RNA mimic of the SSRS given the limitations of our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). U1 may equilibrate its interactions with 5' SS by both stabilizing and destabilizing RNA duplexes. As a result, U1’s interactions with sequence-diverse substrates may all be ‘just right’ for subsequent steps in splicing. This, in turn, may impact the ATP requirement for U1 release during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for human 5' SS recognition</title><p>While much of the catalytic machinery of the spliceosome is well conserved between yeast and humans, we do not yet know if the mechanism of 5' SS recognition we propose also holds true for human U1. Chemical probing data of human U1 revealed allosteric modulation of the SSRS based on positioning of splicing regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shenasa et al., 2020</xref>). Differing conformations of the SSRS could lead to differences in binding behavior and give rise to short- or long-lived binding interactions like those we observe with yeast U1. Whether or not the SSRS of yeast U1 displays similar changes in conformation has not been determined. Ensemble binding data for human U1/RNA interactions also revealed a strong preference for formation of stable complexes on pairing at the G+1 site as well as position- and mismatch-dependent effects at other locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tatei et al., 1987</xref>). This agrees with our single-molecule data on yeast U1 interactions. While it is possible that yeast and human U1 may have differing pathways for splice site recognition, the outcome of longer-lived binding on particular RNA sequences may be the same.</p><p>Finally, the large number of non-obligate accessory factors that associate with human U1 may yield highly malleable pathways for RNA binding. Different factors may tune 5’ SS recognition by a holo-U1 complex to yield distinct kinetic mechanisms. This in turn could lead to enhancement or repression of U1 accumulation at particular sites or functional differences between U1 complexes involved in splicing or telescripting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh et al., 2017</xref>).

While Cas9 (involved in bacterial CRISPR-based immunity), Hfq (involved in bacterial small RNA regulation) and Argonaute (AGO, involved in mRNA repression and silencing) RNPs are involved in very different biological processes than RNA splicing, single-molecule studies of each of these RNPs reveal striking similarities with yeast U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globyte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Małecka and Woodson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). All these RNPs exhibit kinetic behaviors that lead to prioritization of certain sequences over others and are distinct from ‘all-or-nothing’ models for hybridization of nucleic acids in the absence of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wetmur, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wetmur and Davidson, 1968</xref>). In the cases of AGO and Cas9, correct base pairing with the micro-RNA seed sequence (AGO) or PAM (Cas9) is necessary for fast and stable binding. Rapid reversibility of this interaction ensures that these RNPs can dissociate and find other targets if mismatches are detected within the priority region. Additional base pairing with the target then leads to the most stable binding interaction, consistent with binding occurring in multiple steps. These results are analogous to reversible interrogation of RNAs by U1 that prioritizes pairing at the G+1 site and formation of extended duplexes for stable interaction. Cas9 also accelerates target search by diffusion along DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globyte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). While this has not been directly tested with U1, tethering of U1 to the pol II transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kotovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), rather than RNAs themselves, may lead to similar acceleration in binding site identification. Indeed, our kinetic modeling of U1 interactions with a consensus 5' SS containing RNA shows that RNA association is relatively slow and on the order of ~10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>. Association of U1 with the transcription machinery may be needed to increase the effective local concentration of substrate RNAs and to explain in vivo observations of fast, co-transcriptional binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BJ2168 (MATa prc1–407 prb1–1122 pep4–3 leu2 trp1 ura3–52 gal2)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bruce Goode Lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">yAAH0001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U1-SNAP-TAP (BJ2168 +SNP1::SNP1-fSNAP-Hyg+SNU71::SNU71-TAP-URA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">yAAH0393</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Methods, Tap Tagging of Yeast U1 snRNP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid for in vitro transcription of RP51A (pBS117)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Michael Rosbash Lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Séraphin and Rosbash, 1991</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAH0016</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U1 cOligo (DNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JL-U1 5’ complement</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5ʹ-CTT AAG GTA AGT AT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U1 RT Oligo (DNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SRH15</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5ʹ-TCA GTA GGA CTT CTT GAT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U1 snRNA mimic (UU, RNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SRH21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5ʹ-AUA CUU ACC UUA AGA UAU CAG AGG AGA UCA AGA AG /3Cy5Sp/</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U1 snRNA mimic (ΨΨ, RNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SRH36</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5ʹ-AUA CΨΨ ACC UUA AGA UAU CAG AGG AGA UCA AGA AG /3Cy5Sp/</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Handle for U1 mimic (DNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SRH22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5ʹ-/Biotin/ TCT CTT CTT GAT CTC CTC TGA TAT CTT A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA-Cy3 oligomers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Criterion TGX Precast Gel (4–20%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

The cleaned coverslips were silanized using freshly prepared 1% v/v Vectabond in acetone (~30 mL to cover) for 10 min at room temperature.

The red laser (633 nm) was set to 250 μW, and the green laser (532 nm) was set to 400 μW for data collection. The fluorescence signal was imaged at 1 s exposure at 5 s intervals unless otherwise specified. For all experiments, the imaging buffer included glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase, as oxygen scavengers (OSS), and rolox as a triplet state quencher (TSQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2008</xref>). Drift correction was performed, as necessary, by tracking the movement of individual immobilized spots for the duration of the experiment. Auto-focusing was carried out using a 785 nm laser and was done every minute in-between exposures. Mapping files were generated each day using TransFluorSpheres (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fluorescent in both the &lt;635 and &gt;635 nm fields of view (FOV).</p><p>For experiments with the U1 snRNA mimic, prepared slides were first washed with 200 μL Annealing Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl) with 0.01 mg/mL yeast tRNA. Prior to imaging, each lane was washed with 70 μL 0.2 mg/mL streptavidin in Annealing Buffer (+tRNA) which was immediately washed away with 70 μL Annealing Buffer (+tRNA). The annealed mimic/handle/oligomer complex was diluted by a factor of 1:2000–5000 in Annealing Buffer (+OSS +TSQ +tRNA) and the lane was washed with 70 μL of this solution. The accumulation of the complex on the slide surface was monitored in real time in the &gt;635 nm FOV and when the desired density of spots was achieved, excess components were washed away using 70 μL Annealing Buffer (+OSS +TSQ +tRNA). To initiate movies, the buffer in the lane was exchanged with 90 μL Mock Splicing Buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.3, 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 20 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 8% v/v glycerol, 5% w/v PEG-8000, 1.4 mM DTT, +OSS +TSQ +tRNA) and data recording was immediately started. For less stable complexes (e.g<italic>.</italic>, RNA-7a), 30 min of data collection was sufficient to observe the dissociation of most (&gt;90%) RNA oligomers. For the most stable complexes (e.g., ΨΨ mimic + RNA-10), 80 min of data collection was necessary and imaging intervals were reduced to 1 exposure/10 s.</p><p>For experiments with U1 snRNP, prepared slides were first washed with 200 μL Mock Splicing Buffer with 0.05 mg/mL heparin and 0.01 mg/mL yeast tRNA. Subsequent steps were performed one lane at a time. The lane was washed with 70 μL 0.2–0.4 mg/mL streptavidin in Mock Splicing Buffer (+heparin +tRNA) which was allowed to incubate with the slide surface for 2–5 min. The lane was then washed with 70 μL 0.5 mg/mL (×10) heparin in Mock Splicing Buffer (+tRNA) and incubated for 10 min before U1 snRNP was added. U1 snRNP was diluted to a final concentration of 5–20 nM in Mock Splicing Buffer (+heparin +tRNA +OSS +TSQ) and added to the lane. The accumulation of fluorescent spots was monitored periodically in the &gt;635 nm FOV until an optimal density was achieved (usually 2–5 min), then the excess complexes were washed away with 70 μL Mock Splicing Buffer (+heparin +tRNA +OSS +TSQ). Finally, the lane was washed with 70 μL 10 nM RNA-Cy3 in Mock Splicing Buffer (+heparin +tRNA +OSS +TSQ) and data recording was immediately started. In U1 snRNP experiments, the Cy3 signal was typically imaged at 1 s exposure at 5 s intervals for 360 frames (30 min). We determined that the lifetimes measured in these experiments were not being limited by photobleaching by performing control experiments where the power of the 532 nm laser was varied from 200 to 600 μW or where the periodicity of the 1 s exposure was increased to 10 s.</p><p>Raw microscopy source data can be downloaded using Figshare at the link below: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6164067">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6164067</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>).

To construct these plots, the dwell times were binned, and the probability of each bin was divided by the product of the bin width and the total number of events in the data set to compute a probability density value. The ordinate values are plotted on the log-scale to clearly show the difference in fitted time constants. Bin values were chosen to adequately represent the underlying distribution. Error bars for each bin were calculated as previously described based on the error of binomial distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>).

Excitation and emission passed through a 60×1.49 NA oil immersion objective (Olympus). Emission was split with using a dual-view system built as previously described except that the optics were mounted in an optical cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson et al., 2014</xref>).

by the U1 snRNP using co-localization single-molecule spectroscopy. Compelling experimental and analytical approaches yielded three important conclusions: (1) the association of the U1 snRNP with the 5' splice site is largely determined by the snRNP itself and does not require other splicing factors; (2) sequence features of the 5' splice site determine whether a short-lived complex with U1 dissociates or transitions into a longer-lived, &quot;productive&quot; complex, potentially mediated by stabilized contacts with U1 associated proteins; and (3) the ability to form the longer-lived complex cannot be accurately predicted by base-pairing potential alone, as presumed by many predictive algorithms. This work will be of interest to colleagues in the splicing field as well as to others in fields where nucleic acid recognition by snRNPs plays a major role.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70534.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Staley</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Staley</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.18.443434">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.443434v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jonathan P Staley as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nils Walter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors implicate protein in favoring the long-lived complex studied, imposing asymmetry of importance in base pairing, decreasing the stability of base pairing, and favoring base pairing length over thermodynamic stability. The authors further speculate a role for protein-RNA contacts involving Ych1 and Luc7, given informative, published structures. To corroborate the importance of protein in these features of 5' splice site recognition and to sharpen the mechanistic focus of the manuscript, the authors need to test the impact of Yhc1 and Luc7 mutants at the protein-RNA interface for roles in these features – especially Yhc1, given that the authors have already published on the impact of mutations in Yhc1. Otherwise, given the extensive work the authors have previously performed to already demonstrate that U1 snRNP binds to a 5'SS reversibly, with fast and slow dissociation events, one could argue that the current work falls somewhat short in providing new major biological insights.</p><p>2) On a related point, in the section describing U1/5'SS duplexes destabilization in U1 snRNP (line 281) an underlying assumption is that the binding of two RNAs (in the absence of the spliceosomal proteins) would share the same characteristics or trends as two identical RNAs incorporated into the U1 snRNP. While this may be a rhetorical device to increase the clarity/connection between the concepts of predicted binding free energies and the residence time of hybridized oligonucleotides, it does not address the possible reasons for the discrepancy observed in RNA oligonucleotide versus U1 snRNP binding. Further, in the Discussion (lines 395-398), the authors mention that while this study cannot identify a specific interaction or event that stabilizes the long-lived complex, structural studies implicate two U1 associated proteins: Yhc and Luc7. They further describe the interactions that could be implicated based on their findings. It is very difficult to follow this description of the contacts in the context of the larger snRNP structure without an illustrative figure. The authors should point to a reference and derive a physical model from the available cryo-EM structures to show that the U1 snRNA is, most likely, being constrained by its associated proteins in such a way that it increases the binding affinity to complementary RNA oligonucleotides. It would be helpful to add a figure based on the plethora of existing structural data to contextualize the findings of the current work (U1 SSRS/5'SS duplex), showing the protein contacts that the authors implicate in the conformational and thermodynamic modulation of the U1 SSRS/5'SS duplex.</p><p>3) Since splice sites are often &quot;found&quot; in the context of alternative or pseudo/near-cognate splice sites, it would be relevant to the biological significance of the study to ask whether the &quot;rules&quot; identified in the experiments presented in this study influence splice site competition and whether both the short- and long-lived states are subject to competition or, rather, only the short-lived complexes. If possible, it would be beneficial to repeat the CoSMoS experiment with two oligomer sequences of different colors or to assess the impact of adding an unlabeled competitor.</p><p>4) While the two-factor authentication metaphor of Figure 7 is charming, it seems off-topic. Instead, the authors should review the literature for examples of short, exploratory binding events involving an RNA:protein complex, followed by more stable, accommodated binding events, see e.g., the work by Sarah Woodson on 30S ribosomal subunit assemble and on Hfq function, work on kinetic proofreading of the ribosome, work on Cas9-based recognition of its target site, and many others. A potential descriptive framework to be used here is that of &quot;conformational proofreading&quot;. Further, the use of &quot;multi-factor authentication&quot; seems inappropriate for a research article title.</p><p>5) The model described in the paragraphs starting with line 262 through 280 to interpret the observation of long and short complex lifetimes is not entirely clear. There are at least two potential models that can be considered to fit the observations: a linear and a circular model. A linear model would be one where U1 and substrate RNA are not associated (state 1), then they partially associate (state 2), and finally they isomerize to the completely associated/fully hybridized complex (state 3). The circular model is the same, except that it would additionally allow switching between states 1 and 3 directly (bypassing the partially associated state). To differentiate between these two scenarios, the authors would have to vary the concentration of the RNA probe and see if there is a uniform change in a single k<sub>on</sub> rate or if two k<sub>on</sub> rates start to appear. These rate subpopulations would be much easier to detect by fitting with hidden Markov models. It would seem unjustified to decide between these two models without obtaining such additional supporting data.</p><p>6) There is significant concern that the single molecule sampling rate used to acquire the CoSMoS data is too slow to accurately measure the shortest lifetimes observed, which are only ~10 seconds long. According to the Nyquist sampling criterion, the sampling rate needs to be (at least) twice the frequency of the event being measured, implying that the authors cannot meaningfully observe any lifetime shorter than ~10 seconds given their limited sampling rate. Further considering that at minimum two consecutive data points are needed for observing a 10 second lifetime, artifacts (e.g., camera noise) could make up a disproportionate amount of the signal observed in their data for these short lifetimes. For an accurate measurement, the authors need to repeat the experiments at a higher sampling rate to make sure that there are no faster, transient interactions than those currently reported, and that the values reported are accurate.</p><p>7) The authors have chosen to extrapolate rates via exponential fitting to dwell time distributions. This is a reductive approach that ignores the relationship between consecutive events. It is strongly recommended that the authors consider using a hidden Markov modeling (HMM) approach instead. HMMs have long become the gold standard in single molecule biophysics. Even better, a Bayesian approach could help analyze entire datasets at the same time. In this reviewer's opinion, the ebFRET software package from the Gonzalez lab at Columbia University could, for example, work well here.</p><p>8) The authors should say more about the particular requirement for basepairing at position 6, especially in the context of the experiments in Figure 5. This is particularly striking as this position is not well conserved in natural 5'ss, at least compared to position 5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70534.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors implicate protein in favoring the long-lived complex studied, imposing asymmetry of importance in base pairing, decreasing the stability of base pairing, and favoring base pairing length over thermodynamic stability.

First, a major question from our previous studies has been ambiguity surrounding the source of both long- and short-lived binding events observed between U1 and substrate RNAs. Previously we could not rule out the presence of either RNA secondary structure or unknown components of the extract as sources of these observations. Our work here with purified U1 shows that U1 itself can interact with substrate RNAs in kinetically distinct ways. This information is critical for understanding the fundamental basis of snRNP/RNA recognition.</p><p>Second, we show that binding behaviors are highly variable depending on the extent of base pairing and the position of mismatches. Importantly, strong positional effects lead to discrimination against mismatches at certain sites and not others even when the predicted thermodynamic stability for duplex formation is strong. While this has been implied by numerous other studies, our work shows that this discrimination has a kinetic basis. Finally, this discrimination appears to be occurring at a step after initial binding: RNAs with mismatches at certain cites still associate with U1 but do so transiently. This indicates a kinetic proofreading-like mechanism is at play that permits rapid and reversible surveillance of RNAs, efficient rejection of those containing certain mismatches, and efficient stabilization of those containing high complementary to U1. All these pieces of information are fundamental for understanding how splice site recognition occurs and for understanding the kinetic and thermodynamic basis of these events rather than just inferring rules based on phenomenological observations.</p><p>In response to the second point, developing purification protocols for U1 snRNPs containing mutant U1s is well beyond the scope of the current manuscript. First, relatively little is understood about how Luc7 impacts 5’ splice site usage beyond early studies by Mattaj and Seraphin and more recent work by Shuman and Schwer. Specifically, neither group has addressed how Luc7 mutations impact usage of sequences which is necessary to correlate protein mutations with impact on binding of some sequences and note others. Second, mutation of either Yhc1 or Luc7 may significantly destabilize the snRNP and prevent its purification. There is already precedent for this. The relatively benign (at 30<sup>o</sup>C) <italic>luc7-1</italic> mutation that impacts 5’ splice site usage dramatically alters the protein composition of the U1 snRNP purified using the TAP tag (see Fortes, Mattaj, et al., Genes &amp; Dev, 1999; figure 5D). While this and other mutants are useful mechanistic tools, the experimental requirements for confirming a compositionally and structurally intact mutant U1 snRNPs are beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a related point, in the section describing U1/5'SS duplexes destabilization in U1 snRNP (line 281) an underlying assumption is that the binding of two RNAs (in the absence of the spliceosomal proteins) would share the same characteristics or trends as two identical RNAs incorporated into the U1 snRNP.

These are now Figure 1a, b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since splice sites are often &quot;found&quot; in the context of alternative or pseudo/near-cognate splice sites, it would be relevant to the biological significance of the study to ask whether the &quot;rules&quot; identified in the experiments presented in this study influence splice site competition and whether both the short- and long-lived states are subject to competition or, rather, only the short-lived complexes.

We have altered the title of the manuscript to reflect this, changed the graphics for the model proposed in Figure 7A, and have included a discussion of conformational proofreading on pages 19-20. We did not reference ribosome assembly work by Woodson but have now included that in revised manuscript in our discussion of conformational proofreading, which is provide below for convenience.</p><p>“Combined, our data also indicate that binding involves several checkpoints before long-lived complexes are formed (Figure 7). This scheme is consistent with 5' SS recognition involving conformational proofreading as has been implicated in many other nucleic acid recognition events including ribosome assembly and translation (Rodgers and Woodson, 2019, Blanchard et al., 2004). In the case of U1, the conformational change that leads to proofreading (rapid release of the RNA) or stable binding may involve rearrangement of Yhc1 and Luc7 as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Thus, the conformational proofreading would involve formation of different states of the U1 snRNP with different kinetic properties. The initial barrier to forming short-lived complexes is low and requires limited complementarity to the SSRS. Formation of this complex is readily reversible which permits rapid surveillance of transcripts by U1 for 5' SS and prevents accumulation of U1 on RNAs lacking features necessary for splicing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The model described in the paragraphs starting with line 262 through 280 to interpret the observation of long and short complex lifetimes is not entirely clear.

It would seem unjustified to decide between these two models without obtaining such additional supporting data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is good point. Collecting more data with RNA-4+2 would be a great way to get address this question; however, our data were already collected at 10 nM RNA which is the effective concentration barrier in these experiments due to background fluorescence and non-specific binding of the oligos that resulted in data too noisy to reliably interpret.</p><p>We have performed a new analysis to compare the probability of different models for the current data. We have built and optimized three different kinetics models in QuB using maximum idealized point estimation and ranked them according to their Bayesian information criterion (weighting the likelihood of the model with the number of free parameters in the model) for RNA-4+2 binding to U1 snRNP. This is an HMM approach that directly optimizes rate constants from idealized data for a user constructed model (see Qin, Auerbach, and Sachs, Biophysical Journal, 2000).</p><p>These new results are now provided in Figure 1G (see comment #2), and Figure 1-Source Data 3.</p><p>Overall, Model 2 featuring a sequential RNA association followed by a longer-lived bound state provided the lowest BIC score which suggests this model best explains our data (of the models we have tested). Model 3 on the other hand, a circular version of Model 2 proposed by the reviewer, is less favorable for explaining our observations. These results suggest the additional state transitions in Model 3 are not necessary to describe our observations. We are confident in the model we have proposed in the manuscript, given the limitations of our data.</p><p>Of note, we have performed this analysis on RNA-4+2 as this sequence accounts for a very common 5’SS in yeast (~26% of yeast introns (77/298) are G/GUAUGU) as well as the 5’SS observed in the most frequently studied model introns (RP51A, ACT1, and UBC4). We do not wish to over interpret our data with respect to other, less common splice sites.</p><p>A new section to the Methods has been added to describe our HMM methods, which is provided below for convivence.</p><p>“Kinetic modeling of RNA-4+2 was performed using QuB (Nicolai and Sachs, 2013) as previously described (White et al., 2021). Three different hidden Markov models were built, and the transition rates were globally optimized across all molecules using maximum idealized point estimation (Qin et al., 2000). (Figure 1-Source Data 3). The goodness of fit of each model was assessed by the Bayesian information criterion (Schwarz et al., 1978) in Equation 3 where <italic>k</italic> is the number of free parameters in the model, <italic>N</italic> is the number of data points (i.e., frames) and <italic>LL</italic> is the loglikelihood of the fit returned by QuB.

We have performed new single molecule experiments at faster collection rate (1 frame per second, 5x increase in temporal resolution) for RNA-10, RNA-4+2, and RNA-C. We did not find any evidence for faster, transient interactions. These new data are now included as Figure 1-Supplement 4 and Figure 1- Source Data 2 with the corresponding changes to the Main text and Methods.</p><p>Addition to Methods in the section titled “Acquisition and Analysis of Higher Frame Rate Data”</p><p>“To ensure that the lifetimes measured in these experiments are not limited by our acquisition rate of 0.2 Hz, additional U1 snRNP experiments were performed with a continuous exposure of the Cy3 signal at 1 Hz for select RNAs (RNA-10, RNA-4+2, RNAC, Figure 1—figure supplement 4) […] Events in each time series were detected using the DISC algorithm (White et al., 2020) and visually inspected to ensure only specific binding events were included in the analysis.”</p><p>We do note however that in these data sets, we are able to observe the short-lived (~40s) binding events with RNA-10. We have revisited our data collected at 0.2 Hz (1 frame every 5 seconds) and indeed find evidence of a short- and long-lived state. As such, we have updated Figure 3, the corresponding supplemental tables, and the discussion of data with RNA-10 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors have chosen to extrapolate rates via exponential fitting to dwell time distributions. This is a reductive approach that ignores the relationship between consecutive events. It is strongly recommended that the authors consider using a hidden Markov modeling (HMM) approach instead. HMMs have long become the gold standard in single molecule biophysics. Even better, a Bayesian approach could help analyze entire datasets at the same time. In this reviewer's opinion, the ebFRET software package from the Gonzalez lab at Columbia University could, for example, work well here.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this statement. While HMMs are powerful, we do not believe they are the “gold standard” for all single molecule measurements in biophysics. Alternative approaches including change-point detection, auto/cross correlation analysis, image recognition, and others are commonly used in biophysics, particularity for “model-free” analysis. For certain cases, ebFRET is indeed a powerful tool; however, this software was designed specifically for intramolecular smFRET data, and it is unclear which priors are appropriate for intermolecular CoSMoS data without further investigations that are beyond the scope of this work.</p><p>Herein, events were discretized via thresholding and further inspected by examining the raw camera data at each AOI to discern specific and non-specific binding, a well described and robust approach for CoSMoS analysis (Friedman and Gelles, 2015) The exact classification of <italic>unbound</italic> and <italic>bound</italic> events is unlikely to change between our method and a standard HMM given the high signal to background of our data (see example traces in Figure 1 and 3). An example of this is clearly provided in Figure 3 of Greenfield et al., PLOS One, 2012 where thresholding and HMMs provided similar results at high signal to noise ratios in simulated smFRET data. In fact, our association rates reported in Figure 2-Source Data 1 are free of contamination from photobleaching (a feature often not corrected for in HMM modeling) as we only analyzed the time to the first association event. Therefore, our analysis in the main text is appropriate.</p><p>For our new, faster framerate data at 0.2 Hz, the signal to noise ratio is lower, as this set up uses sCMOS detectors. Therefore, these data were analyzed by the DISC algorithm (White et al., 2020), which has exhibited higher accuracy for intermolecular CoSMoS data than vbFRET (the predecessor of ebFRET). DISC is like the segmental k-means algorithm (SKM) and uses unsupervised learning to approximate an HMM. The final output of DISC (and SKM) is the Viterbi path of state transitions (i.e., maximum probability assignment of each data point into one of the discrete states given the determined transition and emission matrices). Importantly, our new analysis of RNA-10 and RNA-4+2 provided dwell time distributions with similar parameters from MLE fitting, suggesting both analysis methods are providing consistent results (see reviewer Comment #6).</p><p>To the first point of the reviewer, we agree more information can indeed be obtained by considering the time between successive events rather than dwell time analysis alone. We have now performed HMM analysis for RNA-4+2 which represents a very common 5’SS observed in vivo to compare three specific models (see response to Comment #5). For our survey of &gt;20 other RNAs, we have chosen to only compare maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of dwell time distributions as we are not confident a parsimonious model can be selected for each dataset. Thus, to avoid over interpreting our data, our manuscript focuses on a discussion of parameters from MLE fitting, a long standing a reliable approach in the single-molecule community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should say more about the particular requirement for basepairing at position 6, especially in the context of the experiments in Figure 5. This is particularly striking as this position is not well conserved in natural 5'ss, at least compared to position 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Position +6 (G/GUAUGU) is frequently conserved as a “U” in both yeast (as we show in Figure 7B) and in humans (see Roca, Sachidanandam, and Krainer, RNA, 2005). In fact, of 245 “GUAUG” introns in yeast, 227 (93%) of them also contain a U at +6 (GUAUGU). Presumably, this site is conserved since it permits pairing with the U6 snRNA “ACAGA” sequence during the catalytic steps in splicing. We have expanded on this idea in the discussion and this text is included on page 21.</p><p>“An additional consequence of this length requirement and the duplexes described in Figure 7C is that they also favor base pairing interactions between the 5' end of the U1 SSRS and the 3' end of the splice site. For example, each of the RNAs in our study capable of forming long-lived interactions also could pair at the +6 position (G/GUAUGU) of the 5' SS. This particular position of the 5' SS is important since it also pairs with the “ACAGA” sequence of the U6 snRNA (base-pairing position underlined) to promote splicing catalysis (Sontheimer and Steitz, 1993, Kandles-Lewis and Seraphin, 1993, Kim and Abelson, 1996) As mentioned above for recognition of G+1, the kinetic properties of U1 are, in part, optimized to facilitate interactions between the 5' SS and the splicing machinery that are important for catalysis even after U1 is released.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
