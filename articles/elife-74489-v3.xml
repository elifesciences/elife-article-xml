dependent on the ability of viruses to manipulate the infected cell to evade immunity, and the ability of the immune response to overcome this evasion. Understanding this process is key to understanding pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, and both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This occurred at the level of protein synthesis, could be mediated by Nsp1 and Nsp14, and correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation. This identifies a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group

In contrast, and despite their importance in antiviral protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pierce et al., 2020</xref>), considerably less is known about the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in infection. NK cells bridge the innate and adaptive responses, and individuals with NK cell deficiencies suffer severe viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orange, 2013</xref>). NK cells respond rapidly to viruses, directly killing infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules. They promote inflammation through the release of TNFα and IFNγ, and influence the induction of both B- and T-cell responses. Once virus-specific antibodies are induced, antibody-dependent NK activation (ADNKA) is generated through antibody linking cell-surface viral antigens with NK cell Fc receptors and subsequent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</p><p>The majority of studies on NK cells have focussed on their adaptive roles in established COVID-19 infection, with highly activated NK cells seen in both the periphery and the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maucourant et al., 2020</xref>). The genetic loss of NKG2C (a hallmark of adaptive NK cells, capable of enhanced ADCC) is also a risk factor for severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vietzen et al., 2021b</xref>), implying a protective role in COVID-19 infection. In support of this, in animal models, Fc-mediated functions correlate with protection in vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorman et al., 2021</xref>), and monoclonal antibody-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is enhanced by Fc-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winkler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suryadevara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winkler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamin et al., 2021</xref>), which enable control of disease even in the absence of neutralising activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, although neutralising monoclonal antibodies are effective when administered prophylactically, Fc-activity is required for efficacy when administered to animals therapeutically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>These animal studies demonstrate potentially important roles for adaptive NK cell responses in COVID-19. Despite this, our understanding of ADCC following infection and vaccination in humans remains limited. Studies to date have assumed spike protein is the dominant ADCC target, and have tested plate-bound protein or transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zohar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tauzin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dufloo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tortorici et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cathcart et al., 2021</xref>). Using these systems, they have shown that ADNKA-inducing antibodies are generated following SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dufloo et al., 2020</xref>), are induced by vaccination in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tauzin et al., 2021</xref>), and can be mediated by a subset of neutralising monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tortorici et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cathcart et al., 2021</xref>). However, these responses have not been tested against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells; the presence, abundance, accessibility, and conformation of viral glycoproteins can be very different during productive infection. Furthermore, although viral entry glycoproteins such as spike can be found on the infected cell surface, and can mediate ADCC, other viral proteins can be the dominant mediators of ADCC during infection; indeed, we have shown that in other viruses, non-structural proteins are often the dominant targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vlahava et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition, there is little information on the NK cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infected cells during the innate phase of infection, despite this process being important to virus pathogenesis; successful viruses must counteract robust NK activation to establish infection, and their ability to do this is critical to their ability to cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). Whether SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect humans is dependent on viral evasion of innate cellular immunity, is unknown. NK cell activation is complex and depends on the balance of ligands for a wide range of inhibitory or activating receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar, 2018</xref>). These ligands can be induced on the surface of target cells in response to stress, infection, or transformation. For example, the stress ligands MICA, MICB, and ULBP1-6, all bind to the ubiquitously expressed activating receptor NKG2D. To limit NK cell activation, many viruses manipulate these NK activating ligands, reducing NK-cell-mediated control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). Whether similar manipulations underlie the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause disease in humans remains unclear.</p><p>To address these critical gaps in our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2-specific NK cell response, we used quantitative proteomics to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection affected cell surface protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rihn et al., 2021</xref>). We found that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells downregulate multiple activating NK ligands, resulting in a reduced NK cell response to infected cells. This suggests a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 counteracts innate immunity early in infection, to establish disease. The development of humoral immunity following natural infection resulted in robust ADNKA against infected cells, and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines; these responses persisted for at least 6 months in most patients. Proteomics identified four cell-surface viral proteins capable of driving this response, leading to the surprising discovery that ADNKA is not primarily driven by spike antibody, but was dominated by antibody to other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid, membrane and ORF3a; this defines a novel role for antibodies targeting the immunodominant nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with these findings, and in contrast to plate-bound protein or transfected cells, spike was a poor activator of ADNKA following vaccination when tested using infected cells. This implies that the breadth and magnitude of ADNKA responses is limited in current vaccination strategies. The inclusion of antigens such as nucleocapsid would recruit additional effector mechanisms, and may help maintain vaccine efficacy following mutation of spike in naturally circulating virus variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SARS-CoV-2 remodels the plasma membrane proteome</title><p>Immune cells recognise and interact with infected cells through cell surface ligands.

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 targeted NK ligands in the same way we measured their abundance, and their sensitivity to digestion with EndoH, which cleaves N-linked glycans from proteins that have not yet transited (or have been retained in) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Digestion with PNGaseF (which cleaves N-linked glycans irrespective of subcellular trafficking) served as a control to show the effect of complete deglycosylation. We were unable to detect endogenous NK ligands by western blot (data not shown), and therefore overexpressed MICA, ULBP2, and B7-H6 using replication deficient adenovirus vectors (RAd). Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, levels of all three NK ligands were substantially reduced, however there was no alteration in the pattern of EndoH sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in intracellular retention of NK ligands, but instead reduces the overall abundance of protein.</p><p>To determine whether this occurred by inhibition of synthesis or degradation of mature protein, we treated cells with proteasomal (MG132) or lysosomal (Leupeptin) inhibitors after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). When tested with overexpressed MICA or B7-H6 (ULBP2 was not tested), MG132 did not result in recovery of NK ligand levels. Leupeptin resulted in a small recovery of B7-H6; however, this was seen in both Mock and infected cells, implying that it reflects constitutive turnover of the ligand rather than virus-specific targeting, and recovery in infected cells remained reduced compared to untreated mock infected cells. Overall, these results are consistent with the virus targeting NK ligands at the level of synthesis, rather than post-translationally. We therefore investigated whether NK ligands were particularly sensitive to inhibition of synthesis, by treating cells expressing MICA, B7-H6, or a control protein (GFP) with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (ULBP2 was not tested). This resulted in rapid loss of MICA, ULBP2, and B7-H6, but not GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To analyse this aspect of NK function, PBMC were incubated with infected cells in the presence of sera from individuals that were seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Certain NK cell subsets degranulate more effectively in response to antibody bound targets. These NK cells can be differentiated by the presence of NKG2C and CD57 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stary and Stary, 2020</xref>). However, NKG2C is only found in a subset of donors who are HCMV seropositive, and a proportion of these individuals are NKG2C<sup>null</sup> due to a deletion in the KLRC2 gene. As a result, NKG2C cannot be used as a marker in all donors. We have previously shown that CD57 is sufficient to identify higher responding NK cells in all donors, and activation of this population correlates with the ability of antibodies to mediate ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fielding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

ADNKA responses were generally of greater magnitude in individuals with more severe disease, with responses remaining detectable during the 150–200 day follow-up. Amongst those with milder disease, strong initial responses were maintained over time, while weaker responses decreased, becoming virtually undetectable by around 200 days. There was a moderate correlation between the ability of antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV-2, and to activate ADNKA in response to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), with a R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.7.

It is certainly a potential target during infection as, despite the fact that virion particles bud internally rather than from the cell membrane, both our PMP and flow cytometric analysis detected substantial levels of spike protein on the infected cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

PMP also detected membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a, and ORF1ab on the cell surface. ORF1ab is expressed as a polyprotein, which is proteolytically cleaved into multiple non-structural proteins (NSPs). Analysis of individual peptides representative of the proteolytically processed NSPs did not reveal any specific NSP enrichment. Furthermore, comparing the relative abundance of viral proteins in PMP, ORF1ab was only present at very low levels (1% of all viral proteins, significantly lower than any other SARS-CoV-2 protein). Taken together, it is unlikely that any NSPs are surface-exposed. Nevertheless, we performed bioinformatic analysis of all viral proteins for the presence of potential transmembrane domains or signal peptides, revealing five additional candidate cell-surface proteins (Nsp4, Nsp6, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b). We transfected cells with previously validated expression constructs for each of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>), and screened them for their ability to activate NK cells in an antibody-dependent manner. We used sera from patients with severe COVID-19 disease, that had previously generated the strongest ADNKA signals against infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, spike primed a substantial ADNKA response.

This is emphasised by the identification of multiple interferon antagonists encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and the increased disease severity in patients with genetic and acquired interferon deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sa Ribero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miorin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schroeder et al., 2021</xref>). To determine whether the virus evades other components of the host immune system we took a proteomic approach to systematically analyse how SARS-CoV-2 infection manipulates the cell surface during the time course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that SARS-CoV-2 remodelling of the plasma membrane leads to the downregulation of multiple cell surface immune ligands involved with the interferon response, cytokine function, and NK activation. This may enable SARS-CoV-2 to evade numerous effector arms of the host immune system. Of particular interest, NK activating ligands appear particularly susceptible to viral shutoff of host gene expression, and this results in inhibition of NK cell activation. This provides an explanation for how small RNA viruses may be able to target the NK response without encoding the large repertoire of specific NK-evasins seen in the large DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2020</xref>), and indicates that shutdown of host transcription and translation is likely to play a broader role in the ability of the virus to establish initial infection than previously appreciated. Later in disease, following the production of antibody, ADNKA leads to significant degranulation, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Somewhat surprisingly, spike antibody is not responsible for the robust ADNKA which develops after natural infection, and only weak ADNKA is generated following spike vaccination.</p><p>Genetic variation in both viruses and their hosts affects the ability of viruses to modulate NK responses, and influence pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vietzen et al., 2021a</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 appears to have evolved to antagonise NK activation by targeting the expression levels of multiple activating NK ligands. Nectin-1 is a ligand for CD96/TACTILE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seth et al., 2007</xref>), which activates human NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmes, 2019</xref>), B7-H6 is a ligand for NKp30, while ULBP2 and MICA are ligands for NKG2D. NKG2D is ubiquitously expressed on γδ cells and CD8+, as well as some CD4+, T-cells in addition to NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zingoni et al., 2018</xref>). Targeting NKG2D ligands may therefore enable the virus to impact additional effector mechanisms beyond just NK cells. Amongst NKG2D ligands, MICA is particularly polymorphic (100+alleles), A549 cells express MICA*001/004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seidel et al., 2015</xref>), while the truncated MICA*008 is the most common allele worldwide. This diversity is largely driven by co-evolution of humans with virus infections, and reflects the broad repertoire of viral immune-evasins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zingoni et al., 2018</xref>). MICA variation therefore has the potential to play a role in the extremely variable outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>A recent study demonstrated that NK cells stimulated with IL-12 and IL-15 were capable of controlling SARS-CoV-2 following infection of VeroE6 or Calu3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witkowski et al., 2021</xref>). NK ligands are highly diverse between species, thus VeroE6 (i.e. African green monkey) cells cannot inform on the ability of human NK cells to control infection, while expression levels of NK ligands were not assessed on Calu3 cells, making it difficult to draw comparisons between the studies. Nevertheless, NK cell activity is heavily dependent on stimulation, and it is highly likely that strongly activating cytokines such as IL-12/IL-15 are capable of stimulating NK cells sufficiently to contribute to viral control despite viral evasion mechanisms.</p><p>In contrast to the effect on NK ligands, we observed minimal downregulation of MHC-I, implying that SARS-CoV-2 cannot prevent peptide presentation to antagonise adaptive cytotoxic cellular immunity. Nor do infected cells bind human IgG from seronegative donors, indicating that it does not encode Fc receptors as ADNKA decoys. These observations are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 acting as an acute ‘hit and run’ virus, which has replicated and transmitted before host adaptive immunity develops. A previous study has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates HLA-A2 via ORF8, which contrasts somewhat with our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). This may indicate a HLA- or cell-type-specific effect, it will be interesting to determine whether coronaviruses evade innate and adaptive immunity in their original bat host, and whether this contributes to their persistence in that species.</p><p>In animal models of vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorman et al., 2021</xref>) and monoclonal antibody administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winkler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suryadevara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamin et al., 2021</xref>) against SARS-CoV-2, antibody-mediated activation of cellular immunity is a critical component of the protective immune response. However, inflammation dominates severe COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horby et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horby et al., 2021a</xref>). The high levels of TNFα and IFNγ observed following ADNKA are likely to exacerbate disease under these circumstances. In support of this, TNFα and IFNγ correlate with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karki et al., 2021</xref>), and critically ill patients have a higher proportion of afucosylated antibodies that may promote a stronger ADCC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsen et al., 2021</xref>). Given that ADCC can potentially contribute to both protection and immunopathology, it is important to understand what determines the magnitude and quality of the ADCC response. Viral entry glycoproteins are a common focus as mediators of ADCC. For example ADCC mediated by Env antibodies have been a major focus in HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forthal and Finzi, 2018</xref>), and gB-specific antibodies have been studied in HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson et al., 2018</xref>). Although antibodies targeting these antigens can clearly bind infected cells, using similar approaches to the present study we recently showed that non-structural accessory proteins were more potent ADCC targets during HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vlahava et al., 2021</xref>). This conclusion is reinforced here, where the neutralising antibody response is dominated by spike, but spike antibodies are poor activators of ADNKA, with other viral antigens driving more efficient ADNKA following natural infection. In support of this data, monoclonal anti-spike antibodies were only effective at activating Fc-mediated control of infection in animal models following engineering to enhance activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2021</xref>). Numerous spike mAbs were capable of potently activating ADNKA against transfected cells, but failed to stimulate NK cells in the presence of infected cells; this may result from differential post-translational modifications of spike between these contexts, the fact that the reduction in activating NK ligands as a result of infection alters the threshold for activation through ADNKA, or the fact that viral CPE affects the formation of an immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stanton et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, this underscores the importance of testing immune responses against live virus infected cells in order to assess efficacy. Importantly, the ability of monoclonal spike antibodies to bind to infected cells did not correlate with their ability to mediate ADNKA, implying that the epitope, position, or angle, at which the antibody binds to the cell surface is critical; it’s notable that 4/5 anti-spike antibodies that activated ADNKA bound the NTD, suggesting that this site is structurally advantageous for Fc-mediated responses.</p><p>A similar phenomenon may underly the greater ability of non-spike antigens to generate a ADNKA response. Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and membrane are all present on the infected cell surface, and can promote ADNKA if appropriate antibodies are present. In some studies, antibodies targeting ORF3a and membrane have been reported as present in only a subset of patients, while almost everyone developed antibodies targeting nucleocapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shrock et al., 2020</xref>). However, other studies have shown that antibodies targeting ORF3a and membrane are much more common and found in most patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heffron et al., 2021</xref>). Our functional work is consistent with this latter data, and suggests that antibodies targeting all three proteins may be major targets for ADCC during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, identifying a potential functional role for antibodies binding these immunodominant targets for the first time. Although it is surprising to observe nucleocapsid on the cell surface, Influenza nucleoprotein is also detected at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yewdell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Virelizier et al., 1977</xref>), and antibodies targeting nucleoprotein can mediate ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vanderven et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jegaskanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laidlaw et al., 2013</xref>). Structural proteins involved in genome packaging may therefore represent a common target for ADCC across multiple virus families.</p><p>The identification of the antigens that drive ADCC is important to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis and disease. A skewing of the spike:nucleocapsid antibody ratio is associated with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Röltgen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Campos Mata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atyeo et al., 2020</xref>), where ADCC-mediating nucleocapsid antibodies might be promoting inflammation. Both the breadth of the nucleocapsid antibody response, and the particular epitopes targeted, have also been correlated with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shrock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voss et al., 2021</xref>). These correlations now need to be followed up functionally, to determine how the epitopes bound by anti-nucleocapsid antibodies affect ADCC. Critically, the same surface-bound antibodies that activate NK cells are likely to promote inflammation by activating myeloid cells and complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szabo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merad and Martin, 2020</xref>), both of which are hallmarks of severe COVID-19.</p><p>Although Fc-dependent mechanisms of cellular immune activation could contribute to immunopathology via multiple mechanisms in severe disease, all patients with mild/asymptomatic disease also developed strong and persistent ADNKA responses. Furthermore, lineage defining mutations in the viral variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, include non-synonymous mutations in membrane, ORF3a, and nucleocapsid, and these can result in reduced antibody binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Vecchio et al., 2021</xref>). Virus variants may therefore evolve to evade ADCC responses as well as neutralising responses, supporting an important role for ADCC in protection. It is therefore significant that spike-vaccine generated antibody responses were poor ADNKA inducers when tested against infected cells. The addition of other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid to vaccines would engage a wider range of immune effector pathways. This approach might improve efficacy against both viral transmission and disease, resulting in vaccines that are more resistant to viral variants containing mutations that diminish antibody neutralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madhi et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Data were acquired using an AttuneNxT (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed with Attune NxT software or FlowJo software version 10 (Tree Star). Individual assays were run in technical triplicate. To ensure inter-assay variation did not affect results, a donor serum demonstrating moderate ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 was included as a positive standard in every assay, while a serum collected before 2020 was included as a negative control in every assay. Where sera were tested at a range of dilutions, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using Graphpad Prism 9. This value was then normalised to the AUC for the standard serum in that particular assay. In all experiments, serums were additionally tested against mock infected cells to control for non-specific activation of NK cells by serum components. An example gating strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and involved gating on NK cells defined as CD56 positive, CD3 negative. This strategy will capture all ‘classical’ NK cells; however, it will miss the recently described CD56-negative NK cell population. Since these are only present at substantial levels in specific conditions such as chronic HIV infection, and older people with HCMV or EBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller-Durovic et al., 2019</xref>), and have not been described to expand during SARS-CoV-2 infection, they are unlikely to play a major role in the NK response examined herein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Serums</title><p>Serums were collected from healthy donors vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine, a minimum of 3 weeks after the first dose, or 1 week after the second. A pre-vaccine sample was taken from every donor, and an ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 RBD performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>), to determine pre-exposure to live SARS-CoV-2. Longitudinal serums from naturally infected individuals have been described previously, clinical characteristics are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seow et al., 2020</xref>). Those labelled ‘mild’ had severity scores of 0, 1, 2 or 3, and ‘severe’ was 4 or 5, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seow et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Virus neutralisation assays</title><p>600PFU of SARS-CoV-2 was incubated with appropriate dilutions of serum, in duplicate, for 1 hr, at 37 °C. The mixes were then added to pre-plated VeroE6 cells for 48 hr. After this time, monolayers were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilised for 15 min with 0.5% NP-40, then blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) and 3% non-fat milk. Primary antibody (anti-nucleocapsid 1C7, Stratech, 1:500 dilution) was added in PBST containing 1% non-fast milk and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing in PBST, secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-HRP, Pierce, 1:3000 dilution) was added in PBST containing 1% non-fat milk and incubated for 1 hr. Monolayers were washed again, developed using Sigmafast OPD according to manufacturers’ instructions, and read on a Clariostar Omega plate reader. Wells containing no virus, virus but no antibody, and a standardised serum displaying moderate activity were included as controls in every experiment. NT50 were calculated in Graphpad Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Antibody depletions</title><p>Anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid antibody was depleted from sera using magnetic bead conjugated spike trimer protein or nucleocapsid protein (Acrobiosystems). Beads were resuspended in PBS +0.05% BSA, then 50 µl serum was mixed with 150 µl beads. Mixtures were incubated on a rotating mixer at 4 °C overnight. Serum diluted in buffer alone was used as a control. Magnetic beads were then removed using a 3D printed magnetic stand. All values given in assays are corrected for this initial fourfold dilution. Levels of anti-spike antibody were measured using a spike trimer ELISA (Acrobiosystems).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Funding acquisition, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Methodology, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: PBMC were extracted from apheresis cones obtained from the Welsh Blood Service (WBS) via an ad-hoc agreement or from blood samples from healthy volunteers and stored in liquid N2 until use.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Domenico Mavilio (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers concluded that the manuscript provides novel insights into the SARS CoV-2 escape from natural killer (NK) cells signaling by downregulating the expression of cellular ligands for activating NK receptors. The authors also showed that strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed later in the disease process and that ADNKA was primarily driven by viral proteins other than Spike. This aspect might be relevant as the COVID-19 vaccine currently in use are based on spike protein. The reviewers agreed that your findings would be of interest to scientists in the field of NK cell biology and SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, although enthusiastic with the bulk results, the reviewers pointed out several specific aspects of the work that need to be addressed experimentally and/or clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study 'ADNKA overcomes SARS-CoV2-mediated NK cell inhibition through non-spike antibodies' by Fielding et al. deals with NK cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. First, by using mass spectrometry the authors show altered cell surface protein expression on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells and downregulation of activating NK ligands such as B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1. This regulation of NK cell ligands resulted in impaired NK cell response (reduction in NK cell degranulation, IFNγ, and TNFα production) towards SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Furthermore, they show strong NK cell activation in the presence of serum containing anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, and that such response was sustained for up to 6 months following infection. Based on the plasma membrane profiling and the use of transfectants expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins, they identified Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and ORF3a as potential targets for ADCC. Depleting spike-specific antibodies from sera confirmed their dominant role in neutralization, but these antibodies had a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies targeting other proteins. In agreement with this observation, ADNKA was weaker following vaccination as compared to natural infection and was not boosted by the second dose of vaccine. Overall, this is an important and well-performed study. However, several questions remained unanswered, which required additional experiments.</p><p>1. Only one cell line was used to analyze the regulation of NK cell ligands upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Are the same NK ligands regulated by SARS-CoV-2 in other permissive cell lines?</p><p>2. It was published recently that NK cells can regulate SARS-CoV-2 fitness in cell culture (Witkowski et al. 2021 Nature). This paper should be cited and discussed in the context of the presented results.</p><p>3. Antibodies to Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and ORF3a induced NK cell activation when transfectants expressing respective proteins were used. Depletion of Spike antibodies did not affect NK cell activation when co-incubated with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and the conclusion was drawn that non-spike antibodies mediate NK cell activation. However, formal proof for this claim is missing. The experiment should be performed with depletion of some non-spike antibodies (Nucleocapsid, Membrane, or ORF3a) from sera to prove that their elimination will impair NK cell activation. This would be especially important for antibodies targeting Nucleocapsid as they are present in most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>4. Spike antibodies can induce ADNKA when Spike is expressed in the context of transfection. The major question is why these antibodies do not provide ADNKA in the context of infection? They can bind to the surface of infected cells, so something interferes with their function.</p><p>5. Panel of Spike-specific monoclonal antibodies was used to show that Spike-directed antibodies poorly activate NK cells when bound to infected cells. However, it is not clear if these antibodies can provide ADCC at all. Were they tested for ADCC when co-incubated with Spike-expressing transfectants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper is of high interest to a broad audience as it provides new knowledge on the role of NK cells in the control of COVID-19 disease progression and vaccine efficacy and design.</p><p>First, the authors identified a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 antagonises innate immunity. By performing a proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2- infected lung epithelial cells, the authors demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a downregulation of activating NK ligands. in vitro functional assays demonstrated that this correlated with reduction in NK cell activation. Moreover, they showed that strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed later in the disease process. In particular, it was shown that ADNKA is not primarily driven by spike antibody but was dominated by antibody to other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid, membrane and ORF3a. Since the anti-COVID-19 vaccine currently in use is based on spike protein, this last aspect could be highly relevant in vaccine design and improvement of vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Although the manuscript is well-structured and the data analysis is rigorous and justify the conclusions, some major points deserve to be better addressed or developed.</p><p>To further extend the knowledge provided on the role of NK cells in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the authors should also investigate the function of the different NK subsets. In particular, also CD56-/CD16+ NK cells – which are not included in the present analysis – deserve to be deeply investigated as these cells are greatly expanded during viral infection (Di Vito C, et al. Front Immunol. 2019. Doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.01812).</p><p>Moreover, as at 48h after infection the activating NK ligands are still downregulated whereas HLA molecules increased their expression, functional assay could be performed also with AAT cells infected for 48h to investigate also at this time point the NK activity.</p><p>Finally, since NK activation depends also on the expression levels of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, it could be interesting to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate receptor expression on NK cells obtained from COVID-19 patients. In particular, it would be interesting to investigate the expression of NKp30 (receptor of B7-H6) and NKG2D (receptor for ULBP2 and MICA). Moreover, as an increased expression of HLA molecules was observed in infected cells at 48h it would be interesting to assess also the expression on KIRs.</p><p>– In the present study, NK cells were identified in viable CD3-/CD56+ cells and then the authors focused their attention on CD57+ NK cells (CD3-/CD56+). Nevertheless, this gating strategy has some weakness since: (i) it does not allow a specific exclusion of B cells from the analysis (CD19 should be added in the panel); (ii) it not includes CD16. This last aspect is particularly relevant since the absence of CD16 in the panel used in functional assays precludes the possibility of investigating the function of the different NK subsets. In particular, CD56-/CD16+ NK cells which are greatly expanded during viral infection (Di Vito C, et al. Front Immunol. 2019. doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.01812) cannot be assessed with the gating strategy used.

Four viral proteins (S, M, N and ORF3a) were expressed on the plasma membrane of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

However, the authors did not study at which level the observed regulation of Nectin1 takes place. It is well established that in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells the Nsp1 proteins blocks translational activity of ribosomes. Therefore, the regulation of NK cell ligands might not be protein specific, but the result of a more general mechanism executed e.g. by Nsp1.

First, by using mass spectrometry the authors show altered cell surface protein expression on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells and downregulation of activating NK ligands such as B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1. This regulation of NK cell ligands resulted in impaired NK cell response (reduction in NK cell degranulation, IFNγ, and TNFα production) towards SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Furthermore, they show strong NK cell activation in the presence of serum containing anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, and that such response was sustained for up to 6 months following infection. Based on the plasma membrane profiling and the use of transfectants expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins, they identified Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and ORF3a as potential targets for ADCC. Depleting spike-specific antibodies from sera confirmed their dominant role in neutralization, but these antibodies had a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies targeting other proteins. In agreement with this observation, ADNKA was weaker following vaccination as compared to natural infection and was not boosted by the second dose of vaccine. Overall, this is an important and well-performed study. However, several questions remained unanswered, which required additional experiments.</p><p>1. Only one cell line was used to analyze the regulation of NK cell ligands upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Are the same NK ligands regulated by SARS-CoV-2 in other permissive cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now investigated the use of Caco2 and Calu3, which are the only other permissive cell types in wide use for SARS-COV2 infection. We were unable to get reliable high MOI infection of Calu3, despite subcloning high ACE2 expressing cells. We have therefore analysed NK ligand downregulation in Caco2 cells. Levels of NK ligands were lower in these cells as compared to A549, nevertheless a similar downregulation was observed (new Figure S3). See also downregulation of NK ligands in 293T cells by viral ORFs that we added in response to reviewer 3’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It was published recently that NK cells can regulate SARS-CoV-2 fitness in cell culture (Witkowski et al. 2021 Nature). This paper should be cited and discussed in the context of the presented results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added discussion of this point: Recently a study demonstrated that NK cells stimulated with IL-12 and IL-15 were capable of controlling SARS-CoV-2 following infection of VeroE6 or Calu3 cells<sup>62</sup>. NK ligands are highly diverse between species, thus VeroE6 (i.e. African green monkey) cells cannot inform on the ability of human NK cells to control infection, while the expression levels of NK ligands were not assessed on Calu3 cells, making it difficult to draw comparisons between the studies. Nevertheless, NK cell activity is heavily dependent on stimulation, and it is highly likely that strongly activating cytokines such as IL12/IL-15 are capable of stimulating NK cells sufficiently to contribute to viral control despite viral evasion mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Antibodies to Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, and ORF3a induced NK cell activation when transfectants expressing respective proteins were used. Depletion of Spike antibodies did not affect NK cell activation when co-incubated with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and the conclusion was drawn that non-spike antibodies mediate NK cell activation. However, formal proof for this claim is missing. The experiment should be performed with depletion of some non-spike antibodies (Nucleocapsid, Membrane, or ORF3a) from sera to prove that their elimination will impair NK cell activation. This would be especially important for antibodies targeting Nucleocapsid as they are present in most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now depleted nucleocapsid antibodies, and shown that this impacts ADNKA. We have also used a monoclonal nucleocapsid antibody to show that this antigen is a ADNKA target. We do not have the reagents to deplete ORF3a or Membrane and cannot delete Membrane from the viral genome. However, we were able to delete ORF3a from the viral genome, and demonstrate that this results in a major reduction in ADNKA. This provides formal proof that both Nucleocapsid and ORF3a can act as ADNKA targets, and has been added to the manuscript (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Spike antibodies can induce ADNKA when Spike is expressed in the context of transfection. The major question is why these antibodies do not provide ADNKA in the context of infection? They can bind to the surface of infected cells, so something interferes with their function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question, however addressing it is a substantial body of work in its own right, involving extensive structural and immunological work. It is therefore beyond the scope of this paper and does not change our major conclusion – that Spike mAbs are not the main mediators of ADNKA, and that all studies that have used Spike transfected cells to assess function should be re-interpreted in this light. We therefore state in the text ‘Numerous Spike mAbs were capable of potently activating ADNKA against transfected cells, but failed to stimulate NK cells in the presence of infected cells; this may result from differential post-translational modifications of Spike between these contexts, the fact that the reduction in activating NK ligands as a result of infection alters the threshold for activation through ADNKA, or the fact that viral CPE affects the formation of an immunological synapse<sup>70</sup>. Nevertheless, this underscores the importance of testing immune responses against live virus infected cells in order to assess efficacy’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Panel of Spike-specific monoclonal antibodies was used to show that Spike-directed antibodies poorly activate NK cells when bound to infected cells. However, it is not clear if these antibodies can provide ADCC at all. Were they tested for ADCC when co-incubated with Spike-expressing transfectants?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed ADNKA assays using Spike transfected cells. This shows that antibodies that mediate ADNKA against infection also act against transfected cells. However numerous antibodies that do not act against infected cells, do act against transfected cells. This strengthens our conclusion that antibodies must be tested against virus, as opposed to transfection systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>– In the present study, NK cells were identified in viable CD3-/CD56+ cells and then the authors focused their attention on CD57+ NK cells (CD3-/CD56+). Nevertheless, this gating strategy has some weakness since: (i) it does not allow a specific exclusion of B cells from the analysis (CD19 should be added in the panel); (ii) it not includes CD16. This last aspect is particularly relevant since the absence of CD16 in the panel used in functional assays precludes the possibility of investigating the function of the different NK subsets. In particular, CD56-/CD16+ NK cells which are greatly expanded during viral infection (Di Vito C, et al. Front Immunol. 2019. doi:10.3389/fimmu.2019.01812) cannot be assessed with the gating strategy used. Considering the role of CD56-/CD16+ NK cells in viral infection and the crucial involvement of CD16 in ADNKA, an additional set of experiments using an improved gating strategy that include at least CD16 should be performed to address these aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not possible to include a CD16 gate in functional assays, because following Fc engagement CD16 is cleaved from the cell surface in order to permit serial engagement. Thus, CD16 positive cells become CD16 negative following ADNKA. Furthermore, although the CD56-/CD16+ population has been demonstrated to be important in certain situations, this largely involves those with HIV and very elderly HCMV/EBV seropositive individuals. Since our donors do not fall into these groups, the proportion of CD56-/CD16+ cells will be too low to permit effective analysis. As a result, it is not possible to assess the role of this population in our study. We have therefore added to the methods section ‘This strategy will capture all ‘classical’ NK cells, however it will miss the recently described CD56 negative NK cell population. Since these are only present at substantial levels in specific conditions such as chronic HIV infection, and older people with HCMV or EBV infection<sup>88</sup>, and have not been described to expand during SARS-CoV2 infection, they are unlikely to play a major role in the NK response examined herein.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At 48h after infection, activating NK ligands are still downregulated whereas HLA molecules increase their expression.

This revealed that there is likely a block at the stage of synthesis, as opposed to degradation or retention. Further screening of the entire SARS-CoV2 ORFeome identified that Nsp14 is likely the primary driver of this process, with some contribution from Nsp1. Given that these proteins target both transcription and translation of host genes, it seems likely that this is an example of the virus achieving inhibition of NK cell activation through non-specific targeting of host cell gene expression. This is extremely interesting, and explains how small RNA viruses are able to target the NK response without encoding a vast repertoire of specific NK modulators, as the large DNA viruses do.

However, it was not possible to block the activity of activating NK ligands in the presence of virus, since the ligand is already downregulated by the virus, leaving nothing to block. Nor does blocking work in the absence of virus infection; this is in line with our extensive experience analysing the NK response to other virus infections and in other cell types (e.g. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004058, 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.22206). We have consistently found that the only way to demonstrate the impact of an activating ligand in the context of virus infection is to delete the viral gene that inhibits it. When you do this, infection occurs in the presence of increased NK activating ligand that hyper-activates the NK cell response, and this can be blocked with blocking antibodies. However, with SARS-CoV-2, we cannot remove Nsp14 without inactivating the virus. At this point, it is therefore not technically possible to formally demonstrate this point, and have therefore been careful to avoid claiming anywhere that we have directly shown that these ligands are responsible for the effects seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A: Is there a difference between this figure and figure 1C other than the addition of N and M proteins; could these be merged to one figure?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the data is the same, we would prefer to avoid introducing the presence of ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid in the earlier figure, because introducing them requires an extensive explanation of their significance on the cell surface.

The differential activity of antibodies against infection vs transfection may be due to glycosylation, viral CPE affecting synapse formation, or be a consequence of the viral manipulation of innate NK ligands that we describe. An extensive program of structural, virological and immunological work will be needed to investigate this, and other, hypotheses properly. At this stage our major conclusion is that other antigens are far more potent than Spike as ADNKA targets, and that immune responses need to be assessed against live virus infected cells. We therefore state</p><p>in the text: ‘this may result from differential post-translational modifications of Spike between these contexts, the fact that the reduction in activating NK ligands as a result of infection alters the threshold for activation through ADNKA, or the fact that viral CPE affects the formation of an immunological synapse<sup>70</sup>.

We do see a very minor downregulation of MHC-I, but the magnitude is so low that it is unlikely to be biologically significant. Whether this represents cell-type or HLA-type specific effects of ORF8 is currently unclear, therefore we state in the text ‘A previous study has demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 downregulates HLA-A2 via ORF8, which contrasts somewhat with our results<sup>63</sup>. This may indicate a HLA- or cell-type specific effect’. However, a full exploration of this phenomenon is tangential to the main results of our study, and beyond the scope of our current manuscript. Although ORF8 antibodies may be useful diagnostically, we do not have any evidence that ORF8 is found on the cell surface – it was not detected in our PMP, and does not have a signal peptide or transmembrane domain. Nor does the paper by Hachim et al. show surface expression. Therefore, it does not currently meet the criteria to be considered as a ADNKA target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C.

This has not been reported for other coronaviruses, but this may simply be because everyone has assumed that it is intracellular, rather than testing it empirically. We have now performed immunofluorescence to provide further evidence for the presence of N on the cell surface (Figure 6D). We also note that nucleoprotein of Flu is also found on the cell surface, and is a target for ADCC. Thus, although this phenomenon is novel for coronaviruses, it is not unique to viruses in general, and we make this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6.

However, it is a massive program of work, which is far beyond the scope of the current paper, which is already extensive.

We will also need to source serums from a large number of people infected with known variants, which has become more complicated as successive waves of different variants have passed through the population.
