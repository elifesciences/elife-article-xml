Here we investigated the <italic>PCA3</italic>/<italic>PRUNE2</italic> regulatory axis from early (tumorigenic) to late (biochemical recurrence) genetic events during human prostate cancer progression.</p> <p><bold>Methods:</bold> The reciprocal<italic> PCA3</italic> and <italic>PRUNE2</italic> gene expression relationship in paired prostate cancer and adjacent normal prostate was analyzed in two independent retrospective cohorts of clinically-annotated cases post-radical prostatectomy: a single-institution discovery cohort (n=107) and a multi-institution validation cohort (n=497). We compared the tumor gene expression of <italic>PCA3</italic> and <italic>PRUNE2</italic> to their corresponding expression in the normal prostate. We also serially examined clinical/pathological variables including time to disease recurrence.</p> <p><bold>Results:</bold> We consistently observed increased expression of <italic>PCA3</italic> and decreased expression of <italic>PRUNE2</italic> in prostate cancer compared with the adjacent normal prostate across all tumor grades and stages. However, there was no association between the relative gene expression levels of <italic>PCA3</italic> or <italic>PRUNE2</italic> and time to disease recurrence, independent of tumor grades and stages.</p> <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We concluded that upregulation of the lncRNA <italic>PCA3</italic> and targeted downregulation of the protein-coding <italic>PRUNE2</italic> gene in prostate cancer could be early (rather than late) molecular events in the progression of human prostate tumorigenesis but are not associated with biochemical recurrence. Further studies of PCA3/PRUNE2 dysregulation are warranted.</p> <p><bold>Funding:</bold> We received support from the Human Tissue Repository and Tissue Analysis Shared Resource from the Department of Pathology of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and a pilot award from the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center.
