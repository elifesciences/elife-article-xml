(iNeurons, iNs) from chimpanzee, bonobo, and human stem cells by expressing the transcription factor neurogenin-2 (NGN2). Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that genes involved in dendrite and synapse development are expressed earlier during iNs maturation in the chimpanzee and bonobo than the human cells. In accordance, during the first 2 weeks of differentiation, chimpanzee and bonobo iNs showed repetitive action potentials and more spontaneous excitatory activity than human iNs, and extended neurites of higher total length. However, the axons of human iNs were slightly longer at 5 weeks of differentiation. The timing of the establishment of neuronal polarity did not differ between the species. Chimpanzee, bonobo, and human neurites eventually reached the same level of structural complexity. Thus, human iNs develop slower than chimpanzee and bonobo iNs, and this difference in timing likely depends on functions downstream of NGN2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>bonobo</kwd><kwd>neuronal maturation</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>neuronal function</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons mature slower in humans than in other non-human primates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differences in cognitive abilities between humans and non-human primates are thought to depend on greater numbers of neurons and more complex neural architectures in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herculano-Houzel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smaers et al., 2017</xref>). Several studies have contributed to the current understanding of the molecular and cellular uniqueness of the primate and, specifically, of the human brain. Compared to other mammals, primate brains contain a greater number of neural stem and progenitor cells that generate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, some types of neurons differ structurally among primate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elston, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeFelipe, 2011</xref>). For example, human cortical pyramidal neurons have longer and more branched dendrites than chimpanzee pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>) and synaptogenesis and development of pyramidal neurons in humans and chimpanzees may be longer than in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2013b</xref>). Given the role of pyramidal neurons in higher cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldman-Rakic, 1999</xref>), a higher degree of connectivity in human neocortex than in other primates could provide a basis for human-specific cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeFelipe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elston et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be generated from somatic cells have expanded the possibilities to compare neurogenesis among apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mora-Bermúdez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, human iPSC-derived pyramidal neurons have been found to mature slower than their chimpanzee counterparts both structurally and functionally and to end up having higher dendrite complexity and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, upon transplantation into the mouse neocortex human neurons were shown to retain juvenile-like dendritic spines dynamics and to mature both structurally and functionally over a protracted window of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linaro et al., 2019</xref>). These findings are in line with previous studies suggesting that the human brain develops and matures slower than that of closely related primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teffer et al., 2013</xref>) and point to the idea that human neurons and human brain develop with different temporal dynamics. A crucial question remains open: is delayed maturation observed at the tissue/organ level regulated by environmental differences or is a cell-intrinsic property of human neurons? To evaluate possible cell-intrinsic differences in the dynamics of neuronal maturation, we used a direct conversion system in which chimpanzee, bonobo, and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are converted directly into neurons using an NGN2 overexpression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frega et al., 2017</xref>). This protocol allows to uncouple cell cycle progression of neural progenitors and developmental processes from neuronal maturation. It therefore offers a powerful tool to directly study the intrinsic differences in the dynamics of neuronal maturation.</p><p>We followed the temporal differentiation of human and ape induced excitatory neurons (iNeurons, iNs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), electrophysiology, and morphological analysis of dendritic arborization, and we observed a clear delayed maturation of human iNs compared to chimpanzee at the functional and transcriptional level. The direct conversion paradigm we used allows us to develop further previous findings by finding evidence for a delayed maturation being a cell-intrinsic feature of human neurons. In addition, unlike previous reports describing iNs as a homogenous population of cortical, upper layer neurons, we observed heterogeneous neuronal cell populations with a majority of cortical sensory neurons, further suggesting that the delayed maturation is a general feature of human neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maturation of ape and human induced neurons in vitro</title><p>We generated iNeurons from three chimpanzee (SandraA, JoC, ciPS01), one bonobo (BmRNA), and three human (409B2, SC102A, HmRNA) iPSC lines and from one human ESC line (H9) using forced expression of the pan-neurogenic transcription factor neurogenin 2 (NGN 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frega et al., 2017</xref>).

This was followed by expression analyses of genes for synapse organization and axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Chimpanzee, bonobo, and human iNs showed a neuron-like morphology at day 7 (d7) of differentiation and formed a dense network by d14.

At d7, the degree of colocalization between TUJI and neurofilament markers decreased, suggesting that the iNs established axo-dendritic polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The pattern of staining of the cytoskeletal components did not differ between apes and humans, suggesting that the timing of axo-dendritic polarity establishment is similar.</p><p>We next developed a sparse labeling approach that enables the tracing of individual cells in the dense connected neuronal cultures. This consisted of transfecting iNs with a GFP-encoding plasmid 4 days prior to fixation followed by staining with an axonal marker (Pan-Neu). The majority of iNs (25/26 cells) had a single axon, which is in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhee et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, it was always the longest neurite, which was found to be positive for the axonal marker (n = 26 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, we find that human iNs mature slower than ape iNs from a structural, transcriptional, and functional point of view. To make our data accessible to the neuroscience community, we provide a ShinyApp-based web browser for data exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanton S, 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NGN2 induces heterogeneous neuronal fates</title><p>A surprising finding in our study was that NGN2 induces heterogeneous, yet similar fates in ape and human iNs. The heterogeneity of iNs cultures in human has been so far under-estimated and was recently revealed using the power and resolution of scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin, 2020</xref>). Cell heterogeneity poses challenges when using human iPSC cells: for therapeutical applications, there is an obvious need for perfectly controllable and defined cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin, 2020</xref>). However, the heterogeneity can be beneficial for basic research in evolutionary neurobiology, as it allows modeling in a dish several neuronal fates and features, of which only a few are expected to show an evolutionary-relevant difference. In addition, the comparison of different neuronal fates maturing in the same dish offers a valuable internal control when looking for features shared by different cell types that can in turn be regarded as core components/biological processes showing relevant changes between species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolutionary aspects of neuronal maturation</title><p>Previous studies showed neoteny of human neurons compared to apes. Whether the neoteny is regulated by cell-extrinsic or neuron-intrinsic mechanisms is currently unknown. This question cannot be easily addressed using organoids, cell transplantation, or heterochronic cultures, as these are complex systems, where multiple events take place at the time: cycling stem cells give to neurons in an heterochronous way, newborn neurons migrate and mature, while showing robust cell–cell interactions that might regulate and influence their behavior. Despite its possible limitations, the use of iNs allows to uncouple early developmental events such as cell cycle progression, proliferation, and differentiation from the intrinsic neuronal maturation properties, thus offering the unique opportunity to directly study the cell-intrinsic and evolutionary aspects of neuronal maturation.</p><p>Our data show that several fundamental properties of neurons, for example the establishment of axo-dendritic polarity, onset of expression of voltage-gated channels, and basic electrical properties, show little or no differences between apes and humans. However, synapse-associated genes become expressed later in human neurons and electrical activity within cells (APs) and between cells (sEPSCs) appear later in the human neurons. In line with that, comparisons of human, chimpanzee, and macaque post-mortem brains have shown that expression changes of genes associated with synaptic functions and spine formation occur later in humans than in the other primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>). iNs morphological maturation follows a similar pattern where until d14 post-induction ape neurons have more complex and longer neurites, a difference that disappears by d21.</p><p>A slower neuronal development of neuronal gene expression in humans than in apes has been previously described in organoids and at the organ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies in cortical neurons made use of a developmental systems, in which pyramidal neurons derived from iPSC via neural progenitors (NPs) without the forced expression of NGN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>). Our data using the iN direct conversion protocol show that the later onset of neuron differentiation and maturation does not only occur in whole organs or complex differentiation systems but happens also in cortical sensory neurons as a downstream effect of NGN2-induced differentiation, strongly suggesting that the delayed maturation is a cell-intrinsic property of human neurons. Of note, sensory neurons are interesting from an evolutionary point of view, as the development and evolution of working memory in human is linked to a higher integration of sensory functions in the human prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smaers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lara and Wallis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Semendeferi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlén, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Which are the reason(s) underlying the transcriptional and functional delay we observed? The synaptic genes expressed by all the neuron sub-classes (core-synaptic genes) show a clear transcriptional delay at early time points (d5). At later time points (d14–21), the transcriptional differences in core-synaptic genes are milder, although the functional differences are still dramatic (see EPSC frequency). This suggests to us that the maturation of synaptic contacts and communication might be driven by two different mechanisms: a transcriptional driver at early time points, setting iNs apart transcriptionally and morphologically, and a post-transcriptional driver at later time points, setting iNs apart functionally. Although this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally in our study and awaits validation, the idea as such is compatible with several mechanisms governing synapse function being post-transcriptional and post-translational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klann and Dever, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sossin and Lacaille, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelleher et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, an activity-dependent transcriptional and translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghiani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buffington et al., 2014</xref>) might contribute and possibly amplify the differences between ape and human neuronal maturation at the functional level. At the molecular level, a possible driver for such differences is Slit-Robo Rho GTPase activating protein 2 (SRGAP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>), wherein three duplication events have occurred on the modern human lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dennis et al., 2012</xref>). Expression of the human-specific form SRGAP2C variant leads to neoteny in spine maturation and might contribute to human brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The delayed development and maturation of human neurons may have several possible consequences for the organization and function in the adult brain. The later onset of neurite outgrowth shown here and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linaro et al., 2019</xref>) has been speculated to result in more complex dendritic trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetto et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, at d35, we find that the axons of the human multipolar neurons are slightly longer than in the ape neurons. Further work is required to understand whether longer axons allow neurons to develop further and establish more contacts with other neurons. Of note, longer axons would obviously make contacts over greater distances in the brain possible. Since the human brain is three times bigger than the ape brains, in the future it will be interesting to investigate whether axons may be longer in human brains than in ape brains and whether that may affect the extent of neuronal projections in human brains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human iPS cell line</td><td valign="top">Riken BRC Cellbank</td><td valign="top">hiPS-409-B2</td><td valign="top">Female</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human iPS cell line stable transfected with Ngn2 and rttA</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">hiPS-409-B2_Ngn2</td><td valign="top">Generated for this study.

Individual coverslips were carefully transferred to a recording chamber under an upright microscope (Olympus BXW-51, Hamburg, Germany) and were perfused (2–3 ml/min) with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; in mM: 100 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose) continuously bubbled with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to maintain a pH &lt; 7.4. Cells were visualized under differential-interference contrast and selected for smoothness of membrane surface and three-dimensional, neuron-like appearance. As bipolar neurons were rare, we selected multipolar cells that could easily be recognized by their slightly irregular (triangular, square, or star-like) appearance, caused by the branching neurites. Recordings of single cells were done in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with glass electrodes (4.5–5.5 MΩ; oD/iD, borosilicate, Hilgenberg, Germany), pulled to tip resistances of ~5.5 MO (Sutter, P97) and filled with an internal solution containing 130 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM NaCl, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.05 mM EGTA (adjusted to pH = 7.3; filtered at 0.2 µm). The liquid junction potential (15 mV) was corrected online. Intra- and extracellular solutions were adjusted to 270 and 280 mOsm, respectively. This osmolarity closely matched the cell-culture medium and allowed for long-time recordings with stable series resistances (Rs, was typically 15–20 MΩ). Recordings were carried out at room temperature (22–24°C) using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Acquisition and analysis were performed using Patch and Fitmaster software (Ver. 2.9x, HEKA) in conjunction with Origin (Ver 2018-2019b, OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Recordings were digitized at 10 or 20 kHz and done in either the voltage- or current-clamp configuration. With the very first voltage, -ramp and –step protocols, we identified initial values of input resistance, Vrmp and cell capacitance (see below). We excluded data when these values had changed by more than 20%. Rs was typically 15–20 MΩ and 50% Rs-compensation was applied routinely. Data were excluded when series resistances increased by more than 5 MO or exceeded 25 MO. In the current clamp, the bridge compensation was used to compensate any voltage drop across the series resistances. A very few cells were not recorded at all as the initial voltage ramp indicated the absence of any voltage-gated currents.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Recordings</title><p>The following basic properties were measured: (1) Vrmp or membrane potential, determined by the concentration of ions on both sides of the membrane, the membrane’s permeability and activity of ion pumps; (2) Rcell or cell-input resistances, influenced by the cell size and the number of membrane proteins, for example ion channels and transporters; (3) Ccell or cell capacitance, reflects the membranes characteristic to act as a capacitor. As the capacitance influences the impedance – the resistance to AC currents – it influences the propagation of fast-changing signals, for example APs (4) tau = R*C or resulting time constant, a measure of the cell response to stimuli.</p><p>The basic properties of the iNs as cell-input resistances (Rcell) and whole-cell capacitances (Ccell) were obtained from the software and verified using the following two protocols. First, we recorded four successive uncompensated voltage steps from −80 to −95/−85 mV/−75/–65 mV (20 kHz sampling rate) to obtain Ccell from the initial fast-capacitive decay and Rcell from the plateau current (for details, see Analysis). Second, we used a ramp protocol (from −90 mV [200 ms] rising to +60 mV within 800 ms; back to −90 mV) to verify the presence of voltage-activated currents and to determine Rcell from the current slope and the resting-membrane potential (Vrmp) from the zero-current crossing of the voltage ramp. Thereafter, we recorded EPSCs at −80 mV for 60 s without pharmacological interference (10 kHz sampling rate, filtered at 2.5 kHz). In few recordings, we applied 50 µM kynurenic acid to verify their glutamatergic identity. We then switched to the current-clamp configuration and measured the induction of action potentials by depolarization. We determined the current ΔI that induced app. 5 mV change at rest (app. −80 mV). We then hold the cell at app. 90 mV to remove any inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels and recorded 20 current steps (500 ms long, two hyperpolarizing, 18 depolarizing) with changing current amplitudes as determined previously (ΔI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Analysis</title><p>To obtain Ccell from the first protocol, the initial 500 µs of the fast-capacitive decay were fitted with an exponential function. The obtained time-constant tau allowed determination of Ccell (C = Rs/tau). In addition, Ccell was determined using the RC compensation routine from the Patchmaster software, once automatically and once manually under visual control. The plateau currents after the transient decay (10 ms mean after 20 ms) allowed determination of Rcell (Rcell = ΔU/ΔI). A second value we obtained from the ramp protocol using the current slope between 75 and 65 mV (Rcell = ΔU/ΔI), and a third value from the amplifier of the Patchmaster software. Normally, all three values for Ccell and for Rcell were in good agreement (&lt;10%) and were averaged. In case of disagreements, the traces were reanalyzed and the accurate value determined by hand. The resting-membrane potential (Vrmp) was obtained from the zero-current crossing of the voltage ramp. In some cases where a low subthreshold activation of voltage-gated sodium currents hyperpolarized the membrane close to and before the zero-current crossing, the resting potential was estimated using a linear fit to the slope between −75 and −65 mV and determining its zero crossing. Action potentials in the current clamp protocols were determined as positive crossings at −20 mV. The maximal numbers obtained during these steps were used for analysis. EPSCs traces were exported for further analysis to the program NeuroExpress (NeXT, v. 19 .n; Attila Szücs, UCSD, San Diego, CA) via an Igor binary format.

The human iPSC lines hiPS409-B2 and SC102A1 were purchased from the Riken BRC Cellbank and System Biosciences, respectively. The human iPSCs line HmRNA (generated in this study) was reprogrammed from human dermal fibroblasts using the StemMACS mRNA transfection kit. The cell line was validated for pluripotency markers by immunohistochemical staining using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell 3-Colour Immunohistochemistry Kit and were differentiated into the three different germ layers using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification kit and StemMACS Trilineage Differentiation Kit. Karyotyping was carried out using Giemsa banding at the Stem Cell Engineering facility, a core facility of CMCB at Technische Universität Dresden. Karyotypes were found to be normal. The human ES cell line H9 was purchased from WiCell. The chimpanzee iPSC lines SandraA and JoC as well as the bonobo iPSCs line BmRNA were generated in a previous study (Kanton et al., Nature, 2019). The chimpanzee iPSCs ciPS01 line was provided by the Max-Delbrück-Centrum für Molekulare Medizin, Berlin. The rtT A/Ngn2-positive iPSCs/ESCs hiPS409-B2_Ngn2, SandraA_Ngn2, BmRNA_Ngn2, H9_Ngn2, SC102A1_Ngn2, HmRNA_Ngn2, ciPS01_Ngn2 and JoC_Ngn2 were generated using lentiviral vectors to stably integrate the transgenes into the genome of the stem cells and differentiate the stem cells into neurons as previously described by Frega et al., Jove, 2017. Our cultures were regularly controlled for mycoplasma. Permission to work with human and non-human primate iPSC lines and Ngn2-inducible cell lines was obtained through the Sächsisches Staatsministerium für Umwelt und Landwirtschaft (Az.: 55-8811.72/26, Az.: 55-8811.72/26/350).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The manuscript by Schörnig presents an elegant comparison of structural and functional maturation of cortical neurons from different primate species that is of broad interest to researchers interested in evolutionary neuroscience and those who are interested in the unique qualities of the human cortex. The authors use an induced neuron approach to generated cortical like neurons from iPSCs form different species and compare the structure, function and gene expression of the different neuron over time in culture. This strategy bypasses development and provides much more heterogeneous cultures for analysis. While the results are largely descriptive, they provide very interesting resource data providing insight into both primate neural development and human-specific attributes.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that the manuscript has potential, extensive revisions and new data are needed. Specifically, three points that require additional support:</p><p>1) Definitive characterization of sensory neurons</p><p>The identity of the induced neurons as sensory neurons is interesting but is based solely on gene expression and clustering of the scRNAseq data. To conclude that these neurons are indeed sensory neurons, the authors need cellular characterization (ephys, marker expression). To tease apart whether the cultures are different than previous studies, the authors need to classify the scRNA data from previous work utilizing NGN2 induction (Zhang et al., 2013) with this same protocol.</p><p>2) Rigor of experimental design</p><p>The comparisons of species differences by scRNA-seq lack rigor based on the use of only a single individual from one species. In addition, there are no details of how many batches of differentiation/induction were done or how many replicates were used for analysis. These points need to be addressed in revision.</p><p>Heterogeneity of cultures and composition differences between species needs to be taken into account to support claims that the molecular, morphological, and physiological timing differences are explained by species and not cell type. It is crucial to compare cells of the same type for each analysis to rule out the influence of composition differences for any of the species differences claims.</p><p>3) Conclusions and mechanisms</p><p>Results in sensory neurons links to working memory in the prefrontal cortex is not well supported.</p><p>The manuscript does not build on the rich and extensive transcriptomic data to provide any mechanistic hypotheses of the causes of the differences.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Comparison of induced neurons reveals slower structural and functional maturation in humans than in apes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Piali Sengupta (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The revised manuscript has been strengthened by additional data including better characterization of the resulting sensory neuron population and the composition similarities between cultures of ape and human. Additional analyses of the transcriptomic data strengthens the overall impact of the data.</p><p>There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The organization of the manuscript would flow better if the data were presented in this order: morphological, transcriptomic and functional data. Thus, the data in Figure 5 should be moved after Figure 1. The data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 would be useful to include in the main figure.</p><p>2) Statistics for structural/morphological analyses are not provided.

The data are included in two new Figure Supplements, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 5.</p><p>The new Figure 3—figure supplement 4 shows data regarding:</p><p>- the bona fide peripheral marker PRPH</p><p>- the deep layers marker TBR1</p><p>- the upper layers markers CUX1 and BRN2</p><p>The new Figure 3—figure supplement 5 shows data regarding:</p><p>- the sensory marker ISLET1</p><p>- the sensory marker NAv1.7</p><p>To provide a comprehensive picture of iNs fate, for all markers considered we show:</p><p>- the tSNE plot of the given marker</p><p>- the quantification of expression in iNs for that given marker, based on scRNAseq data</p><p>- a representative immunofluorescence image of the given marker</p><p>- the quantification of the % of iNs immune-positive for that given marker</p><p>The results from the new experiments revealed that</p><p>i) the iNs culture is heterogeneous,</p><p>ii) the vast majority of the iNs are upper layers sensory cortical neurons</p><p>iii) a minor proportion of iNs are peripheral</p><p>iv) despite all this heterogeneity, each species had similar proportions of peripheral, cortical and sensory neurons, indicating that there was no particular preference for a given cell type between the species.</p><p>Of note, the presence of iNs double positive for ISLET1 and BRN2 (mRNAand protein level) show in a more direct way the presence of cortical sensory fate.</p><p>Based on these data, we conclude that at least a proportion of iNs might be high-order sensory neurons of the cortex.</p><p>A surprising finding in our work is the presence of a vast proportion of sensory neurons, something that was under-appreciated in previous reports.</p><p>To gain functional insight in the sensory fate, we tested a subtype-differentiating Na-channel blocker PF‑05089771 as probe for sensory neurons. The three main Na-channels indicated by our scRNAseq data would show either a very high- (Nav1.7/SCN9a ~ 0.011uM), a medium- (Nav1.2/SCN2a ~ 0.11uM) or low sensitivity (Nav1.3/SCN3a ~ 11uM) towards this substance (half-inactivated channels, when expressed in HEK293 cells (Brown et al., 2016). As we could not identify a major contribution of Nav1.7 to the voltage-gated sodium currents we observed (only concentrations above 1uM clearly inhibited those currents in iNs (e.g. 10uM ~ 50% inhibition)), we have not further followed this line.</p><p>Of note, we observed a clear discrepancy in the % of marker-expressing cells at the protein and mRNA levels. This is not surprising, as it is well known that protein and mRNA levels are not necessarily linearly correlated. Our data would therefore suggest that for certain genes (like <italic>CUX1</italic>) mRNA and protein expression are differentially regulated. In addition, we are aware that technical reasons can also contribute to these discrepancies, like different tendency of different population to be recovered or survived the scRNAsq procedure.</p><p>In line with the point originally raised by the reviewer, an important conclusion/caveat that emerges from our work, is the need to always combine mRNA expression, immunofluorescence and functional analysis to assess cell fate in a more comprehensive and coherent way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To tease apart whether the cultures are different than previous studies, the authors need to classify the scRNA data from previous work utilizing NGN2 induction (Zhang et al., 2013) with this same protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we assessed the mRNA expression of all marker genes found in the single-cell quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fluidigm) of Zhang et al.</p><p>We could identify expression of almost all markers in all species and cell lines, with absence of expression of few genes in our dataset including forebrain marker <italic>FOXG1</italic> and GABA receptor <italic>GABRB2</italic>.</p><p>Besides these minor differences that might arise from technical differences between the two studies, we observe the same cortical and excitatory neuron markers as described by Zhang et al.</p><p>Expanding the finding of Zhang et al., we find that iNs express also sensory markers, suggesting a sensory identity that was not reported before. We think the sensory identity might have been underrepresented in bulk sequencing data by Zhang et al.</p><p>Of note, the sensory fate we report here was confirmed in while we were in revision by two independent laboratories using human iPSCs-derived neurons (Maimaitili et al., 2020; He et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Rigor of experimental design</p><p>The comparisons of species differences by scRNA-seq lack rigor based on the use of only a single individual from one species. In addition, there are no details of how many batches of differentiation/induction were done or how many replicates were used for analysis. These points need to be addressed in revision.</p><p>Heterogeneity of cultures and composition differences between species needs to be taken into account to support claims that the molecular, morphological, and physiological timing differences are explained by species and not cell type. It is crucial to compare cells of the same type for each analysis to rule out the influence of composition differences for any of the species differences claims.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the questions, we generated scRNAseq data from two additional human (SC102A-1 and H9), one chimpanzee (Jo_C) and one bonobo (BmRNA) iPSC cell lines on day 14 (d14) and day 35 (d35) of differentiation. Thereby we increased the dataset from 25,707 to 36,034 analyzed cells. We chose the cell lines for scRNAseq to match to the cell lines used for morphological and electrophysiological experiments. The timepoints for additional scRNAseq were based on the time point with the biggest differences in maturation of iNeurons between the species (d14) and a timepoint with minor differences and mature neurons (d35). All figures were update accordingly.</p><p>After data processing, we retained in total 10,111 ape iNs from the SandraA, JoC and BmRNA cell lines and 25,923 human iNs from the hiPS-409-B2, SC102A-1 and H9 cell lines (see Figure 3A-C). Including the data from four additional cell lines, we still identified 8 clusters of cells based on gene expression patterns (see Figure 3B). Ape and human cells from all cell lines occurred in all three neuronal sub-clusters, with minor differences in proportion (see Figure 3D). Based on these data, we conclude that NGN2 induction in stem cells leads to the differentiation into the same neuronal sub-types, independent of the cell line and species of choice.</p><p>To compare cells of the same sub-class for each analysis, we identified genes that are significantly higher expressed in the three iNs sub-populations than in the cells expressing progenitor markers (NPs) at the same time point in the same species and looked for statistical enrichment of these genes among groups of genes assigned to “Biological Processes” in Gene Ontology (Bennett and Bushel, 2017) (Figure 4A;C).</p><p>We updated the Figure 4 accordingly:</p><p>Figure 4A: Higher expressed genes of iNs sub-clusters at the same time point in the same species.</p><p>Figure 4B: Correlation of enriched GO terms in iNs sub types.</p><p>Figure 4C: Categories of GO terms on biological processes enriched with higher expressed genes in ape and human iNs sub-clusters at each time point.</p><p>Figure 4D: Schematic representation of synaptic parts depicted by SynGO ontology analysis.</p><p>Figure 4E: Sunburst plots of enriched synaptic GO terms with higher expressed genes in developing ape and human iNs at each time point.</p><p>Figure 4 Figure Supplement 1: Sunburst plots of enriched synaptic GO terms with higher expressed genes conserved in developing ape and human iNs sub-clusters at each time point.</p><p>The number of batches and cell lines used is listed in the transparent form, material methods sections and supplementary information. To further address this comment, we generated an additional overview (Supplementary file 5) with all batches (“batch” is the start of new cell differentiation) and the respective number of cells analyzed from each cell culture experiment.</p><p>We hope we have addressed the crucial point raised by the reviewer in a satisfactory manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Conclusions and mechanisms</p><p>Results in sensory neurons links to working memory in the prefrontal cortex is not well supported.</p></disp-quote><p>The general link between high-order sensory neurons and working memory is based on papers present in the literature (see the work of Damasio, Damasio and LeDoux). In the revised form (i) we added more citations to make this point clear and (ii) we re-phrases the sentence in the Discussion, to make clear we are referring to data from others.</p><p>The possible link between the iNs we observed in the dish to the high-order sensory neurons in the prefrontal cortex was proposed in the discussion as a speculation from our side. In the present revised version, to corroborate this suggestion, we run double immunofluorescence for sensory (ISL1) and cortical (CUX1, BRN2) markers and show the presence of a population of sensory cortical iNs. These data suggest that at least some iNs must be higher order sensory neurons.</p><p>We could not show directly the prefrontal identity as: (i) we do not have markers identifying specifically only prefrontal cortex neurons, and (ii) to the best of our knowledge, scRNAseq data from sensory neurons of the human prefrontal cortex are at the moment underrepresented.</p><p>Give these experimental limitations, we did re-phrase the sentence to make the assignment of the prefrontal identity as a possibility rather than a fact.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern, and we hope we have addressed that in a satisfactory manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript does not build on the rich and extensive transcriptomic data to provide any mechanistic hypotheses of the causes of the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer and decided (i) to proceed to a deeper analysis of the scRNAseq data (ii) to provide speculations and mechanistic hypothesis in the Discussion.</p><p>We hope our speculations will meet the reviewers’ expectations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The organization of the manuscript would flow better if the data were presented in this order: morphological, transcriptomic and functional data.

The data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 would be useful to include in the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-organized the manuscript according to the suggestions, in the order: morphological, transcriptomic and functional data.
