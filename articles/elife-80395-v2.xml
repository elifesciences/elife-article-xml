This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene – <italic>lamA</italic> – leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell – the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing <italic>lamA</italic>. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key determinant of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>polar growth</kwd><kwd>phenotypic heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>drug targets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI148255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rego</surname><given-names>E Hesper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1654408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swarts</surname><given-names>Benjamin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI087946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM110243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rego</surname><given-names>E Hesper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014185</institution-id><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rego</surname><given-names>E Hesper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Asymmetric growth in mycobacteria requires a protein that is involved in trafficking mycolic acids to the outer membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the etiological agent of human tuberculosis (TB), is responsible for approximately 1.4 million deaths each year. One of the pathogen’s distinguishing features is its unusual cell envelope. Like nearly all other bacterial species, the plasma membrane is surrounded by peptidoglycan, a rigid mesh-like structure made up of carbohydrate chains cross-linked by peptide bridges. However, in contrast to the peptidoglycan of other well-characterized bacteria, mycobacterial peptidoglycan is covalently linked to the highly branched hetero-polysaccharide arabinogalactan, which is, itself, covalently bound to extremely long-chained fatty acids called mycolic acids. Collectively, this structure is known as the mycolyl-arababinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex or mAGP. Electron microscopy has revealed that the outermost layer is a lipid bilayer, and, as such, it is referred to as the outer membrane, or, alternatively, the mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zuber et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to this core structure, several lipids, lipoglycans, and glycolipids are abundantly and non-covalently interspersed across the plasma membrane and mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jankute et al., 2015</xref>). This complex cell envelope is a double-edged sword: it is a formidable barrier to many antibiotics yet provides several potentially targetable structures. Indeed, two of the four first-line TB antibiotics target cell envelope biosynthesis.</p><p>In addition to their unusual cell envelope, mycobacteria differ from other well-studied rod-shaped bacteria in important ways. Notably, mycobacteria elongate by adding new material at their poles rather than along their side walls. Over the course of a cell cycle, one pole grows more than the other, giving rise to an asymmetric growth pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldridge et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, closely related organisms like corynebacteria that have similar cell wall architecture grow more evenly from their poles, suggesting that asymmetry is not simply a consequence of polar growth and may be actively created by mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rego et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, while the molecular details of asymmetric polar growth are not yet well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>), we have discovered that LamA, a protein of unknown function specific to the mycobacterial genus, is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rego et al., 2017</xref>). Deletion of <italic>lamA</italic> results in more growth from the pole formed from the previous round of division, ‘the new pole’, and less from the established growth pole, ‘the old pole’, leading to less asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rego et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PgfA is an essential polar growth factor that localizes asymmetrically.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Top:</italic> Graphical depiction of growth pattern in wild type (WT) and Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells.

One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, is predicted to be associated with several other divisome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Attempts to delete <italic>msmeg_0317</italic> from the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> chromosome have been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cashmore et al., 2017</xref>), and transposon insertion mapping has predicted the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> homolog, <italic>rv0227c</italic>, to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). MSMEG_0317 belongs to the DUF3068-domain super-family of proteins, which are exclusively found in actinobacteria. One member of this family in corynebacteria has channel activity, so this domain has been renamed PorA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdali et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soltan Mohammadi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, by structure-based homology prediction, MSMEG_0317 shares limited homology to CD36, which transports long-chained fatty acids into eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). In corynebacteria, the putative homolog of MSMEG_0317, LmcA, is thought to have lipid binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2022</xref>), and is involved in an ill-defined step of lipoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cashmore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought to understand the role of MSMEG_0317 in relation to LamA during mycobacterial growth and division. We find that in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, a model mycobacterial species, MSMEG_0317 is essential for polar growth, and localizes to the old pole in a LamA-dependent manner. There, it localizes with MmpL3, the essential mycolic acid flippase, to build the mycomembrane. Our data suggest that one function of MSMEG_0317 is to traffic mycolic acids in the periplasmic space, and that its overexpression is sufficient to restore growth at the old pole in cells missing <italic>lamA</italic>. Together, these results implicate MSMEG_0317 in mycolic acid trafficking, and argue that MSMEG_0317 is an important factor in determining cell wall composition and incorporation at one site of growth – the old pole – in mycobacteria. As such, we propose to rename MSMEG_0317, PgfA, for <underline>P</underline>olar <underline>g</underline>rowth <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>A</underline>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PgfA is essential for polar growth and localizes to the sites of new cell wall synthesis</title><p>To verify the essentiality of <italic>pgfA</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, we used an allele swapping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pashley and Parish, 2003</xref>). Briefly, in a strain whose only copy of <italic>pgfA</italic> was at the L5 phage integration site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis and Hatfull, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007</xref>), we exchanged <italic>pgfA</italic> for either an empty vector or for another copy of itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with <italic>pgfA</italic> being essential for cell growth, we observed approximately 1000-fold fewer colonies when we exchanged <italic>pgfA</italic> with an empty vector compared to exchanging it for another copy of itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To visualize the morphology of <italic>pgfA</italic>-depleted cells, we constructed a strain in which the only copy of the gene was tetracycline inducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Removal of anhydrotetracycline (ATC) from the culture media prevented cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By time-lapse microscopy we observed that, while cells expressing PgfA became longer, on average, as cell density increased within the microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) cells depleted for PgfA stopped elongating but continued to divide (reductive division), became wider, and, in many instances, eventually lysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As cells stopped elongating, we reasoned that PgfA is important for polar growth. To test this, we stained PgfA-depleted cells with a dye that is incorporated into peptidoglycan and monitored outgrowth in dye-free media. Consistent with the notion that PgfA is important for polar growth, we find that PgfA-depleted cells incorporate less new cell material at their poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>If PgfA is important for polar growth, then it should localize to the poles. To determine where and when PgfA functions in the cell, we fused PgfA to mRFP and expressed the resulting chimera from the native <italic>pgfA</italic> promoter. By allele swapping, we find that P<sub>native</sub>-<italic>pgfA-mrfp</italic> restores bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and thus encodes a functional PgfA. Fluorescence microscopy at a single timepoint showed that PgfA-mRFP localizes to mid-cell and to the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In polar growing bacteria, the site of division eventually becomes the site of elongation. Thus, in addition to localizing to the poles, elongation-complex proteins can also appear at mid-cell before daughter cell separation is clearly observed. This makes it difficult to determine true septal-associated localization from a single timepoint. To disentangle whether PgfA, in addition to localizing to the poles, also localizes to the septum during division, we visualized PgfA-mRFP by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For a single cell, we measured the fluorescence distribution over time as a function of both cell cycle time and cell length. As we wanted to compare across strains, we averaged many of these individual trajectories together. The resulting ‘average’ kymograph represents the probability of finding a fluorescent protein in a particular cellular location at a particular stage of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using this analysis, we compared the spatiotemporal localization of PgfA-mRFP to the earliest known markers for the division complex (FtsZ-mCherry2B) and the elongation complex (eGFP-Wag31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We find that PgfA localizes primarily to the old pole before the onset of division. During division, the fluorescence intensity at the old pole becomes slightly less intense as PgfA-mRFP re-localizes to the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This event occurs during the latter stages of FtsZ recruitment, but before the arrival of Wag31 to the mid-cell, suggesting that PgfA is a late divisome-associated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). At the end of division, PgfA-mRFP disappears from the septal site such that the new daughter cells are once again born with an asymmetric distribution of PgfA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with PgfA being a member of both the mycobacterial division and elongation complexes and show that PgfA is essential for polar growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PgfA and MmpL3 are recruited to the old pole by LamA to build the mycomembrane</title><p>The manner of cell death suggested a defect in the cell envelope of PgfA-depleted cells.

However, the molecular details of how precursors are trafficked from the plasma membrane to build the complex structure are almost completely unknown. We do know that one key step involves the essential protein MmpL3, which transports trehalose monomycolate (TMM) across the plasma membrane to the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Su et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). There, TMM is trafficked, through unknown mechanisms, to the antigen 85 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backus et al., 2014</xref>), and incorporated onto mAGP or made into trehalose dimycolate (TDM), a component of the outer mycomembrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiaradia et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, MmpL3 has become an anti-TB therapeutic target, as multiple compounds have been found to inhibit its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">La Rosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Umare et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Using an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> two-hybrid approach, MmpL3 from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was recently found to interact with several factors involved in cell wall synthesis, growth, and division, including Rv0227c (64% identity to <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> PgfA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belardinelli et al., 2019</xref>). To verify that PgfA and MmpL3 interact in intact mycobacterial cells, we constructed strains that expressed fusions to these proteins to enable co-immunoprecipitation. Precipitating MmpL3-GFP with a nanobody against GFP, we found PgfA-FLAG in the elution only when MmpL3-GFP was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results show that MmpL3 and PgfA interact in the cell.</p><p>As our initial interest in PgfA was prompted by its connection to LamA, we wondered if PgfA and MmpL3 would localize differently in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells. Thus, we visualized fluorescent fusions to PgfA and MmpL3 in strains with and without <italic>lamA</italic> and analyzed the fluorescence distributions over time. MmpL3-msfGFP displayed the same spatial and temporal localization pattern as PgfA-mRFP, again suggesting they are part of the same complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Surprisingly, in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells, PgfA-mRFP and MmpL3-msfGFP became dramatically less abundant at the old pole, with no change in abundance at the new pole. The loss of polar PgfA and MmpL3 in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> could be complemented by integrating <italic>lamA</italic> at a single site on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The abundance of msfGFP-MurJ, which transports peptidoglycan precursors, was not as dramatically changed at the old pole in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells, showing that the LamA-dependent loss of MmpL3 and PgfA was specific and not a general loss of elongation-complex proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>If PgfA and MmpL3 are functioning together, then cells depleted of either essential protein may have the same terminal phenotype. To assay this, we created CRISPRi guides to both <italic>mmpL3</italic> and <italic>pgfA</italic> and visualized the morphology of cells over time as the depletion was induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rock et al., 2017</xref>). As <italic>pgfA</italic> is predicted to be the first gene in a two gene operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martini et al., 2019</xref>), we were concerned about polar effects of the CRISPRi depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rock et al., 2017</xref>). To address this, we integrated another copy of MSMEG_0315, the second gene in the operon, at a phage site expressed by its native promoter, and confirmed its expression by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with the notion that PgfA and MmpL3 function in the same pathway, we found that cells depleted for <italic>mmpL3</italic> phenocopied those depleted for <italic>pgfA</italic> in that they become progressively shorter and wider (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—animation 1</xref>), and incorporated less material at their poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, both fusion proteins can replace wild type PgfA at high efficiency, and thus encode functional PgfA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Using fluorescence microscopy, we find that the C-terminal fusion is brightly fluorescent, supporting an orientation that places the beta-barrel-like domain in the periplasmic space. Interestingly, the N-terminal fusion is significantly dimmer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that further experimentation will be needed to fully understand PgfA’s interaction with the membrane. Nevertheless, collectively, these data show that PgfA is an inner membrane protein with a large periplasmic domain and that some portion of the protein binds TMM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PgfA abundance correlates to altered TMM/TDM ratios</title><p>If PgfA is involved in the trafficking of TMM, then its depletion, as with depletion of MmpL3, should result in an altered TMM/TDM ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Degiacomi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tahlan et al., 2012</xref>).

To investigate this, we decided to leverage Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells, which naturally have less PgfA and MmpL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). PgfA and MmpL3 have been described as highly vulnerable drug targets, that is, a small change in their abundance causes growth arrest or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2021</xref>). How do Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells grow at a normal rate with fewer of these essential proteins? We reasoned that changes in gene essentiality in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> may uncover compensatory mechanisms that promote survival. Thus, we created transposon libraries in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> and wild type cells and compared insertions across the genomes. There were very few changes: aside from Δ<italic>lamA</italic> itself, the only gene that sustained significantly fewer insertions in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> across replicates was MSMEG_3187 or <italic>sucT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). SucT succinylates arabinogalactan and LAM, a modification that changes the structural properties of the mycomembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palčeková et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that in cells deleted for <italic>lamA</italic>, in which the levels of PgfA and MmpL3 are lower, the presence of lipoglycans or their modifications become more important. In fact, we find that cells overexpressing PgfA, which results in more TDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>), also have lower levels of cell-associated LAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that PgfA is important for maintaining the correct levels of LM/LAM in the cell envelope. Further, our data uncover a previously unknown connection between TMM transport, or assembly of the mycomembrane, and LM/LAM. We find that the levels of LAM, and to a lesser extent LM, are negatively correlated with the levels of PgfA-mediated TMM trafficking, suggesting that there may be competing pathways for the transport or synthesis of these molecules, a notion supported genetically by Tn-seq. Alternatively, altered PgfA-mediated TMM trafficking may lead to differences in LM/LAM accessibility to extraction methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PgfA is necessary and sufficient for old pole growth in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> and the molecular requirements for growth between the poles are different</title><p>We have shown that PgfA and MmpL3 are necessary for polar growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This is unfortunate because the enzymes that create and remodel the cell envelope are a rich source of anti-bacterial drug targets. In addition, the unusual mode of asymmetric polar growth – coupled with the complexity of constructing the multi-layered mycobacterial cell envelope – means that the details of growth and division in mycobacteria are almost certainly different from laterally growing rod-shaped bacteria.</p><p>Here, we investigate the function of a mycobacterial specific factor LamA. We had previously shown that LamA is, in part, responsible for asymmetric polar growth. Cells missing <italic>lamA</italic> grow more symmetrically and are uniformly susceptible to several drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rego et al., 2017</xref>). How does LamA create asymmetry? We make inroads into answering this question by investigating the cellular function of MSMEG_0317, another protein of unknown function, which was predicted to interact with LamA. We show that MSMEG_0317, renamed PgfA, is involved in the trafficking of mycolic acids in the periplasmic space. In fact, it is unknown how TMMs are physically placed in the mycomembrane. It has been hypothesized that MmpL3 must hand off TMMs to another protein or proteins in the periplasm before they can be incorporated into mAGP or made into TDM by antigen 85 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>). We find that PgfA interacts with both MmpL3 and TMM, and that cells depleted for PgfA display phenotypes consistent with PgfA filling some intermediate role between MmpL3 and subsequent placement of mycolic acids in the mycomembrane. Further research will be needed to precisely establish PgfA’s role in TMM transport; nevertheless, these results advance our understanding of how the mycomembrane is constructed.</p><p>In addition to its role in TMM transport, our data point to a more global function for PgfA in determining the composition of the cell envelope. Specifically, we find that PgfA levels negatively correlate with the abundance of LAM, and to some extent LM, two large and abundant lipoglycans in the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These data suggest that there may be compensatory or competing mechanisms for the transport and/or synthesis of TMM and LM/LAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further strengthening that argument, we find that ΔlamA cells, which have less PgfA, are more reliant on SucT – an enzyme that succinylates LAM and arabinogalactan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhamidi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palčeková et al., 2019</xref>). It may be that TMM and LM/LAM are simply competing for space in the outer leaflet of the mycomembrane. However, to date, altered LM/LAM levels have not been reported for other TMM-trafficking mutants, suggesting that there may be more active regulation controlling the levels or transport of these two molecules. Indeed, others have speculated that succinylation itself may act to negatively regulate mycoloylation, as succinylated arabinan chains are found to be unmycoloylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhamidi et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of lamA results in less PgfA and MmpL3 at one side of the cell, the ‘old pole’, leading to less growth from that side of the cell. Increased expression of PgfA but not MmpL3 restores growth at that side of the cell, suggesting that PgfA’s role in coordinating lipid trafficking, or the presence of the protein itself, is rate limiting for growth at the old pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further research will be needed to understand how a TMM-binding protein influences the rate of cell wall insertion at the old pole. Indeed, insertion of new cell wall material requires the concerted effort of many synthetic enzymes, including those that polymerize and cross-link peptidoglycan. In mycobacteria, the bifunctional class A PBPs (aPBPs) are the dominant enzymes required for cell elongation. In other organisms, aPBPs are activated by inner or outer membrane-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fenton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), though no activator of PonA1 – the major aPBP in mycobacteria – has been found. Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that mycomembrane precursor transport may play a role in activating PG synthesis at the old pole in mycobacteria. What are the requirements for growth at the new pole – the pole newly formed by division? In ΔlamA, this pole grows more without an increase in PgfA or MmpL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); instead, enzymes involved in PG synthesis are more abundant at this site in ΔlamA. These observations suggest that the requirements for growth between the two poles are fundamentally different, at least for a certain time after the onset of pole elongation. Indeed, new poles will eventually become old poles in the next round of division. We see that PgfA and MmpL3 localize to the ‘new old poles’ after division, establishing asymmetry in the next generation. How does LamA affect the growth of the poles in opposite directions – inhibiting one but activating another? Future research is needed, but our data suggest that the new and old poles of mycobacteria may be distinct sites, with different molecular factors and requirements for growth. Our results suggest that LamA influences these differences to create asymmetry in individual cells, leading to a heterogeneous population better able to survive certain stresses, like antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Subsequently, in the merodiploid strain, an in-frame deletion was made by replacing the native copy of <italic>MSMEG_0317 gene</italic> with a zeocin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites using recombineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007</xref>). <italic>MSMEG_0317</italic> and its variants, including the fluorescent protein fusions, were cloned in a Nat<sup>R</sup> L5 integrating vector for allele exchange at the L5 site.

MSMEG_0317 was depleted by removing ATC from the medium and cells were grown for 18 hr. Subsequently, MSMEG_0317-depleted cells were re-diluted in fresh medium, also without ATC, and samples at different timepoints were taken and processed for cryo-EM. Alternatively, to avoid changes in LM/LAM abundance that have been found to be correlated with cell density and growth phase (21), at 18 hr of depletion, half of the culture was removed for lipid extraction and analysis, and replaced with fresh media. Lipid analysis was performed at timepoints before and after the decrease in OD indicating cessation of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>CRISPRi depletion</title><p>To transcriptionally deplete MmpL3 and MSMEG_0317 using CRISPRi, both dCas9 and the respective guide RNAs were cloned in an L5 integrating plasmid plJR962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rock et al., 2017</xref>).

This was repeated on 20–50 cells. These line profiles were then imported into MATLAB, where a custom script was used to generate an average kymograph by 2D interpolation of the individual kymographs. For the demographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, cells were segmented and intensity profiles measured using MicrobeJ. Output intensity profiles were then transferred to MATLAB, sorted by cell length, and aligned by the brightest pole for visualization.

The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 10 ug/ml DNase I; one tablet Roche cOmplete EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail; and 0.5% Igepal Nonidet P40 Substitute) and lysed with a BeadBug Microtube Homogenizer at 4000 rpm six times for 30 s each, icing in between. Lysed cells were spun down at 15,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. Lysates were incubated, where indicated, with either GFP-Trap Magnetic Agarose (Chromotek) or magnetic a-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 4°C overnight, rotating. After incubation, samples were spun down at 2500× <italic>g</italic> for 1 min at room temperature and flow through was discarded. Beads were washed three times with non-detergent wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). GFP-Trap samples were eluted with 2× Laemmli Buffer (Bio-Rad) prepared with 50 mM (DTT) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. FLAG M2 beads were eluted twice with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min rotating at 4°C. All samples not already treated with Laemmli Buffer + DTT were prepared for Western blotting by addition of Laemmli Buffer + DTT and boiled at 95°C for 5 min, to reverse all cross-links.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Western blot verification</title><p>Samples were run on NuPAGE (Thermo Fisher) 4–12% Bis-Tris gels in 1× MOPS-SDS running buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with 1:1000 a-FLAG primary (Sigma-Aldrich, clone M2) and 1:5000 a-mouse secondary (Thermo Fisher, Superclonal A28177). SuperSignal West Femto Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher) was used for chemiluminescent visualization on an Amersham ImageQuant 800 system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Lipid extraction and analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>TMM/TDM</title><p>Crude lipids were extracted from equal wet cell pellet weights of the either <italic>mmpL3</italic> depletion or <italic>MSMEG_0317</italic>-depleted cells after 9, 12, and 15 hr with or without ATC with 2:1 chloroform/methanol mixture for 12 hr. The organic layer was separated from the cell debris centrifugation at 4000× <italic>g</italic>. The organic extract was air-dried overnight. The dried extract was dissolved in 50 μl of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. TMMs and TDMs were separated on by high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Silica gel 60, EMD Merck) using chloroform/methanol/water (25:4:9:0.4). TMMs/TDMs were visualized by spraying the TLC sheet with 20% 1-napthaol in 5% sulfuric acid and charring the plate at 110°C Trehalose containing lipids (TMMs/TDMs) appear as purple bands after charring.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>LM/LAM</title><p>Extraction, purification, and analysis of lipids were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahlwes et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, crude lipids were extracted from equal wet cell pellet weights of the MSMEG_0317 depletion strains after 18, 24, 27, 30, and 33 hr with or without ATC. After lipid extraction using chloroform/methanol, LM and LAM were extracted from the delipidated pellet by incubation with phenol/water (1:1) for 2 hr at 55°C. Phospholipids and PIMs extracted by chloroform/methanol were further purified by <italic>n</italic>-butanol/water phase partitioning, and separated by HPTLC (Silica gel 60, EMD Merck) using chloroform/methanol/13 M ammonia/1 M ammonium acetate/water (180:140:9:9:23). Phospholipids were visualized via cupric acetate staining. PIMs were visualized with orcinol staining as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sena et al., 2010</xref>). LM/LAM samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and visualized using ProQ Emerald 488 glycan staining kit (Life Technologies). To detect LM/LAM in culture supernatants, the supernatants were initially treated with a final concentration of 50 μg/ml Proteinase K for 4 hr at 50°C. The treated supernatants were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE. LM/LAM were blotted onto nitrocellulose at 20 V for 45 min using semi-dry transfer method. Post transfer, the membrane was blocked by 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). The blocked membrane was then probed overnight with CS-35 antibody (BEI Resources, NIH) at 1:250 dilution at 4°C. The membrane was washed with TBST five times for 5 min each. Post washing, it was probed with anti-mouse secondary for 1 hr at room temperature. Membrane was then washed five times for 5 min with TBST. Thermo Scientific’s west dura chemiluminescent reagent was used to develop the membrane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sample preparation and image collection for cryo-EM</title><p>Wild type and MSMEG_0317 depleted <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> cells were pelleted, washed twice with 1× PBS, and suspended in ~20 µl PBS. The culture was subsequently deposited onto freshly glow-discharged holey carbon grids. The grids were then blotted with filter paper manually for about 4 s and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane. The frozen grids were transferred into a 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a K2 Summit direct detector and a quantum energy filter (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Cryo-EM movie stacks were collected using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>). MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) was used for drift correction of the cryo-EM movie stacks.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please see the specific comments from the reviewers below. To summarize:</p><p>1) The TLC data are qualitative and difficult to assess significance. Quantitative data from several experiments should be included.</p><p>2) The conclusions for whether LmcA and PgfA are (or are not) orthologs are not strongly supported and should be revisited.</p><p>3) Overall, please re-assess the specific conclusions of the manuscript and either provide data to support the conclusions or temper claims. Details follow below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Conclusions in Lines 100-101: The inability of LmcA to substitute for PgfA does not mean these proteins are not orthologs, there are many other factors that contribute to heterologous complementation, including the similarity of other binding partners or chaperones. The data that may support the proteins are not orthologs is the absence of an effect on LAM in the PgfA depletion mutant. However, the overexpression of PgfA does lead to changes in LAM. So both proteins still have connections to these pathways and it is not convincing that the proteins are not orthologs performing functions specific to the physiology of the different bacteria.</p><p>– In lines 113-116, the authors reference the data in Figure 1B as being the differences in colonies that grew while performing the allele swapping strategy with the empty vector. Did the colonies that grew actually exhibit a loss of PfgA? Or did these isolates still contain the WT gene? It seems important to understand this in order to make conclusions about essentiality.</p><p>– Conclusions in Lines 150-152– how do the experiments with the RFP tagged PgfA show that PgfA is required for polar growth? The experiments in 1C support that PgfA is involved in cell elongation, but most strikingly it appears to be involved through the envelope integrity. But the polarity of growth is never measured during PgfA depletion. Then the experiments with the RFP tagged PgfA only show localization, but do not test what processes PgfA is required for. In this regard, line 347 is also not supported by the data it references. The authors never actually show that the pgfA mutant is deficient in polar growth.</p><p>– The authors first mention in line 199 that pgfA is in an operon. Did the authors check if there were polar effects in the mutant used in Figures 1 and 2A? For the experiments in Figure 2D, was the expression of MSMEG_0315 at WT levels at the heterologous site? What is MSMEG_0315? Is there a conserved homolog in Mtb?</p><p>– For lines 215-216, the authors claim their data suggest that cells depleted for PgfA accumulate TMM, but this is not shown, much less whether it accumulates to toxic levels. Later in the manuscript, the authors perform the TLCs, so this conclusion should follow the experimental data to support it. In addition, some of the differences in the TLCs are rather small. Replicate TLCs could be quantified, graphed, and stats performed to determine the rigor of the data.</p><p>– Do the authors have an interpretation of why TMM also increases in the overexpression strain in Figure 3D, and how does this fit into their model?</p><p>– Lines 259-260 – it could be more direct to reword the sentence so that it is clear that it is unknown what region of PgfA binds the TMM analog.</p><p>– Is there a reason that in the section starting on line 281, the authors call the corynebacterial homolog NCgI2760 instead of LmcA? Are these the same protein?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The TLC data in Figures 3C and D are qualitative and difficult to assess significance. Quantitative data on the relative abundance of the TDM and TMM bands from several experiments should be included.</p><p>2. The Results section entitled &quot;The function of PgfA is specific to mycobacteria and its abundance negatively correlates with the abundance of lipoglycans LM/LAM&quot; is quite long and spends a lot of time discussing data indicating that PgfA is not an ortholog of NCgl2760 from C. glutamicum. While this is useful information, it detracts from the main thrust of the manuscript-the contribution of PgfA to asymmetric growth. I recommend revising this section to reduce its length and increase focus.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors propose that PgfA is involved in the traffic of mycolic acids in the periplasmic space. I think the data support this idea. However, I think it would strengthen the paper to discuss in more detail what steps in the trafficking process remain unknown and where PgfA might fit into it. For example, is it potentially involved in extracting TMM from the membrane and handing it off to Ag85 proteins for transport? Are there other possibilities? More specific context such as this would improve the Discussion section and make it more impactful.</p><p>2) I am not convinced that the depletion of PgfA appreciably changes the levels of TMM or TDM in cells. Firstly, it would be helpful to know how the authors assigned the TLC spots to TMM and TDM? Controls would be helpful here, such as the inhibition of TMM synthesis to show which spots disappear. Also, in addition to adding better controls to assign the spots, some quantitation is needed. I don't see much in the way of changes to the TMM and TDM spots by eye when PgfA is depleted. In addition, there are new spots appearing at the top of the TLC plate in the PgfA-depleted cells. What species are these? Their identification could shed more light on PgfA function as they are unique to PgfA depletion and not observed in the MmpL3 depletion. At a minimum, this observation should be highlighted in the text given how striking it is (much more striking than the TMM/TDM changes).</p><p>3) The topology experiments are not especially convincing. The reduced fluorescence of the N-terminal fusion makes it hard to draw strong conclusions from this construct. Is there a small amount of protein with GFP inside that is non-functional combined with a larger fraction of non-fluorescent protein with GFP outside that accounts for the functionality of the construct? I think it is probably sufficient to rely on the topology prediction supported by the C-in result from the C-terminal GFP fusion. These combine to make a reasonable case for the proposed topology as long as the caveat is made that further experiments are needed to definitively establish the topology.</p><p>4) As mentioned above, I do not find the argument that NCgl2760 has a different function than PgfA to be convincing. This section should be (significantly) revised to account for the much more reasonable conclusion that cross complementation does not work simply because of divergent protein-protein interactions and/or mycolic acid length between organisms. The fact that PgfA/ NCgl2760 has differential effects on LM/LAM accumulation in their respective host organisms could simply be due to differential stress/regulatory responses downstream of the same primary defect.</p><p>5) The overexpression studies in Figure 5 have several problems. Firstly, were the results normalized for growth rate changes? It seems like the growth rate could significantly affect the outcome of the experiment and the relative elongation at the different poles observed. Secondly, it is concluded that PfgA overproduction but not MmpL3 overproduction restores asymmetric growth to δ-lamA cells. The results for these two strains don't look all that different to me. Some statistics are needed here.</p><p>6) Line 389: &quot;regulating&quot; is misused here and in other sections of the paper. Just because the inactivation of PgfA causes a change in envelope structure/composition does not mean it is a regulator. The regulator designation implies that it is responsive to stimuli, but there is no data supporting this designation. It seems more likely to me that PgfA is a core component of the transport apparatus and that its inactivation alters the envelope because the normal process is disrupted, not because it is a regulator.</p><p>7) Lines 402-415: I think some speculation is important to include in a Discussion section. However, the connection for PgfA with peptidoglycan synthesis is a bit too much of a leap for this paper. I would remove this paragraph.</p><p>8) Line 418-420: Rather than different growth requirements at the two poles, couldn't the results be interpreted as a competition between the two poles for common precursors/protein components? A competition model involving some positive feedback at the favored pole seems simpler and therefore more likely.</p><p>9) Line 215-219: Reference to TMM accumulation is made, but this comes well before the TMM levels are quantified later in the paper and the figure is not referenced. Some rewriting is needed to improve the flow of the paper here. Also, as mentioned above, I do not think the data showing TMM accumulation is convincing as presented.</p><p>10) Figure 2B: Please show the blots for the input material as well as the blots for anti-GFP as well as anti-FLAG blots.</p><p>11) Figure 2C: Make the font bigger for PgfA and MmpL3 or find some other way to make the labels clearer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80395.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please see the specific comments from the reviewers below.

Tn-seq and CRISPRi studies predict these genes to be essential. There have not been any studies on this protein in mycobacteria.

Additionally, the ATC-inducible <italic>pgfA</italic> was at a phage site, uncoupling it from the expression of <italic>msmeg_0315</italic>, and so we feel confident that the phenotypes we report are due to changes in MSMEG_0317 (PgfA) levels.

The TLC data in Figures 3C and D are qualitative and difficult to assess significance. Quantitative data on the relative abundance of the TDM and TMM bands from several experiments should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Results section entitled &quot;The function of PgfA is specific to mycobacteria and its abundance negatively correlates with the abundance of lipoglycans LM/LAM&quot; is quite long and spends a lot of time discussing data indicating that PgfA is not an ortholog of NCgl2760 from C. glutamicum. While this is useful information, it detracts from the main thrust of the manuscript-the contribution of PgfA to asymmetric growth. I recommend revising this section to reduce its length and increase focus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment that will improve the flow and comprehensibility of our manuscript to the reader. The text has been edited to increase clarity and de-emphasize this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors propose that PgfA is involved in the traffic of mycolic acids in the periplasmic space. I think the data support this idea. However, I think it would strengthen the paper to discuss in more detail what steps in the trafficking process remain unknown and where PgfA might fit into it. For example, is it potentially involved in extracting TMM from the membrane and handing it off to Ag85 proteins for transport? Are there other possibilities? More specific context such as this would improve the Discussion section and make it more impactful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have reorganized the discussion and have included a paragraph (lines 427-436) in the discussion on this important topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am not convinced that the depletion of PgfA appreciably changes the levels of TMM or TDM in cells. Firstly, it would be helpful to know how the authors assigned the TLC spots to TMM and TDM? Controls would be helpful here, such as the inhibition of TMM synthesis to show which spots disappear. Also, in addition to adding better controls to assign the spots, some quantitation is needed. I don't see much in the way of changes to the TMM and TDM spots by eye when PgfA is depleted. In addition, there are new spots appearing at the top of the TLC plate in the PgfA-depleted cells. What species are these? Their identification could shed more light on PgfA function as they are unique to PgfA depletion and not observed in the MmpL3 depletion. At a minimum, this observation should be highlighted in the text given how striking it is (much more striking than the TMM/TDM changes).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. TMM and TDM spots were assigned by several methods. First, TLCs were performed using established protocols to get a general sense of how the lipids migrated. Secondly, we depleted or deleted genes known to affect TMM and TDM levels. We show MmpL3 depleted cells in the main text, but now include TLC data from an antigen-85a KO, as well. Lastly, as the reviewer suggested, we treated cells with isoniazid to inhibit TMM synthesis and see the spots corresponding to TMM and TDM decrease. These data can be found in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3. Together, these controls were used to appropriately assign spots on the TLCs. Of note, we also obtained purified TMM and TDM controls from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (ATCC NR-48784 and NR-14844) to use as controls. However, species differences meant that these lipids exhibit significant differences in migration patterns and therefore were not appropriate controls for our experiments.</p><p>The new spots appearing on the top of TLC plates in PgfA-depleted cells are glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). These outer membrane lipids are responsible colony morphology, biofilm formation and sliding motility of Msm and other NTM species. We think that the mycomembrane disruption caused due to PgfA depletion might contribute to better extraction of GPLs from the depleted cells. However, we have not observed consistent patterns of these bands across replicates in the different genetic backgrounds, and do not feel comfortable drawing conclusions about their significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The topology experiments are not especially convincing. The reduced fluorescence of the N-terminal fusion makes it hard to draw strong conclusions from this construct. Is there a small amount of protein with GFP inside that is non-functional combined with a larger fraction of non-fluorescent protein with GFP outside that accounts for the functionality of the construct? I think it is probably sufficient to rely on the topology prediction supported by the C-in result from the C-terminal GFP fusion. These combine to make a reasonable case for the proposed topology as long as the caveat is made that further experiments are needed to definitively establish the topology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this section (lines 261-266).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As mentioned above, I do not find the argument that NCgl2760 has a different function than PgfA to be convincing. This section should be (significantly) revised to account for the much more reasonable conclusion that cross complementation does not work simply because of divergent protein-protein interactions and/or mycolic acid length between organisms. The fact that PgfA/ NCgl2760 has differential effects on LM/LAM accumulation in their respective host organisms could simply be due to differential stress/regulatory responses downstream of the same primary defect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have re-written this section to deemphasize the complementation studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The overexpression studies in Figure 5 have several problems. Firstly, were the results normalized for growth rate changes? It seems like the growth rate could significantly affect the outcome of the experiment and the relative elongation at the different poles observed. Secondly, it is concluded that PfgA overproduction but not MmpL3 overproduction restores asymmetric growth to δ-lamA cells. The results for these two strains don't look all that different to me. Some statistics are needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>As demonstrated in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, there is no difference in growth rate between the strains used in Figure 5A. We now show replicate data in Figure 5A. We determined statistical significance by comparing the averages of the replicate single-cell distributions (aka a “super plot”). This much more rigorous analysis confirms our original conclusion that increased expression of PgfA restores growth at the old pole in Δ<italic>lamA</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 389: &quot;regulating&quot; is misused here and in other sections of the paper. Just because the inactivation of PgfA causes a change in envelope structure/composition does not mean it is a regulator. The regulator designation implies that it is responsive to stimuli, but there is no data supporting this designation. It seems more likely to me that PgfA is a core component of the transport apparatus and that its inactivation alters the envelope because the normal process is disrupted, not because it is a regulator.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have made the appropriate changes to remove “regulating” from the manuscript in reference to PgfA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Lines 402-415: I think some speculation is important to include in a Discussion section. However, the connection for PgfA with peptidoglycan synthesis is a bit too much of a leap for this paper. I would remove this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We have softened some of the language in this section as to not over-reach the conclusions of our data. However, we believe that this is an interesting avenue of research given the trend of peptidoglycan synthesis activation by lipoproteins in other bacterial species. It follows that the pathways that govern lipid trafficking may be involved in similar regulatory mechanisms in mycobacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Line 418-420: Rather than different growth requirements at the two poles, couldn't the results be interpreted as a competition between the two poles for common precursors/protein components? A competition model involving some positive feedback at the favored pole seems simpler and therefore more likely.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered the hypothesis that the two poles are competing for common precursors; however, we think that our results do not support this model. In a precursor competition model, it would be expected that when there is a decreased demand for precursors at the favorable pole, the rate of elongation would increase at the un-favored pole. In fact, we see in Figure 5A that, in different genetic backgrounds, growth can increase at one side of the side without compensatory decreases in growth on the other side (Δ<italic>lamA</italic>+ <italic>pgfA</italic>), and vice versa (Δ<italic>lamA</italic>+ <italic>mmpL3</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Line 215-219: Reference to TMM accumulation is made, but this comes well before the TMM levels are quantified later in the paper and the figure is not referenced. Some rewriting is needed to improve the flow of the paper here. Also, as mentioned above, I do not think the data showing TMM accumulation is convincing as presented.</p></disp-quote><p>See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 2B: Please show the blots for the input material as well as the blots for anti-GFP as well as anti-FLAG blots.</p></disp-quote><p>Now included as Figure 2 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2C: Make the font bigger for PgfA and MmpL3 or find some other way to make the labels clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Labels for this figure have been made clearer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
