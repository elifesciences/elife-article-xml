in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across superior temporal gyrus (STG). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain lowers its response to inputs we generate ourselves, such as moving or speaking. Essentially, our brain ‘knows’ what will happen next when we carry out these actions, and therefore does not need to react as strongly as it would to unexpected events. This is why we cannot tickle ourselves, and why the brain does not react as much to our own voice as it does to someone else’s. Quieting down the brain’s response also allows us to focus on things that are new or important without getting distracted by our own movements or sounds.</p><p>Studies in non-human primates showed that neurons in the auditory cortex (the region of the brain responsible for processing sound) displayed suppressed levels of activity when the animals made sounds. Interestingly, when the primates heard an altered version of their own voice, many of these same neurons became more active. But it was unclear whether this also happens in humans.</p><p>To investigate, Ozker et al. used a technique called electrocorticography to record neural activity in different regions of the human brain while participants spoke. The results showed that most areas of the brain involved in auditory processing showed suppressed activity when individuals were speaking. However, when people heard an altered version of their own voice which had an unexpected delay, those same areas displayed increased activity. In addition, Ozker et al. found that the higher the level of suppression in the auditory cortex, the more sensitive these areas were to changes in a person’s speech.</p><p>These findings suggest that suppressing the brain’s response to self-generated speech may help in detecting errors during speech production. Speech deficits are common in various neurological disorders, such as stuttering, Parkinson’s disease, and aphasia. Ozker et al. hypothesize that these deficits may arise because individuals fail to suppress activity in auditory regions of the brain, causing a struggle when detecting and correcting errors in their own speech. However, further experiments are needed to test this theory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>speech production</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>speech motor control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC018200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ozker</surname><given-names>Muge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS109367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flinker</surname><given-names>Adeen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC018805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flinker</surname><given-names>Adeen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS115929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flinker</surname><given-names>Adeen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRCNS 1912286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flinker</surname><given-names>Adeen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027</institution-id><institution>Leon Levy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship in Neuroscience</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ozker</surname><given-names>Muge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Sensorimotor circuits share a common mechanism across the animal kingdom in which sensory responses to self-generated motor actions are suppressed. It is commonly hypothesized that suppressing responses to predicted self-generated stimuli increases sensitivity of the sensory system to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poulet and Hedwig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poulet and Hedwig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider and Mooney, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it enables detection and correction of motor errors by providing a template of the predicted sensory outcome to compare with the actual sensory outcome. In the domain of speech, this mechanism is described in models which suggest that neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during speech production. When there is a mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback, responses in the auditory regions are enhanced to encode the mismatch and inform vocal-motor regions to correct vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hickok et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houde and Nagarajan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tourville and Guenther, 2011</xref>).</p><p>A common experimental strategy to generate mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback is to perturb auditory feedback during speech production. Auditory feedback perturbations are usually applied either by delaying auditory feedback (DAF), which disrupts speech fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairbanks, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stuart et al., 2002</xref>), or by shifting voice pitch and formants, which result in compensatory vocal changes in the opposite direction of the shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houde and Jordan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones and Munhall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niziolek and Guenther, 2013</xref>). Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies investigated neural responses during speech production both in the absence and presence of auditory feedback perturbations. In support of speech production models, these studies have repeatedly reported suppressed responses in auditory cortex during speaking compared with passive listening to speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Numminen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wise et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curio et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houde et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christoffels et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niziolek et al., 2013</xref>), as well as enhanced responses when auditory feedback was perturbed indicating sensitivity to auditory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tourville et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behroozmand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenlee et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behroozmand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozker et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the same or distinct neural populations in the auditory cortex show speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback.</p><p>While auditory responses are largely suppressed during speech production, detailed investigations using neurosurgical recordings revealed that the degree of suppression was variable across cortical sites, and auditory cortex also exhibited non-suppressed and enhanced responses (albeit less common) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creutzfeldt and Ojemann, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flinker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenlee et al., 2011</xref>), mirroring results from non-human primate studies using single-unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliades and Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>). In the same non-human primate study, it was reported that neurons that were suppressed during vocalization showed increased activity when auditory feedback was perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>). Based on this finding, we predicted that if speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors, suppressed auditory sites should be sensitive to auditory feedback, thus exhibit enhanced neural responses to feedback perturbations. Alternatively, if suppression and speech monitoring are unrelated processes, then suppressed sites should be distinct from the ones that are sensitive to auditory feedback.</p><p>The level of attention during speech monitoring can vary depending on the speech task. During normal speech production, speech monitoring does not require a conscious effort, however it is a controlled, attentional process during an auditory feedback perturbation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashimoto and Sakai, 2003</xref>). It is well known that selective attention enhances auditory responses and improves speech perception under noisy listening conditions or when multiple speech streams are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mesgarani and Chang, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>). We predicted that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions, such as during an auditory feedback perturbation task, should increase feedback sensitivity and elicit larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal speech production.</p><p>To summarize, in this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in human neurophysiological recordings. We predicted that auditory sites showing speech-induced suppression would elicit enhanced responses to auditory feedback perturbations. Further, we aimed to investigate the role of attention in auditory feedback sensitivity by comparing auditory responses during an auditory feedback perturbation task compared with normal speech production.</p><p>To address these aims, we used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in neurosurgical participants, which offers a level of spatial detail and temporal precision that would not be possible to achieve using non-invasive techniques. We first identified the sites that show auditory suppression during speech production, and then employed a DAF paradigm to test whether the same sites show sensitivity to perturbed feedback. Our results revealed that overlapping sites in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that auditory suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors in humans. Further, we showed that auditory responses in the posterior STG are enhanced in a DAF task compared to normal speech production, even for trials in which participants receive simultaneous auditory feedback (no-delay condition). This result suggests that increased attention during an auditory feedback perturbation task can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity and posterior STG is a critical region for this attentional modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to assess cortical responses during perception and production of speech, and quantify speech-induced auditory suppression, participants (n=35) performed an auditory word repetition (AWR) task. We examined the response patterns in seven different cortical regions including STG, middle temporal gyrus (MTG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), precentral gyrus (preCG), and postcentral gyrus (postCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As an index of the neural response, we used the high gamma broadband signal (70–150 Hz, <italic>see Materials and methods</italic>), which correlates with the spiking activity of the underlying neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lachaux et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cortical responses during speech tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrodes from all participants (n=35) are shown on a template brain with different colors corresponding to different regions (number of electrodes in each region denoted in the parentheses).

Average responses were larger during passive listening in STG (average % signal change ± SEM; Listen: 62.1±0.6, Speak: 29.8±0.4), MTG (32.7±0.9, 22.3±0.9), and SMG (27.4±0.8, 25.8±0.7) compared with speaking. Conversely, responses were larger during speaking in IFG (29.2±1.3, 31.2±1.3), MFG (28.3±1.6, 31.4±1.3), preCG (27.4±0.4, 37±0.5), and postCG (26±0.4, 42±0.5). These results suggested that auditory regions responded more strongly during passive listening compared to speaking, verifying previous reports of neural response suppression to self-generated speech in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>In the AWR task, participants heard the same auditory stimulus twice in each trial, once from a recorded female voice and once from their own voice. It is well known that repeated presentation of a stimulus results in the suppression of neural activity in regions that process that stimulus, a neural adaptation phenomenon referred to as repetition suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grill-Spector et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Todorovic and de Lange, 2012</xref>). To ensure that our observed suppression of neural activity in auditory regions was not due to repetition suppression, but rather was induced by speech production, we performed a visual word reading (VWR) task, in which participants hear the auditory stimulus only once (from their own voice). Response magnitudes during speaking in the AWR and VWR tasks were similar (paired t-test: t(466)=0.62, p=0.53), characterized by a strong correlation across electrodes (Pearson’s correlation: r=0.9006, p=0). These results suggested that repetition of the auditory stimulus in the AWR task did not affect response magnitudes and the observed reduction in response magnitudes was induced by speech production.</p><p>To quantify the amount of speech-induced suppression, we calculated a suppression index (SuppI) for each electrode by comparing neural responses during listening versus speaking in the AWR task (SuppI = Listen-Speak/Listen+Speak; <italic>see Materials and methods</italic>). A positive SuppI indicated a response suppression during speaking compared to listening and was observed most strongly in middle to posterior parts of STG, followed by MTG and SMG. A negative SuppI indicated a response enhancement during speaking compared to listening and was observed in motor regions, most strongly in the postCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatial topography of speech-induced auditory suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Suppression indices for all electrodes are shown on a template brain.

We hypothesized that the degree of speech-induced auditory suppression should be tightly linked to sensitivity to speech errors, as predicted by current models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houde and Nagarajan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tourville and Guenther, 2011</xref>) and neural data in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we used an additional task, in which we delayed the auditory feedback (DAF) during speech production to disrupt speech fluency. In this task, 14 participants repeated the VWR task while they were presented with their voice feedback through earphones either simultaneously (no-delay) or with a delay (50, 100, and 200 ms; <italic>see Materials and methods</italic>). In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozker et al., 2022</xref>), using the same dataset, we demonstrated that participants slowed down their speech in response to DAF (articulation duration; DAF<sub>0</sub>: 0.698, DAF<sub>50</sub>: 0.726, DAF<sub>100</sub>: 0.737, and DAF<sub>200</sub>: 0.749 ms). Moreover, auditory regions exhibited an enhanced response that varied as a function of feedback delay, likely representing an auditory error signal encoding the mismatch between the expected and the actual feedback. However, those results were not directly linked to auditory suppression.</p><p>Here, we compared neural responses in the AWR and the DAF tasks to test whether auditory regions that exhibit strong speech-induced suppression also exhibit large auditory error responses to DAF, which would indicate strong sensitivity to speech errors.

The degree of both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to DAF were highly variable across the cortex, SuppI ranging from –0.46 to 0.53 and SensI ranging from –0.62 to 0.70. The largest SuppI and SensI as well as a strong overlap between the two measures were observed in the STG, suggesting that auditory electrodes that show speech-induced suppression are also sensitive to auditory feedback perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

We were interested in dissociating if these larger responses were merely an effect of perceiving voice feedback through earphones instead of air or rather were specific to our DAF design, likely due to increased attentional demands. Therefore, four participants performed an additional VWR task in which they were presented with their simultaneous voice feedback through earphones (VWR with auditory feedback [VWR-AF]). As previous studies have reported that DAF can increase voice intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yates, 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell and Archer, 1984</xref>), we first verified whether participants spoke louder during the DAF task. A comparison of their voice intensity between DAF<sub>0</sub> (no-delay trials in the DAF task) and the VWR-AF (standard word reading with simultaneous feedback through earphones) conditions did not show a significant difference (voice intensity; DAF<sub>0</sub>: 50±11 dB, VWR: 49±12 dB; paired t-test: t(118)=1.8, p=0.08). After verifying that the sound volume entering the auditory system is not statistically different in the two conditions, we compared the responses in the auditory cortex and found that overall response magnitudes were now on par across the two conditions (DAF<sub>0</sub>: 89±17, VWR-AF: 82±17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, a detailed inspection of individual electrode responses revealed that some electrodes showed larger response to DAF<sub>0</sub>, while others showed either larger responses to VWR-AF or similar responses to both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In a single participant, we demonstrated that adjacent electrodes in the STG that are only 5 mm apart exhibited completely different response patterns. Electrodes in the more posterior parts of STG showed larger responses to DAF<sub>0</sub>, while electrodes in more anterior parts showed similar responses to DAF<sub>0</sub> and VWR-AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine an anatomical landmark at which the reversal of response patterns occurred in the STG, we used the lateral termination of the transverse temporal sulcus (TTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenlee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nourski et al., 2016</xref>) based on the individual FreeSurfer segmentation of the participant’s preoperative MRI.

Lastly, we examined STG electrodes alone, sorted by their anterior-to-posterior positions with respect to the TTS. In line with the results from the single participant, electrodes that were located posteriorly within a 1 cm distance from this anatomical landmark showed significantly larger responses to the DAF<sub>0</sub> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

We found that while the strongest auditory suppression was observed in the STG, the degree of suppression was highly variable across different recording sites. To explain this variability, we considered the functional role of auditory suppression in speech monitoring. We showed that delaying auditory feedback during speech production enhanced auditory responses in the STG. The degree of sensitivity to feedback delays was also variable across different recording sites. We found a significant correlation between speech-induced suppression and feedback sensitivity, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring. While there was no anatomical organization for auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity in the STG, we found an anterior-posterior organization for the effect of attention on feedback sensitivity. Auditory sites that lie posterior to the lateral termination of the TTS in the STG showed stronger activation during the DAF task compared to a standard word reading task, even for trials in which participants received simultaneous feedback, demonstrating attentional modulation of feedback sensitivity.</p><p>We observed the strongest speech-induced suppression in the middle and posterior parts of the STG. In line with previous iEEG studies, we found that degree of suppression was variable across different recording sites in the STG without any anatomical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flinker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenlee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nourski et al., 2016</xref>). So far, a clear gradient for speech-induced suppression has never been reported in the STG but only in the Heschl’s gyrus and superior temporal sulcus by studies that used comprehensive depth electrode coverage within the temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nourski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nourski et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We found only a few sites with speech-induced enhancement and several sites with no response change. Based on single-unit recordings in non-human primates, it is known that majority of neurons in the non-core auditory cortex exhibits suppression, while a smaller group exhibits excitation during vocalization. It is difficult to isolate speech-induced enhancement in human studies, because measurements reflect the average response of the underlying neural population, which is dominated by suppressed responses. A previous non-human primate study suggested that there might be a division of labor between the suppressed and excited neurons. They showed that when an external auditory stimulus is presented concurrently during vocalization, neurons that showed vocalization-induced suppression did not respond to the external stimulus. In contrary, neurons that showed vocalization-induced excitation responded even more when external stimulus is concurrently presented during vocalization, suggesting a role in maintaining sensitivity to the external acoustic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliades and Wang, 2003</xref>). In humans there might be a similar division of labor between auditory sites that were suppressed and non-suppressed, such that while suppressed sites are engaged in monitoring self-generated sounds, non-suppressed sites maintain sensitivity to external sounds. But unfortunately, our study did not include the necessary experimental conditions to directly test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our broad topographical search using subdural electrodes revealed additional sites outside the canonical auditory regions in the STG that showed speech-induced suppression, mainly in the MTG, and a few others in the SMG and preCG. Sensorimotor regions in the preCG including inferior frontal and premotor cortices are known to activate during passive listening tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pulvermüller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogan et al., 2014</xref>), and show tuning to different acoustic properties of speech similar to the auditory regions in the STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mesgarani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2016</xref>). Our results showed that isolated sites in these frontal motor regions were sensitive to DAF, confirming their auditory properties and suggesting their involvement in speech monitoring.</p><p>Current models of speech motor control predicted a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and sensitivity to speech errors, suggesting a role for auditory suppression in speech monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houde and Nagarajan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tourville and Guenther, 2011</xref>). Behavioral evidence in human studies showed that when auditory feedback is delayed in real time, speakers attempt to reset or slow down their speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairbanks, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stuart et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, when fundamental frequency (pitch) or formant frequencies of the voice are shifted, speakers change their vocal output in the opposite direction of the shift to compensate for the spectral perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houde and Jordan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones and Munhall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niziolek and Guenther, 2013</xref>). Neurosurgical recordings and neuroimaging studies that investigate the brain mechanism of auditory feedback processing demonstrated that these feedback-induced vocal adjustments are accompanied by enhanced neural responses in various auditory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tourville et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behroozmand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behroozmand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozker et al., 2022</xref>). However, it has not been clear whether it is the same or different neural populations that exhibit speech-induced suppression and enhanced responses to auditory feedback perturbations. Only in a non-human primate study, which recorded single-unit activity in auditory neurons of marmoset monkeys, it was shown that neurons that were suppressed during vocalization exhibited increased activity during frequency-shifted feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>). In contrast, to replicate this finding in humans, a previous iEEG study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>, used frequency-shifted feedback during vowel production and found that most suppressed auditory sites did not overlap with those sensitive to feedback alterations. Using DAF instead of frequency-shifted feedback, we demonstrated a significant overlap of two neural populations in the STG, along with a strong correlation between the degree of speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. This discrepancy may be due to different methods of calculating sensitivity to altered feedback. In our study, sensitivity was determined by comparing responses to delayed and non-delayed feedback during production, whereas Chang et al. compared perturbed feedback responses during production and listening. One possibility is that our approach identifies a larger auditory neural population in the STG sensitive to altered feedback. Alternatively, it could indicate a larger population highly sensitive to temporal rather than spectral perturbations in auditory feedback. Thus, we observe a wide overlap of the two neural populations in the STG showing both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. Replaying a recording of the participants’ own delayed voice back to them, which we were unable to complete in this study, would have made the results of the two studies more comparable while also completely eliminating the possibility of a sensory explanation for the observed response enhancement.</p><p>Forward models of speech production suggest that a mismatch between the predicted and the actual auditory feedback is encoded by a response enhancement in the auditory cortex signifying an error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houde and Nagarajan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tourville and Guenther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hickok, 2012</xref>). Our results suggested that attention to one’s own speech stream during adverse speaking conditions, such as during an auditory feedback perturbations task, might also contribute to the response enhancement in the auditory cortex. Auditory feedback control of speech was thought to be involuntary and not subject to attentional control, because several previous studies showed that participants produced compensatory responses to pitch shifts even when they were told to ignore feedback perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Munhall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zarate et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keough et al., 2013</xref>). However, prolonging pitch shift duration resulted in an early vocal response that opposes the pitch shift direction and a later vocal response that follows the pitch shift direction suggesting an interplay between reflexive and top-down processes in controlling voice pitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hain et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnett and Larson, 2002</xref>). More recent EEG studies demonstrated that dividing attention between auditory feedback and additional visual stimuli or increasing the attentional load of the task affected vocal responses as well as the magnitude of ERP components, suggesting that attention modulates auditory feedback control on both a behavioral and a cortical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tumber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we found that neural responses in the posterior STG were larger for DAF<sub>0</sub> (randomly presented simultaneous feedback condition in the DAF task) as compared with the VWR-AF condition (consistent simultaneous feedback throughout standard word reading task), even though participants displayed similar vocal behavior in these two conditions. In light of the previous literature, we interpret these response differences as arising from an attentional load difference between the two tasks. In the DAF experiment, the auditory feedback was not consistent since no-delay trials were randomized with delay trials. This randomized structure of the paradigm with interleaved long delay trials (causing slowed speech) required conscious effort for speech monitoring and thus sustained attention. While remaining cautious about this interpretation and our study’s limitation in attentional controls, we believe that this response enhancement represents an increased neural gain driven by attention to auditory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillyard et al., 1998</xref>), and highlights the critical role of the posterior STG in auditory-motor integration during speech monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hickok and Poeppel, 2000</xref>), with its close proximity to the human ventral attention network comprising temporoparietal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vossel et al., 2014</xref>). We leave it to future studies to include additional conditions to manipulate the direction and load of attention to further validate the influence of attention on speech monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participant information</title><p>The Institutional Review Board of NYU Grossman School of Medicine approved all experimental procedures.

The high gamma broadband response (70–150 Hz) at each time point following stimulus onset was measured as the percent signal change from baseline, with the baseline calculated over all trials in a time window from –500 to –100 ms before stimulus onset (data files containing high gamma activity recordings are available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/flinkerlab/Sensitivity-Suppression">GitHub</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SuppI calculation</title><p>Suppression of neural activity is measured by comparing responses in two time periods in the AWR task. First time period was during listening the stimulus (0–0.5 s) and the second time period was during speaking (0–0.5 s). For each trial, average responses over Listen and Speak periods were found and suppression was measured by calculating Listen-Speak/Listen+Speak. Then suppression values were averaged across trials to calculate a single SuppI for each electrode. For the neural activity, raw high gamma broadband signal power was used instead of the percent signal change to ensure that the SuppI values varied between –1 and 1, indicating a range from complete enhancement to complete suppression respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>SensI calculation</title><p>Sensitivity to DAF is measured by comparing neural responses to increasing amounts of feedback delay. Neural responses in each trial were averaged in a time period following the voice feedback (0–0.5 s). For each electrode, a SensI was calculated by measuring the trial-by-trial Spearman correlation between the delay condition and the averaged neural response. A large sensitivity value indicated a strong response enhancement with increasing delays.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was approved by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (approved protocol s14-02101) which operates under NYU Langone Health Human Research Protections.

In this form, the more obvious difference is that there is an auditory response to the auditory stimulus, and none to the visual, which is expected, but not what I think the authors want to convey.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have updated Figure 1 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The DAF paradigm includes playing auditory feedback at 0, 50, 100, and 200 ms lag, and it is expected that some of these lags are more likely to induce dysfluencies than others. It would be helpful to include some analysis of whether the degree of suppression or enhancement varies by performance on the task, since some participants may find some lags more interfering than others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the original analysis, we calculated a Sensitivity Index for each electrode by correlating the high gamma response with the delay condition across trials. To address the reviewer’s question, we now compared delay conditions in pairs (DAF0 vs DAF50, DAF0 vs DAF100, DAF0 vs DAF200, DAF50 vs DAF100, DAF50 vs DAF200 and DAF100 vs DAF200).</p><p>Similar to our Suppression Index calculation, where we compared neural response to listening and speaking conditions (Listen-Speak/Listen+Speak), we now calculated the Sensitivity Index by comparing neural response to two delay conditions as follows:</p><p>e.g. Sensitivity Index = (DAF50 – DAF0) / (DAF50 + DAF0). We used the raw high gamma broadband signal power instead of percent signal change to ensure that the Sensitivity Index values varied between -1 to 1.</p><p>As shown in the figure below, even when we break down the analysis by feedback delay, we still find a significant association between suppression and sensitivity (except for when we calculate sensitivity indices by comparing DAF50 and DAF100). Strongest correlation (Pearson’s correlation) was found when sensitivity indices were calculated by comparing DAF0 and DAF200.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, participants found DAF200 more interfering than the others and slowed down their speech the most (Articulation duration; DAF0: 0.698, DAF50: 0.726, DAF100: 0.737, and DAF200: 0.749 milliseconds; Ozker, Doyle et al. 2022).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94198-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3 shows data from only two electrodes from one patient. An analysis of how amplitude changes as a function of the lag across all of the participants who performed this task would be helpful to see how replicable these patterns of activity are across patients. Is sensitivity to DAF always seen as a change in amplitude, or are there ever changes in latency as well? The analysis in Figure 4 gets at which electrodes are sensitive to DAF but does not give a sense of whether the temporal profile is similar to those shown in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4A, electrodes from all participants are color-coded to reflect the correlation between neural response amplitude and auditory feedback delay. A majority of auditory electrodes in the STG exhibit a positive correlation, indicating that response amplitude increases with increasing feedback delays. To demonstrate the replicability of the response patterns in Figure 3, here we show auditory responses averaged across 23 STG electrodes from 6 participants.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94198-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Response latency in auditory regions also increases with increasing auditory feedback delays. But this delayed auditory response to delayed auditory feedback is expected. In Figure 3, signals were aligned to the perceived auditory feedback onset, therefore we don’t see the latency differences. Below we replotted the same responses by aligning the signal to the onset of articulation. It is now clearer that responses are delayed as the auditory feedback delay increases. This is because participants start speaking at time=0, but they hear their voice with a lag so the response onset in these auditory regions are delayed.</p><p>According to models of speech production, when there is a mismatch between expected and perceived auditory feedback, the auditory cortex encodes this mismatch with an enhanced response, reflecting an error signal. Therefore, we referred to changes in response amplitude as a measure of sensitivity to DAF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While the sensitivity index helps to show whether increasing amounts of feedback delay are correlated with increased response enhancement, it is not sensitive to nonlinear changes as a function of feedback delay, and it is not clear from Figure 3 or 4 whether such relationships exist. A deeper investigation into the response types observed during DAF would help to clarify whether this is truly a linear relationship, dependent on behavioral errors, or something else.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared responses to delay conditions in pairs in the analysis presented above (response #2). We hope these new results also clarifies this issue and address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) While the correlation between SuppI and SensI is clear here (as opposed to Chang et al), it is unclear if this difference is a byproduct of how SensI was calculated (and not just different tasks). In that paper, the feedback sensitivity was calculated as a metric comparing feedback responses during production and listening, whereas here the SensI is a correlation coefficient during production only. If the data exists, it would be very helpful to also show an analysis similar to that used previously (i.e. comparing DAF effects in both production and playback, either in correlations or just the 200ms delay response). One could imagine that some differences are due to sensory properties, though it is certainly less clear what delay effects would be on listening compared to say pitch shift.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, the calculation of SensI is different in the two studies. In Chang et al. study, SensI was calculated by comparing perturbed feedback responses during production and passive listening. This is a very meticulous approach as it controls for the acoustic properties of the auditory stimuli under both conditions.</p><p>In our study, we didn’t have a passive listening condition. This would require recording the participants’ voice as they were speaking with DAF and playing it back to them in a subsequent passive listening condition. Therefore, we can’t completely eliminate the possibility that some differences are due to sensory properties. However, to address the reviewer’s concern, we examined the voice recordings of 8 participants for acoustic differences. Specifically, we compared voice intensities for different auditory feedback delays (0,50,100 and 200ms) and found no significant differences (F=0, p=0.091).</p><p>We think that the difference with the Chang et al. study is an important point to emphasize, therefore we now added in the Discussion:</p><p>“In contrast, to replicate this finding in humans, a previous iEEG study by Chang et al. (Chang, Niziolek et al. 2013) used frequency-shifted feedback during vowel production and found that most suppressed auditory sites did not overlap with those sensitive to feedback alterations. Using DAF instead of frequency-shifted feedback, we demonstrated a significant overlap of two neural populations in the STG, along with a strong correlation between the degree of speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. This discrepancy may be due to different methods of calculating sensitivity to altered feedback. In our study, sensitivity was determined by comparing responses to delayed and non-delayed feedback during production, whereas Chang et al. compared perturbed feedback responses during production and listening. One possibility is that our approach identifies a larger auditory neural population in the STG sensitive to altered feedback. Alternatively, it could indicate a larger population highly sensitive to temporal rather than spectral perturbations in auditory feedback. Thus, we observe a wide overlap of the two neural populations in the STG showing both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. Replaying a recording of the participants' own delayed voice back to them, which we were unable to complete in this study, would have made the results of the two studies more comparable while also completely eliminating the possibility of a sensory explanation for the observed response enhancement.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I am still a bit unclear on how Experiment 4 is different than the no-delay condition in Experiment 3. Please clarify. Also, to be clear, in Experiments 1+2 the subjects were not wearing any headphones and had no additional sidetone?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that participants were not wearing earphones in Experiments 1&amp;2 (with no additional sidetone), and that they were wearing earphones in Experiments 3&amp;4.</p><p>For the “no delay” condition in the DAF experiment (Experiment 3), participants were wearing earphones and reading words with simultaneous auditory feedback.

We found that response magnitudes were now similar in the two experiments (Experiment 3 and 4) and earphones (with the associated increased sound amplitude) were indeed the reason for larger neural responses. Thus, Experiment 4 differs from the no-delay condition in Experiment 3 only in the stimuli read aloud.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3, why is the DAF200 condition activity so much bigger than the other conditions, even prior to the DAF onset? I worry this might bias the rest of the response differences.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3B and 3D, time=0 indicates the onset of the perceived auditory feedback. Below we replotted the responses in the same two electrodes but now time=0 indicates the onset of articulation. We see that the peaking time of the responses are delayed as the auditory feedback delay increases. This is because participants start speaking at time=0, but they hear their voice with a lag so the response onset in these auditory regions are delayed. However, like the reviewer pointed out, the response for the DAF200 condition in Electrode G54 is slightly larger even at the very beginning. We think that this small, early response might reflect a response to the bone-conducted auditory feedback, which might be more prominent for the DAF200 condition. Nevertheless, we still see that response amplitude increase with increasing feedback delays in Electrode 63.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4C, are the labeled recording sites limited to those with significant DAF and/or suppression?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4C, we show electrodes that had significant high-gamma broadband responses during all tasks. We write in the Methods: “Electrodes that showed significant response increase (p &lt; 10−4) either before (−0.5 to 0 s) or after speech onset (0 to 0.5 s) with respect to a baseline period (−1 to −0.6 s) and at the same time had a large signal-to-noise ratio (μ/σ &gt; 0.7) during either of these time windows were selected. Electrode selection was first performed for each task separately, then electrodes that were commonly selected were further analyzed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Were there any analyses done to control for the effects of vocal changes on the DAF neural responses? The authors' previous paper did note a behavioral effect. This is probably not trivial, as we may not know the 'onset time' of the response, in contrast to pitch shift where it is more regular. If the timing is unknown, one thing that could be tried is to only look early in DAF responses (first 50ms say) to make sure the DAF effects hold.</p></disp-quote><p>DAF involves two different perturbations: the absence of feedback at speech onset and the introduction of delayed feedback during playback. The timing of the behavioral effect in response to these two perturbations remains unclear. Aligning the neural responses to the production onset and examining the first 50ms would only capture the response to the acoustic feedback for the no-delay condition within that time window. Conversely, aligning the responses to the playback onset might miss the onset of the behavioral effect, which likely starts earlier as a response to the lack of feedback. We acknowledge the reviewer's point that this is a limitation of the DAF paradigm, and the behavioral effect is not as straightforward as that of pitch perturbation. However, we believe there is no clear solution to this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Figure 3, it might be nice to show the SuppI and SensI on the plots to give the reader a better sense of what those values look like.</p></disp-quote><p>We included SuppI and SensI values in the new version of Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(1) In Figure 1, it is unclear whether the responses shown in B-D correspond to the ROIs shown in Figure A - I am guessing so, but the alignment of the labels makes this slightly unclear, so I suggest these be relabeled somehow for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is fixed in the updated version of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1D the difference in colors between AWR and VWR is difficult to appreciate - I suggest using two contrasting colors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is fixed in the updated version of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please add y-axis labels for Fig 3B-D.
