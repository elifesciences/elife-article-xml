While the evolutionary mechanisms behind tRNA gene set evolution have been investigated theoretically and computationally, direct observations of tRNA gene set evolution remain rare. Here, we report the evolution of a tRNA gene set in laboratory populations of the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25. The growth defect caused by deleting the single-copy tRNA gene, <italic>serCGA</italic>, is rapidly compensated by large-scale (45–290 kb) duplications in the chromosome. Each duplication encompasses a second, compensatory tRNA gene (<italic>serTGA</italic>) and is associated with a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. We postulate that tRNA-Ser(CGA) elimination increases the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA), a pressure relieved by increasing <italic>serTGA</italic> copy number. This work demonstrates that tRNA gene sets can evolve through duplication of existing tRNA genes, a phenomenon that may contribute to the presence of multiple, identical tRNA gene copies within genomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>duplication</kwd><kwd>pseudomonas fluorescens sbw25</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>YAMAT-seq</kwd><kwd>serine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ayan</surname><given-names>Gökçe B</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Hye Jin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallie</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bacterial tRNA gene set rapidly evolves, compensating the loss of one tRNA type by large duplication events that increase the gene copy number of a second, different tRNA type.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Even though tRNAs perform the same canonical function in all organisms – decoding 61 sense codons into 20 amino acids – tRNA gene sets vary considerably across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fujishima and Kanai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marck and Grosjean, 2002</xref>). Two aspects in which they vary are the types of tRNAs encoded and the number of gene copies encoding each type. Bacterial tRNA complements typically contain 28–46 types of tRNA, encoded by 28–120 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>). Elucidating the factors contributing to, and the molecular mechanisms behind, the evolution of these variations has been of long-standing interest in biology. There is general agreement that bacterial tRNA gene sets are, in conjunction with the rest of the translational machinery, shaped by selection for rapid and accurate protein synthesis (‘translational efficiency’; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</xref>). Efficient translation is an important determinant of bacterial growth rate, with more efficient protein production enabling faster growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kurland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kurland and Ehrenberg, 1987</xref>). tRNAs mainly contribute to translational efficiency during elongation, the stage of translation where codons are sequentially matched to aminoacylated (charged) tRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodnina, 2018</xref>). Codon-tRNA matching occurs by a trial and error process; tRNAs – in the form of ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bensch et al., 1991</xref>) – are stochastically sampled from the available pool. The speed with which a matching tRNA is selected depends on the absolute and relative concentration of tRNAs that match the codon; codons matched by more abundant tRNAs are expected, on average, to be translated more quickly than those matched by rarer tRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). Given that the formation of codon-tRNA matches by stochastic sampling is the rate-limiting step of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Varenne et al., 1984</xref>), any factors affecting the matching process are likely to influence the evolution of bacterial tRNA gene sets. Examples include variations in codon-tRNA matching patterns and codon bias. Both of these are discussed in more detail below.</p><p>Codon-tRNA matching patterns are complex; some tRNAs match, and hence translate, more than one synonymous codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crick, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikemura, 1981</xref>). This expanded translational capacity is the result of relaxed base pairing between the first base of the tRNA anticodon (tRNA position 34) and third base of the codon (codon position 3). In this binding position, a number of non-standard, ‘wobble’ pairings are permitted (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agris et al., 2018</xref>). Most wobble pairings involve post-transcriptionally, enzymatically modified bases in the anticodon stem-and-loop region of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machnicka et al., 2016</xref>). These post-transcriptional modifications affect the binding capacity and/or accuracy of a large fraction of bacterial tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Björk and Hagervall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manickam et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, the set of post-transcriptional modification pathways active within a bacterial species affects the codon–tRNA matching pattern and, in turn, is expected to influence tRNA gene set composition. Indeed, various post-transcriptional modification pathways have been shown to co-vary with tRNA repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grosjean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Novoa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Codon bias refers to the preferential use of some synonymous codons over others. A number of hypotheses exist regarding the evolutionary origins and consequences of preferred codons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Novoa and Ribas de Pouplana, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>), one of which is the optimization of codon–tRNA matching during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berg and Kurland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bulmer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bulmer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Higgs and Ran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rocha, 2004</xref>). There are several lines of support for this hypothesis. Firstly, different codons have been demonstrated to be translated at different rates in yeast, with more frequent codons generally being translated more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gardin et al., 2014</xref>). Secondly, codon and tRNA abundances have been observed to co-vary across many bacterial genomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ikemura, 1985</xref>), particularly under conditions where rapid translation is required (e.g., during rapid growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emilsson and Kurland, 1990</xref>], in highly expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikemura, 1981</xref>], or among bacteria with faster growth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharp et al., 2010</xref>]). Thirdly, a number of studies have demonstrated an increase in protein expression when codon–tRNA co-variation is strengthened, either by optimizing synonymous codon use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sørensen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>) or by the addition of exogenous tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Misra and Reeves, 1985</xref>).</p><p>As outlined above, two factors expected to affect tRNA gene set evolution are the presence of tRNA post-transcriptional modification pathways and codon bias; post-transcriptional modifications heavily influence codon–tRNA matching patterns (affecting the tRNA types that are encoded), while codon bias dictates the translational demand for individual tRNA types (influencing tRNA abundances and hence tRNA gene copy number). Overall, theoretical and computational studies are consistent with the optimization of translational efficiency by the streamlining of tRNA gene sets; bacterial growth rate correlates with fewer tRNA types encoded by more gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ran and Higgs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rocha, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In addition to factors influencing the evolution of tRNA gene sets, the mechanisms behind their evolution are an area of interest. Hypothetically, tRNA gene sets can evolve by several different mechanisms. Surplus tRNA genes may be lost (by deletion), while tRNA genes may be acquired from external sources (by horizontal gene transfer), or from within the genome (by duplication events). Additionally, the identity of existing tRNA genes may be altered by the acquisition of anticodon mutations (anticodon switching). Thus far, most evidence for the above routes of tRNA gene set evolution is indirect: phylogenetic analyses provide evidence of the flexibility of bacterial tRNA gene sets by loss, gain (both by horizontal gene transfer and duplication), and anticodon switch events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Withers et al., 2006</xref>). An anticodon switch event has also been directly observed in laboratory yeast; <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> populations in which the gene encoding tRNA-Arg(CCU) had been removed were repeatedly rescued by a C→T mutation in one of eleven gene copies encoding tRNA-Arg(UCU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). While the aforementioned study demonstrates the power of experimental evolution to provide insight into the evolution of tRNA gene sets, there remains a shortage of empirical studies directly investigating the evolution of bacterial tRNA gene sets and translation.</p><p>To address this, we (i) engineer a suboptimal bacterial tRNA gene set, (ii) compensate the defect using experimental evolution, and (iii) determine the genetic and molecular bases of compensation. More specifically, we delete the single-copy tRNA gene, <italic>serCGA</italic>, from the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25. We compensate the resulting growth defect during a 13-day serial transfer evolution experiment and show that the genetic basis of compensation is large-scale (45–290 kb), tandem duplications encompassing a second tRNA gene (<italic>serTGA</italic>). Using a bacterial adaptation of YAMAT-seq (a method of mature tRNA pool deep-sequencing originally developed for use in human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>]), we demonstrate that each duplication event is accompanied by an increase in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. Finally, we develop a model that combines our experimental results with the predicted effects of codon–tRNA matching patterns and codon bias, to provide a molecular explanation of how the observed tRNA pool changes may affect translation and growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 tRNA gene set</title><p>Isolated from the leaf of a sugar beet plant, <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 is a non-pathogenic bacterium that is frequently used as a model system in evolutionary biology.

To investigate SBW25 codon–tRNA matching patterns, a combination of current wobble rules (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agris et al., 2018</xref>) and tRNA post-transcriptional modification prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machnicka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panwar and Raghava, 2014</xref>) was applied. Evidence for the translation of multiple synonymous codons was found for 28 of 39 tRNA types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The proposed SBW25 codon–tRNA matching patterns indicate that the 39 tRNA types consist of a core set of 33 essential types (thatwhich together are theoretically capable of translating all 61 codons) and six non-essential types (whose cognate codons are also predicted to be translated by an essential tRNA type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The six non-essential types are candidates for suboptimal tRNA gene set construction; their apparent functional redundancy suggests that they can be eliminated, while their retention indicates that elimination may be detrimental.</p><p>With the aim of constructing a suboptimal tRNA gene set, we focussed our attention on <italic>serCGA</italic>, a single-copy gene encoding the non-essential tRNA type, tRNA-Ser(CGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). According to the predicted codon–tRNA matching pattern, the cognate codon of tRNA-Ser(CGA), UCG, can also be translated by the essential tRNA type, tRNA-Ser(UGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In several Gram-negative bacteria, tRNA-Ser(UGA) is post-transcriptionally modified at U<sub>34</sub> to 5-methoxycarbonylmethoxyuridine (mcmo<sup>5</sup>U<sub>34</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in the expansion of translational capacity from codon UCA to include UCG and UCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takai et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takai, 1996</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The mcmo<sup>5</sup>U<sub>34</sub> modification is performed by the CmoA/B/M enzymatic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Björk and Hagervall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sakai et al., 2016</xref>). Homologues of these enzymes are present in SBW25; protein BLAST searches of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MG1655 CmoA, CmoB, and CmoM against the SBW25 proteome give significant hits to Pflu1067, Pflu1066, and Pflu0633, respectively (BLASTp e-values &lt;1e-50; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>CmoA/B/M-mediated expansion of tRNA-Ser(UGA) translational capacity to include codon UCG is expected to rescue a <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutant.

Given that UCG is a relatively high use codon in SBW25 – accounting for 22.5% of serine and 1.31% of all codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) – <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion is expected to considerably increase translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA). Hence, while a <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutant may survive, significant translation and growth defects are anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Deletion of <italic>serCGA</italic> limits rapid growth</title><p>To test the prediction that <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion results in a viable strain with a growth defect, the entire 90 bp, single-copy <italic>serCGA</italic> gene was removed from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 by two-step allelic exchange (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for construction details). This process changed the tRNA gene set from 66 tRNA genes of 39 types to 65 tRNA genes of 38 types. The engineering process was performed two independent times, yielding biological replicate strains Δ<italic>serCGA-</italic>1 and Δ<italic>serCGA-</italic>2. A third round of allelic exchange gave rise to an engineering control strain, SBW25-eWT. Successful deletion of <italic>serCGA</italic> demonstrates that it is not essential for survival; at least one other tRNA can translate codon UCG. <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion results in an immediately obvious growth defect on King’s medium B (KB), a rich medium that supports rapid growth and hence rapid translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">King et al., 1954</xref>).

Closer examination revealed a ~45 kb segment that is duplicated in all five strains (4,119,923–4,164,966). This segment is predicted to contain 45 genes, including 44 protein-coding genes (none of which is obviously linked to translation, or serine transport/metabolism), and one tRNA gene: <italic>serTGA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Close manual inspection revealed no evidence of any point mutations in any copy of the <italic>serTGA</italic> gene or promoter sequence, in any of the evolved isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), meaning that each duplication strain contains a second, wild-type copy of <italic>serTGA</italic>. In addition, isolate M4-L carries additional copies of four other tRNA genes (<italic>argTCT</italic>, <italic>hisGTG, leuTAA,</italic> and <italic>hisGTG</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Notably, this experiment has revealed three different tRNA gene sets that each provides a similar level of fitness in KB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>): SBW25 encodes 66 canonical tRNA genes of 39 tRNA types, four of five compensated isolates carry 66 tRNA genes of 38 types, and the fifth compensated isolate (M4-L) carries 70 tRNA genes of 38 types.</p><p>Given that the duplicated <italic>serTGA</italic> gene encodes tRNA-Ser(UGA), the tRNA type that can theoretically perform the function of tRNA-Ser(CGA) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), it is a logical candidate for the underlying cause of compensation. However, there are also 44 protein-coding genes in the shared duplication segment, any of which could contribute to the compensatory effect. We therefore tested whether a plasmid-based increase in <italic>serTGA</italic> expression can compensate for <italic>serCGA</italic> loss. To this end, the <italic>serCGA</italic> and <italic>serTGA</italic> genes were individually amplified from SBW25, and each ligated into the expression vector pSXn (giving pSXn-CGA and pSXn-TGA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This placed the expression of the tRNA gene under the control of an isopropyl-ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible <italic>tac</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Boer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owen and Ackerley, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Each plasmid construct was inserted into SBW25, Δ<italic>serCGA</italic>-1, and Δ<italic>serCGA-</italic>2, and the growth of the resulting strains was analysed in the absence of the inducer (to achieve lower-level, leaky expression of the tRNA gene). Expression of either <italic>serCGA</italic> or <italic>serTGA</italic> was shown to improve the growth of the <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutants in rich medium; addition of pSXn-CGA or pSXn-TGA increases the maximum growth rate of Δ<italic>serCGA</italic>, while addition of empty pSXn does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>; two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests). Contrastingly, expression of neither tRNA improved growth of SBW25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with <italic>serCGA</italic> expression actually leading to a decrease in SBW25 maximum growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; one-sided two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test p=0.000158).

Similar PCRs for the remaining duplication strains detected the presence of the relevant duplication junctions on day 2 (M2-Lop), day 4 (M3-L), and day 5 (M2-L and M4-L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A notable feature of the duplication fragments is that they are heterogeneous. That is, each of the five compensated isolates carries a unique duplication fragment with distinct endpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Further, there is evidence of within-lineage heterogeneity; two distinct duplication fragments were identified in isolates from a single lineage (M2-L and M2-Lop; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To investigate within-lineage heterogeneity more closely, additional large colonies were isolated from day 13 of each mutant lineage and tested by PCR for the presence of the duplication junction(s) previously identified in the lineage. The results provide evidence for genotypic heterogeneity in compensated isolates from three of the four mutant lineages (M2, M3, and M4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Three differently sized PCR products were detected among the four isolates from lineage M2, demonstrating the presence of at least three distinct duplication fragments in the day 13 population. A mixture of compensated genotypes was also detected in lineages M3 and M4, with duplication junctions M3junct1 and M4junct1 amplifying in only three (of four) and two (of four) isolates, respectively. No PCR products were detected for the remaining isolates in these lineages, indicating that these three isolates either carry a duplication junction that was not tested for or compensate by a different mechanism.</p><p>The results in this section demonstrate that (i) strains carrying duplication fragments arise early within the mutant lineages of the evolution experiment (within 2–5 days or ~7–35 generations) and (ii) a degree of heterogeneity exists in duplication fragments, both between and within mutant lineages. These observations suggest that a mixture of duplication strains – and, by extension, tRNA gene sets – arise and compete within each mutant lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Duplication events increase the proportion of tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool</title><p>Next, we sought to quantify the effect of <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion and subsequent <italic>serTGA</italic> duplication on the mature tRNA pool of SBW25. To this end, YAMAT-seq – an established method of deep-sequencing mature tRNA pools in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>) and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Warren et al., 2020</xref>) – was adapted for use in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25. The YAMAT-seq procedure quantifies charged and uncharged mature tRNAs; it does not measure pre-tRNAs, or tRNA fragments. Briefly, the YAMAT-seq procedure involves (i) isolation of total RNA from exponentially growing cells, (ii) removal of amino acids from the charged fraction of mature tRNAs, rendering all (or, most) mature tRNAs uncharged, (iii) ligation of Y-shaped, DNA/RNA hybrid adapters to the conserved, exposed ends of the mature, uncharged tRNAs, (iv) reverse transcription and amplification of adapter-tRNA complexes, (v) gel purification of the PCR products, (vi) high throughput sequencing, and (vii) computational and statistical analyses.</p><p>YAMAT-seq was performed on three replicates of nine strains: wild type (SBW25), the two independent <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutants (Δ<italic>serCGA-</italic>1, Δ<italic>serCGA</italic>-2), and six isolates from day 13 of the evolution experiment (W1-L, M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, M3-L, and M4-L). High throughput sequencing of the reverse-transcribed tRNA pools resulted in an average of 1,177,340 raw reads <italic>per</italic> sample. More than 99.99% of the raw reads fell within the range of lengths expected for tRNA-containing reads (80–150 bp), indicating good adapter-binding specificity. The &gt;80 bp reads for each sample were aligned to a set of 42 reference tRNA sequences, consisting of all unique tRNA gene sequences predicted in the SBW25 chromosome (including <italic>cysGCA</italic>-2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>). At the conclusion of the alignment process, an average of 1,050,749 reads <italic>per</italic> sample were aligned to the reference sequences (~89% read retention; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Within each sample, the reference sequences with the highest and lowest (above zero) read counts consistently varied by a factor of ~10,000. For example, in sample 1, 109,963 reads aligned to Gly-GCC and 13 to Ile2-CAU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>All samples showed reads aligned to 40 or 41 (of 42) reference sequences. The reference sequences without reads were Ser-CGA (in Δ<italic>serCGA</italic> and derivatives, as expected) and Cys-GCA-2 (in all 27 samples). Together with the prediction of a non-standard secondary structure for <italic>cysGCA-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and Lowe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>), our inability to detect the Cys-GCA-2 sequence in any sample strongly indicates that Cys-GCA-2 does not contribute to translation. Overall, the YAMAT-seq results support the tRNA gene set predicted for SBW25: all 39 predicted types of mature tRNAs were detectable, including the 33 essential and the six non-essential tRNA types (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>While the YAMAT-seq results provide a useful overview of the relative abundances of tRNAs in a mature tRNA pool, within-strain comparisons of different tRNA types should be interpreted cautiously. As outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>, variations in tRNA structural components and post-transcriptional modifications can adversely affect the relative efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction for some tRNA types, reducing their apparent proportions. In our results, three tRNA types consistently align a very low proportion of reads (&lt;0.0001): Phe-GAA, Glu-UUC, and Ile2-CAU. A much higher proportion of reads was expected in particular for Phe-GAA and Glu-UUC, both of which are the sole tRNA types responsible for decoding all synonymous codons for their respective amino acids (accounting for 3.66% and 5.43% of genome wide codons, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>). Given their low read numbers, and non-central role in our experiment, these three tRNA types were removed from downstream statistical analyses.</p><p>The strength of the YAMAT-seq procedure lies in comparing changes in mature tRNA levels across genotypes. Any issues with efficiencies are expected to remain relatively constant across the strains in this experiment, allowing changes in relative tRNA type abundances to be detected. To this end, DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to compare normalized expression levels of 36 mature tRNA types – all SBW25 tRNA types except for Phe-GAA, Glu-UUC, and Ile2-CAU – in pairs of strains. Firstly, the effect of deleting <italic>serCGA</italic> was investigated by comparing tRNA sequences from each of the two independent <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion strains with those in SBW25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The absence of tRNA-Ser(CGA) from both deletion mutants demonstrates that (i) tRNA-Ser(CGA) is encoded solely by the deleted <italic>serCGA</italic> gene, and (ii) under the conditions tested, tRNA-Ser(CGA) is indeed a non-essential tRNA type in SBW25 (i.e., can be eliminated without causing death). The <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutants also showed consistently lower levels of tRNA-Thr(CGU) (DESeq2 adjusted p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001), a result that may reflect a close metabolic relationship between threonine and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sawers, 1998</xref>).

Importantly, no differences in tRNA pools were detected in the wild type control lineage (W1-L versus SBW25; DESeq2 adjusted p&gt;0.1). Contrastingly, a single consistent, statistically significant difference was observed across the five mutant lineage isolates: the level of tRNA-Ser(UGA) was 2.06- to 2.60-fold higher than in the Δ<italic>serCGA</italic> ancestor (DESeq2 adjusted p&lt;0.0001). A number of other tRNA types co-vary with the rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). While none of these differences is statistically significant in all strains, they are consistently in the same direction (i.e., increase or decrease). Thus, while the main effect of <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion and <italic>serTGA</italic> duplication is the loss of tRNA-Ser(CGA) and elevation of tRNA-Ser(UGA) respectively, other more subtle effects are likely to exist. Finally, pairwise comparisons between the duplication strains reveal some tRNA pool differences between the different duplication strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, no differences were detected between strain M4-L and any of the other duplication strains (DESeq2 adjusted p&gt;0.3), indicating that the four additional tRNA genes duplicated in M4-L do not contribute to the mature tRNA pool. It is possible that the duplication junction in M4-L – which lies 112 bp upstream of the duplicated <italic>argTCT-hisGTG-leuTAG-hisGTG</italic> tRNA genes – truncates a promoter, leading to little or no expression of the duplicated copies.

In this final section, we develop a model to provide a molecular explanation of how elevating tRNA-Ser(UGA) levels may compensate for tRNA-Ser(CGA) loss.</p><p>As described in the introduction, tRNA pool composition is an important determinant of translational speed. During elongation, the codon occupying the ribosomal A site is matched to a corresponding tRNA by stochastically sampling from the available pool of ternary complexes. Ternary complexes consist of a tRNA, an elongation factor (EF-Tu), and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bensch et al., 1991</xref>). Given that EF-Tu is a highly abundant protein that binds all correctly charged tRNA types with approximately equal affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Louie et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schrader et al., 2011</xref>), and uncharged tRNAs with several fold lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nissen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shulman et al., 1974</xref>), the relative levels of each ternary complex are expected to reflect mature, charged tRNA proportions. Overall, the average time taken to match any given codon is dependent on the availability of the corresponding charged tRNA type(s); codons matched by a higher proportion of tRNAs will, on average, be translated more quickly than those matched by rarer tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Varenne et al., 1984</xref>). To illustrate, consider the serine codons and seryl-tRNAs from our experiments; codon UCA is translated by tRNA-Ser(UGA), while codon UCG can theoretically be translated by tRNA-Ser(CGA) <italic>or</italic> tRNA-Ser(UGA) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When both tRNA types are present, UCG is matched by a higher proportion of tRNAs than UCA and hence is expected to be translated more quickly, on average.</p><p>The above logic can be extended to provide relative numerical estimates of codon translation times, where codon-tRNA matching patterns and tRNA proportions are known.

A multitude of theoretical studies have focused on various aspects of tRNA gene set evolution, highlighting roles for post-transcriptional modifications and codon bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bulmer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Higgs and Ran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ikemura, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Novoa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ran and Higgs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharp et al., 2010</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses have provided evidence of bacterial tRNA gene set evolution by four main routes: (i) tRNA gene loss through deletion events, (ii) tRNA gene acquisition through horizontal gene transfer, (iii) tRNA gene acquisition by within-genome duplication events, and (iv) tRNA gene changes as a result of anticodon switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marck and Grosjean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Withers et al., 2006</xref>). In this work, we provide direct, empirical evidence for one of these routes: tRNA gene acquisition by within-genome duplication events. Loss of the single-copy tRNA gene <italic>serCGA</italic> was compensated by large-scale, tandem duplications that increase the copy number of tRNA gene <italic>serTGA</italic>, leading to elevation of tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Retention of <italic>serCGA</italic> in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 wild type</title><p>The observation that increasing the proportion of mature tRNA-Ser(UGA) can compensate for tRNA-Ser(CGA) loss can be explained on the molecular level: we hypothesize that elimination of tRNA-Ser(CGA) places translational strain on tRNA-Ser(UGA) at UCG codons, and that this pressure can be at least partially relieved by elevating tRNA-Ser(UGA) levels. While this hypothesis is consistent with our experimental results, it raises the question of why <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 might retain a copy of <italic>serCGA</italic> in the natural, plant environment; given that selection for translational efficiency favours fewer tRNA types encoded by more tRNA gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ran and Higgs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rocha, 2004</xref>), one might expect <italic>serCGA</italic> elimination in favour of multiple <italic>serTGA</italic> gene copies. However, <italic>serCGA</italic> is frequently retained in bacterial genomes; a study of 319 bacteria from different genera indicates a <italic>serCGA</italic> retention rate of ~70%, with retention correlating with higher UCG usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>). What is the advantage of retaining tRNA-Ser(CGA) over simply encoding higher levels of tRNA-Ser(UGA)?</p><p>One possible explanation for <italic>serCGA</italic> retention is that, while both tRNA-Ser(CGA) and tRNA-Ser(UGA) <italic>can</italic> translate UCG codons, tRNA-Ser(CGA) may do so with greater efficiency (i.e., more quickly and/or more accurately). Indeed, changing the anticodon of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Ser(UGA) from UGA to CGA has been shown to increase the efficiency of UCG translational in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takai et al., 1999b</xref>). Further, any difference in translational efficiencies may depend on environmental conditions; temperature, acidity, and ion concentration all alter the stability of RNA base pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nikolova and Al-Hashimi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Serra et al., 2002</xref>).

This is because, in addition to increasing fitness, the duplication of <italic>serTGA</italic> has provided a possible route by which <italic>serCGA</italic> could be regained, and thus the original <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 tRNA gene set restored. Specifically, one of the two copies of <italic>serTGA</italic> could acquire a T→C transition at tRNA position 34, changing the gene from <italic>serTGA</italic> to <italic>serCGA</italic> (i.e., an anticodon switch event). In order for such a mutation to spread through the population, it must encode a functional tRNA. This requires the new, hypothetical tRNA-Ser(CGA) to be recognized by seryl-tRNA ligase (SerRS), the enzyme that adds serine to all types of serine-carrying tRNAs in the cell (for a review of tRNA ligase function, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ibba and Soll, 2000</xref>). Recognition of seryl-tRNAs by SerRS depends not on the tRNA sequence or the anticodon, but rather on the characteristic three-dimensional shape of seryl-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lenhard et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, even though <italic>serTGA</italic> and the original <italic>serCGA</italic> encode tRNAs with very different sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it is plausible that the new, hypothetical <italic>serCGA</italic> could form a functional tRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, a UGA→CGA anticodon switch alters the translational capacity of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA-Ser(UGA) from codon UCA to UCG in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takai et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takai et al., 1999b</xref>).

Extensive work has shown that large-scale tandem duplications occur at extremely high rates in bacteria; for example, in an unselected overnight culture, around 10% of <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells reportedly carry a duplication of some sort, with 0.005–3% carrying a duplication of a particular locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Roth, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reams et al., 2010</xref>). These rates are orders of magnitude higher than those typically reported for single nucleotide polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Westra et al., 2017</xref>) and are consistent with the early detection of duplication fragments in our evolution experiment: strains carrying large-scale duplications were isolated from every mutant lineage by day 13 (~90 generations), and the duplication fragments they contained were first detected in the relevant population between days 2 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Large-scale duplications arise through unusual exchange of DNA between two separate parts of the bacterial chromosome, with the separating distance determining the size of the duplication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Roth, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>). A variety of mechanisms have been reported to underpin duplication formation, including (i) RecA-mediated, unequal recombination, (ii) RecA independent unequal recombination, and (iii) errant topoisomerase or gyrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shyamala et al., 1990</xref>). The first of these, RecA-mediated unequal recombination, occurs between direct repeats some distance apart (e.g., rRNA operons and <italic>rhs</italic> genes), with longer repeats generally leading to higher rates of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>). Two of the five mutant lineage isolates in this work (M2-L, M3-L) have endpoints in ~1.5 kb direct, imperfect repeats at 4.12 Mb and 4.31 Mb of the SBW25 chromosome, suggesting that the ~192 kb duplication fragment they contain arose by RecA-mediated, unequal recombination between these regions. The duplication fragments in the other three mutant lineage isolates (M1-L, M2-Lop, and M4-L) show no obvious signs of homology between their endpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating an alternative mechanistic origin. Overall, the diversity in duplication fragment endpoints – location and degree of homology – in this study are indicative of a range of mechanistic origins.</p><p>While duplication formation does not necessarily require sequence homology, duplications that occur at the highest rates typically result from unequal recombination between long (&gt;200 bp) repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>). The <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 genome contains many of these types of repeats dispersed around the chromosome, including five nearly identical rRNA operons and three highly similar <italic>rhs</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silby et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, there are hundreds of smaller repeats throughout the genome, including REPINs and tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertels and Rainey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silby et al., 2009</xref>). Errant recombination between any of these repeated sequences could plausibly generate large-scale duplications, meaning that almost any region of the SBW25 chromosome – and therefore many tRNA genes – could conceivably be duplicated <italic>via</italic> homologous recombination. It has previously been noted that the region surrounding the SBW25 replication terminus appears to be more susceptible to evolutionary change than the rest of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silby et al., 2009</xref>). This variable region extends approximately 1.4 Mb on either side of the terminus, engulfing 28 tRNA genes (including <italic>serTGA</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). It seems probable that, while the copy number of many tRNA genes could feasibly be elevated by large-scale duplications, the tRNA genes surrounding the SBW25 replication terminus may be more prone to evolutionary change by duplication.</p><p>Given that dispersed repeats and large-scale duplications are a widespread feature of bacterial genomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brazda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>), similar within-genome duplication may be capable of generating changes in tRNA gene copy number in many bacteria. Presumably, different duplication fragments – and therefore tRNA genes – arise at varying rates (depending on the presence and length of direct repeats in the surrounding area) and have varying degrees of evolutionary success (depending on fragment size and the dosage effects of genes in the fragment).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolutionary fate of the large-scale duplications and new tRNA gene copies</title><p>Large-scale duplications in bacterial genomes are typically unstable (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>). That is, in addition to occurring at high rates, they are also lost – without a trace – at high rates. Duplications are lost in ~1% of cells <italic>per</italic> generation in Salmonella cultures, in the absence of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>). Due to their combined ease of gain and loss, it has been suggested that duplications serve as fleeting evolutionary solutions to transient phenotypic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sonti and Roth, 1989</xref>); they occur at high frequency without adversely affecting the long-term structure and integrity of the genome. The reported instability of large-scale duplications raises questions about the long-term fate of the duplications seen during this experiment. That is, if the serial transfer experiment was continued past day 13, what would happen to the duplication strains and the tRNA genes that they contain?</p><p>Extension of the evolution experiment could have several outcomes. One is that duplication fragments encompassing <italic>serTGA</italic> may continue to arise and be lost, with duplication strains eventually reaching a stable level within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reams et al., 2010</xref>). In this scenario, while individual large-scale duplications would continually rise and fall, they would remain the dominant evolutionary solution in the population. A second possibility is that progressively smaller (and inherently more stable) duplication fragments may arise, perhaps eventually resulting in a duplication fragment comprised only of <italic>serTGA</italic> and its promoter. Such smaller duplication fragments may arise either from a <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutant (by rarer duplication events between more proximate DNA sequences) or from a duplication strain (by remodelling of the existing duplication fragment). Once a smaller, more stable fragment is dominant in the population, one copy of <italic>serTGA</italic> could conceivably change to <italic>serCGA</italic> through an anticodon switch event (see earlier discussion). A third possible outcome of continuing the evolution experiment is that, over time, a more stable mutation may arise, independently of the duplication fragments.

Reads of the expected length (80–151 bp) were extracted (resulting in 99.99% read retention).

Reads that aligned equally well to more than one reference sequence were discarded in order to minimize misallocation of reads to similar reference sequences. Finally, the unused reads for each sample were de novo aligned, and the resulting contigs checked to ensure that none contained substantial numbers of tRNA reads (particularly seryl-tRNAs).

Codon-tRNA matching patterns are based on the G-U wobble rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crick, 1966</xref>), and post-transcriptional modifications predicted using a combination of MODOMICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>), tRNAmod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panwar and Raghava, 2014</xref>), and tRNAmodpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Machnicka et al., 2016</xref>). Following current wobble rules (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agris et al., 2018</xref>) and the predicted post-transcriptional modifications, the 39 tRNA types present in SBW25 are split into 33 theoretically essential types (pink highlighting) and six theoretically non-essential types (green highlighting).

A minimum of 4.5 million raw reads was obtained for each sample, and these were aligned to the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silby et al., 2009</xref>) and subsequently analysed using a combination of breseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrick et al., 2014</xref>) and Geneious. This file provides a summary and a full report of the mutations predicted in each isolate. In addition to the large tandem duplications detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, two unique point mutations were identified: W3-L carries a non-synonymous point mutation in <italic>ytfH</italic> (encoding a probable transcriptional regulator), and M2-L carries a synonymous point mutation in <italic>edd</italic> (encoding phosphogluconate dehydratase). There is evidence for some non-ubiquitous deletions in repetitive, intergenic, DNA elements in M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, and M4-L. These deletions affect areas outside of the large duplication regions. Some putative mutations were identified in all (or most) isolates, many of which have also been identified in unrelated experiments (i.e., are likely to be present in the starting strain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallie et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallie et al., 2019</xref>).

Note that for comparison purposes, the duplication details for each strain are provided on the same line numbers as the SBW25 list (scroll down until the first duplicated genes is visible in each duplication isolate).

This 245 bp segment encompasses the <italic>serTGA</italic> gene and ~155 bp of the upstream region, which is expected to contain the <italic>serTGA</italic> promoter. Any point mutation in either <italic>serTGA</italic> copy in the duplication strains (M1-L, M2-L, M2-Lop, M3-L, and M4-L) is expected to be reflected by a drop in the proportion of the dominant base (to around 0.5). For example, if in M1-L one <italic>serTGA</italic> copy had gained a C→T point mutation in tRNA position 34 (i.e., an anticodon switch event; see Discussion), one would expect approximately half the 214 reads covering base 4,163,669 to contain a T, and the other half to carry a C. Therefore, the dominant base proportion would be expected to drop to ~0.5. No evidence was found of any mutations in any copy of <italic>serTGA</italic> or its promoter; all 245 bp were covered by a minimum of 127 reads in each duplication strain, with at least 94% of reads at each position carrying the dominant base.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57947-supp5-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Reference list of 42 unique tRNA sequences in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 GtRNAdb 2.0 predicts 67 tRNA genes in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>).</title><p>These include 42 unique primary tRNA sequences, each of which is listed in this file. These 42 sequences are used as references to align the YAMAT-seq data in this work (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Note that the list of 42 sequences includes one likely pseudo tRNA (11_Cys-GCA-2–1). This sequence is not predicted to form a tRNA with conserved cloverleaf secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan and Lowe, 2019</xref>). Further, no YAMAT-seq sequences were aligned to this reference sequence in any sample. We conclude that Cys-GCA-2–1 does not form part of the functional mature tRNA pool in SBW25. In addition, the <italic>serCGA</italic> sequence (30_Ser-CGA-1–1) is expected to be absent from 21 of 27 samples (samples 2–8, 11–17, and 20–26); this tRNA is encoded by <italic>serCGA</italic> (the gene that was deleted by genetic engineering in this work and remains absent in all derived strains). As expected, almost no reads were obtained for this reference sequence in these 21 samples. The very low numbers of Ser-CGA reads obtained in some of these samples (e.g., two reads in sample 20, the third replicate of Δ<italic>serCGA-</italic>1) are likely to be barcode misallocations from one of the six SBW25 or W1-L samples.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57947-supp6-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>YAMAT-seq data showing elimination of tRNA-Ser(CGA) followed by elevating of tRNA-Ser(UGA) expression in each of the five duplication isolates.</title><p>The first tab contains index details and a summary of the raw YAMAT-seq reads (GEO accession number GSE144791; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) for each of the 27 samples (three replicates of nine strains): a minimum of 636,995 reads of the expected size (80–151 bp) was obtained <italic>per</italic> sample.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This well-written manuscript demonstrates that deletion of a non-essential single-copy tRNA gene in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> fluorescens (ser-tRNA CGA) alters the cellular tRNA pool and reduces fitness. During experimental evolution in the laboratory, the authors find that the tRNA deletion is compensated by repeated, large duplications of a part of the genome, which include a near cognate tRNA gene (tRNA TGA). The duplications are associated with increased tRNA TGA expression and increased fitness. The authors suggest that this is a novel evolutionary response to overcome translational inefficiency. These results are framed by a simple model of translation dynamics to understand the initial fitness effects of the gene deletion, and the observed evolutionary response. Overall, the reported experimental work is well done and presents interesting results. The manuscript is also clearly written. However, all reviewers raised questions about the presented mathematical/verbal model and agree that the novelty and breadth of the findings are overstated. Evolution via gene duplication is a well-known phenomenon in evolutionary biology, has been observed in many experimental evolution studies, and is the most likely outcome of the experimental design. The repeated observation of duplications of a region containing tRNA-TGA as well as other tRNAs is a worthwhile finding but the generality of this result for our broader understanding of the evolution of tRNAs requires further exploration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider more of the literature on tRNA pool evolution and clarify how this study represents a significant advance. There has been much discussion of gene loss and duplication as key features (e.g. Withers et al., 2006; Wald and Margalit 2014; Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015), and the resulting evolutionary flexibility of tRNA gene sets (e.g. Ikemura, 1985; Rocha, 2004; Higgs and Ran, 2008; Diwan et al., 2018). This paper provides experimental support for these ideas, arising from the deletion of a single bacterial tRNA gene. This is a valuable result, being the first such demonstration in bacteria. However (contrary to the projection in the manuscript), this is not an unexpected result, and is not sufficient to generalize broadly. The reported adaptation of YAMAT-seq to measure bacterial tRNAs is very useful. Prior models of tRNA gene set evolution have demonstrated the importance of codon usage bias for translation rate (e.g. Bulmer, 1991; Berg et al., 1997; Higgs and Ran, 2008).</p><p>2) The initial model is overly simplistic and ignores much of the advances made in our understanding from prior work showing the importance of codon usage (see references above). The model does not explicitly include links between tRNA set and translation rate, and between translation rate and fitness; these are instead left as verbal arguments. Equation 1 is odd, because it suggests that codon B is translated by both alpha and beta (whereas only one tRNA can decode a codon at a time) and perhaps only works when alpha is limiting. The meaning of Equation 3 is unclear. The calculated translation times (Equation 4) should probably be clearly discussed as relative (not absolute) times. Finally, none of the model predictions are novel (see references above). Citing and discussing prior work may be sufficient to clearly set up the basic premise here (instead of the model), allowing a deeper focus on the experimental work.</p><p>3) We are not convinced that a key assumption of the model is reasonable: &quot; the rate of translation by an anticodon-codon pair is determined solely by the proportion of the anticodon in the tRNA pool&quot;. I would think that the rate-limiting step in the translation of a codon is determined by the stochastic search for the cognate ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA+EF-Tu and GTP) to the A-site (Varenne et al., 1984). I cannot see that this is directly related to the proportion in the tRNA pool, but mainly to the concentration of each cognate ternary complex at steady-state. Reducing the concentration drastically by deleting a tRNA gene is likely to be limiting for growth, but this can be compensated for by increasing the concentration by a duplication. If the authors assume that competition with non-cognate and near-cognate ternary complexes are of major importance for the rate of translation of a codon this should be clearly stated. The authors find that tRNA proportions vary almost 100,000-fold; does this mean that translation rates are also expected to vary 100,000-fold and is there any experimental support for this? Please provide a clear explanation for why proportion of the anticodon in the tRNA pool is expected to be rate-limiting, supported by proper references.</p><p>4) A number of factors relevant to understand translation rates and tRNA gene evolution are not discussed in sufficient depth, and as early in the manuscript as is necessary. For instance, codon usage doesn't feature in the Results section until much later. So the experimental results seem puzzling until it is clear that the non-essential tRNA gene actually recognizes a codon that is very abundant in the genome. In the Discussion section (subsection “Retention of <italic>serCGA</italic> in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 wild type”), selection due to codon bias should be considered as a 4th hypothesis for the retention of tRNA(CGA) (perhaps in combination with hypotheses 1 or 3). Prior work also shows that tRNA modifications can alter the accuracy and efficiency of translation (Grosjean et al., 2010; Bjork and Hagervall, 2014; Manickam et al., 2015). These details are mentioned in passing, but deserve more prominence because they are really critical to set expectations and interpret the results. The focal tRNA species are expected to be modified by cmoAB; if the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain used here has this modification system, it could explain the observed results: modified tRNA(UGA) can compensate tRNA(CGA) function, whereas the other near cognate tRNAs cannot (it is unclear whether G-U wobble works when G is in the codon and U is in the anticodon). I suggest that the details about codon usage, gene copy numbers of all cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, and relevant modification systems should be presented and clearly discussed at the outset.</p><p>5) We agree that the increase in tRNA(UGA) levels probably drove the large duplications observed during evolution. However, there are some points of concern here.</p><p>a) Given that the deletions were large, it would be useful to be able to estimate the contribution of tRNA(UGA) to increased fitness. Does deleting the duplicated tRNA(UGA) in evolved isolates reduce fitness, and by how much?

Serine is one of the most toxic amino acids and it is possible that the reduction in growth rate in the deletion mutants are mainly due to this toxicity rather than a reduced translation rate, which would provide an alternative explanation for why the effect on growth is much smaller in minimal media. The proteose peptone 3 used in KB medium is high in serine (about 12% of total amino acids) suggesting that this might cause toxicity due to the inability of L-serine-deaminase to degrade excess serine after a reduction in ser-tRNA concentration. Addressing this in the final manuscript would make readers aware of this issue, even while pointing out that this explanation may be insufficient because adding a plasmid with the amplified tRNA increases fitness.</p><p>2) Related to this point, in rich media it has been seen that charging levels for serine tRNAs can be very low at below 10% although serine concentration is high (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016). This work is new to this reviewer, but this might be of interest to the authors and readers of the article.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57947.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider more of the literature on tRNA pool evolution and clarify how this study represents a significant advance. There has been much discussion of gene loss and duplication as key features (e.g. Withers et al., 2006; Wald and Margalit, 2014; Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015), and the resulting evolutionary flexibility of tRNA gene sets (e.g. Ikemura, 1985; Rocha, 2004; Higgs and Ran, 2008; Diwan et al., 2018). This paper provides experimental support for these ideas, arising from the deletion of a single bacterial tRNA gene. This is a valuable result, being the first such demonstration in bacteria. However (contrary to the projection in the manuscript), this is not an unexpected result, and is not sufficient to generalize broadly. The reported adaptation of YAMAT-seq to measure bacterial tRNAs is very useful. Prior models of tRNA gene set evolution have demonstrated the importance of codon usage bias for translation rate (e.g. Bulmer, 1991; Berg et al., 1997; Higgs and Ran, 2008).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we have re-written substantial portions of the manuscript, including the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion. Specifically:</p><p>1) The Introduction has been re-written to include a more comprehensive review of the literature on tRNA gene set evolution. It now includes a deeper analysis of factors that influence tRNA gene set evolution (including post-transcriptional modification pathways, and codon use; and the mechanisms of evolutionary change. The suggested references have been included, and we thank the reviewers for these useful suggestions.</p><p>2) The Abstract, final paragraph of the Introduction, and the final paragraph of the Discussion have been re-written to clarify the advances made in our study. In our opinion, the main advance provided by our work is the direct observation of the evolution of a tRNA gene set by the mechanism of gene duplication (Introduction). In this way, our work provides empirical support for a number of phylogenetic and computational studies that postulate gene duplication as a mechanism of bacterial tRNA gene set evolution (Tremblay-Savard et al., 2015; Wald and Margalit, 2014; Withers et al., 2006). We agree that our results alone are not sufficient to generalize about the prevalence of duplication events in tRNA gene set evolution, and have included this in our Discussion. A second advance provided by our work is the adaptation of YAMAT-seq for use in bacteria (Introduction). We are pleased that the reviewers think this is useful, and hope that it will aid others in their research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The initial model is overly simplistic and ignores much of the advances made in our understanding from prior work showing the importance of codon usage (see references above). The model does not explicitly include links between tRNA set and translation rate, and between translation rate and fitness; these are instead left as verbal arguments. Equation 1 is odd, because it suggests that codon B is translated by both alpha and beta (whereas only one tRNA can decode a codon at a time) and perhaps only works when alpha is limiting. The meaning of Equation 3 is unclear. The calculated translation times (Equation 4) should probably be clearly discussed as relative (not absolute) times. Finally, none of the model predictions are novel (see references above). Citing and discussing prior work may be sufficient to clearly set up the basic premise here (instead of the model), allowing a deeper focus on the experimental work.</p></disp-quote><p>The response to Essential revision point 3 (below) also contains information relevant to this point.</p><p>From the reviewers’ comments, we can see that our explanation of the initial model was unclear. For example, we did not intend to imply that a single codon is translated by more than one tRNA molecule at any given time; rather, in cases where a codon can be translated by more than one type of tRNA, the proportions of these tRNAs were added together to estimate the average time required to randomly sample a matching tRNA from the available pool (see also the summary provided in response to Essential revision 3). The initial model was indeed simple. It was intended as a null model demonstrating one simple point: translational speed is optimized by eliminating tRNA redundancy (in the absence of complicating factors). Hence, in cases where surplus tRNAs are retained (such as <italic>serCGA</italic> in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25), additional factors should be considered. An example factor – different translational efficiencies between codon-tRNA pairings – was provided by the extended model.</p><p>However, on reflection, we agree with the reviewers that the manuscript would benefit from reorganization to allow more focus on the main novelty of our study: the experimental work. As suggested, we have removed the initial modelling section, instead discussing more prior work in the Introduction (including work on the effects of codon use, links between tRNA set and translation rate, and links between translation rate and growth/fitness). The results now begin with a new section, “The <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 tRNA gene set”. This section covers the structure of the tRNA gene set, with emphasis on the seryl-tRNAs and codons that feature later in our work. A (re-written) modelling section appears at the end of the Results section, with the aim of providing a cohesive molecular explanation of the observed results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We are not convinced that a key assumption of the model is reasonable: &quot; the rate of translation by an anticodon-codon pair is determined solely by the proportion of the anticodon in the tRNA pool&quot;. I would think that the rate-limiting step in the translation of a codon is determined by the stochastic search for the cognate ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA+EF-Tu and GTP) to the A-site (Varenne et al., 1984). I cannot see that this is directly related to the proportion in the tRNA pool, but mainly to the concentration of each cognate ternary complex at steady-state. Reducing the concentration drastically by deleting a tRNA gene is likely to be limiting for growth, but this can be compensated for by increasing the concentration by a duplication. If the authors assume that competition with non-cognate and near-cognate ternary complexes are of major importance for the rate of translation of a codon this should be clearly stated. The authors find that tRNA proportions vary almost 100,000-fold; does this mean that translation rates are also expected to vary 100,000-fold and is there any experimental support for this? Please provide a clear explanation for why proportion of the anticodon in the tRNA pool is expected to be rate-limiting, supported by proper references.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments, together with those in Essential revision point 2, lead us to conclude that there is a miscommunication about how we envisage the translational system and effects of the observed mutations. To clarify our position we have written the following summary (including definitions, citations, and details of where the relevant information can now be found in the manuscript):</p><p>Summary</p><p>Ternary complexes versus the mature tRNA pool.</p><p>Prokaryotic translation consists of three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination (reviewed in Rodnina, 2018). The rate limiting step of elongation is the stochastic search for a ternary complex to match the codon occupying the ribosomal A site (Varenne et al., 1984). Ternary complexes consist of a mature tRNA, elongation factor EF-Tu, and GTP (Bensch et al., 1991). EF-Tu binds all types of mature tRNA with approximately equal affinity (Louie et al., 1984; Ott et al., 1990). Hence the composition of the ternary complex pool is expected to reflect that of the mature tRNA pool; proportions of mature tRNAs provide a barometer for ternary complex availability, and ultimately elongation speed. This information is now included in the Introduction and Results.</p><p>Competition between cognate and near-cognate tRNAs.</p><p>A codon-tRNA match is considered “cognate” when the first two bases of the codon form Watson-Crick base pairs with the tRNA anticodon <italic>and</italic> the third codon base forms either a Watson-Crick or wobble base pair (Plant et al., 2007). Hence, in our system, both tRNA-Ser(CGA) and tRNA-Ser(UGA) are considered to be cognate matches for codon UCG (and tRNA-Ser(UGA) is also a cognate match for codons UCA and UCU). This means that, while a single UCG codon is translated by a single tRNA molecule, stochastic sampling of either a tRNA-Ser(CGA) or tRNA-Ser(UGA) ternary complex is expected to result in translation. This is why the proportions of tRNA-Ser(CGA) and tRNA-Ser(UGA) are added together to estimate the average time required to match a UCG codon (Equation 2B) (this point may also help to clarify some parts of Essential revision point 2).</p><p>For simplicity, our model assumes that the two tRNA types translate UCG with equal efficiency. The possibility that UCG is translated more efficiently by tRNA-Ser(CGA) than tRNA-Ser(UGA) provides one reason why duplication of <italic>serTGA</italic> does not fully restore wild type fitness, and may contribute to the retention of <italic>serCGA</italic> in the wild type strain (as opposed to 2+ copies of <italic>serTGA</italic>) (Discussion). We have not referred to tRNA-Set(CGA) and tRNA-Ser(UGA) as being “in competition” for translating UCG because, in our view, they are better described as synergistic: the translational demand imposed by UCG codons is, presumably, shared between the two types. We have included a new section at the beginning of the Results (“<italic>The</italic> P. fluorescens <italic>SBW25 tRNA gene set</italic>”) in which we outline the codons, tRNAs, and matching patterns that are important for understanding the manuscript. This new section, together with the extended Introduction, aims to clarify these issues from the outset.</p><p>The effects of our mutations on translation.</p><p>As outlined above, UCG codons are expected to be translated by tRNA-Ser(CGA) or tRNA-Ser(UGA) in wild type <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25. Deletion of <italic>serCGA</italic> eliminates tRNA-Ser(CGA), presumably resulting in all UCG codons being translated by tRNA-Ser(UGA). Hence, in a <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutant, a lower proportion of ternary complexes match UCG, leading to an increase in the average time needed to stochastically sample a matching ternary complex (and ultimately slowing translation/growth). As the reviewers correctly surmise, the translational and selective pressure exerted on tRNA-Ser(UGA) by <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion can be relieved by elevating tRNA-Ser(UGA) levels, through increasing <italic>serTGA</italic> gene copy number. We have included this explanation in the final Results section and Discussion.</p><p>We appreciate that the original manuscript did not sufficiently lay out the relationship between UCG codons and tRNAs. We hope that the new organization and sections of the manuscript clarify these issues, and that the results of our experiments are now more intuitive.</p><p>The reviewers bring up some very good points regarding the YAMAT-seq measures. As they point out, the within-strain mature tRNA proportions measured by YAMAT-seq vary about 100,000 fold. Even after removing the three lowest tRNA proportions (which are thought to be affected by post-transcriptional modifications impeding the reverse transcription reaction), the variation in tRNA proportions exceeds reported variations in codon translation rates (Gardin et al., 2014). This highlights that, while the YAMAT-seq results provide a useful overview of the relative amounts of tRNAs in a mature tRNA pool, within-strain comparisons should be treated with caution. The real strength of the YAMAT-seq data lies in detecting differences in tRNA proportions across samples. In our case, this means detected the effects of <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion and subsequent <italic>serTGA</italic> duplication on the mature tRNA pool of SBW25. Hence, as the reviewers also point out in Essential revision point 2, interpretations of the YAMAT-seq data should focus on relative proportions (and, hence, relative translation times) across strains. We have altered the YAMAT-seq results and model section to reflect these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A number of factors relevant to understand translation rates and tRNA gene evolution are not discussed in sufficient depth, and as early in the manuscript as is necessary. For instance, codon usage doesn't feature in the Results section until much later. So the experimental results seem puzzling until it is clear that the non-essential tRNA gene actually recognizes a codon that is very abundant in the genome. In the Discussion section (subsection “Retention of serCGA in P. fluorescens SBW25 wild type”), selection due to codon bias should be considered as a 4th hypothesis for the retention of tRNA(CGA) (perhaps in combination with hypotheses 1 or 3). Prior work also shows that tRNA modifications can alter the accuracy and efficiency of translation (Grosjean et al., 2010; Bjork and Hagervall, 2014; Manickam et al., 2015). These details are mentioned in passing, but deserve more prominence because they are really critical to set expectations and interpret the results. The focal tRNA species are expected to be modified by cmoAB; if the Pseudomonas strain used here has this modification system, it could explain the observed results: modified tRNA(UGA) can compensate tRNA(CGA) function, whereas the other near cognate tRNAs cannot (it is unclear whether G-U wobble works when G is in the codon and U is in the anticodon). I suggest that the details about codon usage, gene copy numbers of all cognate and near-cognate tRNAs, and relevant modification systems should be presented and clearly discussed at the outset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and have changed the layout of the manuscript to ensure early and clear introduction of the suggest concepts and their relevance to our experimental system. Specifically:</p><p>1) We have outlined the role of codon-tRNA matching patterns (and, hence, post-transcriptional modification enzymes) and codon use in the Introduction.</p><p>2) We have written a new first Results section (“<italic>The</italic> P. fluorescens <italic>SBW25 tRNA gene set</italic>”) outlining the key elements of our experimental system, and the relationships between them (<italic>e.g.</italic>, seryl tRNA genes, serine codon use, codon matching patterns). We would like to thank the reviewers for the particularly helpful suggestions regarding the Cmo-mediated modification of tRNA-Ser(UGA), of which we were not previously aware.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We agree that the increase in tRNA(UGA) levels probably drove the large duplications observed during evolution. However, there are some points of concern here.</p><p>a) Given that the deletions were large, it would be useful to be able to estimate the contribution of tRNA(UGA) to increased fitness. Does deleting the duplicated tRNA(UGA) in evolved isolates reduce fitness, and by how much? Related to this, it was not clear whether there were any other mutations in the evolved lines, and their identity; e.g. were there any promoter mutations in the native copy of the tRNA(UGA) gene?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that deleting one <italic>serTGA</italic> copy would be a nice addition to our experiments, this particular genetic manipulation is unlikely to be successful. This is largely due to the instability of large-scale duplication fragments; similar fragments are lost at rates of 1 % in overnight culture (Anderson and Roth, 1977; Reams and Roth, 2015), and ongoing investigations indicate that our duplication fragments are no exception (unpublished data). Duplication fragment loss typically occurs via RecA-mediated, homologous recombination (Reams and Roth, 2015) – the same process that would hypothetically be harnessed during the genetic engineering process to replace a <italic>serTGA</italic> copy with a ~1 kb deletion fragment. Successfully targeting the ~100 bp <italic>serTGA</italic> without affecting the remainder of the ~45 kb duplication fragment is highly unlikely. Even in the event of successful manipulation, the desired engineered strain would be expected to quickly lose the remainder of the duplication fragment during growth (given that loss of duplication fragments occurs at high rates, and no selective advantage is expected in the absence of the second <italic>serTGA</italic> copy).</p><p>With the above in mind, we concentrated our resources on demonstrating that an increase in <italic>serTGA</italic> expression can indeed compensate for <italic>serCGA</italic> loss. Expression of <italic>serTGA</italic> from the pSXn plasmid improves growth of the <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutant and, importantly, does not affect the growth of the wild type strain (Figure 3C). This result is central to our work, because it provides empirical evidence that codon UCG actually can be translated by tRNA-Ser(UGA) (Figure 1B), and hence can compensate for tRNA-Ser(CGA) loss. However, we do agree with the reviewers that other genes within the 45 kb duplication fragment could still contribute via unknown mechanisms to the compensatory effect. To reflect this, we have amended the relevant Results section: “…the result that pSXn-based <italic>serTGA</italic> expression specifically improves the growth rate of ∆<italic>serCGA</italic> demonstrates that <italic>serTGA</italic> can provide a degree of compensation for <italic>serCGA</italic> loss. Other genes in the shared 45 kb fragment may nevertheless contribute to compensation, via unidentified mechanisms.”.</p><p>Regarding mutations other than the large-scale duplications: only one additional putative mutation was identified among the mutant isolates: M2-L contains a synonymous mutation in carbohydrate metabolism gene <italic>edd</italic> (in addition to carrying a 192 kb duplication fragment). This mutation is not expected to have major effects on our translational system because (i) it is a synonymous change to an arginine (<italic>i.e.</italic> not a serine) codon, resulting in no change to the Edd protein sequence, and (ii) it is not found in any other isolate, including M2-Lop that was isolated from the same population at the same time point. This information is now explicitly included in the Results. A number of intergenic differences in homopolymeric tracts and other repeats were called in all/most isolates (mutant and wild type); these have also been previously called in other, unrelated evolution experiments (<italic>i.e.</italic>, they are either mistakes in the published SBW25 genome sequence, or are present in our stored wild type strain) (Beaumont et al., 2009; Gallie et al., 2019). A comprehensive list of all differences called by <italic>breseq</italic> (Deatherage and Barrick, 2014) and Geneious (v11.1.4), and accompanying descriptions, is in Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) What is the level of overexpression of the tRNA gene on the plasmid (Figure 4)? If this is much more than the 2-fold increase due to gene duplication, it means that we do not know if a 2-fold increase is sufficient to increase fitness. On a related note, I could not see information on the sensitivity of the tRNA-seq method (I might have missed this); this is necessary to know how much confidence to place in the measured fold change values.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the pSXn plasmid: we do not know the exact level of expression from the pSXn plasmid. We can say that the inserted tRNA gene is placed under IPTG-inducible expression from a strong (<italic>tac</italic>) promoter (de Boer et al., 1983). We do not add IPTG at any stage of our experiments, meaning that we expect only low level, leaky expression from the repressed promoter (Owen and Ackerley, 2011). However, as the reviewers point out, this expression is likely to be higher than a two-fold increase. We have made this explicit in the interpretation of our results: “While it should be noted that tRNA-Ser(UGA) levels resulting from pSXn-based expression are likely to exceed those resulting from an additional chromosomal copy of <italic>serTGA</italic>, the result that pSXn-based <italic>serTGA</italic> expression specifically improves the growth rate of ∆<italic>serCGA</italic> demonstrates that <italic>serTGA</italic> can provide a degree of compensation for <italic>serCGA</italic> loss.”. We have also included more details on the plasmid, and construction process (new Materials and methods section “Expression of tRNA genes from the pSXn plasmid”).</p><p>To assist with interpreting the strength of the YAMAT-seq assay, we have provided more details (<italic>e.g.</italic>, raw read numbers, the numbers of reads aligning to each tRNA types) within the main text (Results) and Materials and methods. Here, we would like to highlight the considerable weight of the YAMAT-seq data. Firstly, this is a large data set that is consistent across replicates; each of the nine strains were assayed in three biological replicates, and no major differences were seen between tRNA proportions in among replicates (Supplementary file 7). Secondly, a robust statistical analysis that corrects for multiple comparisons was employed to detect differences in relative tRNA expression levels between strains (DESeq2; Anders and Huber, 2010; Love et al., 2014). Importantly, DESeq2 control comparisons revealed no significant differences in tRNA expression levels (<italic>i.e.</italic>, no differences were detected between SBW25 and the Day 13 wild type lineage isolate, or between the two biological replicates of the <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion strain; Figures 5A, 5B). Thirdly, the differences detected were consistent: <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion results in (permanent) loss of tRNA-Ser(CGA), and a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) was the only consistently significant difference upon duplication of <italic>serTGA</italic>. Overall, we have confidence in the differences detected in tRNA expression levels between strains. To what extent smaller changes are not detected as significant, we cannot currently say.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Please specify your assumption that all tRNAs are fully charged, maybe with reference that this is not always the case and description of what YAMAT-Seq measures.

These studies collectively report that in nutrient poor media, all tRNA species are fairly uniformly charged at ~60-90 %. However, during exponential growth in rich medium (LB), charging levels are reported to vary considerably between tRNA species (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016). In particular, the four seryl-tRNAs were reported to show very low charging levels (~10 %) under these conditions (see their Figure 1A).</p><p>We find this result somewhat surprising. Uncharged tRNAs interact with RelA, a ribosome-associated protein that brings uncharged tRNAs to the ribosomal A site (Winther et al., 2018). In this respect, uncharged tRNAs compete with charged tRNAs (in the form of ternary complexes) for occupation of the ribosomal A site; uncharged tRNAs slow elongation or, at higher levels, activate the stringent response (Goldman and Jakubowski, 1990). The stringent response involves a global shift in gene expression, ultimately resulting in slower growth and division (reviewed in Hauryliuk et al., 2015). In light of the need for rapid growth and division, it seems counterintuitive that uncharged tRNAs would exist in high proportions during exponential growth in rich medium. While Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al. do not discuss the low seryl-tRNA charging levels with respect to the stringent response, we note that <italic>E. coli</italic> MC4100 – the strain in which the majority of their measurements were made – carries the <italic>relA1</italic> mutation, which effectively eliminates uncharged tRNA-based activation of the strignent response (Metzger et al., 1989).</p><p>Clearly, a charging rate of only 10 % would violate our assumption that all mature seryl-tRNAs are charged. Reassuringly however, under rapid growth conditions all within-family tRNA types (<italic>i.e.</italic>, those carrying the same amino acid) show similar charging levels under all conditions measured so far (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016; Dittmar et al., 2005). If similar, consistently low charging levels exist for SBW25 seryl-tRNAs during YAMAT-seq, our general conclusions are expected to hold given that the model uses only seryl-tRNA proportions (which, if flawed, are presumably consistently so) to estimate elongation times.</p><p>We have added an explicit statement of our assumption and its limitations that all tRNAs are charged in the model section of the Results, and outlined why this is a limitation of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The focus on serine is potentially problematic. Serine is one of the most toxic amino acids and it is possible that the reduction in growth rate in the deletion mutants are mainly due to this toxicity rather than a reduced translation rate, which would provide an alternative explanation for why the effect on growth is much smaller in minimal media. The proteose peptone 3 used in KB medium is high in serine (about 12% of total amino acids) suggesting that this might cause toxicity due to the inability of L-serine-deaminase to degrade excess serine after a reduction in ser-tRNA concentration. Addressing this in the final manuscript would make readers aware of this issue, even while pointing out that this explanation may be insufficient because adding a plasmid with the amplified tRNA increases fitness.</p></disp-quote><p>If we have understood correctly, the reviewers are suggesting that <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion may cause an increase in free intracellular serine, the toxicity of which could become problematic in the presence of high amounts of extracellular serine. This could provide an alternative explanation for why the ∆<italic>serCGA</italic> growth defect is seen in KB (serine rich) and not M9 (serine poor) medium. The toxicity of serine is an aspect of our work that we had not fully considered, and we thank the reviewers for the suggestion.</p><p>On consideration, we think that while serine toxicity may contribute to the growth defect in KB medium, it is unlikely to account for the entire effect. This is due to three reasons:</p><p>1) Excess serine is highly toxic and thus tightly regulated (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016; Kriner and Subramaniam, 2019). Studies of the three L-serine deaminases in <italic>E. coli</italic> show Michaelis constants (Km) in the millimolar range (Burman et al., 2004; Cicchillo et al., 2004), meaning that these L-serine deaminases have a high affinity for L-serine. This is consistent with L-serine deaminases playing a role in preventing serine excess (Zhang and Newman, 2008). Indeed, serine is depleted from rich medium much more rapidly than any other amino acid during bacterial growth (Zhang et al., 2010).</p><p>Like <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 is predicted to encode three L-serine deaminases (<italic>sdaA1/pflu1035, tdcG/pflu4898, sdaA2/pflu5679</italic>), and a transmembrane L-serine transporter (<italic>sdaC/pflu1034</italic>). Hence, SBW25 seems adequately equipped to deal with the (presumably relatively small) amounts of excess serine that may be produced upon the elimination of tRNA-Ser(CGA), a tRNA that accounts for ~1.5 % of the SBW25 tRNA pool (see Supplementary file 7). Notably, none of the L-serine deaminases or the serine transporter are found within any of the duplication fragments (see Supplementary file 4).</p><p>2) While serine is indeed toxic for <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is possible to delete all three genes encoding L-serine deaminases and grow the triple mutant in serine rich medium (Zhang and Newman, 2008). Cells of the triple mutant grown in this manner are deformed during the early stages of growth, indicating effects of serine accumulation on cell growth and division (Zhang et al., 2010; Zhang and Newman, 2008). The misshapen cells have been proposed to result from problematic cell wall synthesis, possibly through the mis-incorporation of serine in the place of alanine in peptidoglycan (Parveen and Reddy, 2017).</p><p>We have grown <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 and our <italic>serCGA</italic> deletion mutants in serine rich (KB) and poor (M9) media, and compared cell phenotypes at various stages of growth (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We have seen some intriguing cell phenotypes that we plan to investigate further – namely, very elongated long cells in the ∆<italic>serCGA</italic> mutants during growth in KB. However, these phenotypes differ from those reported by Zhang et al. for high-level serine toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Zhang and Newman, 2008).</p><p>3) Finally, recent experiments in our laboratory have shown broadly similar results to those reported here with a second, non-seryl tRNA type. Reduction of this second (glycyl) tRNA type leads to a fitness defect that is compensated by large, tRNA-encompassing duplications in a distinct region of the SBW25 chromosome. While the new work is preliminary and ongoing, it strongly indicates that our results are not limited to seryl-tRNAs.</p><p>To summarize: due to the combination of the three reasons above, we think it unlikely that serine toxicity is the primary cause of the ∆<italic>serCGA</italic> fitness defect in KB medium. However, serine toxicity may of course still contribute to the observed phenotypes. To reflect this development, we have included a figure of the cell morphologies (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and a new paragraph in the relevant Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to this point, in rich media it has been seen that charging levels for serine tRNAs can be very low at below 10% although serine concentration is high (Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016). This work is new to this reviewer, but this might be of interest to the authors and readers of the article.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this article to our attention!
