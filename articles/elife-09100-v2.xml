cytoplasm and the nucleus. NF-κB, which plays key roles in inflammation and cancer, displays oscillations whose biological advantage remains unclear. Recent work indicated that NF-κB displays sustained oscillations that can be entrained, that is, reach a persistent synchronized state through small periodic perturbations. We show here that for our GFP-p65 knock-in cells NF-κB behaves as a damped oscillator able to synchronize to a variety of periodic external perturbations with no memory. We imposed synchronous dynamics to prove that transcription of NF-κB-controlled genes also oscillates, but mature transcript levels follow three distinct patterns. Two sets of transcripts accumulate fast or slowly, respectively. Another set, comprising chemokine and chemokine receptor mRNAs, oscillates and resets at each new stimulus, with no memory of the past. We propose that TF oscillatory dynamics is a means of segmenting time to provide renewing opportunity windows for decision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09100.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09100.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09100.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The process of producing useful biological molecules from genes – known as gene expression – is not always simple. Many genes are part of complex circuits, some of which show regular patterns of activity in response to an environmental cue. For example, the expression of some genes is tied to the 24-hour daily cycle of light and dark.</p><p>Transcription factors are proteins that control gene activation and expression, and some transcription factors periodically move in and out of the cell’s nucleus – the compartment of an animal cell that houses the vast majority of the genetic material. This behavior is known as oscillation. A transcription factor called NF-κB oscillates, changing between an inactive form outside of the nucleus and an active form inside. NF-κB plays important roles in inflammation and cancer, and is activated by cues from outside the cell. Some of the genes that the active form of NF-κB activates then produce molecules that inactivate NF-κB, thus helping to establish the oscillations.</p><p>The benefits of the oscillations are not clear. However, recent studies suggest that environmental cues can cause small perturbations that gradually adjust the rate at which the oscillations occur, and in doing so, synchronize the oscillations amongst neighboring cells.</p><p>By using embryo cells from genetically engineered mice, Zambrano et al. investigated how NF-κB oscillations get synchronized. The experiments showed that the activity of the NF-κB protein and the expression of the genes it controls synchronize across neighboring cells whenever the external environmental perturbations come in pulses. However, once the pulsed cues stop, this synchronization is quickly lost. In essence, the cells reset after each environmental cue with no memory of previous episodes of NF-κB activity.</p><p>Further work revealed that the expression of the genes controlled by NF-κB also cycles and resets with each new environmental cue. However, the products of these genes accumulate in three different ways. Some accumulate quickly; some accumulate at a slow and steady pace; and some oscillate in amount, and this amount resets once the environmental cue has stopped. Each of these classes of gene products can be related to specific cell behaviors that activate sequentially on well-defined time schedules.</p><p>Overall, Zambrano et al. suggest that the ability of NF-κB to reset its activity with each new environmental cue gives cells the opportunity to pause and adjust course.</p><p>Zambrano et al. now plan to explore what happens to NF-κB synchronization in different cell types exposed to a collection of inflammatory stimuli. Along the same line, it will be worth exploring NF-κB behavior in cancer cells, where NF-κB activity is often out of control and drives unrestrained cell proliferation. These studies would contribute to a deeper understanding of cancer biology and to the identification of new treatments for the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09100.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09100.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synchronous oscillations</kwd><kwd>NF-kappaB</kwd><kwd>TNF-alpha</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>mathematical modelling</kwd><kwd>single-cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Marie Curie Action 2011</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>298447-NonLinKB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zambrano</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intra European Fellowships</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCA-2011-298447NonLinKB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zambrano</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AIRC2010/2013 project R0444</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bianchi</surname><given-names>Marco E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flagship program EPIGEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bianchi</surname><given-names>Marco E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NF-κB oscillations synchronize to external perturbations as a damped oscillator, producing different transcription dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic circuits are instrumental for cells to provide adequate transcriptional responses to different external and internal stimuli, but we are still far from a complete understanding of how they work. The growing availability of single-cell measurements is bringing unprecedented insights into the dynamics of transcriptional responses: although it was traditionally thought that gene circuits should provide a temporally stable response to constant external stimuli, there is increasing evidence that the dynamics of gene circuits is more elaborate, and is often characterized by pulses of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine et al., 2013</xref>). A special case is oscillatory dynamics, in which the activity of some element in the genetic circuit varies periodically, and so does the output of the circuit. Paradigmatic oscillatory dynamics are associated with circadian clocks, which are present in a wide variety of organisms that synchronize their activities to the periodic variation in external daylight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>). However, oscillatory dynamics with periods far shorter than 24 hr have been reported in genetic circuits of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suel et al., 2007</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shankaran et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The dynamics of transcription factors in gene circuits can play a key role in information transmission through biochemical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</xref>) by selectively modulating the expression of different genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</xref>). A paradigmatic example is how different p53 dynamics can selectively activate transcriptional programs that commit the cell to different cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purvis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A property of free oscillating systems (or <italic>free oscillators</italic>, as analogy to simple mechanical oscillators such as the pendulum) is <italic>entrainment</italic>, by which an oscillator can gradually modulate its phase and frequency thanks to a small perturbation (<italic>forcing</italic>) that is itself periodic and oscillating with a period resonant with the intrinsic period of the oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pikovsky et al., 2003</xref>). A common forcing can also lead to the synchronous dynamics of multiple oscillators and thus to collective dynamical states. Entrainment was successfully reproduced in synthetic genetic oscillators, in which single bacterial cells (each expressing a fluorescent reporter protein in response to a synthetic genetic circuit) were entrained collectively to an oscillating provision of arabinose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mondragon-Palomino et al., 2011</xref>). The forcing to one oscillator can also be provided by other oscillators, and this coupling can lead to the emergence of different collective dynamical states characterized by different synchronous dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pikovsky et al., 2003</xref>). Inter-cellular coupling has indeed been exploited to genetically engineer synchronous quorum sensing genetic oscillators in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danino et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, intra-cellular coupling leads to locked oscillatory states for different cell oscillators, as recently shown for the circadian rhythm and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieler et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, NF-κB is a typical transcription factor that displays intrinsic oscillatory behavior. NF-κB plays key roles in inflammation, immune responses, development and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaturvedi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh and Hayden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ledoux and Perkins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Naugler and Karin, 2008</xref>). Strictly speaking, NF-κB is a family of dimers encoded by 5 different genes, but in what follows we will refer to p65/RELA independently of the dimer it forms. In resting cells, p65 exists mostly within a cytoplasmic complex bound to the IκB inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). Inflammatory signals like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce phosphorylation of IκB proteins by IKKs–upstream kinases in the signaling pathway–, ubiquitination and degradation of IκBs, and the release of active NF-κB that translocates into the nucleus to activate the expression of several genes, including those encoding for the IκB inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). Re-expression of IκBs contributes to relocate NF-κB in the cytoplasm, which is an inhibitory feedback loop for the system. A second feedback loop is centred on the protein A20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>), which upon activation of the system inhibits the IKKs. Thus, these two layers provide a nonredundant regulation of NF-κB response to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werner et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, the IκB inhibitors also show variable sensitivity to different stimuli and respond on different timescales to fine-tune the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paszek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shih et al., 2009</xref>). This system of negative feedback loops (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> upper panel) provides both a tight control of the response to external stimuli and flexibility. As a consequence of this complex wiring, upon constant stimulation the nuclear concentration of NF-κB in each cell oscillates with heterogeneous dynamics according to each cell’s susceptibility and to the inherent stochasticity of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). Due to such asynchrony at the single cell level, the NF-κB response appears almost non-oscillating at the cell population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>), and it is difficult to correlate NF-κB oscillatory profiles with gene expression outputs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09100.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Periodic forcing turns damped heterogeneous oscillation into synchronous sustained oscillations.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) The activity of NF-κB is regulated through different negative feedbacks provided by the inhibitors IκB and A20.

White’s group showed that short trains of TNF-α pulses produce rounds of synchronous NF-κB translocation; the stimulation frequency affected both the translocation amplitude and gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>). A study performed while the present one was in progress indicated that entrainment of NF-κB oscillations at population level arises when 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP-p65 are perturbed with regular trains of sawtooth-like profiles of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>). Here, we used GFP-p65 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from knock-in mice and thus expressing physiological levels of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Lorenzi et al., 2009</xref>). Using a microfluidic device, we exposed cells to well-defined, periodic TNF-α stimuli, and eliminated continuously both catabolites produced by the cells and secreted proteins, which might generate a secondary autocrine/paracrine response. We find that GFP-p65 MEFs lock their NF-κB oscillations to the periodic external signal, and become synchronized. However, the 1:1 locking is maintained over a wide variety of frequencies of the driving TNF-α stimulus, does not improve over repeated stimulation and actually disappears fast when the external stimulus ceases, all of which suggest that entrainment is not achieved. The mathematical model we developed indeed suggests that NF-κB can behave as a damped oscillator, analogous to a mechanical damped harmonic oscillator; damped oscillators do not entrain but follow external forcing while it is present. Taking advantage of the fact that GFP-p65 MEFs under periodic stimulation behave as a synchronous population, we analyzed the transcriptional output at genome-wide level. We find that one single NF-κB dynamics translates into 3 different dynamics of transcriptional regulation, all of which can be reproduced by our mathematical model; the key discriminator is the parameter representing mRNA degradation. Furthermore, the three dynamical patterns correspond to specific functions, which suggests that group of genes were positively selected by evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Periodic forcing turns heterogeneous NF-κB oscillations into synchronous oscillations</title><p>To characterize the response of the NF-κB oscillatory system to different external stimuli, we made use of GFP-p65 knock-in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Lorenzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>) cultured in a microfluidic device to control precisely the concentration and timing of the TNF-α stimulation (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Although this measure implies a partial segmentation of the cytoplasm and thus is more elaborate than the background-corrected mean nuclear intensity used recently by different authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung et al., 2014</xref>) it is a ratio of intensities and thus it self-corrects for changes in image intensity in our experimental settings (see e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> or <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Furthermore, provided that the total amount of p65 is constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>), NCI(t) is a monotonic function of nuclear NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9B</xref>) so that oscillations are observed in the former if and only if they are present in the latter (further details in Materials and methods). Finally, a rigorous description of the observed dynamics was achieved through the automatic identification of statistically significant peaks (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>The timing between two consecutive peaks is the experimental period T<sub>exp</sub>. T<sub>exp</sub> has a distribution with a maximum at 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which is the approximate intrinsic period reported for NF-κB oscillations that we called T<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). As observed for static stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>), the observed oscillations are very heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and asynchronous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, the variety of behaviors observed, including non-oscillating cells, is compatible with the dynamics observed in the same cells for static culture conditions, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). Similar behaviors are found in the absence of nuclear staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9C</xref>), which led us to conclude that imaging conditions do not interfere with NF-κB signaling.</p><p>The tail in the period distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the observed average of four peaks in 12 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), instead of the expected eight, indicate that in our cells the heterogeneous oscillations are damped and tend to converge to an equilibrium state under stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, although oscillatory peaks are observed for most of the cells, they are infrequent and irregular for times beyond 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) as previously reported for the same cells in static conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). Hence, we describe here these heterogeneous oscillations as <italic>damped</italic> in contrast with the <italic>sustained</italic> oscillations, which continue regularly and unabated for a very long time in continuously stimulated cells, see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Damped oscillations can easily emerge in the NF-κB genetic circuit. Indeed, a minimal deterministic model that takes into account the basic elements of the NF-κB genetic circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zambrano et al., 2014b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, see Materials and methods for a complete description of the model) shows that different combinations of the parameters can lead to different dynamics. The model parameters that we used for our explorations are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. We denote as P<sub>S</sub> those specifying the external signal and as P<sub>NF-κB</sub> those used to model the double IκB and A20 negative feedback; in our explorations, we allow them to vary differently depending on the associated uncertainty about their values (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We generated a library of randomized parameters and found that the system presents a fixed point whose stability changes depending on the parameters (details on the stability analysis are found in the Materials and methods section). The vast majority of parameter combinations give rise to damped oscillations (when all the eigenvalues have all negative real parts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). A smaller fraction of parameter combinations give rise to trajectories that converge to a stable limit cycle around the unstable fixed points (so certain eigenvalues have positive real parts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Interestingly, parameters for oscillating and non-oscillating cells are in similar intervals suggesting that it is the precise combination of the parameters, rather than a single one, what determines the resulting dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Our simulations might also explain why other researchers found continuous periodic oscillations with T<sub>0</sub> = 90 min under a constant flow of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>, and see Discussion) and the variety of damped oscillatory dynamics upon LPS recently reported for fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). Our exploration shows further how variations of the parameters can give rise to a variety of dynamics that reflects what we find in an isogenic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Considering the heterogeneity of dynamics, to better visualize the collective oscillatory state of the population in each condition, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mondragon-Palomino et al., 2011</xref>, we computed and represented the phase of the oscillation ϕ(t) for each cell by detecting peaks and setting ϕ=0 (2π) at the maximum of each peak and ϕ(t)=π in the minimum between two peaks (phase plots for the green time series are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B,C</xref>.

Thus, oscillatory peaks can be easily observed. In the phase plot, the first response to constant TNF-α right after t=0 hr is synchronous in the population, but this synchrony is quickly lost, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the response of the NF-κB oscillator to perturbations in the cell’s environment, we switched periodically the stimulus concentration in the culture chambers in the microfluidics apparatus.

Peaks are present in all the forcing cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>) and synchronous, in contrast to the asynchronous peaks observed in constantly stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

This is also evident from single-cell NCI traces and from the peaks detected in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> respectively). Indeed, only for T<sub>f</sub>=45 min we observed small peaks after the last cycle of the forcing, but these peaks are on average 90 min away from the last forced peak, and correspond to the intrinsic oscillatory period of our oscillator.

However, we found that our cells can actually be synchronized under periodic stimulations with T<sub>f</sub>=60 min (T<sub>1</sub> =T<sub>2</sub> =30 min) when D<sub>1</sub> =10 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>) and D<sub>2</sub> =0 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we found that synchrony is still visible for D<sub>2</sub>&gt;0 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), as we had observed for other stimulation periods. The difference might arise from the fact that we use a forcing different from the sawtooth-like TNF-α profile used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</xref>, which is obtained by periodically and quickly replacing the medium in contact with the cells with fresh TNF-α. The sawtooth concentration profile is assumed to arise due to a clearance process of TNF-α by degradation and internalization. We then applied sawtooth forcing to our cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Cells lock their oscillations to the sawtooth forcing of periods T<sub>f</sub>=60 min and T<sub>f</sub>=90 min at the doses considered. Interestingly, the synchronization is lost for T<sub>f</sub>=180, suggesting that autocrine-paracrine signalling might introduce a distortion in the cell environment, which is reduced when the medium is changed more frequently. Alternatively, the different geometry of our microfluidic with respect to the one used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</xref> might lead to a slower TNF-α degradation and produce profiles closer to static concentration than to oscillatory stimulation. The profiles observed are indeed similar to some of the dynamics observed for alternating doses of TNF-α with D<sub>2</sub>&gt;0 ng/ml, such as those for T<sub>f</sub>=60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), T<sub>f</sub>=90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and T<sub>f</sub>=180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), with compatible values of η.

Rather, it is similar to that of simple mechanical damped oscillators, such as the damped harmonic oscillator, which after a perturbation tend to relax to an equilibrium state. When these mechanical systems are challenged with an external periodic forcing, the period of the oscillations tends to match the period of the forcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pikovsky et al., 2003</xref>). In fact, our minimal mathematical model of the NF-κB circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) reproduces damped oscillations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B,D</xref>). In these conditions, the period of the periodically forced system converges to the period of the forcing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of note, the model reproduces the small peaks appearing between two forcing cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), similar to the small peaks that we observed for the same forcing as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>When behaving as a damped oscillator, the NF-κB system is well suited to quickly synchronize its oscillatory period to input signals of a wide variety of timescales. This is probably a desired feature for a system that underlies responses to environmental challenges, which do not come with a particular periodicity. This is the reverse of what might be desirable for circadian clocks, whose design should privilege the entrainment to the 24-hr light/darkness period. To understand how the oscillatory pattern of NF-κB affects its biological output, we focused on the transcription dynamics of genes controlled by NF-κB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synchronous NF-κB dynamics reveal different patterns of gene expression</title><p>The heterogeneity of NF-κB dynamics in the cell population under constant stimulation makes it difficult to establish a direct correspondence between NF-κB activity and transcription.

Mature transcripts of the early gene IκBα follow the oscillatory dynamics, show transcription-coordinated splicing and do not accumulate after stimulus wash-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Furthermore, synchronization among cells does not improve upon repeated forcing (“training”), and single cells trained for a dozen forcing cycles stop oscillating and dephase (“forget”) as fast as cells stimulated only once. Finally, cells can be synchronized with a wide variety of forcing periods and forcing amplitudes, and synchronize to the external forcing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref> right, green lines) without showing any preference for periods resonating with the NF-κB intrinsic period of 90 min; synchronization is more pronounced with high than with low stimulation amplitude.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09100.047</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>NF-κB behaves as a damped oscillator that can synchronize to time-varying external stimuli to produce functionally related transcriptional outputs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The NF-κB system is able to provide different responses to different inputs, from constant (left) to time-varying ones (right).

Simulations with our mathematical model can actually reproduce the ability of the system to synchronize to different forcing periods. The ability of our cells to synchronize to a 60 min periodic forcing points in the same direction.</p><p>Thus, we find that our GFP-p65 knock-in cells are not entrained, as do not satisfy the essential precondition – sustained oscillations – and two critical tests for entrainment – increasing synchronization upon repeated forcing, and synchronization to the natural frequency of the internal oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pikovsky et al., 2003</xref>). Our cells appear closer to the classical textbook example of a damped harmonic oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>), whose frequency corresponds to the frequency of the external stimulation, and whose synchronization to the external stimulus increase monotonically with stimulus amplitude.</p><p>We interpret the damped oscillator behaviour of the NF-κB system as an intrinsic characteristic of the NF-κB system which allows it to adapt to a wide variety of inputs and to quickly reset. In fact, pathogens and inflammatory signals do not come in regular periodic patterns, and a carefully calibrated inflammatory response that would adapt itself to any irregular pattern of stimulation would be positively selected for.</p><p>We explored our minimal mathematical model to understand why we observed damped oscillations whereas Kellogg and Tay observed sustained oscillations under constant stimulation, a behaviour that presumably is the root of the different synchronization mechanisms observed. Our simulations suggest that sustained oscillations would not be the norm, but rather the result of a specific set of parameters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Indeed, the NF-κB network has an equilibrium that depending on the combinations of parameters can be stable, giving rise to damped oscillations that converge to it, or unstable, giving rise to a stable cycle around it (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left, magenta line); transitions between these two states can be mediated by a Hopf bifurcation.</p><p>The simulations performed with our simple model can thus reconcile our experimental observations with the detection of sustained oscillations for different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>), but also with the rich variety of damped oscillatory dynamics reported for other cell types in recent works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). Other theoretical analyses have identified the amount of NF-κB expressed by a specific cell as the determinant of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mothes et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we used cells with physiological and uniform p65 levels. We also note that the interplay between different feedback loops, including the A20 feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werner et al., 2008</xref>) can vary between cell types, leading to different degrees of dampening, as observed experimentally by selective knock-outs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>); dissecting the contribution of each of these feedbacks will be the subject of future experimental and theoretical work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Oscillations in the nuclear concentration of NF-κB lead to different dynamical patterns of gene expression</title><p>The oscillatory behaviour of NF-κB consists in periodic relocalization between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and entails corresponding cycles of NF-κB binding to cognate binding sites in the genome. Thus, NF-κB driven transcription should be pulsatile as well, and in fact we detect cycles in the levels of elongating transcripts in the prototypical early and late NF-κB-controlled genes IkBα and Ccl5. However, whereas mature mRNA oscillates for IκBα, it slowly accumulates for the late gene Ccl5, and this held true for different frequencies of the periodic stimulation. Genome-wide analysis of dynamics, using unsupervised clustering of whole transcriptome profiles, identified six highly homogeneous sets (“clusters”), three containing genes with increasing transcription and three containing genes with decreasing transcription. While the genes with increasing transcription are predicted NF-κB targets, those in the decreasing sets are not.</p><p>The train of p65 nuclear translocations is thus decoded by the cell into different transcriptional dynamics: genes in Cluster 1 display a clear and sustained oscillation in transcript level; instead, transcripts for genes in Clusters 2 and 3 accumulate fast or increase slowly and steadily over many cycles of NF-κB oscillations, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The result is that each new wave of TNF-α elicits on Cluster 1 genes almost the same responses as the previous waves, and no memory is kept of the past; the expression of genes of Clusters 2 and 3 allows a long-lasting response that integrates over time the responses to previous waves.</p><p>All three dynamics of genes with increased expression could be reproduced by our minimal mathematical model of transcription, which incorporates the features of the paradigmatic telegraph model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suter et al., 2011</xref>). Our model also suggests that mRNA degradation is the key parameter that allows a functional and temporal shaping of the NF-κB response, in particular for transcripts in Cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>, top-left panel). The computational results fit well with the fast turnover of early transcripts, whose degradation depends on positive regulators like Zfp36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rabani et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, Zfp36 is in Cluster 1, and oscillates sharply and synchronously with the forcing; this might contribute further to the shaping of peaked responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Oscillatory dynamics and functionally related patterns of gene expression: an adaptive viewpoint</title><p>Overall, our most remarkable finding is that NF-κB oscillations drive the expression of distinct sets of genes whose expression dynamics and functions correlate: the transcripts that oscillate encode mostly cytokines and cytokine receptors, the ones that rise fast and decrease slowly encode proteins involved in immunity, and the ones that rise steadily encode proteins involved in the rearrangement of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>While steady-rise and rise/decline programs of gene expression can be operated by non-oscillatory transcription factors, oscillating transcription programs can be best achieved with oscillating transcription factors. We note that the transcripts that oscillate are involved in the decision of cells of whether to move or not, which has to be refreshed repeatedly over time. The oscillatory dynamics of NF-κB allows time to be segmented in units of 90 min cycles, with the option to resume chemokine-directed migration after each single cycle. As seen from this perspective, the operation of the NF-κB system as a damped, fast-detuning oscillator implies that in the presence of constant stimulation each motile cell will decide for itself, without synchrony to nearby cells. In contrast, in a situation where stimuli change over time beyond a certain threshold – at least three-fold variation in amplitude – cells would be broadly coordinated. Uncoordinated movement may maximize the volume randomly patrolled by cells, while coordinated movement may be optimal to reach a specific target location.</p><p>We thus speculate that NF-κB oscillations may have adaptive value in achieving oscillatory expression of genes involved in movement and direction, and the cells’ decision between uncoordinated or collective action. In conclusion, we suggest that the oscillatory dynamics of NF-κB (and other transcription factors) is a means of segmenting time to provide opportunity windows for decision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Please note that this section contains both technical details and supplemental information explaining the rationale behind our experimental approaches.

Time-lapse images were acquired at 6 min intervals for more than 15 hr. We used a low magnification objective (20x, 0.5 NA) and an open pinhole (Airy 3), ensuring that the image depth (10.7 µm) contains the thickness of the whole cell so that images are a record of the total cell fluorescence. GFP-p65 is imaged with the 488 nm Argon laser (GFP channel) while Hoechst 33342 stained nuclei are imaged with the low energy 405 nm UV diode laser at 5% of its maximum intensity (HOE channel). Images were acquired as 16 bit, 1024×1024, TIFF files.

Hence different controls were performed to exclude distortions of the natural signalling in our imaging conditions.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Apoptosis and cell death</title><p>We noticed that cells under a constant flow of fresh medium do not display apoptotic events until very late in the experiments (10–12 hr; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Importantly, unstimulated cells are viable and undergo mitosis despite the presence of low serum concentration (0.1% FCS). In contrast, cells receiving a constant flow of TNF in the absence of Hoechst and UV imaging undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), with a frequency that is proportional to the TNF concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). The imaging fields contain detectable apoptotic cells after 3, between 6 and 9 or after 12 hr of stimulation with 10, 1 or 0.1 ng/ml of TNF, respectively. This suggests that cell death observed in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> was due to the continuous flow of 10 ng/ml TNF-α and not due to the imaging conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Photo-damage</title><p>The cells were either imaged for 15 hr in the presence of Hoechst or left without Hoechst and not imaged; we then immunostained cells to detect thymine dimers formation. Immunostaining intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) are extremely low in cells exposed to Hoechst and imaging, especially when compared to cells exposed to UVC radiation. This suggests that imaging does not produce thymine dimers or that thymine dimers are repaired fast and do not accumulate in the cells.</p><p>To further exclude the possibility of DNA damage, we checked for the presence of gammaH2AX, which is a marker for early DNA repair after formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turinetto and Giachino, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and late DNA repair after the formation of UV-induced thymine dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staszewski et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Again, the signal for gammaH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>) is extremely low in imaged cells, when compared to the signal from cells treated with doxorubicin, which induces DSBs. Of note, the phosphorylated form of H2AX is found at DNA polymerase stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turinetto and Giachino, 2015</xref>) as marker of replicative stress. This observation may explain the minimal signal present in some of the imaged cells.

Manual segmentation of nuclei is simple when nuclei are either empty or full of p65, but becomes unreliable when concentrations in nucleus and cytoplasm are similar. Despite this caveat, we found a good qualitative agreement of dynamics in unstained/non-imaged cells with the heterogeneous but damped oscillatory dynamics observed under Hoechst/UV imaging conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>.

Each passage will be then thoroughly described in the next paragraphs.</p><p>The dynamics were quantified by computing the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of the intensities (NCI) of single cells, which is a measure robust against distortions and reflects faithfully the oscillations in the nuclear concentration of NF-κB oscillatory dynamics. This holds true provided that the total amount of p65 is constant, as we show for our cells under stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>), and is also assumed by mathematical models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al (2002)</xref> and the more recent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</xref>). Interestingly, p65 is not constant in macrophages stimulated with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sung et al., 2014</xref>). The analysis of time series relies on the detection of significant peaks, performed following our previously discussed procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>) that allows to distinguish significant peaks from noisy peaks. Once peaks are detected we assign them a phase: 2π for the “maxima” and π for the “minima” between peaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Selection of the quantifier of NF-κB dynamics</title><p>In order to assess the oscillations for a larger number of cells, we optimized our software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>) to calculate the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of the intensity (NCI) of NF-κB signal for hundreds of cells; NCI is a quantifier that has been used by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). As we argue below, thanks to the fact that the total amount of NF-κB is constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>), NCI depends univocally and monotonically on the nuclear amount of NF-κB. More importantly, due to the fact that it is a ratio of intensities, it is robust and independent of slight changes in the focus and in the laser intensity, among other possible experimental distortions, which are observed in our setup. The same rationale brought us to use ratios of intensities in our previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zambrano et al., 2014b</xref>).

However the numerator and denominator of this ratio can fluctuate due to biological reasons and this might blur the existence of oscillations in the nuclear amount of NF-κB. But this is not the case, due to the fact that the total amount of NF-κB is constant for our stimulated fibroblasts.

frames. As argued previously, this is not the case in our setting and that’s the reason why we preferred to use NCI.</p><p>Finally, variations in the areas of the nucleus and the cytoplasm might introduce small distortions, although they typically vary seldom and slowly. Notice though that our software discards cells for which the areas change abruptly, which typically is an indicator of imminent mitosis or cell death. We cannot totally exclude variations of p65 at single cell level, provided that we measured it using a population assay; however, p65 turnover is known to be long, so its slow variation would contribute with a small term in the derivative and thus would just slightly distort the times for which peaks in NCI appear compared to those of the nuclear concentration. To conclude, we think that NCI would still capture the peaks and hence would be able to assess the cell's oscillatory state, which is our aim here.</p><p>The data provided confirm the validity of NCI as a quantifier. First, we have that NCI(t) remains reasonably constant – except for some spontaneous oscillations, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zambrano et al., 2014b</xref>) for cells that are not stimulated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9A</xref>. This is remarkable because the movie from which these series were obtained present considerable variation in the image intensity (see the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Along the same lines we do not find upwards or downwards average trends in our data of NCI time series for different conditions discussed in the main figures and in the figure supplements, which indicates further that the time series are properly normalized and reflect well the dynamics. As an additional confirmation, we have plotted together the average nuclear intensity and the NCI values obtained from manual segmentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9C</xref>, that show the same kind of qualitative behavior as NCI but with different trends, as expected. A last indicator of the sensitivity of the quantifier comes from its ability to detect even small oscillatory peaks, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> as an example. Overall, then, NCI is a faithful measure of the oscillatory state of our cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Automated analysis of time-lapse experiments data</title><p>The major advantage of considering NCI with respect to the nuclear to total ratio used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al (2014a)</xref> is that it does not require a perfect segmentation of the cytoplasm, which might be complicated when cells touch each other. We developed a software that uses this quantifier and is thus able to multiply by a factor of 2 the number of cells tracked, and by a factor of 1.5 the average tracking time with respect to the one described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al (2014a)</xref>.</p><p>The software used to calculate NCI is provided as source code and works as follows: for each time-lapse experiment, we have N frames images in the HOE channel and in the GFP channel, respectively. Nuclei were segmented and used for cell tracking following the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al (2014a)</xref>. In order to estimate the average cytoplasmic intensity, the background was computed by taking a square area centred on the cell nucleus, dividing it in tiles and using the one with the smallest average intensity in the GFP channel to estimate the background intensity (this procedure gives values compatible with the values obtained using a clustering-based algorithm). Points belonging to the cytoplasm are those around the nucleus in a size window equal to 1.5 times the size of the nucleus. The average cytoplasmic intensity is computed from the intensity in the GFP channel of the pixels from this “ring”. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>Dividing or apoptotic cells were identified assessing their geometrical features (abrupt changes in size of the nucleus and of the “cytoplasmic ring”) and discarded automatically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Time series analysis</title><p>To analyse the resulting NCI time series, we adapted our peak detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). We consider peaks as a sequence of a local minimum, local maximum and local minimum. The value of the peak θ is defined by the height of the peak (from the highest minimum to the maximum). A peak defined by only three consecutive time points is considered a noise peak. We plot the distribution of the noise peak values obtained from our unperturbed and chronic stimulation time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), for which we observe our previously reported spontaneous activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>). We find that these noisy peaks have a low value, and hence by considering as significant those with a value over θ&gt;0.15, we find a reasonably good compromise between the need to ignore noise peaks and the need to detect small peaks of valuable dynamical information. This was tested in a number of time series, and an example of time series with the significant peaks detected using this threshold is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>. Calculations of magnitudes inferred from peaks take advantage of time series from cells that were tracked for at least 7 hr.</p><p>Following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mondragon-Palomino et al., 2011</xref>) we used the peaks to assign a phase value: peak maxima are assigned a phase 0 (2π) and a phase π is assigned to peak minima. This was of particular interest to obtain an assessment of the oscillatory modes present in our system, provided that peaks can be very heterogeneous and plotting the peak height in colour-plots might make it difficult to appreciate the smaller ones and hence the possible resonant oscillatory patterns. An example of this transformation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, which is the phase derived from the peaks obtained of the time series displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mondragon-Palomino et al (2011)</xref> we use the phase difference between the time series and the forcing to quantify the degree of synchrony. The phase difference Δφ was calculated from the timing ΔT between the beginning of each forcing cycle and the closest significant peak, as Δφ=2πΔT/T<sub>f</sub>, where T<sub>f</sub> is the forcing period.

Our relatively simple model illustrates why this situation might arise and how a wider variety of dynamics might arise compared to the regular oscillations documented in the literature for more complicated models (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2010</xref>)).</p><p>To illustrate this, we analyzed the dynamics for a constant external stimulus (<italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)=2 h<sup>-1</sup>) and varying simultaneously each parameter of the parameter set <italic>P<sub>NF-κB</sub> </italic>according to their uncertainty degree D. We used them to generate trajectories and selected those giving rise to a response, i.e. those for which N(t) is bigger than 0.4 in the first 3 hr and whose average values in the last hours was smaller or equal than N=0.4. To characterized in a systematic way their dynamics, we located the fixed point of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ42 equ43 equ44 equ45 equ46 equ47 equ48 equ49">Equations 1–8</xref> and calculated the eigenvalues {<italic>λ<sub>i</sub></italic>} (<italic>i</italic>=1,...8) of the Jacobian. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref> we plot the real and imaginary parts of each set of eigenvalues. We represent with a red dot the eigenvalues belonging to a set in which the real part of at least one of them is bigger than zero. This means that the fixed point for those parameters is unstable and hence trajectories converge to a stable limit cycle around it. In other words, for those parameter combinations sustained oscillations arise. The percentage of parameter sets giving sustained oscillations is below 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>, right panel), which make us conjecture that parameters giving rise to sustained oscillations are not the norm.</p><p>We also plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref> the parameter values giving rise to oscillating and non oscillating (but responding) trajectories. We note that the intervals are very similar except for parameters <italic>n</italic> and <italic>d<sub>A</sub></italic> involved in the A20 negative feedback, which indicates that this feedback is critical in order to obtain a sustained or a damped oscillatory response. In previous works it was shown experimentally and through mathematical models that the interplay between the IκB and A20 regulatory modules regulate different phases of NF-κB response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werner et al., 2008</xref>). Our numerical results suggest that it also plays a key role in the type of dynamics observed (oscillatory versus damped). Overall, this analysis further hints to the fact that it is the precise combination of parameters, rather than the precise single values, what determines the type of dynamics observed and might account for the different dynamics observed with respect to other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we have to notice that being the system given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ42 equ43 equ44 equ45 equ46 equ47 equ48 equ49">Equations 1–8 </xref>a dynamical system with real variables, the imaginary eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs. The distribution of parameter combinations with 2, 4 and 6 imaginary eigenvalues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref> (left panel). Notice that an oscillatory frequency can be associated to each couple of complex conjugate pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>), so having more than one of such couples means that the dynamics will combine different frequencies.</p><p>To further illustrate all this, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref> we present examples of the variety of trajectories found. Some of them are oscillating (red), showing both smooth and spiky oscillatory peaks. Many others are damped and in some cases the concurrence of two oscillating timescales, fast and slow, is evident. Some others present clearly non-oscillating profiles. Overall, our numerical exploration of our relatively simple models shows that different dynamics are possible in presence of constant stimulation, as observed in the experiments of this and previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zambrano et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>The model simulation routine was implemented in C code language and compiled using gcc.

The manuscript &quot;NF-κB oscillations translate into functionally related patterns…&quot; by Zambrano et al. presents a systematic investigation of single-cell NF-κB signaling dynamics and of population-level transcriptional responses in GFP-RelA knock-in mouse fibroblasts stimulated with controlled TNF pulses. The authors use a microfluidic device to deliver TNF to cells while avoiding the accumulation of secreted proteins. Although, this does not exclude cell-centric feedback regulation of the signaling response to TNF, the minimal ODE model proposed by Zambrano et al. nonetheless accounts well for their experimental observations and the authors conclude that NF-κB behaves as a damped oscillator in these fibroblasts. That said, the reviewers have raised serious concerns about the single-cell data (detailed below) that need to be addressed.</p><p>The second half of the study, focused on the gene expression kinetics and functional correlates in cells treated with TNF pulses, leverages the use of oscillatory stimulations to reveal different clusters of genes that share dynamic patterns of expression. This is the most convincing and interesting finding of the manuscript. An important biological insight is that different functional pathways exhibit different expression dynamics; chemokine/chemokine receptors oscillate with TNF inputs, while immune responses integrate over longer timescales. The authors convincingly show that the decay rate of the mRNA of a gene of interest is sufficient to account for the different dynamic regimes of gene regulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The live cell imaging conditions seem to have been very damaging to cell physiology. Stress from photo-damage during live-cell imaging is a very serious issue which has hampered many cell biological studies (Cole R, 2014 Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">5</xref>) 452-259), and it is essential to address this problem. In the data presented by Zambrano et al., the supplementary movies show that the knock-in fibroblasts express very low levels of GFP-RelA making imaging challenging and it is quite evident from these movies that there is significant cell death and stress, and few cell divisions. Photo-stress was likely increased in this study due to the repeated exposure to the UV laser used for Hoechst imaging. A key concern is that with such a high level of stress, the observed NF-κB dynamics may not represent the true signaling dynamics induced solely by TNF. This could explain the authors observe highly damped oscillations, which are different from the sustained oscillations observed and reported in their first paper on the same GFP-RelA knock-in MEFs (Sung MH et al. 2009 PLoS One). In contrast to the manuscript under consideration, no UV or Hoechst were used in the 2009 study and healthy cell divisions were frequently observed throughout the long-term imaging supplementary movies. In light of these important concerns, the inclusion of the single-cell imaging data in the paper requires additional control data:</p><p>A) Because nuclear dyes can alter cell cycle and/or cause oxidative stress and mutations (Martin RM, Leonhardt H, and Cardoso MC, 2005 Cytometry; Ge J, Wood DK, et al. 2013 Cytometry), crucial control experiments should be performed to tease out the effects of the long incubation with the dye and the effects of UV radiation, with or without TNF. Do the dye and UV light perturb natural signaling dynamics or other physiology of the cells, such as cell cycle and apoptosis?</p><p>B) Importantly, the authors should compare the transcriptional response of cells with or without exposure to dye and UV light to verify that similar results are obtained under both conditions.</p><p>2) With regards to the quantification of nuclear GFP-RelA, the authors state that the nuclear to cytoplasmic intensity, termed NCI, is an &quot;internally normalized measure&quot;. Although this quantity has been used previously to represent nuclear localization of NF-κB (Nelson DE et al. Science 2004 and subsequent publications from the same group), more groups now approximate the nuclear concentration of NF-κB with the background-adjusted mean nuclear intensity (Lee TK et al. 2009 Science Signaling; Sung MH et al. 2014 Science Signaling; Lee REC, et al. 2014 Molecular Cell; Kellogg RA and Tay S, 2015 Cell), while minimizing the photobleaching which decreases fluorescent signals. NCI is not fully internally normalized, because both the numerator and the denominator fluctuate over time due to biological effects, not only due to technical effects. Would the same damped oscillations dynamics be observed with background-adjusted mean nuclear intensity?</p><p>3) Regarding the comparison with the recent report by Kellogg and Tay (2015 Cell), one important difference that is not highlighted here is that the applied pulse characteristics are different. The Tay group delivered a pulse by an infusion of TNF-α without washing (i.e. T2 = 0, using the terminology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), assuming a clearance process through internalization and degradation. Zambrano et al. enforced a washing and reset period between consecutive pulses. While it is a matter of debate which method better mimics a physiologically relevant situation, the different forcing protocols may have affected their results and make a direct comparison problematic. Could this explain why the two groups observe different results?</p><p>4) Concerning the choice of pulse duration for different forcing frequencies, the authors should justify why different &quot;T1&quot; periods were used for different forcing frequencies (45 min for 90 min pulses, 30 min for 180 min pulses, etc.). Michael White's group has reported that the temporal profile of nuclear NF-κB depends on the pulse duration (Ashall L et al. 2009 Science, FigureS7). Fixing the pulse duration might simplify the interpretation of results from a systematic comparison.</p><p>5) With regards to the computational model, one concern is that many parameter values seem ill-defined experimentally. Although the model builds on a previously published version, a more exhaustive presentation of the model (to explain which parameters are fixed, and which are fitted) should be included. It is also recommended that experimental effort be made to narrow down the number of free parameters: this greatly improves the quality of biochemical models, and makes for better predictions. Finally, IκBα is encoded in the model to exert a &quot;transcriptional repressor&quot; role although the cited study does not present particularly convincing evidence for any direct repressor activity of IκBα. Is this term necessary to recapitulate the experimental data, especially for a minimal mathematical model?</p><p>6) With respect to the sensitivity of model behavior to parameter values, the authors acknowledge large parameter sensitivity of their model, with 2-fold changes in expression levels of proteins switching cells from damped to sustained oscillatory responses (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A-D</xref>).</p><p>A) An exact description of the parameters that were varied in these supplementary figures needs to be included.</p><p>B) More generally, a systematic parameter sensitivity of the model (e.g. in terms of generating varied types of oscillation) should be performed to allow readers to understand the robustness of the model (in terms of its predictive power). In particular, this could potentially identify key proteins whose up/down regulation would most affect the response phenotype. In turn, the natural variability in the expression levels of these signaling components should be taken into account: it would explain the phenotypic variability that must exist within the isogenic population of cells used in these experiments, but that was overlooked so far.</p><p>C) Most relevant to the biology of NFκB signaling, such parameter sensitivity would help reconcile the diverse dynamics of NFκB response depending on the cell type under consideration (c.f. comparison with Kellogg and Tay, 2015 study). For that reason, it would be particularly useful to document systematically the variety of phenotypes (from damped oscillations, to spontaneous oscillations etc.) to predict and explain how different cell types use NFκB response differently to generate different functional responses, and to support the authors' argument that damped oscillations responses may be common while the stable oscillations may only be a rare case.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;NF-κB oscillations translate into functionally related patterns of gene expression&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor) and a Guest Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>In their revised submission, Zambrano and colleagues have addressed most of the concerns raised in the original review of this manuscript and the submission is accordingly much stronger. In particular, the authors have added a number of datasets to validate their experimental setup for live-cell imaging, mitigating initial concerns about damaging conditions for the cells under study. The new justification in the main text (Results) along with new supporting data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supplements) better explains the rationale for using this particular measure of nuclear NF-κB in this study. Furthermore, the detailed explanation now included in the Materials and methods presents a complete argumentation for this approach with their current datasetMaterials and methods, and clearly lays out the assumptions made and therefore provides an excellent overview for all readers familiar, or unfamiliar, with these types of data. Additional data and explanations in the text also better support the choice of stimulation profile. The new manuscript also provides a well-done analysis of their computational model which helps position their findings with regards to the dynamic behavior of TNF-induced NF-κB responses in a greater context of possible and probably behaviors. Only a few minor issues are noted for the revised version which we hope can be rapidly addressed by the authors.</p><p>Cell death, cell division and imaging conditions – overall, the additional data provided by the authors, particularly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> do suggest that the cell death that is observed in some of the experiments is likely due to the presence of TNF (under flow condition and in the absence of serum), and not just an artefact of the use of a Hoescht dye and UV illumination to identify the nucleus of each cell. However, the evidence from PO4-gammaH2AX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> has an important weakness and should probably be de-emphasized. Indeed, this epitope marks double strand breaks (DSBs) and while doxorubicin (positive control) is known to produce DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in cells in most phases of the cell cycle (DSB are linked to genes actively transcribed; e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705119">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705119</ext-link>) UV illumination creates other types of DNA damage (pyrimidine dimers) but only lead to DSBs in cells in S-phase and on a longer time scale than that used bythe authors in this figure (6-12 hrs, vs. 3 hrs – e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947453">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947453</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800352">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800352</ext-link>). Therefore, lack of PO4-gammaH2AX staining does not necessarily preclude the possibility of UV-induced DNA damage.</p><p>Square vs. sawtooth stimulation profile. Because the geometry of the microfluidic chamber is very different in this study from that of the device used in Kellogg and Tay, it is unclear if a significant reduction in TNF concentration is achieved when medium flow is stopped (as noted by the authors, TNF is stable in their chamber, and would decay only if actively degraded by cells). Importantly, this could be an alternative explanation for the lack of synchrony – this stimulation profile may be closer to static concentration than to oscillatory stimulation – which should be noted in the discussion of these data.</p><p>Regarding the sensitivity analysis of the model – the sensitivity analysis does provide a greater context for the observations by the authors as well as the cited work by Kellogg and Tay. The authors mention that parameters related to the A20 feedback are the only one for which there is a clear difference between values that lead to different types of dynamics. When discussing this result, the authors may find it helpful to refer to Werner et al. (2008; Genes and Dev.), where the A20 feedback was explored computationally and experimentally. This paper should also be cited in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, when introducing the A20 feedback.</p><p>Regarding the role of IκBα as a repressor – the new results from the authors do shed more light on that issue. However, the authors should review their model diagram as some are ambiguous or possibly misleading. It would be easier for the readers to interpret the model if the &quot;activation&quot; arrow for NF-κB and the &quot;inhibition&quot; arrow for IκBα were carefully positioned to target the reactions on which they act.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Periodic forcing turns heterogeneous NF-κB oscillations into synchronous oscillations”:</p><p>a) &quot;Replicate and show…&quot;; &quot;divide&quot; or &quot;proliferate&quot; would be a better term to characterize the cells' behavior.</p><p>b) “Limited cell death… &quot;; it may be more appropriate to just state &quot;cell death…&quot;.</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction: &quot;In resting cells, p65:p50 exists mostly as a cytoplasmic complex bound to the IκB inhibitors (Hoffmann et al., 2002)&quot; would be better rephrased to: &quot;In resting cells, p65 exists mostly within a cytoplasmic complex bound to the IκB inhibitors (Hoffmann et al., 2002).&quot;</p><p>&quot;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors should indicate in the main text or in the figure legend how many forcing cycles the cells were stimulated with before withdrawal of the forcing.&quot; The authors have now added cycle numbers on the figures although it would be helpful if the figure legend explained what these numbers represent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09100.053</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>How transcription factors affect responses to extracellular signals remains a key question in systems biology for which the NF-κB signaling pathway in mammalian cells has been a canonical study system.

Stress from photo-damage during live-cell imaging is a very serious issue which has hampered many cell biological studies (Cole R, 2014 Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">5</xref>) 452-259), and it is essential to address this problem.

Do the dye and UV light perturb natural signaling dynamics or other physiology of the cells, such as cell cycle and apoptosis?</italic> </p><p>On one hand, these comments highlight the need to complete and make explicit the controls already made that exclude any interference of our nuclear labeling with the natural signaling of NF-κB in the cells. On the other hand, they suggest that our description of single cell dynamics as damped (and not sustained) oscillations was not as sharp as it should have been.</p><p>To address the first issue, we first performed several control experiments.</p><p>DNA damage:</p><p>To exclude DNA damage in the cells due to imaging, we assessed by immunostaining the presence of H2AX phosphorylation (gammaH2AX), a marker for ongoing DNA damage repair. We compared gammaH2AX staining in cells that were not exposed to Hoechst nor imaged and in those exposed to Hoechst and/or laser irradiation for imaging.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> shows the results of this analysis: no difference in gammaH2AX intensity was detected in the cell nuclei upon different treatments, only the expected basal levels are observed (Turinetto &amp; Giachino, 2015). It is also worth considering that NF-κB plays a pivotal role in activating the DNA damage response upon irradiation and a nuclear translocation would be expected if imaging is anyhow harmful. Importantly, we do not see increasing levels of global activation of NF-κB through the NCI time series for unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).</p><p>Hence, at the low concentration of labeling used and the relatively low energy of our laser (405 nm) DNA damage remains almost undetectable. These results have been discussed in the main text and described in detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Cell divisions:</p><p>It is important to point out that cells are cultured in medium containing reduced serum (0.1% FBS) to minimize background noise during imaging, a necessary technical condition when the signal to noise ratio is very low. In low serum, cells progressively transit through the G2/M phase and accumulate in G1, as documented by the cell cycle analyses reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>. The low serum does not block the cell cycle completely and cells in mitosis are present until the very last imaging frame in all conditions tested. Cells are healthy as can be appreciated in the movies of unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). This is the main explanation for the low number of mitoses noted by the reviewers, whom we thank for asking for clarifications.</p><p>We acknowledge that a more accurate assessment of the imaging effect on the cell cycle would have been provided by single-cell based approaches like the FUCCI cell cycle sensor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/it/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/cell-viability-and-regulation/cell-cycle/live-cell-imaging-of-cell-cycle-and-division.html">https://www.thermofisher.com/it/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/cell-viability-and-regulation/cell-cycle/live-cell-imaging-of-cell-cycle-and-division.html</ext-link>) that allows following cell divisions within a cell population during imaging. We actually tried this approach but our fibroblasts are very resistant to transfection. The minimal fraction of cells that were labeled with the sensor did not allow a statistically significant evaluation of cell cycle alteration, if any, in the cells undergoing imaging in the presence/absence of TNF-α.</p><p>Cell death:</p><p>In our previous work with these cells and imaging settings (Zambrano et al., 2014a) we quantified photo-stress after 15 hours of imaging of Hoechst-exposed (Video S1 and S2 in the paper) and non-exposed cells (Videos S3 and S4 of that paper), finding equally low death rates (close to 5%). Indeed, in microfluidics set-up, cell death is even lower in unstimulated cells than in Zambrano et al. 2014, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>.</p><p>However, the reviewers are right in pointing out that <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> with cells treated with 10ng/ml TNF-α shows considerable cell death and now we propose an explanation for that effect. We suspected that TNF-α–but not Hoechst/UV imaging– might lead to cell death. To test this we evaluated the appearance of apoptotic cells in cell populations exposed to a continuous flow of different doses of TNF-α in the microfluidics chamber <italic>without</italic> Hoechst/UV imaging. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> we show GFP-imaging fields from time-lapse acquisitions for 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml TNF-α continuous stimulation. The appearance of dead cells is considerably anticipated as the dose of TNF-α increases: the first dead cells appear on average at 12, 9 and 3 hours, respectively (red frames).</p><p>FACS analysis of the cell cycle supports this conclusion while excluding Hoechst toxicity at population level. Untreated cells or cells exposed to Hoechst, in the presence or absence of 10ng/ml of TNF, showed no global perturbation of the cell cycle but apoptotic cells appeared after three hours of incubation with TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10</xref>). Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was also observed by the Tay group: cells under static stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α (movie S1 in (Tay et al., 2010) undergo almost no cell death, while many cells under constant TNF-α flow die (movie S1 in new Kellogg &amp; Tay, 2015). This probably depends on culture conditions and on the cell type; the precise mechanism will be the object of future investigation.</p><p>Sustained versus damped oscillations:</p><p>The reviewers are concerned that in our culture conditions oscillations were “damped” and thus different from the “sustained” oscillations that were observed for the same cells in Sung et al. 2009 using different culture conditions. This is in part a semantic problem involving the terminology used. In Sung et al. 2009 oscillations of GFP-p65 were referred to as “sustained” as opposed to the extremely damped dynamics of NF-κB revealed by biochemical population-level assays as in the seminal paper of Hoffmann et al., 2002.</p><p>In the present work we do not claim that our cells have different dynamics from the one described in Sung et al. 2009 and Zambrano et al. 2014. We described the dynamics as “damped” as opposed to “sustained oscillations”, the latter referring to the regular series of peaks – almost sinusoidal – for time lapses longer than 12 hours reported by Kellogg and Tay, 2015.</p><p>In dynamical systems terms, damped oscillations are those that tend to stabilize to a fixed point while sustained oscillations converge to limit cycle. This is what we mean by damped oscillations here. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, we show a representative collection of the heterogeneous dynamics observed under continuous flow of TNF-α, from non-oscillating cells to increasingly oscillating cells, as previously reported. This heterogeneity was summarized in the number of peaks per cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>. This is remarkable provided that culture conditions are not static as in (Sung et al., 2009; Zambrano et al., 2014a), so autocrine-paracrine signaling, which might induce oscillations in late phases of the stimulation, is not possible.</p><p>Overall, though, the dynamics we observe cannot be described as sustained using Kellog and Tay terminology, provided that the peaks we find become more irregular and infrequent as the stimulation proceeds, in agreement with what observed previously. Most of our time series oscillate to apparently end up fluctuating around a value higher than the pre-stimulation level. In conclusion, we unfortunately used the same term “sustained” in two different meanings in two different papers, but there is little we can do: we should retroactively change the term used in Sung et al. 2009. We now try to define exactly in our manuscript the term sustained as we use it.</p><p>Possible interference by Hoechst and imaging on oscillations:</p><p>Finally, to further assess if labeling and imaging induce distortions of NF-κB dynamics, we decided to manually quantify NF-κB dynamics for cells that were not exposed to Hoechst nor imaged with UV. Examples of the manually derived single cell traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8C</xref>, which show a heterogeneous but damped oscillatory dynamics as the ones shown in this manuscript and in our previous works, under imaging in the presence of Hoechst.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>In order to sharpen the manuscript, we have briefly delineated in the section “Periodic forcing turns heterogeneous NF-κB oscillations into synchronous oscillations” that controls were performed to exclude any interference between the signalling dynamics of NF-κB and the imaging conditions, and that cell death is mostly due to the continuous flow of TNF-α, referring to the movies. This is illustrated with several supplemental figures cited in the main text and thoroughly described in “Safety assessment for Hoechst staining” in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>To clarify further our description of the oscillations as damped, in section “Periodic forcing turns damped NF-κB oscillations into synchronous oscillations” we refer to the new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, to illustrate the heterogeneous damped oscillatory dynamics that we observe as opposed to the sustained oscillations that are observed by Tay’s group. We also put our results in the context of previous observations done with the same cells.</p><p><italic>B) Importantly, the authors should compare the transcriptional response of cells with or without exposure to dye and UV light to verify that similar results are obtained under both conditions.</italic> </p><p>This is actually an important point that needed clarification in the manuscript. In fact, we did perform our experiments of transcription with cells that were not exposed to Hoechst nor UV illuminated. As shown by the controls performed to address comment 1A, it is clear that the dynamics are not distorted by the imaging conditions, so neither should be the transcriptional response. However, in order to further exclude effects on transcription, we performed RT-PCR transcription assays for IκBα and Ccl5 in cells under constant TNF-α both with and without Hoechst staining. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> indicate no significant difference between the two conditions.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>This is now clarified in the revised version of the manuscript. We also added in Materials and methods that no nuclear labelling was used in the transcription experiments, and that we performed controls showing that nuclear labelling wouldn’t have altered the results anyway. There we refer to the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) With regards to the quantification of nuclear GFP-RelA, the authors state that the nuclear to cytoplasmic intensity, termed NCI, is an &quot;internally normalized measure&quot;. Although this quantity has been used previously to represent nuclear localization of NF-κB (Nelson DE et al. Science 2004 and subsequent publications from the same group), more groups now approximate the nuclear concentration of NF-κB with the background-adjusted mean nuclear intensity (Lee TK</italic> et al.</p><p> <italic>2009 Science Signaling; Sung MH et al. 2014 Science Signaling; Lee REC, et al. 2014 Molecular Cell; Kellogg RA and Tay S, 2015 Cell), while minimizing the photobleaching which decreases fluorescent signals. NCI is not fully internally normalized, because both the numerator and the denominator fluctuate over time due to biological effects, not only due to technical effects. Would the same damped oscillations dynamics be observed with background-adjusted mean nuclear intensity?</italic> </p><p>This comment made us realize that we did not provide convincing enough arguments of the validity of Nuclear to Cytoplasmic Intensity (NCI) as a quantifier of NF-κB dynamics and on the rationale of our selection. To summarize, we believe that the question raised by the reviewers can be answered with a clear yes and detail our reasoning below.</p><p>First, the imaging rationale: As we can see in some of the movies accompanying this manuscript (see e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref>) there are global fluctuations in the intensity of the images and of the background, which also vary in space. This is essentially due to small changes in the focus, slight inclination of the plates and changes in the laser intensity that might amplify-or reduce- the amount of light measured. These changes are sizeable when the signal to noise ratio is very low, as in the case of physiological levels of p65. Photobleaching, if any, is negligible: one can see in our movies – as in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> – that cells are bright even in late phases of the imaging. Thus our rationale is to use a ratio of background-corrected intensities, so that these distortions will cancel out; this is the same rationale that we applied in our previous works, where we used ratios of intensities to quantify the dynamics (Sung et al., 2009; Zambrano et al., 2014a).</p><p>Second, the mathematical rationale: A precise description of our rationale for selecting NCI has been reported in the extended paragraph “Quantification of NF-κB dynamics” in the Materials and methods section. The mathematical discussion leads to conclude that, being a ratio of intensities, NCI is a faithful indicator of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-κB and hence robust to global changes in the image intensity. We use the same reasoning to show why the background-corrected average nuclear intensity would reflect the global imaging distortions in our settings and hence would not be an adequate readout of the nuclear amount of NF-κB. However, as the reviewers rightly point out, the numerator and denominator of this ratio can fluctuate due to biological reasons and this might blur or overestimate the oscillatory behavior of nuclear NF-κB, which is the truly important readout. If it were possible to assess that total NF-κB is constant, then the oscillations in the nuclear NF-κB would correspond to oscillations in NCI, as we demonstrate in Supplemental Information, due to the fact that the latter is a monotonously increasing function of the former, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>). We then provide evidence that NF-κB is indeed constant (see below).</p><p>Third, the biochemical rationale: Is the total amount of NF-κBa constant parameter? Although this has been widely assumed in the field and included in different mathematical models present in the literature, from the seminal paper (Hoffmann et al., 2002) to more recent papers as (Kellogg &amp; Tay, 2015), this view has been challenged by a recent work (Sung et al., 2014) showing that p65 is regulated by a positive feedback in macrophages under LPS stimulation. Thus, to confirm that the “constant p65” assumption holds true for our GFP-p65 MEFs, we quantified p65 in cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 8 hours with sampling every hour. Immunoblots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref> show no large changes in the p65 levels upon stimulation. We did not quantify p65 at single cell level using microscopy because fluctuations of our experimental setup might lead to imprecise results. However, we consider our assumption valid and in line with the literature.</p><p>Finally, variations in the areas of the nucleus and the cytoplasm might introduce small distortions, although they typically vary slowly. This problem can be easily solved by discarding cells for which the areas change abruptly – an indicator of imminent mitosis or cell death –, as our software does.</p><p>To further support the validity of NCI we are providing additional data.</p><p>First, we have that NCI(t) remains constant at single cell level – except for some spontaneous oscillations, as previously reported (Zambrano et al., 2014a) – as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A</xref>. This is remarkable because the movie from which these series were obtained shows considerable decrease in image intensity (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Along the same lines we do not find upwards or downwards average trends in our data of NCI time series for different conditions, which indicates further that the time series are properly normalized and reflect well the dynamics. We have also plotted side-by-side the NCI values and average nuclear intensity obtained by manual segmentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8C</xref>. For this experiment the imaging conditions were stable so the same kind of qualitative behavior is obtained, as expected. A last indicator of the sensitivity of the quantifier comes from its ability to detect even small oscillatory peaks, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> as an example for 0.1 ng/ml TNF-α.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>We have tried to make all this clearer in the revised manuscript. In the first section of the results, where we briefly describe our approach, we explain that NCI is a valid quantifier of NF-κB dynamics while being robust to imaging distortions. Also, we decided to abandon the “internally normalized” term, which might be misleading.</p><p>Finally, in the Materials and methods section, we have introduced a new paragraph entitled “Selection of the quantifier of NF-κB dynamics” where we reproduced the discussion above on the validity of each quantifier providing the appropriate mathematical demonstration. The cited movie and supplement figures have been included in the new manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the comparison with the recent report by Kellogg and Tay (2015 Cell), one important difference that is not highlighted here is that the applied pulse characteristics are different. The Tay group delivered a pulse by an infusion of TNF-</italic>α</p><p> <italic>without washing (i.e. T2 = 0, using the terminology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), assuming a clearance process through internalization and degradation. Zambrano et al. enforced a washing and reset period between consecutive pulses. While it is a matter of debate which method better mimics a physiologically relevant situation, the different forcing protocols may have affected their results and make a direct comparison problematic. Could this explain why the two groups observe different results?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for giving us the opportunity to expand on this point, which now has been addressed in the revised manuscript, also by adding new experimental results.</p><p>Indeed a crucial difference of the setup of Kellogg and Tay with respect to ours is that they periodically and quickly refresh the medium in contact with the cells, after which they assume that a clearance process takes place. This should produce a sawtooth TNF-α profile. We, instead, do constantly control the amount of TNF-α in direct contact in the cell by subjecting them to a <italic>continuous</italic> flow of the selected doses D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> for different times T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. Importantly, as we already pointed out, our approach also should reduce to the minimum the contribution of autocrine-paracrine signaling in the dynamics.</p><p>To gain further insights in whether these differences could explain the observed differences in the synchronization mechanism, we have measured the dynamics of our cells under sawtooth-like profiles of TNF-α with different periodicities. The results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>. GFP-p65 MEFs synchronize to sawtooth pulses with T<sub>f</sub>=90'. In contrast to Kellogs and Tay’s results, our MEFs synchronize also to T<sub>f</sub>=60'. However, the synchronization after the first pulse is quickly lost for T<sub>f</sub>=180'.</p><p>Interestingly, with the sawtooth approach synchronizations are less sharp and reminiscent of those obtained using alternating doses (D<sub>1</sub>&gt;0 and D<sub>2</sub>&gt;0) for T<sub>f</sub>=60' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>), T<sub>f</sub>=90' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and T<sub>f</sub>=180' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations suggest that culturing conditions, absence of flow and chamber geometries possibly affect TNF-α decay and clearance. Moreover, autocrine-paracrine signaling may further contribute to distortions of the dynamics.</p><p>However, coming back to the point raised by the reviewers, the shown ability of our cells to synchronize to a sawtooth of T<sub>f</sub>=60', contrarily to what is reported by Kellogg and Tay (2015 Cell) for a similar forcing, further suggests that the synchronization mechanism strictly depends on cellular and environmental factors.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>We have included the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> in the manuscript and discussed it in the section The synchronization mechanism of GFP-p65 knock-in MEFs is not entrainment. We have put this figure in the context of our discussion, stating that it provides further confirmation to our interpretation of the synchronization mechanism as that of a damped oscillator to a (sufficiently) strong external periodic forcing.</p><p><italic>4) Concerning the choice of pulse duration for different forcing frequencies, the authors should justify why different &quot;T1&quot; periods were used for different forcing frequencies (45 min for 90 min pulses, 30 min for 180 min pulses, etc.). Michael White's group has reported that the temporal profile of nuclear NF-κB depends on the pulse duration (Ashall L et al. 2009 Science, FigureS7). Fixing the pulse duration might simplify the interpretation of results from a systematic comparison.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers: using the same value of in all the experiments would help in the interpretation of the results. A comprehensive analysis of many different combinations of T1, T2, D1 and D2 would have been extremely time-consuming and economically challenging. Therefore we started exploring only few combinations. We discuss here the reasons of our selection of T<sub>1</sub> in each experiment while providing additional supplementary experiments to facilitate data comparison, and reinforcing the central message of the dynamics part of our work: that NF–κB oscillations can lock to a wide variety of input stimuli. This message has been highlighted further in the manuscript.</p><p>In our first experiments with T<sub>f</sub> =90 min we decided to use T<sub>1</sub> =45 min to see whether a &quot;long square wave&quot; forcing could give rise to synchronous dynamics similar to the T<sub>1</sub> =5 min short pulses documented in the paper by Michael White's group (Ashall et al., 2009). To explore lower frequencies, like T<sub>f</sub> =45 min, smaller values of T<sub>1</sub>have been chosen. We first tried with T<sub>1</sub> =30 min, T<sub>2</sub>=15 min, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3—figure supplement3</xref>, upper panels) and found that synchrony to the forcing was very poor, which highlighted the importance of a resetting phase in order to obtain synchronization to the input. By reducing the value of T<sub>1</sub> =30 min to the value of T<sub>1</sub> =22,5 min shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we find the synchrony of the oscillations for different doses.</p><p>On the other hand, we selected T<sub>1</sub>=30 min for the experiment with T<sub>f</sub> =180 min shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> because we observed that T<sub>1</sub>=30 min for T<sub>f</sub> =90 min produced synchronous dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, lower panels), almost as clear as the ones observed for T<sub>1</sub> =45 min. We also speculated that T<sub>1</sub> =30 min,T<sub>f</sub> =180 min might produce even sharper oscillations in the transcriptional output, which in turn was useful for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>We have better motivated our selection of T<sub>1</sub>in the manuscript and have included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> where the interested reader can find graphs on the dynamics for the conditions described above. Furthermore, we have highlighted the importance of the resetting time in obtaining the synchrony that we observe in the T<sub>f</sub> =45 min, which is something that we overlooked in the original version of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) With regards to the computational model, one concern is that many parameter values seem ill-defined experimentally. Although the model builds on a previously published version, a more exhaustive presentation of the model (to explain which parameters are fixed, and which are fitted) should be included. It is also recommended that experimental effort be made to narrow down the number of free parameters: this greatly improves the quality of biochemical models, and makes for better predictions. Finally, IκBα is encoded in the model to exert a &quot;transcriptional repressor&quot; role although the cited study does not present particularly convincing evidence for any direct repressor activity of IκBα. Is this term necessary to recapitulate the experimental data, especially for a minimal mathematical model?</italic> </p><p>Model description:</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that many parameters of the model are ill-defined: there is always a trade-off between the complexity of the model designed and the number of parameters that will be well defined, provided that any simplification implies to conflate in few processes many different ones. This is the case of our 8-dimensional mathematical model, but this holds true also for higher dimensional mathematical models of the NF-κB system, as e.g. Tay et al., 2010 and Ashall et al., 2009 – with twice as many variables as ours – where still ill-defined parameters can be found. As the reviewers implicitly suggest, a clear description of how the model is built can help to find a correspondence between variations in the experimental conditions and the system’s parameters. Hence, we have introduced in the Materials and methods a detailed description of the processes that our mathematical model takes into consideration, reproducing the basic discussion of the work where we described a previous version of the model (Zambrano et al. 2014b), including the normalizations performed, which leads to a simplification and a reduction of the free parameters.</p><p>Parameter variation:</p><p>Along the same lines, we have followed what we did in (Zambrano et al., 2014b) and assigned to each of the model parameters an uncertainty degree <italic>D</italic>, which is low <italic>D=0.2</italic> for parameters derived from biochemical rates of the literature (in our case, mostly from Tay et al., 2010, such as decay rates of proteins and RNA) and high (D=<italic>1</italic>) for others that are unknown or that correspond to processes that have been simplified, as in our case those involved in the A20 negative feedback. Parameters are then allowed to be varied by a random factor in the [10<sup>-<italic>D</italic></sup>, 10<italic><sup>D</sup></italic>] interval, which means that the largest uncertainty degree imply a variation of up to one order of magnitude around the initial parameter value. In the new Table 2 we now explicitly state the biochemical rates and constants used, their origin, the parameters of the model to which they are related and the uncertainty degree considered for each of them. Importantly, in our fittings we allow each of the parameters to vary only by a factor in the [10<sup>-<italic>D</italic></sup>, 10<italic><sup>D</sup></italic>] interval. This is now clearly stated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>We also have clarified the notation of the parameters making explicit those that are fixed and those that are fitted. We essentially have three sets of parameters: P<sub>S</sub>, P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub>, and P<sub>G</sub>. The first, P<sub>S</sub>, accounts for the parameters of the external time-varying signal; P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub>, is the set of parameters that regulate NF-κB dynamics via the double IκBα–A20 negative feedback loop, and P<sub>G</sub> encloses the parameters used to reproduce the gene expression. Thus, the mathematical description of the expression of two genes under the control of NF-κB under the same external forcing conditions would have the same values of P<sub>S</sub> and P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub>, but different –individually fitted – values of P<sub>G</sub>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, then, the same values of P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub> where used to reproduce the NCI, IκBα and CCL5 profiles, but for each of these a different P<sub>G</sub> was used. Similarly, in the fittings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we use the same values of P<sub>S</sub> and P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub>as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> but then each single gene is fitted with its own P<sub>G</sub>. This is also clearly explained in the new version of the manuscript, as well as in the captions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6.</p><p>On the role of IκBα as a repressor:</p><p>Finally, concerning the role of IκBα as a repressor, we agree that the evidence provided in (Arenzana-Seisdedos et al., 1995) is not conclusive. However, the role of IκBα as a repressor has been considered in a number of works, e.g. (Kellogg &amp; Tay, 2015; Lipniacki et al., 2006; Tay et al., 2010), while not in others (Ashall et al., 2009; Sung et al., 2014). We have tested if our model can reproduce observed profiles even if such transcriptional repressor is not present, when simulating both the dynamics of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7A</xref>) and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Gene expression profiles are indeed reproduced, for genes with both increased and decreased transcription, with relative errors comparable to those obtained with our original model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7D</xref>). It can also be observed that the degradation rate is the key parameter to reproduce the dynamics of each cluster of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7E</xref>). Importantly, this exploration made us realize that for clusters 4-6 containing genes with decreased transcription we were essentially fitting the gene expression profiles as a simple RNA degradation process.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>All this has now been clarified in the text, where we also mention the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>. We also clarify that the role of IκBα as a repressor is not fundamental.</p><p><italic>6) With respect to the sensitivity of model behavior to parameter values, the authors acknowledge large parameter sensitivity of their model, with 2-fold changes in expression levels of proteins switching cells from damped to sustained oscillatory responses (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A-D</xref>). A) An exact description of the parameters that were varied in these supplementary figures needs to be included.</italic> </p><p>Using the notation that we have introduced to address point number 5, we have now specified that the parameters varied were P<sub>NF-</sub>κ<sub>B</sub>, according to the uncertainty degree that we assigned to each of them. We have added a similarly precise description of the parameters varied in the remaining numerical supplemental figures.</p><p><italic>B) More generally, a systematic parameter sensitivity of the model (e.g. in terms of generating varied types of oscillation) should be performed to allow readers to understand the robustness of the model (in terms of its predictive power). In particular, this could potentially identify key proteins whose up/down regulation would most affect the response phenotype. In turn, the natural variability in the expression levels of these signaling components should be taken into account: it would explain the phenotypic variability that must exist within the isogenic population of cells used in these experiments, but that was overlooked so far.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewers’ advice, we have performed a numerical exploration of our model in order to identify the variety of oscillatory behaviours that it can display. We varied the parameters of the model according to the uncertainty degree assigned to them. Since our model is a system of ordinary differential equations, it is possible to determine numerically the stability of the fixed points of the flow determined by equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1</xref>)-(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">8</xref>) (see Materials and methods), and thus what dynamics should arise for each parameter combination.</p><p>We did generate a library of 10,000 random parameter combinations in the intervals prescribed, and did pre-select those that gave a response in the time series of <italic>N(t)</italic>. The eigenvalues of the fixed point are plotted in the complex plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>; those in red correspond to sets of eigenvalues for which at least one of them has a real positive part. In that situation, the system converges to sustained oscillations, but the fraction of those combinations is less than 10% of the total, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>. Examples of sustained oscillations similar to the ones shown by Kellogg and Tay 2015 and some spiky oscillation, similar to the ones shown in Ashall 2009, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>.</p><p>We also find that most of the trajectories have four eigenvalues with imaginary parts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>; this implies that most of the trajectories have two competing frequencies. For this reason, we find examples in which the interaction of fast and slow oscillating timescales can be observed. Additional examples of the variety of time series present can be shown in panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>. The fact that the signaling of NF-κB can present rich dynamics was pointed out in Sung et al. 2009. We hope that our results will contribute to further illustrate this important point that shows how even in isogenic populations heterogeneous dynamics – due to different parameter combinations – might arise.</p><p>Finally we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref> the intervals of the parameters that give rise to sustained or damped oscillations (recall that the parameters selected are those giving trajectories responsive to the stimulus). We find that in our simple model the parameter ranges are very similar in oscillating and non-oscillating trajectories. Only for certain parameters related to the A20 feedback (n and dA) we find a clear difference. This suggests that variations in this upstream negative feedback can lead to strong variations in the type of dynamics. Overall, though, our results suggest that only the precise combination of parameters is what determines whether the system displays sustained or damped oscillations. Only further analytical work on the structure of bifurcations in parameter space may shed light on this important point. This type of work could also pave the way for targeted experiments that might be able to identify key proteins in NF-κB regulation, but this is far from the scope of the present work.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>We have tried to make all this clearer in the revised manuscript. An appropriate description has been added to the first section of the Results. The details of the stability analysis have been added to the Materials and methods section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> has been improved with panels summarizing the discussion above.</p><p><italic>C) Most relevant to the biology of NFκB signaling, such parameter sensitivity would help reconcile the diverse dynamics of NFκB response depending on the cell type under consideration (c.f. comparison with Kellogg and Tay, 2015 study). For that reason, it would be particularly useful to document systematically the variety of phenotypes (from damped oscillations, to spontaneous oscillations etc.) to predict and explain how different cell types use NFκB response differently to generate different functional responses, and to support the authors' argument that damped oscillations responses may be common while the stable oscillations may only be a rare case.</italic></p><p>We believe that some the results previously shown and the revised version of the manuscript can address this point. In response to Point 2 we generated the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, where we document the variety of phenotypes that we observe with examples of trajectories with different degrees of dampening, although the majority of them are those with few peaks (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indeed illustrates that in an isogenic population different oscillatory phenotypes can be observed. Hence, as the reviewers point out, it should be expected that also different cell types will display different oscillatory behaviors: this is probably the case of those studied in the work by Kellogg and Tay 2015, but the same could applied to recently published results with fibroblasts (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, (Cheng et al., 2015)) or macrophages (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> in Sung et al., 2014), that present also remarkable variability of behaviors. Furthermore, the numerical exploration performed to address the previous point illustrates how variations in the parameter combinations can give rise to widely different dynamics, which hints in the same direction. We can only claim that in our cells damped oscillations are much more common; our model suggests that damped oscillations are more frequent. Only the study of a wide variety of cell types can tell which of the two types of dynamics is more frequent. This will be hopefully the direction of our future work.</p><p>Actions taken:</p><p>All this has been made clearer in the first Results section and in the Discussion, where we state that our results (numerical and experimental) can also provide clues to reconcile the visions emerging from works where different cell types were considered, that we cite in the new version.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] Only a few minor issues are noted for the revised version which we hope can be rapidly addressed by the authors. Cell death, cell division and imaging conditions</italic> – <italic>overall, the additional data provided by the authors, particularly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> do suggest that the cell death that is observed in some of the experiments is likely due to the presence of TNF (under flow condition and in the absence of serum), and not just an artefact of the use of a Hoescht dye and UV illumination to identify the nucleus of each cell. However, the evidence from PO4-gammaH2AX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> has an important weakness and should probably be de-emphasized. Indeed, this epitope marks double strand breaks (DSBs) and while doxorubicin (positive control) is known to produce DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in cells in most phases of the cell cycle (DSB are linked to genes actively transcribed; e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705119">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705119</ext-link>) UV illumination creates other types of DNA damage (pyrimidine dimers) but only lead to DSBs in cells in S-phase and on a longer time scale than that used bythe authors in this figure (6-12 hrs, vs. 3 hrs</italic> – <italic>e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947453">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947453</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800352">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800352</ext-link>). Therefore, lack of PO4-gammaH2AX staining does not necessarily preclude the possibility of UV-induced DNA damage.</italic></p><p>To address this, we assessed the presence of thymine dimers as a specific indicator of DNA damage upon UV exposure. Thymine dimers in imaged cells were at a level below the sensitivity threshold of the immunostaining method. Now results are reported in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment on the role of gammaH2AX. The text in the Materials and methods has been changed to de-emphasise the relevance of this marker for photo-damage. Appropriate new references have been added.</p><p><italic>Square vs. sawtooth stimulation profile. Because the geometry of the microfluidic chamber is very different in this study from that of the device used in Kellogg and Tay, it is unclear if a significant reduction in TNF concentration is achieved when medium flow is stopped (as noted by the authors, TNF is stable in their chamber, and would decay only if actively degraded by cells). Importantly, this could be an alternative explanation for the lack of synchrony</italic> – <italic>this stimulation profile may be closer to static concentration than to oscillatory stimulation</italic> –</p><p><italic>which should be noted in the discussion of these data.</italic> </p><p>This is an insightful comment. Indeed, the different geometry of the chamber and presumably different culture conditions can lead to a different decay rates for the TNF-α when put in contact with the cells. This observation has been included in the discussion of the sawtooth profile data.</p><p><italic>Regarding the sensitivity analysis of the model</italic> –</p><p><italic>the sensitivity analysis does provide a greater context for the observations by the authors as well as the cited work by Kellogg and Tay. The authors mention that parameters related to the A20 feedback are the only one for which there is a clear difference between values that lead to different types of dynamics. When discussing this result, the authors may find it helpful to refer to Werner et al. (2008; Genes and Dev.), where the A20 feedback was explored computationally and experimentally. This paper should also be cited in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, when introducing the A20 feedback.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Indeed, the paper mentioned is one of the first descriptions of how the interplay between the A20 and IκB regulatory modules provides a fine-tuning of NF-κB response to an external stimulus. We now cite it when briefly describing the A20 feedback in the introduction. We also cite it when discussing the role of A20 in the type of dynamics observed in the paragraph “Classification of the different dynamical responses for constant stimulus”of the“Mathematical modelling” section of the Materials and methods. Finally, we also cite it in the Discussion when commenting on the same results.</p><p><italic>Regarding the role of IκBα as a repressor</italic> –</p><p><italic>the new results from the authors do shed more light on that issue. However, the authors should review their model diagram as some are ambiguous or possibly misleading. It would be easier for the readers to interpret the model if the &quot;activation&quot; arrow for NF-κB and the &quot;inhibition&quot; arrow for IκBα were carefully positioned to target the reactions on which they act.</italic> </p><p>The diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref> have been changed as suggested.
