facilitates muscle-bone crosstalk and skeletal remodeling in part by its action on osteoblasts and osteocytes. In this study, we investigated whether irisin directly regulates osteoclasts. In vitro, irisin (2–10 ng/mL) increased osteoclast differentiation in C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow progenitors; however, this increase was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to integrin α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>. Irisin also increased bone resorption on several substrates in situ. RNAseq revealed differential gene expression induced by irisin including upregulation of markers for osteoclast differentiation and resorption, as well as osteoblast-stimulating ‘clastokines’. Forced expression of the irisin precursor <italic>Fndc5</italic> in transgenic C57BL/6J mice resulted in lower bone mass at three ages and greater in vitro osteoclastogenesis from <italic>Fndc5</italic>-transgenic bone marrow progenitors. This study demonstrates that irisin acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to increase differentiation and promote bone resorption, supporting the tenet that irisin not only stimulates bone remodeling but may also be an important counter-regulatory hormone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>irisin</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>resorption</kwd><kwd>remodeling</kwd><kwd>myokine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AR077382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estell</surname><given-names>Eben G</given-names></name><name><surname>Baron</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name><name><surname>Spiegelman</surname><given-names>Bruce M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AG060917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estell</surname><given-names>Eben G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54GM115516-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK112374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P20GM121301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulation of bone homeostasis by the exercise-induced myokine irisin is in part potentiated by a direct action on osteoclast differentiation and resorption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Irisin is a peptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), a membrane-bound protein highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. <italic>FNDC5</italic> expression increases in response to acute bouts of exercise by regulation of PGC-1α, leading to a burst of circulating irisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). Initially, irisin was described as a hormone that induces thermogenesis in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boström et al., 2012</xref>), but more recent studies have shown that it has a potent ability to modulate bone turnover. These effects support the tenet that irisin may be a key mediator of muscle-bone crosstalk during exercise. Initial studies demonstrated that irisin enhanced cortical bone formation and prevented unloading-induced bone loss in vivo and stimulated osteoblasts in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colaianni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colaianni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colaianni et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, genetic deletion of <italic>Fndc5</italic> was separately shown to block resorption-driven bone loss and maintain osteocyte function following ovariectomy; irisin treatment in vitro also prevented osteocyte apoptosis and stimulated sclerostin and RANKL release, key promoters of osteoclastogenesis, through the α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub> integrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). This study addresses the hypothesis that irisin also directly stimulates osteoclast differentiation and function in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>First, we used continuous treatment with a range of irisin doses (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL) for 7 days in an in vitro osteoclast differentiation assay using primary marrow hematopoietic progenitors. These doses were based on previous studies establishing the physiologic range of circulating irisin during and after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). We found a qualitative enhancement of both osteoclast number and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and significant increases in osteoclast number across this dose range (2, 5, and 10 ng/mL: p&lt;0.0001, 20 ng/mL: p=0.044; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Based on these results, we selected 10 ng/mL irisin to compare continuous (7 days) and transient treatment for the first 4 or 24 hr of culture, and for all further experiments with resorption and gene expression. Both transient treatments led to enhanced osteoclast numbers versus controls (4 hr: p=0.0218, 24 hr: p=0.0008), but continuous irisin resulted in the greatest increase (p&lt;0.0001) and was higher than both 4 hr (p=0.0002) and 24 hr only treatments (p=0.0152; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). The stimulatory effect of continuous 10 ng/mL irisin was then further confirmed in primary hematopoietic cells from both sexes of C57BL/6J mice (p=0.0003) and in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line (p=0.0428; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

Irisin significantly increased osteoclast numbers on dentin (p=0.013), as well as total resorption area (p=0.045). However, when normalized by osteoclast number, resorption was not significantly different (p&gt;0.99), indicating a dominant effect of cell number in increasing total resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

Significant decreases in both the number of osteoblasts per bone perimeter (p=0.05) and bone formation rate (p=0.0046) were observed only at 2 months, and not at 13 months.

Osteoclast numbers per bone perimeter were slightly increased in Fndc5-transgenic mice versus wild type across 2–13 months but did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). However, primary bone marrow progenitors isolated from <italic>Fndc5-</italic>transgenic mice at 2–3 months demonstrated markedly greater osteoclastogenic potential compared to the wild type, yielding significantly higher numbers of osteoclasts that were qualitatively larger than controls during in vitro differentiation (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Skeletal phenotype and osteoclastogenic potential of <italic>Fndc5</italic> forced expression with McK muscle promoter mice (MCK-FNDC5, TG) compared to wild type C57BL/6J controls (WT).</title><p>Whole-bone gene expression from tibia shows increased <italic>Fndc5</italic> expression out to 13 months (<bold>a</bold>, N = 3–5).

This stimulatory effect was observed across multiple experiments with primary murine progenitors and the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line and occurred with either intermittent or continuous irisin exposure across a range of physiologic concentrations previously reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). Analogous to its action on osteocytes, we confirmed the expression of integrin subunits α<sub>V</sub> and β<sub>5</sub> on osteoclasts and identified it as a likely receptor for irisin, particularly since blocking this receptor complex with a neutralizing antibody completely suppressed the stimulatory effect of irisin on osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, we found that both recruitment and differentiation of more osteoclast progenitors with irisin treatment appeared to be driving factors of enhanced bone resorption, based on in situ studies on native dentin as well as synthetic calcium phosphate and collagen substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Using unbiased RNAseq analysis and qRT-PCR of irisin-treated osteoclasts, we noted that some markers of early osteoclast differentiation, nuclear fusion markers, and enzymes related to bone resorption were upregulated, matching the functional effects observed in vitro. In addition, several osteoclast-secretory factors known to stimulate osteoblasts were significantly upregulated, suggesting that the direct actions of irisin on this cell type may have further impact on cell signaling to enhance coupled remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the capacity of irisin to impact osteoclast function in vivo, we employed a genetic strategy with chronically forced expression of <italic>Fndc5</italic> using the muscle-specific <italic>Mck</italic> promoter. In that mouse model, we demonstrated that high levels of irisin were expressed in the whole bone marrow at both ages, and this was associated with low bone mass. The relative contribution of osteoclastogenesis to the skeletal phenotype cannot be resolved in our genetic model. While early decreases in osteoblast numbers and bone formation rate were observed by histomorphometry at 2 months of age in the transgenic mouse, these metrics became equivalent to controls at 13 months, whereas a trend for increased osteoclast numbers was noted at 13 months. The in vitro differentiation cultures from the <italic>Fndc5</italic>-transgenic marrow progenitors from 2- to 3-month-old mice provide further supportive evidence for the action of irisin on the osteoclast. Bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors from <italic>Fndc5</italic>-transgenic mice at 2–3 months of age were not different from the wild type in regard to the pace or quantitation of osteoblast differentiation or mineralization. On the other hand, in vitro osteoclastogenesis from transgenic hematopoietic progenitors was markedly enhanced compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, we have found that continuous exogenous treatment with 10 ng/mL irisin used to stimulate in vitro osteoclast differentiation from wild type progenitors had no observable effect on osteoblast differentiation or mineralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate a clear action of irisin on the osteoclast, but further suggest that in this forced expression model, irisin may act at early stages to reduce bone mass by suppressing osteoblast-mediated bone formation, while the later and persistent effects on bone turnover may be more focused on the osteoclast.</p><p>While our observations of irisin’s effects on osteoblastogensis differ from other published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colaianni et al., 2014</xref>), it is important to note that both dose and duration of irisin exposure may be critical determinants of the skeletal response and hence be responsible for phenotypic differences. For example, from our gene expression studies, it is clear that the activity of the <italic>Mck</italic> promoter for <italic>Fndc5</italic> is very high at 2 months but waned with age, albeit still maintaining relatively increased levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This exposure difference may impact skeletal cell responsiveness as noted by an earlier study demonstrating suppressed osteoclastogenesis in vitro with supraphysiologic levels of irisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marino et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we found that 20 ng/mL irisin had little effect on osteoclast number in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), and initial experiments with doses of irisin equal or exceeding 100 ng/mL actually showed reduced osteoclast numbers (data not shown). Our previous work demonstrated that irisin concentrations in humans are approximately 2–4 ng/mL but increase to 10 ng/mL or more with exercise, a dose range we employed for the in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jedrychowski et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, both dosing and timing relative to developmental age may be determinants of irisin’s function as a dynamic signaling molecule in the skeleton, and its actions on specific bone cell types. It should be noted that the relatively narrow dose range for stimulating osteoclastogenesis could have physiologic implications since exercise induces rapid changes in serum calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ng et al., 2018</xref>). If irisin targets both osteoclasts and osteocytes, it may serve as another counter-regulatory hormone to maintain serum calcium during the early phases of exercise much like parathyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our studies provide more evidence that irisin mediates muscle-bone crosstalk by regulating bone remodeling. While further studies are necessary to fully elucidate irisin’s mechanism of action on the osteoclast and to resolve contrasting cellular effects observed between cell types and experimental models, it remains clear that this myokine is a potent regulator of bone remodeling that is able to both act directly on all key cell types of the bone remodeling unit, and potentially modulate signaling between them.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male/female)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td>Wild type mouse line</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>RAW 264.7</td><td>ATCC</td><td>TIB-71</td><td>Cryopreserved monocyte cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Integrin aVb5 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab78289, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1566022">AB_1566022</ext-link></td><td>Neutralizing antibody (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Irisin</td><td>Lake Pharma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2018</xref></td><td>N/A (custom)</td><td>10 his-tag recombinant from HEK 293 cells</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>RANKL, recombinant human</td><td>PeproTech</td><td>310–01</td><td>Osteoclast growth factor</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>M-CSF, recombinant murine</td><td>PeproTech</td><td>315–02</td><td>Osteoclast growth factor</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Acid Phosphatase Kit</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>387A</td><td>TRAP assay</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Corning Osteo Assay</td><td>VWR</td><td>89184–614</td><td>Resorption assay</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>OsteoLyse Assay Kit</td><td>Lonza</td><td>PA-1500</td><td>Resorption assay</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism 8</td><td>Graphpad</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td>Statistics/graphing software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FIJI</td><td>NIH</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td>Image analysis software</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Primary osteoclast culture</title><p>Primary murine osteoclasts were differentiated and cultured in vitro by the following methods.

Slices were then moved into 96-well plates and cultured as described above. At day 7, dentin slices were TRAP stained and imaged as described for osteoclast counts. TRAP+ osteoclasts were visualized on the dentin surface via a top-down microscope used for histomorphometry analysis, with bright light illumination provided from below, through the thin dentin slice. To image the underlying resorption pits, the dentin slices were then sonicated briefly to removed cells and stained with toluidine blue to visualize resorption pits by previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vesprey and Yang, 2016</xref>) on the same microscope. Briefly, each slice was placed face-down on a 20 µL drop of 1% toluidine blue solution (in 1% sodium borate 10-hydrate solution with distilled water) for 4 min and then rinsed and allowed to air dry before imaging and manual calculation of total pit areas for blinded images in ImageJ. Toluidine-stained pits were clearly identifiable on the dentin surface as rounded features with dark edges and were manually traced in Image J to generate binary thresholded masks from which the total area was calculated. Confirmation experiments were performed with the Osteo Assay resorption assay (Corning Inc, Corning, NY), whereby osteoclasts were cultured on the substrate treated 96-well plates by the previously described methods, then removed with 10% bleach and the substrate was stained with von Kossa stain (Sigma-Aldrich). Imaging of the wells on a dissecting scope with backlighting allowed visualization of pits, and automated area calculations based on binary thresholded masks of the images. To determine earlier time-point resorption, the OsteoLyse assay (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was employed, utilizing the same osteoclast culture methods on a collagen substrate, whereby detection of carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) allows for relative quantification of degraded collagen as an indicator of resorptive activity.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor.

In this study, the authors have observed a decrease in osteoblasts and an increase in osteoclasts and concomitant decrease in mineralized surface (MS/BS).</p><p>2) Another concern is related to the bone histomorphometry (Figure 4B). There is a clear reduction in BV/TV, which seems to be driven more by a reduction in the MS/BS and osteoblast numbers (p values close to 0.05) than by increased osteoclast numbers. The increase in osteoclast progenitors in the FNDC5 Tg mice is consistent with the authors' hypothesis. The authors should address this in the Discussion – perhaps the most likely explanation is that there may be a more robust increase in bone resorption and osteoclast numbers earlier in life (the mice were analyzed at 4.5 months). If data on younger mice are available, these should be provided; if not, this issue should at least be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58172.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-designed study of the effects of Irisin on osteoclastogenesis that reports the effects of dosing and timing of Irisin on osteoclast number, morphology, and integrin α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub> expression in vitro.

In response to the summary, we acknowledge the lack of in-depth mechanistic insights in this study but note the novelty of these findings in regard to previously uncharacterized effects of irisin on a key cell type in bone homeostasis, the osteoclast. We therefore feel that the study stands on its own while also setting the foundation for more detailed mechanistic studies that are currently in planning and underway. Below, we address each of the specific critiques in turn, with rationale and reference to corresponding changes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show validation of the transgenic mouse in terms of the quantitative changes in Fndc5 or Irisin expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised Figure 4 to more clearly demonstrate the validation of the transgenic forced expression of FNDC5 by showing quantitative increases in whole-bone mRNA expression of FNDC5 in tibia at both 4.5 and 13 months of age (Figure 4A). To establish the characterization of this transgenic model more completely we have further included data at earlier and later timepoints where available, at 2 and 13 months for µCT (Figure 4B) and at 13 months for histomorphometry (Figure 4C) (see Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is important given that the in vivo data contradicts to the previously published results that reported Irisin increases bone mass and cortical bone thickness.

We have endeavored to address contradictions with previously published results throughout the Discussion (Results and Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another concern is related to the bone histomorphometry (Figure 4B).

We have now included µCT data for an earlier time point at 2 months, which does indeed also show a reduction in trabecular and cortical bone, and smaller bone area in transgenic mice. We have added the histomorphometry data at this earlier time point to gain insight into osteoblasts and osteoclasts relative to bone changes. In sum for the revised manuscript we included µCT at three time points (2, 4.5 and 13 months) and dynamic histomorphometry at two time points (2 months and 13 months). The original submission noted that histomorphometry was done at 4.5 months; that was in error, it was performed on 2-month-old mice and corresponds with the µCT at that time point. As noted, we have now also included in vitro osteoblast differentiation cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors from 2-3-month wild type and transgenic mice and found no increase in osteoblast differentiation or mineralization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Similarly, in vitro osteoblast differentiation of wild type bone marrow progenitors showed no effect of the continuous exogenous treatment with 10 ng/mL irisin that was shown to stimulate osteoclast differentiation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>These in vitro osteoblast findings have been included in the Discussion to inform interpretation on the respective roles on osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the transgenic model. In the transgenic model itself, the decrease in osteoblast numbers and bone formation at 2 months did not persist at 13 months, when it showed a slight but nonsignificant increase possibly related to the increase in osteoclast number (Figure 4C). At the earlier time points, osteoclast numbers did not differ by genotype, whereas by 13 months, there were more osteoclasts per bone surface in the transgenic. While the level of irisin exposure with exogenous treatment in vitro and forced FNDC5 expression in vivo are not directly comparable, these data together suggest that irisin influences both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation throughout skeletal development. A more complete discussion of these data and the insights they may provide into the respective roles of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in response to irisin have been worked into the Discussion (Results and Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
