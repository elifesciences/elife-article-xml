However, a clear effect of sleep deprivation on aggressive behaviors remains unclear. We find that acute sleep deprivation profoundly suppresses aggressive behaviors in the fruit fly, while other social behaviors are unaffected. This suppression is recovered following post-deprivation sleep rebound, and occurs regardless of the approach to achieve sleep loss. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches suggest octopamine signaling transmits changes in aggression upon sleep deprivation, and reduced aggression places sleep-deprived flies at a competitive disadvantage for obtaining a reproductive partner. These findings demonstrate an interaction between two phylogenetically conserved behaviors, and suggest that previous sleep experiences strongly modulate aggression with consequences for reproductive fitness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07643.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07643.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07643.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We know from personal experience that sleepless nights can change the way we behave, sometimes making us more irritable and less adept at social interactions. However, it can be difficult to establish cause and effect: does a lack of sleep lead to altered behavior, or vice versa? The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is a popular model organism for studying questions like this because its neural circuitry is relatively well understood.</p><p>To explore the effects of lack of sleep on social behaviors, and in particular on aggression, Kayser et al. disrupted the sleep of male fruit flies using various techniques, such as shaking them during the night, and then observed how they behaved. The experiments revealed that sleep-deprived flies were less aggressive than flies with undisturbed sleep. Furthermore, sleep-deprived male flies were less successful at mating with female flies when they were in direct competition with a rested male fly. Normal behavior was restored when the sleep-deprived flies were allowed to recover lost sleep for as little as six hours before the next aggression assay.</p><p>To investigate how sleep loss leads to a decrease in aggressive behavior, Kayser et al. used different drugs to treat the sleep-deprived flies. A drug activating the equivalent of the noradrenergic system in flies helped them to recover normal fighting behaviors despite a lack of sleep. In mammals, noradrenaline is a chemical that affects heart rate, sleep-wake patterns, aggression and a number of other phenomena.</p><p>Although aggressive behavior is often perceived as negative in humans, it can be important for survival. Human brains and behaviors are obviously more complex than those of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, learning more about the neuronal circuits that control sleep and social behavior in fruit flies may lead to an improved understanding of these phenomena in humans and, in the longer term, the development of drugs that can influence or modulate aggressive behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07643.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07643.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>octopamine</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>sleep deprivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 NS090461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL07713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single night of sleep deprivation suppresses fighting behaviors in male fruit flies, with consequent impairments in reproductive fitness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insufficient sleep impairs a wide range of essential processes such as cognition, alertness, metabolic activity, and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster and Wulff, 2005</xref>). In addition, sleep disruptions influence emotional processing and can modulate affective state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banks and Dinges, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Minkel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2012</xref>). Work over many decades has suggested an interaction between sleep loss and changes in aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamphuis et al., 2012</xref>), but even basic questions such as directionality of effect remain unresolved. Chronic enforced wakefulness or selective REM sleep deprivation have been linked to increased aggression in rodents, although in both cases it is not possible to distinguish the potential effect of sleep loss from prolonged physical activity and/or increased stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamphuis et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, work in humans indicates that while measures of irritability increase with insufficient sleep, aggression itself is unaffected or reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamphuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cote et al., 2013</xref>). While human aggression often carries a negative connotation, it can provide a competitive advantage and thereby promote survival. However, dysregulated aggression and violence are significant public health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2012</xref>), as is chronic sleep insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Czeisler, 2013</xref>), emphasizing the need to understand how these two processes affect one another.</p><p>Both sleep and aggression are conserved across phylogeny. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been established as a powerful model system for deconstructing the cellular and molecular basis of aggression, yielding novel insights into the neural basis of fighting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Flies also exhibit sleep-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>) and, in response to sleep deprivation, demonstrate deficits in behaviors like learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seugnet et al., 2008</xref>). Whether sleep and aggression interact in the fly is unknown. Monoamines such as octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>), which is the insect analog of norepinephrine, and dopamine are potent regulators of arousal in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andretic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kume et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>). Distinct subpopulations of neurons of each type appear to independently modulate sleep and aggression. For octopamine, ASM neurons in the medial protocerebrum govern wake-promoting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>), while VUM cells in the anterior or posterior brain control social behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Certel et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2007</xref>) or fighting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), respectively. Regarding dopamine, neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body control sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), and a number of distinct clusters modulate aggression, including PPM3 and T1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>). In sum, both of these signaling systems would be well positioned to integrate information regarding internal state and environmental demand to optimize behavioral output at a given time. Sleep serves numerous vital functions, but aggression is also a critical behavior for acquisition of food, reproduction, and predator defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2012</xref>). Disrupting sleep processes might impair the function of neuronal controls underlying aggression.</p><p>Using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we find that acute sleep deprivation strongly suppresses aggressive behaviors, while other social behaviors are unaffected. Reduced aggression occurs with different forms of sleep deprivation and is reversible with sufficient recovery sleep. Pharmacologic experiments reveal that an octopamine agonist specifically restores aggression in sleep-deprived flies, and we use genetic approaches to suggest that sleep loss itself, rather than manipulation of aggression neurons, is required for changes to aggression. Finally, we demonstrate that sleep deprived flies are at a disadvantage for reproductive success when competing against flies whose sleep has been unperturbed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute sleep deprivation suppresses aggression</title><p>To test how sleep deprivation affects aggressive behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we focused on 4–7 day old Canton-S (CS) males in social isolation since shortly after eclosion. Flies were acutely sleep deprived for 12 hr overnight using mechanical stimulation, and aggression assays were performed the following morning, either by pairing flies within the same condition or pairing one control fly with a sleep-deprived fly (‘between conditions’, for which males of each condition were tracked with a small dot of paint on the thorax). We found that acute sleep deprivation resulted in a profound suppression of aggression in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In assays between deprived and non-deprived flies, non-deprived flies showed frequent lunges and were nearly always dominant over deprived flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, flies that were sleep deprived overnight rarely lunged, even when attacked by a non-deprived fly, suggesting suppression of reactive aggression by sleep deprivation. In assays between 2 sleep-deprived flies, the males engaged in aggressive behaviors significantly less often than pairs of control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1, 2</xref>). The reduced aggression within condition did not simply derive from lack of social encounters, as sleep-deprived and control pairs spent similar amounts of time interacting during the beginning of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); sleep-deprived flies could also be observed throughout the assay in close proximity without engaging in fighting behaviors, which rarely occurred in control flies. When lunging did occur, the latency to first lunge in pairs of sleep-deprived flies following initial social encounter was markedly increased compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and dominance was rarely established. Together, these results suggest deficits in both proactive and reactive aggression, and demonstrate that sleep deprivation negatively impacts fighting behaviors.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07643.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acute sleep deprivation suppresses aggressive behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of aggression (lunge count) in control or sleep deprived male CS flies. ‘Between conditions’ indicates fights between a control fly and a sleep-deprived fly; ‘within condition’ is a fight between 2 sleep-deprived or 2 control flies. ‘Daytime deprivation’ and ‘recovery’ refers to fights between conditions (n = 16, 16, 9, 10, 10, 8, 14, 9 from left to right).

The CS males used in our experiments show high sleep amounts during both day (450.77 ± 77.09 min) and night (528.91 ± 109.74 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), allowing us to test day and night sleep requirements. Mechanical sleep deprivation for 11 hr during the day with fighting assays performed during the final hour of the light period also reduced aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and shifted dominance towards non-deprived flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that timing of sleep loss to day or night is not critical. How much sleep loss is required to affect subsequent fighting behaviors? We mechanically sleep deprived flies for the final 1, 3, or 6 hr(s) of the night, followed by aggression assays the next morning. Focusing on assays within condition, we found that 6 hr of sleep loss resulted in suppression of fighting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) similar to 12 hr of sleep loss. However, sleep deprivation for the final 1 or 3 hr(s) of the night caused no reduction in fighting behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the timeframe of sleep loss required for learning deficits in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seugnet et al., 2008</xref>). To control for the possibility that mechanical stimulation/fatigue and not sleep loss per se is responsible for reduced aggression, we mechanically stimulated flies for a 6 hr period spanning the final 3 hr of night and first 3 hr of day. During this time, flies exhibit more wake in comparison to the final 6 hr of the night, only losing ∼3 hr of sleep (sleep lost = 186.72 ± 61.03 in night/day transition; sleep during final 6 hr of night = 293.41 ± 61.49). Continuous stimulation for 6 hr during the night/day transition period did not affect subsequent fighting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that sleep deprivation and not mechanical stimulation is responsible for suppression of aggression.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that acute sleep deprivation caused permanent impairment of aggressive behaviors, we examined lunging after 12 hr of overnight mechanical sleep deprivation followed by a 24 hr recovery period. Fighting returned to baseline levels with 1 day recovery after sleep loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and dominance was equally likely for a previously sleep-deprived or non-deprived fly when paired against one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, neither sleep deprivation, nor the mechanical stimulation used to deprive, result in injury to the fly or long-lasting impairment. Next, we further investigated the timeframe for recovery following 12 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation. Deprived or control flies were assessed within condition at 1, 3, 6, or 9 hr after overnight sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Following 1 and 3 hr of recovery sleep, aggression was still markedly suppressed. By 6 hr we observed recovery of fighting behaviors, with lunge counts no longer significantly reduced compared to the 6 hr control group. 9 hr after the end of sleep deprivation, levels of aggression remained indistinguishable from controls. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>), we detected no differences in baseline aggression in control groups throughout the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Do other methods of sleep deprivation similarly influence aggression? We noted sleep in CS males to be exquisitely sensitive to high temperatures, with near total sleep loss when exposed to 31°C overnight. Temperature-dependent sleep deprivation also resulted in reduced lunging with aggression assays performed the following morning at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that suppressed aggression is not specific to mechanical sleep deprivation. To examine whether sleep deprivation in the fly indiscriminately impairs other complex motor programs, we tested if courtship between a socially naive male and virgin female is affected. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seugnet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kayser et al., 2014</xref>), 12 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation during the night had no effect on courtship behavior the following morning as measured by courtship index or copulation frequency over a 10 min period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, a distinct complex behavior remains intact following acute sleep loss, suggesting that like learning and memory, aggression is a specific behavior that is impaired following sleep deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bifunctional role of octopamine in sleep and aggression</title><p>Octopamine and dopamine have been implicated in controlling both sleep/arousal and aggressive behaviors. We examined whether either of these monoamines play a role in coupling sleep deprivation to changes in aggression. First, we asked how thermogenetic sleep deprivation via overnight activation of octopaminergic or dopaminergic neurons affects next day fighting. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> thermosensitive cation channel <italic>dTrpA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) was expressed using <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> (octopamine neurons) or <italic>TH-GAL4</italic> (dopamine neurons), and flies were exposed to 29°C for 12 hr overnight. Activation of neurons using either GAL4 line resulted in near total sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); importantly, overnight exposure to 29°C in flies lacking either the GAL4 or UAS did not impact sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), in contrast to CS males exposed to 31°C. Aggression was assessed the following morning at 23°C, below the threshold for TrpA1 activation. Sleep deprivation by activation of Tdc2+ or TH+ neurons caused a significant suppression of aggression the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), while genetic and temperature controls with normal prior sleep showed no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results suggest that perturbation of octopamine and/or dopamine signaling as a result of sleep deprivation could impair aggressive behaviors. Using a pharmacologic approach we tested whether octopamine or dopamine agonists rescue reduced aggression. Flies were fed the octopamine agonist chlordimeform (CDM) or the dopamine agonist L-DOPA leading up to aggression assays that were preceded by thermogenetic sleep deprivation. CDM, but not L-DOPA, rescued aggression following sleep deprivation via activation of Tdc2+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, CDM also rescued aggression following sleep deprivation via activation of TH+ neurons, while L-DOPA did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This effect is not specific to thermogenetic sleep deprivation, as CDM alone rescued aggression after mechanical sleep deprivation as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that aggression-relevant octopamine function is compromised downstream of sleep deprivation signals, regardless of method of sleep loss.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07643.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Octopamine agonist CDM rescues reduced aggression following sleep deprivation.</title><p>Quantification of aggression at 23°C in <italic>Tdc2-GAL4&gt;UAS-TrpA1</italic> or <italic>TH-GAL4&gt;UAS-TrpA1</italic> males that were thermogenetically sleep-deprived the prior night at 29°C (SD, red bars) or remained at 21°C (Ctrl, white/gray bars) (n = 10, 16, 10, 12 from left to right).

Previous work has shown that social experience through group housing of flies also dramatically reduces aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), and we examined if a shared mechanism suppresses fighting in both cases. In contrast to sleep deprivation, reduced aggression secondary to group housing was similarly rescued either by CDM or L-DOPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the drugs can function comparably to rescue aggression depending on the method of suppression. Moreover, while sleep deprivation and social experience both suppress aggression, they appear to do so through distinct though potentially overlapping mechanisms.</p><p>Does sleep deprivation itself suppress aggression, or does reduced fighting stem from decreased locomotor activity after sleep loss? Following thermogenetic sleep deprivation we quantified motor activity. As expected, sleep-deprived flies were less active than non-deprived controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), presumably due to increased homeostatic sleep drive. While only CDM rescued aggressive behaviors following sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we found that both CDM and L-DOPA rescued locomotor activity back to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these experiments dissociate motor activity from aggression following sleep deprivation, and indicate that sleep loss itself impairs aggressive behaviors.</p><p>A group of 2–4 Tdc2+ neurons in the posterior fly brain within the VUM cluster near the suboesophageal (SOG) ganglion have been implicated in the role of octopamine modulation of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>).

Suppressed aggression following overnight activation of all Tdc2+ neurons with TrpA1 might be independent of sleep deprivation, and derive from hyperstimulation and subsequent quiescence of the Tdc2+ Cha- aggression cells. To rule out this possibility, we activated these neurons for 12 hr overnight at 29°C, followed by next day aggression assays at 23°C. Activation of Tdc2+ Cha- neurons did not cause sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with research localizing the wake-promoting octopamine neurons to dorsal brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, sustained activation of Tdc2+ Cha- neurons also did not impair aggression the following day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Non-deprived flies were frequently observed to interrupt courtship activities of the other male, and at times, engage in fighting behaviors away from the female altogether. These behaviors were less frequently observed between sleep-deprived males. To quantify the reduced male–male competition for a female mate in sleep-deprived flies, we determined the percent of time that the 2 males and 1 female were observed clustered together or in a ‘chain’ formation, with both males actively courting the female concurrently. During these periods, males were clearly observed to engage in low intensity fighting behaviors like fencing, which sometimes escalated to brief high intensity tussling or lunging. We found that in non-deprived flies, 26% of time in the assay was spent in chains or clusters; this was reduced to 17.2% in pairs of sleep-deprived males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3 media4">Videos 3, 4</xref>), suggesting that competitive social interactions are reduced following sleep deprivation.

Does reduced aggression following sleep deprivation have a functional consequence on reproductive fitness in a competitive environment? We paired control and mechanically sleep-deprived CS males together with a virgin female and assayed copulation success. Males of each condition were tracked with a dot of paint on the thorax. In these assays, we found that control flies were more likely to ‘win’ copulation with the female compared to sleep deprived flies (∼63% vs 37%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The suppression of aggression is independent of the method used to induce sleep loss and reversible with sufficient recovery sleep. We provide evidence that octopamine plays a role in mediating reduced aggression levels following sleep loss, and we find using competitive courtship assays that sleep deprivation places flies at a disadvantage for reproductive success due to insufficient aggression towards competing males. These results demonstrate that aggression is a specific social behavior that becomes dysregulated by sleep deprivation.</p><p>Subjective experience in humans indicates that irritability increases with insufficient sleep, which is supported by validated measures of emotional reactivity and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banks and Dinges, 2007</xref>); however, irritability and aggression are likely dissociable in higher organisms. While there are well-validated measures of aggression as a lifetime personality trait, tools to measure changes to aggression in humans over relatively short-time periods (hours to days) are less well-established, as is measuring irritability in animal models independent of overt behavioral expression. Most human studies of the interaction between sleep and aggression have been correlational and utilized self-reported measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamphuis et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, more recent human work is informative regarding dissociation of irritability and/or impulsivity from aggression itself: research supports a reduced capacity to inhibit impulsivity to negative stimuli after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Platten, 2011</xref>), while a study designed to measure reactive aggression in sleep-deprived men reported diminished aggression in response to provocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cote et al., 2013</xref>). The rodent literature supports the contrasting hypothesis that sleep insufficiency leads to <italic>increased</italic> aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kamphuis et al., 2012</xref>). These differences might result from confounds such as the impact of sustained activity or stress rather than sleep deprivation per se, or REM sleep loss vs total sleep loss. Regardless, while the repertoire of emotional experience and output in humans is far more complex than in a laboratory animal, the central effect of sleep deprivation on aggression appears to be conserved between flies and humans.</p><p>Segregating stress effects from sleep loss itself when sleep-depriving animals—including humans—presents obstacles. Using multiple types of sleep deprivation stimuli combined with genetic manipulations, our data suggest that the impact of sleep deprivation on aggression is causally related to sleep loss. Nonetheless, experimental paradigms that prevent sleep in the face of heightened sleep need are inherently stressful to an animal. The specificity with which aggressive social interactions are impaired as opposed to all social behaviors serves as a strong indicator that the effects we observe are not simply part of a broader stress response; moreover, other stressors are known to negatively impact courtship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patton and Krebs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christie et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that courtship is not uniquely immune to stress-related impairment.</p><p>Aggression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has long been appreciated to play a role in mate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sturtevant, 1915</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dow and von Schilcher, 1975</xref>). Male flies fight more in the presence of a female, and recent work has shown that prior exposure to a female suppresses this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>); the aforementioned study focused on aggressive behaviors occurring after male flies copulate with females in the arena, suggesting that aggression may function both to obtain a reproductive partner and possibly guard that partner after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that even in the setting of sleep deprivation, male flies will successfully court a female partner in the absence of competition. However, when competing for a female mate against a non-deprived control male, sleep deprivation impairs sexual fitness, likely due to reduced aggression towards the other male: pharmacologic restoration of aggression with an octopamine agonist likewise rescues sexual fitness. Importantly, reduced performance in the competitive copulation assay occurs in males that were isolated since eclosion, eliminating the possibility that previously-established hierarchical cues are involved and emphasizing the crucial role of sleep for normal function.</p><p>Sleep loss is required for subsequent suppressed aggression, while prolonged prior excitation of aggression-relevant neurons has no effect on fighting the following day. How is sleep need conveyed to aggression loci? Our results implicate octopaminergic signaling in this process, and suggest that neurons involved in setting aggression levels, but not male choice between courtship and aggressive behaviors, are specifically impacted: while intermale aggression is reduced with sleep deprivation, intermale courtship is not, by default, increased. Norepinephrine, the mammalian analog of insect octopamine, has a critical role in aggression in vertebrates; noradrenergic neurons are also important regulators of sleep-wake transitions. Identification of specific cellular subpopulations whose output is altered by sleep deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> will enable mapping the neural circuits that relay sleep information to aggression centers, as well as investigation of the molecular signals that control deprivation-dependent changes to octopamine aggression neurons. The conserved cellular substrates of these behaviors between flies and mammals suggest such findings will be of relevance to understanding the neurobiological basis of aggression and impairment after sleep loss. In sum, our results indicate that two innate behaviors—sleep and aggression—are coupled, and suggest that molecular signals generated by sleep deprivation might be potential targets for selective modification of aggressive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>TH-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Cha-GAL80</italic> are from laboratory stocks, and were outcrossed 8× into a <italic>w1118;CS</italic> background (gift from D Anderson).

Locomotor activity was monitored using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitoring (DAM) system (Trikinetics, Waltham MA). Activity was measured in 1 min bins and sleep was identified as 5 min of consolidated inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). Data was processed using PySolo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilestro and Cirelli, 2009</xref>). Mechanical sleep deprivation was accomplished using a Trikinetics vortexer mounting plate, with shaking of monitors for 2 s randomly within every 20 s window for 12 hr during the night. Temperature-dependent sleep deprivation in CS males was at 31°C during the night; thermogenetic sleep deprivation was at 29°C. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, locomotor activity was quantified as total number of beam breaks from ZT1-2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Aggression assays</title><p>Flies were moved into isolation tubes (5 ml tubes, Falcon 352002) shortly after eclosion unless otherwise specified. Following sleep assays in DAM tubes, flies recovered for 30 min in isolation on regular food in isolation tubes, and then were moved to aggression arenas by gentle aspiration. Aggression assays were performed and scored as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Certel and Kravitz, 2012</xref>) with minor modifications. Assays consisted of fights between 2 males in 1 well of a 12 well plate with a food cup in the center. Yeast paste or a buried headless female were placed in the center of the cup, which was well lit. The sides of each arena were coated in Fluon (Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and lid with Rain-X (ITW Global Brands, Houston, TX). Fights were recorded from above using a video camera (Sony HDR-CX210) and lunges scored manually, blind to condition. For fights between conditions (and all competitive copulation experiments) male flies were labeled with a small dot of acrylic paint at least 24 hr prior to the assay; the paint color for each condition was randomized between experiments. Lunge count for ‘between condition’ assays (control vs SD) was quantified separately for each fly of the designated condition; lunge count ‘within condition’ was quantified as the combined number of lunges from both flies in the assay. Dominance (scored only in ‘between condition’ assays) was determined as repeated lunges by one fly followed by retreat of the other to the edge of the cup or off the cup altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alekseyenko et al., 2014</xref>). All assays were performed for 30 min at 25°C and 40–60% humidity unless otherwise specified. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, social interaction was defined as time spent with the flies within 1 body length of one another. Interaction was quantified during the first 5 min of the assay or until first lunge, whichever occurred first. For pharmacologic rescue experiments, flies were fed chlordimeform (CDM; 0.05 mg/ml; Sigma) or L-DOPA (3 mg/ml; R&amp;D Systems) mixed into 5% sucrose and 2% agar beginning ∼4 hr prior to lights off, and continued to feed on the drug throughout the night (during 12 hr of thermogenetic sleep deprivation or mechanical sleep deprivation during the final 6 hr of night). At ZT0 (end of sleep deprivation), flies recovered for 1 hr on drug/control mixed into regular food at the same concentration prior to aggression assays at ZT1. For group-housing experiments, males were raised in groups of 10 flies for 4–5 days, then isolated on drug/control for 20 hr prior to assay at ZT1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Courtship assays</title><p>Virgin male flies were collected shortly after eclosion and housed in isolation. Female CS virgins (3–7 days post eclosion) were used in all courtship assays. Following sleep assays, flies recovered for 30 min in isolation on regular food, and then a male and female were gently aspirated into a well-lit porcelain mating chamber (25 mm diameter and 10 mm depth) covered with a glass slide. Courtship index (CI) was determined as the percentage of total amount of time a male was engaged in courtship activity during a period of 10 min or until successful copulation. Copulation frequency was calculated as percentage of flies in each condition that successfully copulated during the 10 min assay. For ‘within condition’ competitive courtship assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), 2 males and 1 virgin female were loaded into 1 well of a 12 well plate containing 5 ml of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Certel et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2007</xref>). Courtship and copulation measures were determined for the male first demonstrating sustained courtship (&gt;20 s) towards the female. Assays were recorded and scored blind to experimental condition. For competitive courtship assays between conditions, one male fly of each condition (control or deprived) and 1 virgin female were aspirated into a well, and the male that first copulated with the female was determined the ‘winner’. Experiments were scored blind to condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry and imaging</title><p>Brains were dissected in PBS, fixed in 4%PFA for 30 min at room temperature, and cleaned of remaining tissue in 0.3% PBST.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), Leslie Griffith, a Reviewing editor, and two additional reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper looks at the linkage between sleep deprivation and aggression. The mammalian literature has both human studies and rodent studies, but no clear consensus for the relationship has emerged – different studies report increased, unchanged or decreased aggression. Potentially the roles of stress and context may explain some of this variability, but examining the question in flies where there are relatively robust and standardized conditions to assess both is an opportunity to shed light on how sleep deprivation might affect aggression and the mechanisms that underlie the linkage. This paper provides a clear result suggesting that sleep deprivation decreases aggression without disrupting other complex behaviors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors want to suggest that social amelioration of aggression and sleep deprivation's anti-aggression effects are mechanistically different based on the ability of an OA agonist, but not a DA agonist, to rescue <italic>dTrpA1</italic> SD from either <italic>Tdc2</italic> or TH driver. All the reviewers were concerned that thermogenetic sleep deprivation might represent a special case of sleep deprivation since the brain is flooded with bioaminergic NT for 12h and there can be lasting effects. If there is truly a distinction between the roles of OA and DA in aggression after sleep deprivation, the pharmacology should also hold for high temp sleep deprivation and mechanical sleep dep. Without those data it is really not appropriate to make the general statement that “sleep deprivation” is different than shared housing – you need to do all types of deprivation to make this claim, which is a central point of the paper.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Why are there regular 2h oscillations in all the sleep data? To my knowledge there is no ultradian rhythm to sleep and this suggests strongly to me that there was some external disturbance of sleep in all these experiments. Were they all done the same incubator? Are light or temperature levels oscillating with the same rhythm? The data shown in this paper are clearly not taken in constant conditions and while this may not affect the outcome of the experiments it is not completely clear to me that it wouldn't. Retaking one or two key data sets in conditions that are truly constant would allay this concern.</p><p>2) Can the authors clarify how they distinguish treatment groups in assays where different types of males are compared to one another. The text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> indicates that they used painted dots. Is this also true for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?

Consistent with results following thermogenetic sleep deprivation, we find that CDM but not L-DOPA rescues fighting after mechanical sleep deprivation. This experiment confirms that selectivity of the OA agonist to rescue aggression is not specific to a single mode of sleep loss.</p><p>To provide further evidence that thermogenetic and mechanical sleep deprivation engage similar mechanisms, we now also show that thermogenetic sleep deprivation (like mechanical) results in impaired performance in a competitive copulation assay the following day. Moreover, we demonstrate that the OA agonist but not DA agonist rescues sexual fitness following sleep deprivation, consistent with rescue of aggression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p><italic>Minor points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Why are there regular 2h oscillations in all the sleep data?

Retaking one or two key data sets in conditions that are truly constant would allay this concern</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. The sleep plots are noisy due to the small number of flies used – the noise looks most prominent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. In both instances, a single experiment with a small number of flies was used to generate the sleep plot; not all flies from each independent experiment that generates the lunging data are represented in these sleep traces. Both of those particular sleep plots come from experiments run at nearly the same time. While we agree it looks as though there are regular oscillations, we have confirmed by environmental monitors that temperature, humidity, and light are constant. It is possible that incubator fan noise or vibration contributed to that pattern. However, we now present new sleep plots from experiments run at a different time that make clear there are no ultradian rhythms in our experiments. These sleep experiments are from flies that yield the same effect on aggression as the noisier plots previously displayed.</p><p><italic>2) Can the authors clarify how they distinguish treatment groups in assays where different types of males are compared to one another.
