Adult pluripotent stem cells drive this ability, but how injury activates and directs stem cells into the appropriate lineages is unclear. Here we describe a single-organ regeneration assay in which ejection of the planarian pharynx is selectively induced by brief exposure of animals to sodium azide. To identify genes required for pharynx regeneration, we performed an RNAi screen of 356 genes upregulated after amputation, using successful feeding as a proxy for regeneration. We found that knockdown of 20 genes caused a wide range of regeneration phenotypes and that RNAi of the forkhead transcription factor <italic>FoxA</italic>, which is expressed in a subpopulation of stem cells, specifically inhibited regrowth of the pharynx. Selective amputation of the pharynx therefore permits the identification of genes required for organ-specific regeneration and suggests an ancient function for FoxA-dependent transcriptional programs in driving regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02238.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02238.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02238.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some animals can regrow whole limbs or organs after amputation. Flatworms called planaria, for example, can regenerate their whole body from small pieces. This remarkable ability depends on neoblasts—a type of stem cell found in planaria that can detect damaged or lost organs, migrate to the site of damage, produce the required cells, and integrate into the remaining tissues. Researchers hope that studying these animals will reveal ways to use stem cells to regenerate injured limbs or organs in humans.</p><p>Planaria have been used in many studies of regeneration. However, manually amputating organs from the flatworms is time-consuming and the resulting wounds vary, which makes it hard to compare regeneration between animals treated in different ways.</p><p>Now, Adler et al. have developed a new technique for studying regeneration in planaria. Placing the flatworms briefly into a solution of sodium azide causes the pharynx—an organ that is used for both eating and excretion–to drop off. Using chemicals in this way means the loss of the pharynx leaves a uniform wound, with no damage to the adjacent digestive system, and that large numbers of planaria with identical wounds can be produced rapidly. To ensure that treatment with sodium azide did not alter normal regeneration processes in planaria, Adler et al. carried out manual amputation of tissue in sodium azide-treated flatworms; regeneration in these flatworms was identical to that seen in untreated planaria.</p><p>Planaria in which the pharynx had been removed by sodium azide exposure showed rapid recruitment of neoblasts to the wound site, where they formed epidermal, muscle and nerve cells, and organized into a functioning pharynx within a few days. Adler et al. then identified 20 genes that were required for various stages of regeneration. These experiments revealed that a transcription factor (a protein that controls gene expression) called FoxA was specifically required for the regrowth of the pharynx. This is a previously unknown function for FoxA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02238.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02238.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>planaria</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>single-organ regeneration</kwd><kwd>pharynx</kwd><kwd><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R37GM057260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A chemical method has been developed for studying single organ regeneration and fate specification of stem cells in an adult organism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many organs in the human body have the potential to repair themselves after injury. For example, the hematopoietic system can replenish the entire blood in an animal from a single stem cell after bone marrow transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lagasse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shizuru et al., 2005</xref>), and hair follicle and epidermis can regenerate in mammals following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs and Segre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seifert et al., 2012</xref>). To initiate regeneration, stem cells must sense an injury, proliferate and differentiate appropriately, and replace the missing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poss, 2010</xref>). Stem cells (and in particular iPS cells) represent enormous potential for developing therapeutic treatments for disease. However, effective implementation of these technologies will require an improved understanding of stem cell activation and regulation in vivo.</p><p>Planarians are a classical system for studying regeneration. After amputation, even small fragments can support regrowth of entire animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1898</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>), indicating that the resident cells have the capacity to self-renew, and can replace all of the missing tissues comprising the animal (including muscle, nervous system, digestive system, excretory system and epithelial cells). This regenerative capacity depends on a population of stem cells termed neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>). These pluripotent cells are constantly dividing, driving replenishment of all cell types during homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pellettieri and Sánchez Alvarado, 2007</xref>). Upon amputation, neoblasts are stimulated to divide rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguñà, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reddien et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>) and begin to differentiate, but how these stem cells are regulated to produce only the tissues that need to be replaced is unclear.</p><p>One hypothesis for how stem cells can produce any tissue in the planarian body on demand is that these cells exhibit heterogeneity across the population, in terms of both gene expression and cell cycle status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rink, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reddien, 2013</xref>). Heterogeneity has been observed molecularly by gene expression-profiling of neoblasts purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>). Functional evidence of such heterogeneity is supported by single-cell transplantation experiments in which some, but not all, stem cells can repopulate and rescue animals lacking stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is unclear what percentage of the stem cell population is in fact pluripotent, or if these cells produce lineage-restricted stem cells. Recent studies have also demonstrated that discrete subpopulations of neoblasts express markers of differentiated tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scimone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, cell fate decisions can be established within neoblasts, but how this happens is unknown.</p><p>Normally contained within an internal cavity referred to as the pharyngeal pouch, the pharynx protrudes through a ventral opening upon sensing food or prey and ingests food by contractile peristalsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wulzen, 1917</xref>). The planarian pharynx serves as both the entrance and exit to the digestive system and is a complex organ consisting of multiple tissues including neurons, muscle, epithelial cells and secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishii, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacRae, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kido, 1964</xref>). The pharynx is a large cylindrical structure that clearly lacks dividing stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay and Coward, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orii et al., 2005</xref>). Previous experiments describing de novo pharynx regeneration in head and tail pieces have shown that mesenchymal cells adopt pharyngeal fate prior to accumulation in the nascent pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bueno et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebrià et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that neoblasts respond to the absence of the pharynx and produce cells of the pharyngeal lineage shortly after amputation. Pharynx regeneration is therefore an excellent model for understanding organ regeneration in general, beginning with pluripotent stem cells that differentiate into distinct cell types, which then integrate with pre-existing tissues to form a functional organ.</p><p>Here we describe a novel strategy for amputation of a single organ, the pharynx, and for studying its regeneration. Using feeding behavior as a quantitative assay for regeneration, we screened a library of transcripts upregulated during pharynx regeneration. We show that RNAi of these genes causes a wide range of regeneration phenotypes, and that the pioneer transcription factor FoxA, which functions in many organisms to specify endodermal organogenesis, is required for regeneration of the planarian pharynx. Taken together, this novel amputation strategy offers a defined context in which to measure and understand discrete changes in a stem cell population during regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemical amputation selectively removes the pharynx</title><p>In order to dissect the specific response to organ amputation, we sought to develop a method to selectively remove a single organ. We found that soaking animals in sodium azide for a brief period of time caused the pharynx to be extruded, and then dislodged completely from the rest of the animal following gentle agitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Because this amputation does not require surgery, the wound produced after chemical treatment is indistinguishable between animals. Within several days the pharynx regenerated, as visualized either in live animals or by hybridization with a pharynx-specific riboprobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cebrià et al., 2007</xref>). Other organs, including the gastrointestinal system, were unaffected at a gross morphological level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that sodium azide treatment causes selective amputation of the pharynx without noticeably perturbing other organs.

Histological analysis of the anatomical changes that occur during pharynx regeneration confirmed that chemical amputation causes detachment of the pharynx without affecting the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, white arrows). Within 24 hr of amputation, small, undifferentiated cells accumulate at the entry to the intestine, within the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, white arrowheads). Two days after amputation, these cells begin to organize, characterized by a layer of ciliated epithelial cells, a concentration of neurons, and a subepidermal muscle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Three days after amputation the lumenal connection to the intestine has been restored, radial symmetry has been re-established, and most genes expressed in the mature pharynx are present, including the secreted Frizzled-related protein <italic>sFRP-1</italic>, ciliary dynein heavy chain <italic>DNAH-β3</italic>, and two members of the Nou Darake family of FGF-receptor-like proteins <italic>ndk</italic> and <italic>ndl-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, following selective removal of the pharynx, animals regenerate all of the component tissues, in a similar sequence to what has been observed previously for de novo pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bueno et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebrià et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Even though the regeneration of chemically amputated pharynges appears to proceed normally by all histological and molecular measures, and 100% of animals regenerated pharynges after amputation (n &gt; 1000), we wished to further test whether the brief exposure to sodium azide during chemical amputation might cause secondary effects in regeneration, particularly soon after the treatment. To test the possibility that sodium azide broadly compromised regenerative potential, we performed transverse amputations in sodium azide. After washout, wound healing occurred normally, indicating that animals recovered rapidly from sodium azide treatment. Furthermore, in these regenerating fragments, the mitotic profile triggered by amputation during the early phase of regeneration was indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that sodium azide exposure does not significantly perturb the kinetics of regeneration in general and likely has minimal effects on pharynx regeneration in particular.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neoblasts are essential for pharynx regeneration</title><p>Exposure of animals to lethal doses of gamma-irradiation completely prevents stem cell division and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardeen and Baetjer, 1904</xref>). To confirm that pharynx regeneration also requires neoblasts, animals were lethally irradiated (10,000 rads γ-irradiation) prior to pharynx amputation. Radiation completely prevented pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in 100% of animals (n = 100 animals) indicating that, as expected, stem cells are required for regeneration. Furthermore, lethal irradiation inhibited the accumulation of cells at the wound site 24 hr after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the first cells to arrive at the wound site are either neoblasts or their descendants.

Because chemical amputation produces an internal wound but leaves the epithelium intact, we wondered whether it would elicit similar proliferation kinetics to other types of surgically-induced wounds. We quantified the number of mitoses in the animal during pharynx regeneration by staining planarians with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendzel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>). In the first 24 hr after amputation, we observed a sharp but transient decrease in overall mitotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), presumably due to the metabolic suppression effects of sodium azide. Overall, body-wide mitotic activity did not significantly change as regeneration progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). However, mitotic activity in the vicinity of the wound site appeared to increase 24 hr after amputation, although this effect diminished as regeneration proceeded. To confirm this observation, we quantified mitoses in each of two defined regions: one around the wound site and one posterior to the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, we found a significant enrichment of mitotic nuclei around the pharynx wound site, indicating that the proliferative response induced by pharynx removal generates a sufficiently powerful signal to induce and maintain proliferation where regeneration is necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Gene expression profiling of pharynx regeneration</title><p>We sought to define the molecular mechanisms driving pharynx regeneration by expression-profiling experiments.

Based on our observations that pharynx regeneration triggered a localized stem cell proliferative response, we isolated a plug of tissue surrounding the pharynx wound site in order to enrich for those transcripts most directly relevant to this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We extracted RNA at specific times during a window of time up to 72 hr post-amputation, and compared these samples to plugs isolated immediately after amputation (time 0). Because we aimed to identify transcripts that were essential for the initiation of pharynx regeneration, we first focused on genes upregulated during the first 24 hr after amputation. During this window, 718 genes were enriched upon pharynx removal (log<sub>2</sub> fold change&gt;0.4, adjusted p&lt;0.05) and we cloned 274 of these genes. We also cloned a second group of genes that were significantly upregulated at 48 and 72 hr after amputation, but not prior. An additional set of 82 genes were included based on consistent upregulation at both 48 and 72 hr after amputation, for a total of 356 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>To validate our microarray data, we examined the expression patterns of several upregulated genes during pharynx regeneration with whole-mount in situ hybridization.

Interestingly, expression of several of these genes was undetectable prior to amputation, but increased significantly afterward, mimicking the marked upregulation in transcription observed for wound-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>) and suggesting that chemical amputation does in fact stimulate a wound response. Two genes in this category (PDZ ring finger protein 4 and rhomboid) showed dramatic increases in the region surrounding the pharynx after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that these cells may broadly respond to pharynx removal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RNAi screen identifies genes required for pharynx regeneration</title><p>Because the pharynx is required for ingestion of food, we developed an assay that measures the recovery of feeding behavior after selective pharynx removal as a rapid and quantitative method to gauge the extent of pharyngeal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2001</xref>).

The RNAi screen identified eight genes that exhibited phenotypes consistent with a general function in stem cells. In addition to causing a strong inhibition of feeding and pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), knockdown of these eight genes severely compromised regeneration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and decreased mitotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, in situ hybridization for these transcripts demonstrated that they were expressed primarily in stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These genes include ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böser et al., 2013</xref>), the chromatin assembly factor Rbbp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonuccelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zeng et al., 2013</xref>), the G1/S-specific cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu and Pearson, 2013</xref>), the zinc finger-containing protein <italic>zmym-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>) and the RuvB DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>). Three other genes in this group have not been previously implicated in stem cell function in planarians. These genes include the DNA licensing factor MCM7, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF-3), and the Sumo-activating enzyme subunit 2 (SAE-2). Interestingly, SAE-2 was recently identified as a component of the stem cell proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böser et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our screen captured phenotypes for novel stem cell genes, indicating that this strategy can successfully identify genes acting at discrete and early steps in the process of regeneration.</p><p>The next group of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Specific Effectors) caused profound defects in feeding, but unlike the previous category, most of these animals produced some pharyngeal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), indicating that pharynx regeneration was either delayed or stalled. The inability to feed was most pronounced following knockdown of the Forkhead transcription factor <italic>FoxA</italic> and the heterogeneous nuclear protein <italic>hnRNPK</italic>. Other genes that caused strong pharynx phenotypes included the poly-A binding protein PABP-2, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome COP9 signalosome complex (COP9), two WD-repeat containing proteins (WDR3 and WDR36), the ER membrane protein jagunal, and decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2 (DDSS-2). Overall, mitotic activity of the RNAi knockdown animals in this group was comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that these genes were unlikely to affect general stem cell function. However, <italic>PABP-2(RNAi)</italic> animals exhibited elevated mitotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), a phenotype observed in <italic>EGFR1(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>p53(RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fraguas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>) and reflecting a failure of proliferative control of the stem cell population.</p><p>The final category of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Other) contains animals that fail to feed but regenerate full-length pharynges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). To accomplish successful feeding after pharynx amputation, animals need to retain the ability to properly sense food and move towards it. Because our screening strategy relied on feeding behavior, it allowed for the discovery of genes required for motility, chemosensation, or other defects in organ function that do not accompany obvious morphological defects. Indeed, we uncovered several genes in this category, including the immediate early gene fos-1, the SMAD protein Madd4, the RNA-binding protein SART-3, and a novel protein. Following knockdown, these animals regenerated pharynges indistinguishable from controls at the morphological level, and had normal levels of mitotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). None of these knockdown animals exhibited motility problems, raising the possibility that these genes may be required for sensory function or for proper integration of the newly regenerated pharynx with the rest of the animal.</p><p>We then performed in situ hybridizations to determine the distribution of each of these transcripts during pharynx regeneration. Most of these genes demonstrated a striking upregulation in the vicinity of the pharynx as soon as 24 hr after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results show that our combined approach of expression profiling followed by RNAi screening successfully identified genes that are functioning at different steps in the regeneration process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>Smed-FoxA</italic> is required for regeneration of the pharynx but not other organs</title><p>Forkhead transcription factors are critical determinants of foregut development throughout evolution, in both protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mango, 2009</xref>) and deuterostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fritzenwanker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).

By contrast, <italic>FoxA(RNAi)</italic> pharynges appeared as a disorganized mass of cells, lacking obvious muscle fibers and any epithelial covering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating both a failure to produce the cells comprising the pharynx and to pattern them properly.

First, the amount and types of tissues amputated is consistent among animals, stimulating the same regeneration program in each worm. Because planaria lack clear anatomical landmarks and vary in body proportion, surgical amputations are inherently variable among animals, removing different amounts of each tissue with each amputation. Second, chemical amputation produces wounds of exactly the same size, which normalizes both the extent of mitotic activity and the degree of apoptosis, both known to correspond directly with wound size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>).

This is in contrast to essentially all other types of surgical amputation performed in planaria, which introduce epithelial wounds and damage multiple underlying tissues that are broadly distributed throughout the body. Therefore, chemical amputation allows us to isolate the response of stem cells to the loss of a single organ in a potentially high-throughput, quantifiable manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Expression profiling combined with functional analyses identifies genes acting in different stages of pharynx regeneration</title><p>Utilizing chemical amputation as a foundation for an RNAi screen, we were able to identify 20 genes that are required at multiple stages for pharynx regeneration, as measured by feeding behavior. However, given the small size of this screen, we have probably uncovered only a portion of the genes acting at each stage of pharynx regeneration. For example, two of these genes (Rhomboid and PDZ ring finger 4) were undetectable immediately after amputation, but strongly upregulated 12–24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Even though these genes failed to produce an RNAi phenotype, their specific transcriptional activation after wounding indicates that mechanisms exist that allow animals to distinguish between homeostatic versus regenerative events. Nonetheless, we uncovered a pharyngeal regeneration molecular pathway for genes identified in this screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Pharynx regeneration begins with activation of stem cells, an increase in expression of a pharynx-specific progenitor marker, and migration of these progenitors to the blastema. Some of the basic mechanisms driving regeneration (e.g., stem cell proliferation) are likely shared between the pharynx and other organs, and we identified several genes in this category, including ribonucleotide reductase, MCM7, and CPSF-3. In addition, we expected to identify genes specific to pharynx regeneration, and we identified at least one gene (<italic>FoxA</italic>) that appears to be highly specific for this organ. Interestingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the DNA helicase RuvB functions in a genetic pathway with FoxA to regulate pharynx organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Updike and Mango, 2007</xref>). Our results demonstrate that in planaria, RuvB is required for stem cell function, but it may also play a role in properly specifying progenitors during regeneration. A further category of genes identified were those that potentially affect the migration of progenitors into the nascent pharynx (WDR3 and WDR36), highlighting the fact that migration of stem cells and/or their progeny is an essential step in pharynx regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Embryonic factors are deployed in adult animals to regulate pharynx regeneration</title><p>FoxA functions as a pioneer transcription factor, opening chromatin due to its structural similarity to linker histones and activating transcription of endoderm-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaudet and Mango, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eeckhoute et al., 2009</xref>). Although it has been previously characterized in development and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lupien et al., 2008</xref>), our study represents the first indication that FoxA functions in regeneration. FoxA is known to define organ identity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaudet and Mango, 2002</xref>) and to directly modify chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>), leading to a hypothesis that during planarian regeneration, FoxA plays an analogous role. Because <italic>FoxA(RNAi)</italic> animals still established expression of anterior/posterior patterning molecules and regenerated head and tail structures normally, we conclude that FoxA is not required for regenerating or patterning organs besides the pharynx. We note, however, that some expression of pan-pharyngeal markers is maintained in <italic>FoxA(RNAi)</italic> animals, raising the possibility that organ specification is only partially compromised. Although this may be due to incomplete knockdown of <italic>FoxA</italic>, alternatively, it may reflect a block in differentiation of pharyngeal tissue, which requires FoxA activity.</p><p>The pharynx consists of neurons, muscle, mesenchyme, and epithelial cells, but lacks neoblasts. Each of these differentiated tissues has a distinct morphology and identity from the rest of the animal, suggesting that these different cell types may share a common pharyngeal identity.

However, the exclusion of stem cells from the pharynx indicates that a boundary within the mesenchyme prevents pluripotent stem cells from invading this organ. <italic>FoxA</italic> expression bridges this spatial boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>FoxA</italic> defines a subpopulation of stem cells necessary for pharynx regeneration</title><p>Our data demonstrate that <italic>FoxA</italic> transcript is present in the stem cell population, like other transcription factors that are critical for brain, photoreceptor, and excretory system development in planaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scimone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>).

In other animals, FoxA recruitment to chromatin is controlled by trans-acting factors including T-Box, GATA, and lef transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mango, 2009</xref>), and these types of proteins may function cell-autonomously in neoblasts.</p><p>Alternatively, signals acting distantly from the neoblasts are likely to stimulate <italic>FoxA</italic> expression in neoblasts.

In planarians, induction of supernumerary pharynges or engraftment of transplanted pharynges only occurs at a distance from the resident pharynx, suggesting that an inhibitory activity is present in the peripharyngeal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ziller-Sengel, 1967a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">1967b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schilt, 1972</xref>). Gaining a molecular handle on these aspects of whole-body regeneration will enhance our understanding of organismal homeostasis in animals.</p><p>In sum, our findings uncovered a new role for FoxA in adult animal regeneration and demonstrates that our organ-selective screening strategy can identify genes with distinct and specific functions during regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical amputation and tricaine anesthetization</title><p>Pharynges were removed from animals 4–5 mm in size, and starved for 7 days. Planarian water was replaced with 100 mM sodium azide (diluted in Montjuïc water). After 5–7 min, the pharynx was visibly extended out of the body. Vigorous pipetting often dislodged the pharynx from the body; if necessary, fine serrated forceps (#5441; Ted Pella, Reading, CA) were used to remove the pharynx, followed by several washes in Montjuïc. For tricaine treatment, 2 g/l tricaine was diluted in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Animals soaked in tricaine display their pharynx but never eject it.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Worm care and irradiation</title><p><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> asexual clonal line CIW4 was maintained and used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>).

For each replicate, 25 plugs were homogenized together, and then chloroform-extracted. The pellet was then precipitated with isopropanol, washed, and resuspended in water. RNA was then purified on an RNEasy column with DNase-treatment (Qiagen, Germany).</p><p>The experiment was performed in triplicate. RNA quality was assessed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 machine (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Starting with 100 ng total RNA, amplification and labeling with Cy3 or Cy5 was performed using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit Two-Color from Agilent Technologies (#5190-2306). Custom Agilent 4x44k arrays with design id: 033226 were hybridized according to the manufacturer protocols, and scanned on an Agilent G2505C scanner.

Ligations were transformed directly into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain HT115, then verified by PCR and sequencing. For screening, overnight cultures of individual cDNAs were grown in 2XYT, and 2X RNAi food was prepared (30 ml bacterial culture was pelleted and resuspended in 150 µl 3:1 liver:water paste). 15 animals were fed three times, 3 days apart, and amputations were done the following day. Feeding assays were performed 9 days after amputation. All RNAi experiments used this same timing strategy, with day 0 representing the time of amputation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Janet Rossant, a Reviewing editor, Marianne Bronner, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript by Adler et al. describes the results of an elegant screen for genes required for organ regeneration in planaria. The authors have developed a clever scheme to chemically amputate the planarian pharynx, thereby standardizing the organ's removal and permitting regeneration assays to be conducted on a relatively large scale. These assays have a straightforward, quantitative readout: animals that regenerate a functional pharynx are able to ingest food (dyed to monitor food intake). The authors characterize the cell biology underlying pharynx regeneration, showing that it requires the animal's stem cells, and they identify changes in gene expression that occur during the initial three days of pharynx regeneration. Targeting a subset of genes that are differentially expressed during the early stages of pharynx regeneration, the authors perform an RNA interference screen to identify genes required for this process. Of the 356 genes they screened, they find 20 in which knockdown leads to defects in pharynx regeneration, by perturbing either stem cell function, pharyngeal morphogenesis, or more specific aspects of pharyngeal function (i.e., a pharynx is formed, but it does not function properly). Focusing their efforts on a forkhead transcription factor homolog, FoxA, the authors show that this gene is required specifically for regeneration of the pharynx. In addition to its expression in the pharynx, FoxA is expressed in a subset of <italic>smedwi-1+</italic> neoblasts, providing additional evidence for lineage commitment within this cell population.</p><p>This elegant work provides an important contribution to our understanding of organ regeneration in planaria. The paper is well written, the data are beautifully presented, and the work is consistent with the high standards that one has come to expect from an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. I recommend that it be accepted, provided that the following relatively minor concerns are addressed.</p><p>Substantive concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The interpretation that the dorsal outgrowths observed 3-4 weeks after initiating Fox RNAi treatment are not specified as pharyngeal tissue seems problematic given the analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>. Because the only markers shown are general markers of protonephridia and neurons (i.e., no pharyngeal markers are shown), the identity of these outgrowths appears to be unresolved. If FoxA expression begins to recover at these late time points (i.e., the effects of dsRNA wear off), these outgrowths could reflect defective/aborted pharyngeal regeneration based upon insufficient FoxA levels. This could easily be addressed by examining the outgrowths for the expression of pharyngeal markers (and FoxA, to see if it is still inhibited).</p><p>2) Although it is nice to refer to Morgan's and Randolph's papers from the late 1800s, it would seem that there has been enough recent progress on planarians and sufficient historical reviews referring extensively to older work to render these citations superfluous. Instead, it seems more important to cite relevant work from this and other post-Morgan/Randolph eras. For example, it would be reasonable to cite the ultrastructural work on the pharynx from the 1960s. The discussion of chalones at the end of the paper would benefit from considering the work of Ziller-Sengel and Schilt ('60s and '70s), suggesting the presence of an autoinhibitory factor from pharynx. The paper characterizing TMUS-13 (Cebria et al. 1997) should be referenced, since that antibody is used extensively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02238.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The interpretation that the dorsal outgrowths observed 3-4 weeks after initiating Fox RNAi treatment are not specified as pharyngeal tissue seems problematic given the analysis reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F</italic></xref><italic>.

In the revised version, we have added several WISH experiments interrogating the cellular composition of this dorsal outgrowth. In particular, our experiments confirmed the absence of pharyngeal tissue using two specific markers (<italic>laminin and npp-1</italic>) in all animals examined. By H&amp;E staining, the dorsal outgrowth lacks any apparent radial or laminar structure characteristic of the intact pharynx. Often, this outgrowth is densely populated with muscle and neuronal tissue. Furthermore, FoxA expression remains strongly inhibited at these late time points, eliminating the possibility that restoration of FoxA expression drives formation of this outgrowth. We have included this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Although it is nice to refer to Morgan's and Randolph's papers from the late 1800s, it would seem that there has been enough recent progress on planarians and sufficient historical reviews referring extensively to older work to render these citations superfluous.
