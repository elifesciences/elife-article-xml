maintain the functional heterogeneity of stem cells, which generates diverse differentiated cell types required for organogenesis, are not understood. In this study, we report that Trithorax (Trx) actively maintains the heterogeneity of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain. <italic>trx</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts gradually adopt a type I neuroblast functional identity, losing the competence to generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and directly generating differentiated cells. Trx regulates a type II neuroblast functional identity in part by maintaining chromatin in the <italic>buttonhead</italic> (<italic>btd</italic>) locus in an active state through the histone methyltransferase activity of the SET1/MLL complex. Consistently, <italic>btd</italic> is necessary and sufficient for eliciting a type II neuroblast functional identity. Furthermore, over-expression of <italic>btd</italic> restores the competence to generate INPs in <italic>trx</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts. Thus, Trx instructs a type II neuroblast functional identity by epigenetically promoting Btd expression, thereby maintaining neuroblast functional heterogeneity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03502.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03502.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03502.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whereas the majority of cells in the brain are unable to divide to produce new cells, neural stem cells can divide numerous times and have the potential to become many different types of brain cells. However, between these two extremes there is another group of cells called neural progenitors. These cells can give rise to multiple types of neurons but, in contrast to stem cells, they can undergo only a limited number of divisions.</p><p>Many of the molecular mechanisms by which stem cells give rise to progenitors are similar in mammals and in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In the brains of fly larvae, a subset of neural stem cells called type II neuroblasts give rise to ‘intermediate neural progenitors’, each of which can divide between four and six times. Every division generates a replacement intermediate neural progenitor and a cell called a ganglion mother cell, which divides one last time to produce two brain cells. Thus, intermediate neural progenitors increase the overall output of cells derived from every division of a type II neuroblast.</p><p>The ability of type II neuroblasts to generate intermediate neural progenitors is important for development. Loss of this ability will result in a shortage of cells, disrupting brain development, while the faulty generation of intermediate neural progenitors will result in the formation of tumors. Now, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain cells cultured in the laboratory, Komori et al. show that an evolutionarily conserved enzyme called Trithorax has an important role in maintaining this ability. Trithorax acts through a protein called Buttonhead. The role of Buttonhead in regulating intermediate neural progenitors has also been identified by Xie et al.</p><p>Komori et al. show that type II neuroblasts that lack Trithorax activity lose their unique identity and behave as type I neuroblasts, which never generate intermediate neural progenitors. Trithorax maintains the cellular memory of a type II neuroblast by keeping regions of chromatin—a macromolecule made of DNA and proteins called histones—in an active state. These regions contain key genes, such as the gene for Buttonhead. Re-introducing Buttonhead in type II neuroblasts that lack Trithorax activity can reinstate their ability to produce intermediate neural progenitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03502.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03502.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>Trithorax</kwd><kwd>larval brain</kwd><kwd>intermediate neural progenitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM092818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Komori</surname><given-names>Hideyuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Janssens</surname><given-names>Derek H</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Cheng-Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Drosophila equivalent of the human protein Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1n enables neural stem cells to generate neural progenitors through the fly equivalent of the human transcription factor Sp8, thereby contributing to an increased number and diversity of cell types during brain development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells employ several strategies to generate the requisite number of diverse differentiated cell types required for organ development and organ homeostasis in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franco and Müller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>). One such strategy involves stem cells changing their temporal identities. For example, neuroblasts sequentially express distinct temporal-identity transcription factors, allowing them to generate diverse differentiated cells in the fly embryonic ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pearson and Doe, 2003</xref>). Another strategy involves maintaining a functionally heterogeneous pool of tissue-specific stem cells. Studies in flies and vertebrate systems show that functionally heterogeneous stem cells directly contribute to the generation of diverse cell types during hematopoiesis, gut homeostasis, and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graf and Stadtfeld, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Copley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>). Numerous patterning mechanisms have been described to explain how the fates of distinct stem cells within a developing organ become specified, but how their functional heterogeneity is maintained throughout the lifespan of an organism remains completely unknown.</p><p>The central complex of the insect brain is comprised of an intricate network of neurons and glia that process a vast number of environmental inputs essential for daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>). All differentiated cell types in the central complex arise from repeated rounds of self-renewing asymmetric divisions of type I and type II neuroblasts, which are molecularly and functionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In every asymmetric division, a type I neuroblast always generates a precursor cell (ganglion mother cell or GMC) that divides once to produce two differentiated cells. By contrast, every asymmetric division of a type II neuroblast invariably leads to the generation of an immature INP that acquires an INP functional identity during maturation. An INP undergoes 5–8 rounds of asymmetric division to regenerate and generate a GMC with each division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the ability to generate INPs functionally distinguishes these two types of neuroblasts.</p><p>Type II neuroblasts uniquely express the ETS transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). Mis-expression of PntP1 can induce a type II neuroblast functional characteristic in a type I neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). However, the physiological function of PntP1 in the maintenance of a type II neuroblast functional identity remains unclear. The <italic>pnt</italic> locus encodes at least three distinct alternatively spliced transcripts. Thus, it is formally possible that multiple isoforoms of Pnt or a yet unknown mechanism function to maintain a type II neuroblast functional identity.</p><p>Epigenetic mechanisms such as the methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) play central roles in specifying cell type identities during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuettengruber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). The evolutionarily conserved SET1/Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes catalyze the methylation of H3K4 and maintain the target gene loci in a transcriptionally active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roguev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krogan et al., 2002</xref>). The fly genome encodes three orthologs of the SET1/MLL protein, Trx, Trithorax-related (Trr), and dSet1. Similar to their mammalian counterparts, Trx, Trr, or dSet1 can each assemble functionally active complexes by binding to Absent, small, or homeotic discs 2 (Ash2), Retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (Rbbp5), and will die slowly (Wds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardehali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). Functionally, Trr or dSet1 regulates global mono- or tri-methylation of H3K4 respectively. In contrast, Trx appears to selectively regulate the expression of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes through the methylation of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breen and Harte, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 1995</xref>). However, little is known about the targets of Trx beyond the <italic>Hox</italic> genes.</p><p>Here, we report that Trx maintains the type II neuroblast functional identity by regulating the transcription of <italic>btd</italic> during fly larval brain neurogenesis. Type II neuroblasts mutant for <italic>trx</italic> or genes encoding the core components of the SET1/MLL complex display a type I neuroblast marker expression profile and generate GMCs instead of INPs. These results indicate that Trx maintains a type II neuroblast functional identity by regulating the transcription of specific target genes. We identified a direct downstream target of Trx, Btd, that plays an important role in the maintenance of a type II neuroblast functional identity. <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts adopt a type I neuroblast functional identity and directly generate GMCs instead of INPs. Conversely, type I neuroblasts over-expressing <italic>btd</italic> assume a type II neuroblast functional identity and generate INP progeny. Most importantly, over-expression of <italic>btd</italic> restores the competence of <italic>trx</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts to generate INPs. Thus, we conclude that Trx functions to epigenetically maintain Btd expression in type II neuroblasts, thereby maintaining neuroblast functional heterogeneity in the larval brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>trx</italic> regulates neuroblast heterogeneity by maintaining a type II neuroblast identity</title><p>Analyses of gene transcription in mutant larval brains enriched with type I or type II neuroblasts led us to hypothesize that differential regulation of gene expression contributes to neuroblast functional heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carney et al., 2012</xref>) (Komori and Lee, unpublished observation). Because the <italic>trx</italic> gene contributes to cell fate maintenance in a variety of developmental processes, we tested whether it is required for maintaining neuroblast heterogeneity. We induced GFP-marked mosaic clones derived from single wild-type or <italic>trx</italic> mutant type I or II neuroblasts and assessed the identities of cells in the clones by examining the expression of cell fate markers in a time-course study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Identical to wild-type neuroblasts, <italic>trx</italic> mutant type I neuroblasts maintained the expression of Deadpan (Dpn) and Asense (Ase) and the cytoplasmic localization of Prospero (Pros), but lacked PntP1 expression (Dpn<sup>+</sup>Ase<sup>+</sup>PntP1<sup>−</sup>Pros<sup>cytoplasmic</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, data not presented). In addition, both wild-type and <italic>trx</italic> mutant type I neuroblasts were always surrounded by GMCs (Dpn<sup>−</sup>Ase<sup>+</sup>Pros<sup>nuclear</sup>) (data not presented). Thus, Trx is dispensable for the maintenance of a type I neuroblast functional identity. While all wild-type type II neuroblasts displayed a Dpn<sup>+</sup>Ase<sup>−</sup>PntP1<sup>+</sup>Pros<sup>−</sup> marker expression profile in all stages examined, <italic>trx</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts progressively altered their marker expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

For example, neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and in the outer subventricular zone collectively contribute to the generation of all the cell types required for the development of a human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, heterogeneous stem cell pools have also been reported in other organs including the blood and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graf and Stadtfeld, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Copley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>). Although the mechanisms that specify the identity of distinct stem cell types within a given organ have been proposed, the mechanisms that maintain the functional heterogeneity of stem cells have never been reported. In this study, we used the two well defined and functionally distinct types of neuroblasts in the fly larval brain to investigate the mechanisms that maintain stem cell functional heterogeneity during neurogenesis. We discovered that Trx functions uniquely to maintain a type II neuroblast identity through the H3K4 methylation activity of the SET1/MLL complex, thereby contributing to neuroblast heterogeneity during larval brain neurogenesis. We identified the homeodomain transcription factor Btd as a direct downstream target of Trx in the maintenance of a type II neuroblast identity. To our knowledge, this Trx-Btd-dependent mechanism provides the first mechanistic insight into the maintenance of stem cell functional heterogeneity within an organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The homologs of Trx and Btd have been shown to play critical roles in regulating vertebrate neural stem cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MuhChyi et al., 2013</xref>).

Our data indicate Trx plays a central role in maintaining the functional identity of a type II neuroblast by promoting the expression of a small number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figures 1 and 4A</xref>). We identified the <italic>btd</italic> gene as a critical downstream target of Trx that is both necessary and sufficient for the regulation of the type II neuroblast functional identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 4–7</xref>). <italic>btd</italic> encodes a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factor required for proper patterning of the head segment during fly embryogenesis and likely functions as a transcription activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wimmer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schöck et al., 1999</xref>). However, the role of Btd in regulating neuroblasts has never been established, and the mechanisms by which Btd elicits biological responses remain unclear. Several possible reasons exist to explain the relatively inefficient nature of eliciting the type II neuroblast functional identity in a type I neuroblast by the mis-expression of <italic>btd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, certain co-factors might be required for Btd to efficiently activate its target gene transcription, and a lower abundance of these co-factors in type I neuroblasts hinders the functional output of mis-expressed Btd. Second, the epigenetic landscape might be vastly different between the two types of neuroblasts such that mis-expressed Btd may not have access to all of its target genes required to elicit the type II neuroblast functional identity in a type I neuroblast. Lastly, additional transcription factors might function in parallel with Btd to regulate the functional identity of a type II neuroblast. Btd is a highly conserved transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estella and Mann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MuhChyi et al., 2013</xref>).

We initially hypothesized that Pnt might function in parallel with Btd to maintain the functional identity of a type II neuroblast. This hypothesis was extremely appealing in light of a previous study demonstrating mis-expression of PntP1 can transform a type I neuroblast into a type II neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Unexpectedly, knocking down the function of the <italic>pnt</italic> gene, which encodes at least three alternatively spliced transcripts, had no effect on the maintenance of the type II neuroblast functional identity, and instead, resulted in the formation of supernumerary type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result led us to revise our hypothesis and propose that Pnt functions in the immature INP to specify an INP identity. Consistently, heterozygosity of the <italic>pnt</italic> locus dominantly enhanced the supernumerary neuroblast in the <italic>brat</italic> or <italic>erm</italic> hypomorphic genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

We stopped fixation by incubating the lysate with Glycine (0.25 M) at room temperature for 4 min and on ice for 10 min. Following fixation, samples were washed with wash buffer (1xPBS, 5 mM Tris–HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA) containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 1 mM PMSF for three times and homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH8.1, 10 mM EDTA) to obtain nuclear extracts. The nuclear extracts were disrupted by using a sonicator (18 cycles of sonicating for 30 s and interval for 30 s). Five percent of the sonicated sample was stored for INPUT. The rest of the sonicated chromatin was incubated with antibodies in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Trition X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris–HCl pH8.1, 167 mM NaCl) at 4°C overnight. Samples were incubated with Dynal beads (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY) at 4°C overnight, washed twice with low salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% TritonX-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH8.1, 150 mM NaCl), twice with high salt immune complex wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% TritonX-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH8.1, 500 mM NaCl), three times with LiCl immune complex wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris–HCl pH8.1), twice with TE buffer, and then were eluted from beads. Cross-linking of chromatin–protein complex was reverted at 65°C overnight. Samples were treated with RNase A at 55°C for 2 hr and incubated with 2 μg of proteinase K at 45°C for 1 hr. Samples were cleaned up by phenol:chloroform and precipitated by EtOH precipitation. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of water. 5 μl were used in each qPCR reaction. Antibodies used in this experiment were anti-Trx antibody (Mazo A), anti-H3K4me2 (07–030; Millipre, Billerica, MA), and rabbit IgG (ab46540; Abcam).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Heinrich Reichert, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports the role of Trithorax (Trx) in the maintenance of type II neuroblast identity. Type II neuroblasts mutant for Trx gradually convert to type I neuroblasts: they turn on Asense and lose PntP1, and they generate GMCs instead of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). Neuroblasts mutant for a core component of the SET1/MLL complex also show the same phenotype. By sequencing brains enriched for type I or type II neuroblasts, the authors identify a transcription factor, buttonhead (btd) whose transcripts are up-regulated in mutant brains enriched with type II neuroblasts. They show by ChIP that Trx binds to the <italic>btd</italic> gene. Type II neuroblasts mutant for <italic>btd</italic> do not turn on Ase, but their INPs never mature. Further, the authors show that overexpression of <italic>btd</italic> in type I neuroblasts is sufficient to convert them into type II neuroblasts that generate INPs (although this phenotype is only observed in ∼28% of neuroblasts). Finally, they show that over-expressing <italic>btd</italic> in type II neuroblasts that are mutant for trx rescues type II neuroblast identity. These findings are very interesting because they show that Trx maintains type II neuroblast identity through a specific transcription factor, <italic>btd</italic>, and thus add to our knowledge of the molecular control of type II neuroblasts identity in the fly, which are emerging as a good model for comparable neural stem cell in vertebrates. The experiments are performed appropriately and the results are presented in a largely logical manner. The data are generally solid and well-quantified. However, there are several significant points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The discovery of the contribution of <italic>btd</italic> to Type II neuroblasts appears to be more important than that of Trx and it is suggested to mention <italic>btd</italic> in the title.</p><p>2) One important missing point is that the author do not show the expression of <italic>btd</italic> in type II neuroblasts through antibody staining, or the loss of <italic>btd</italic> in Trx mutants. Although an enhancer fragment of <italic>btd</italic> drives Gal4 in type II neuroblasts, this is only a good indication that <italic>btd</italic> is in the right place. It would be better to see protein expression by antibody staining, if available.</p><p>3) <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts do not have the same phenotype as Trx mutants, suggesting that other target genes of Trx are involved. Could it be PntP1? Although <italic>pntp1</italic> mutants by themselves do not affect type II neuroblast identity, double mutant for <italic>btd</italic> and <italic>pntp1</italic> might have more severe phenotype than <italic>btd</italic> or <italic>pntp1</italic> mutants alone.</p><p>4) The reviewers strongly recommend deleting the discussion section on “Trx maintains a type II neuroblast functional identity independently of the Polycomb protein”. There is no mention or investigation of this issue at all in the Results section. Indeed in the Discussion section, the reader is confronted for the first time with largely undocumented data to support the section's conclusions. This is not acceptable, moreover it detracts from the quality of the experiments that are well described and documented in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03502.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The discovery of the contribution of</italic> btd <italic>to Type II neuroblasts appears to be more important than that of Trx and it is suggested to mention</italic> btd <italic>in the title</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the title to “The Trithorax histone methyltransferase complex maintains the functional heterogeneity of neural stem cells through the transcription factor Buttonhead.”</p><p><italic>2) One important missing point is that the author do not show the expression of</italic> btd <italic>in type II neuroblasts through antibody staining, or the loss of</italic> btd <italic>in Trx mutants.

We were unable to generate a specific antibody against the Btd protein for the immunofluorescent application. In addition, we were unable to recover any viable transgenic fly lines that carry a transgene containing a BAC clone covering the entire <italic>btd</italic> locus after two attempts. As the only option available, we examined the expression pattern of the <italic>btd-Gal4</italic> driver in the <italic>rbbp5null</italic> mutant brain. We observed a dramatic reduction in the expression of <italic>btd-Gal4</italic> in the <italic>rbbp5null</italic> mutant brain as indicated by the <italic>UAS</italic> reporter transgene expression. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>btd</italic> is a downstream target of Trx. We have now revised the text to include this result and added the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Btd mutant type II neuroblasts do not have the same phenotype as Trx mutants, suggesting that other target genes of Trx are involved. Could it be PntP1? Although</italic> pntp1 <italic>mutants by themselves do not affect type II neuroblast identity, double mutant for</italic> btd <italic>and</italic> pntp1 <italic>might have more severe phenotype than</italic> btd <italic>or</italic> pntp1 <italic>mutants alone</italic>.</p><p>We were initially extremely enthusiastic about the possibility that <italic>pnt</italic> acts in parallel with <italic>btd</italic> to maintain the functional identity of a type II neuroblasts because Trx binds to the promoter region of the <italic>pntP1</italic> transcription unit, and the expression of PntP1 was undetectable in <italic>trx</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts. Since the <italic>pnt</italic> locus encodes multiple alternatively spliced transcripts, we knocked down the function of all <italic>pnt</italic> isoforms in type II neuroblasts by over-expressing three distinct <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenes targeting the common exon. To our surprise, <italic>pnt</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts give rise to immature INP progeny that revert into supernumerary type II neuroblasts. This result strongly suggested that <italic>pnt</italic> functions in the immature INP to specify an INP identity. Consistently, the heterozygosity of <italic>pnt</italic> strongly enhanced the supernumerary neuroblast phenotype induced by genes required for proper specification of an INP identity, including <italic>brat</italic> and <italic>erm</italic>. Together, these data indicate that <italic>pnt</italic> functions in the immature INP rather than in the type II neuroblast. We attempted to knock down the function of both <italic>btd</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic> by over-expressing all possible combinations of available <italic>UAS-btdRNAi</italic> and <italic>UAS-pntRNAi</italic> transgenes in type II neuroblasts. We validated the effectiveness of the <italic>btdRNAi</italic> construct by inducing type II neuroblasts to assume the functional identity of a type I neuroblast in the larval brain. Larval brains co-expressing the <italic>UAS-btdRNAi</italic> and <italic>UASpntRNAi</italic> transgenes in type II neuroblasts possessed supernumerary neuroblasts that displayed a type II neuroblast marker expression profile. However, we were unable to interpret the identity of the supernumerary neuroblasts in the <italic>btd</italic>, <italic>pnt</italic> double mutant brain because <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II neuroblasts acquire a type I neuroblast functional identity without displaying a type I neuroblast marker expression profile. We have now revised the text and added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2A</xref>) to describe the functional characterization of <italic>pnt</italic> in type II neuroblasts.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers strongly recommend deleting the discussion section on “Trx maintains a type II neuroblast functional identity independently of the Polycomb protein”.
