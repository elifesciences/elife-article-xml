To address this issue we investigated the impact of hearing loss on the onset and time-course of cognitive decline in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), that is the 3×Tg-AD mice and the underlying mechanisms. We found that hearing loss induced by noise exposure in the 3×Tg-AD mice before the phenotype is manifested caused persistent synaptic and morphological alterations in the auditory cortex. This was associated with earlier hippocampal dysfunction, increased tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and redox imbalance, along with anticipated memory deficits compared to the expected time-course of the neurodegenerative phenotype. Our data suggest that a mouse model of AD is more vulnerable to central damage induced by hearing loss and shows reduced ability to counteract noise-induced detrimental effects, which accelerates the neurodegenerative disease onset.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>tau phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007707</institution-id><institution>Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione Contro Gli Infortuni sul Lavoro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BANDO BRIC 09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paludetti</surname><given-names>Gaetano</given-names></name><name><surname>Grassi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007707</institution-id><institution>Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione Contro Gli Infortuni sul Lavoro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRiC INAIL 2016-DiMEILA17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paludetti</surname><given-names>Gaetano</given-names></name><name><surname>Grassi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Central damage and sensory deprivation caused by noise-induced hearing loss in the pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) phase can compromise auditory cortex-hippocampal circuitry, targeting common pathogenetic pathways, thereby accelerating onset and progression of AD phenotype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent epidemiological evidence suggests a strong association between hearing loss and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gallacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Loughrey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu and Lee, 2019</xref>). Specifically, impairments in peripheral and central auditory structures have been linked to incidence and acceleration of cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernabei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amieva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fortunato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deal et al., 2017</xref>) as well as to increased risk for the onset of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gates et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Panza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Taljaard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, it has been shown that for every 10 dB increase in hearing loss, there is a 20% increased risk of developing dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Substantiating such correlation would have significant implications for prevention and treatment of dementia. Indeed, while it is difficult to counteract neurodegeneration, hearing loss can be considered as a modifiable risk factor, given that it could be widely treated with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Therefore, it is mandatory to clarify the mechanisms linking hearing loss to dementia. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship between auditory sensory deprivation and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Griffiths et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Slade et al., 2020</xref>), but the nature of such association remains controversial.</p><p>It has been reported that hearing loss causes a cascade of changes in the main auditory pathway and in non-lemniscal brain regions, such as the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Manikandan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nadhimi and Llano, 2021</xref>), a brain structure involved in memory and severely impaired in cognitive decline and AD.

In previous studies we showed that exposure to loud sounds led to structural plasticity changes in central auditory structures, resulting in decreased spine density and altered dendritic complexity in pyramidal neurons of layer II/III of the auditory cortex (ACx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fetoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fetoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paciello et al., 2018</xref>). It is also known that neurons in the hippocampus respond to acoustic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>); indeed, auditory potentials can be evoked in this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bickford-Wimer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moxon et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, data from animal models suggest that hearing loss can affect hippocampal functions by altering neurotransmitter levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chengzhi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui and Li, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckmann et al., 2020</xref>) and by decreasing neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kurioka et al., 2021</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no studies have yet characterized the impact of auditory sensory deprivation on the onset and time-course of cognitive decline in AD and the underlying mechanisms. To this aim, we used 3×Tg AD mice, a common experimental model of AD, which experienced hearing loss induced by noise exposure at an age of 2 months, when the AD phenotype is not manifested yet. Auditory and hippocampal functions were then investigated over time to establish whether and how auditory sensory deprivation could accelerate and/or worsen AD-associated cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Noise exposure induces hearing loss in both 3×Tg-AD and wild-type mice</title><p>Our first step was to characterize hearing loss induced by noise at different time points in both 3×Tg-AD and wild-type (WT) mice. Thereinafter mice exposed to noise will be referred to as ‘AD-NE’ and ‘WT-NE’, whereas normal hearing mice not subjected to noise as ‘AD-NN’ and ‘WT-NN’. Animals were exposed to noise at 2 months of age (M) and subsequently analyzed at 3 M (corresponding to 1 month after noise exposure) and at 6 M (corresponding to 4 months after noise exposure).

The trend of threshold increase was similar across mid- and high frequencies and no significant differences were observed between 3×Tg-AD and WT mice, indicating that both strains show a similar degree of susceptibility to hearing loss induced by noise. At 6 M, both WT-NN and AD-NN showed a slight increase (about 20 dB) in auditory threshold values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) compared to younger mice, probably as a consequence of physiological age-related worsening of cochlear function. Of note, when comparing noise-exposed 6 M animals with age-matched not-exposed animals, a significant increase in auditory threshold was observed, specifically in the range of mid-frequencies, indicating that noise can induce a permanent hearing loss over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; WT-NN n = 9, AD-NN n = 13; WT-NE n = 7, AD-NE n = 11; three-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test, WT-NN vs. WT-NE, p = 0.017; AD-NN vs. AD-NE, p = 0.003).

In a first phase of the test, the animal is allowed to explore two objects and then, after a certain time interval, one of the objects is changed with a novel one. Depending on the time interval between the two sessions, it is possible to evaluate STM or LTM.

Notably, WT animals recovered over time, whereas 3×Tg-AD mice failed to rescue central damage associated with hearing loss, showing not only persistent synaptic and morphological alterations in the ACx, but also hippocampal dysfunction, increased tau phosphorylation, and anticipated memory deficits compared to the expected time-course of AD phenotype observed in age-matched 3×Tg-AD mice not exposed to noise. Neuroinflammation and redox imbalance were found in hippocampi of 6 M AD-NE mice that might be related to the reduced ability of the central structures to rescue noise-induced detrimental effects, making this experimental model of AD more vulnerable to central damage induced by hearing loss.</p><p>The experimental model of auditory sensory deprivation was achieved in both WT and 3×Tg-AD animals by exposing 2 M mice to repeated noise sessions, a paradigm used in our previous studies capable of inducing hearing loss, hair cell loss, and decreased transmission between inner hair cells and primary afferent fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fetoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paciello et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In our study, no differences in baseline auditory thresholds were found between AD-NN and WT-NN animals at 3 and 6 M, consistent with previous data reporting alterations in cochlear functions starting from 9 M in other models of AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Wu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">O’Leary et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The acoustic trauma caused permanent increase of auditory threshold of about 30–40 dB, spanning at all frequencies analyzed in both strains, estimated 1 and 4 months after the onset of trauma sessions (corresponding to 3 and 6 M of mouse age), indicating no differences in cochlear susceptibility to noise exposure between WT and 3×Tg-AD animals.

The spine loss observed in 3 M animals might be caused by deafferentation and activity-dependent remodeling of neuronal connectivity. Accordingly, our electrophysiological analyses on ACx brain slices revealed that noise-induced morphological changes were accompanied with decreased excitatory synaptic responses of neurons within layer II/III.</p><p>Interestingly, by analyzing the long-lasting effect of sensory deprivation (i.e., 4 months after noise exposure) in ACx, we found out that 6 M WT animals showed a recovery in both basal synaptic transmission and spine density in ACx, whereas 3×Tg-AD animals failed to recover synaptic and morphological dysfunctions associated with cochlear peripheral damage.</p><p>Moreover, we found that 6 M AD-NE mice showed decreased pGluA1<sup>Ser845</sup> at 6 M, suggesting a decreased AMPAR stabilization in the plasma membrane and potentially a decreased channel conductance in AD mice subjected to acoustic trauma. Such post-translational modification of GluA1 is known to stabilize glutamate receptor at dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kessels et al., 2009</xref>) and it is considered critical for sensory deprivation-induced homeostatic synaptic response and for experience-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goel et al., 2011</xref>).

Moreover, it has been reported that age-related hearing loss in an animal model of presbycusis is accompanied by extensive reorganization of plasticity-related neurotransmitter expression in ACx and hippocampus, and is associated with altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity, as well as memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beckmann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although a certain degree of heterogeneity has been reported in 3×Tg-AD mouse model regarding the onset and progression of cognitive deficits, the majority of studies including ours indicate that 7–9 months is the time-window when cognitive deficits most often manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clinton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martinez-Coria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakroborty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cocco et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, memory performance in 6 M 3×Tg-AD mice was comparable to that of WT mice. Of note, our study showed that sensory deprivation induced by noise accelerated cognitive decline in 3×Tg-AD mice, anticipating it at 6 M of age, as revealed by decreased LTM and STM recognition memory performance in NOR test.</p><p>Looking for a molecular mechanism underlying hippocampal functional and morphological alterations, we focused on common pathogenic markers shared by noise-induced hearing loss and neurodegenerative disease. Our Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed increased pTau<sup>Ser396</sup> in the hippocampus of 6 M 3×Tg-AD mice exposed to noise in parallel with increased TNF-α and IL-1β, well-known markers of neuroinflammation, and increased oxidative stress, 4-HNE expression, and apoptotic markers in the hippocampus.</p><p>The interplay between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation is a common feature of AD pathology and production of oxidizing free radicals, including ROS and reactive nitrogen species, can be induced by increased cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Naik and Dixit, 2011</xref>). Moreover, several studies also showed that oxidative stress leads to increased tau phosphorylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Su et al., 2010</xref>) and peroxidative damage and 4-HNE expression facilitated aggregation of phosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pérez et al., 2000</xref>), inducing tau hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gómez-Ramos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in the hippocampus and neocortex and cognitive impairment have been observed as a consequence of chronic noise exposure in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Park et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that auditory sensory deprivation can exacerbate pathological molecular pathways of AD, accelerating cognitive decline.</p><p>Moreover, the increased expression of HO-1 in the hippocampus of WT animals exposed to noise can be considered as an endogenous response to prevent or counteract redox imbalance. Of relevance, we did not observe this HO-1 upregulation in AD-NE mice, suggesting an impaired ability of endogenous antioxidant system to face oxidative insult in AD mouse model. This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that HO can interact with APP family members resulting in HO inhibition. Accordingly, in APP mutant mice HO-1 as well as bilirubin levels were significantly decreased while oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity was markedly increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>). The observed changes in ROS/HO-1 expression are potentially responsible for the functional and structural alterations we found in the hippocampus of AD-NE mice. Here, we did not directly investigate the cause-effect relationship between oxidative stress and impaired synaptic plasticity, that we plan to address in a follow-up study. However, literature data allows us to hypothesize a role of oxidative stress, that is involved in various pathological states including several age-related neurodegenerative diseases, considering that neurons are seen as a crucial target of oxidative attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Domenico et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding SOD2, we did not find significant difference in protein expression among groups. However, considering the higher ROS and 4-HNE levels documented in the hippocampus of AD-NE mice, we cannot exclude changes in SOD2 enzymatic activity instead of protein expression per se.</p><p>Collectively, our data indicate that in 3×Tg-AD mice, central compensatory mechanisms to restore the up-spread damage induced by hearing loss are compromised, likely by early impairment of networks preceding the onset of the neurodegenerative pathology. As such, central damage-induced auditory sensory deprivation in the pre-symptomatic AD phase further compromises fragile networks, probably targeting common pathogenetic pathways, thereby accelerating onset and progression of AD phenotype.</p><p>In the context of high brain vulnerability and lower cognitive reserve, hearing loss is a critical risk factor for cognitive decline and AD onset. On a translational perspective, our data suggest that monitoring hearing and cognitive function in elderly people and attenuating hearing loss with rehabilitative devices could be effective tools for delaying and mitigating AD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mice, harboring the Swedish human APP, presenilin M146V, and tauP301L mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oddo et al., 2003</xref>) were used in this study, compared to (B6129SF2/J) WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roddick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Ying et al., 2017</xref>).

Animals were mildly anesthetized (ketamine 50 mg/kg+ medetomidine 0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and placed in the anechoic room. Three stainless steel recording electrodes were subcutaneously inserted posterior to the tested pinna (active), vertex (reference), and contralateral pinna (ground). ABRs were collected using a computer-controlled TDT System 3 (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) data acquisition system with real-time digital signal processing. Tone bursts ranging from 6 to 32 kHz (1 ms rise/fall time, 10 ms total duration, 20/s repetition rate) were presented monaurally in an open field using a horn tweeter (Tucker-Davis Technologies). The responses were filtered (100–3000 Hz bandpass), digitized, and averaged across 512 discrete samples at each frequency-level combination. ABRs were measured at low (6 kHz), mid (12, 16, and 20 kHz), and high (24 and 32 kHz) frequencies. Thresholds were determined by decreasing tone intensity in 5 dB steps starting at 100 dB and decreasing to 0 dB or until a reliably scored ABR Wave I component was detected. Baseline ABRs were recorded bilaterally testing each ear separately to ensure no consistent left-right ear ABR asymmetry.

Recognition memory, both STM and LTM, was evaluated using the NOR paradigm. Both tests were divided into three sessions: habituation, training, and test. Briefly, for the LTM version, animals were familiarized on the first day for 10 min with the test arena (45 cm × 45 cm). On the second day (training session), they were allowed to explore two identical objects placed symmetrically in the arena for 5 min. On the third day (test session), a new object replaced one of the old objects and animals were allowed to explore for 5 min. For the short-term version of the test, which took place 24 hr after the long-term version, animals were habituated to the arena for 10 min on the first day, and underwent training and test, separated by 30 min, on the second day. Different couples of objects were used for the short-term and for the long-term paradigms. Preference index, calculated as the ratio between time spent exploring the novel object and time spent exploring both objects, was used to measure recognition memory. To exclude place preference in the test session, the position of the novel object was alternated on both sides of the box. Furthermore, object identity was counterbalanced across group, to exclude preference based on intrinsic object properties. The objects used were: lego bricks arranged in different shapes, glass bottles filled with clean bedding, pyramids, and spheres made of plastic. All objects were of almost the same size, and lego bricks were arranged in simple shapes (cubical or rectangular). Each object during each phase was taped to the arena, so that the animals couldn’t displace them. After each test, the objects and the box were cleaned with 70% ethanol solution. Mice exploring less than 10 s were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Moreover, to ensure that deficits in locomotor activity, which could have hindered object recognition test results, were not induced by the treatment, animal behavior was evaluated in the open field test.

of cognitive decline and dementia. Using an experimental mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease, the authors show that noise-induced hearing impairment enhances a range of functional and structural synaptic deficits in the hippocampus and auditory cortex and accelerates memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's model mice. These results provide a potential explanation for the link between impaired hearing and dementia.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Auditory sensory deprivation induced by noise exposure exacerbates cognitive decline and hippocampal dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The ABR analysis did not include important information, especially which wave or waves were used for determining thresholds. This can affect the interpretation of results because changes in specific ABR waves could indicate where along the auditory pathway the noise-induced hearing loss occurs. For instance, a threshold shift in the later waves could not be simply attributed to cochlear injury, as suggested in the manuscript. In fact, the study of noise induced hearing loss in C57BL6 mice, cited above, reported that physiological effects were not necessarily associated with peripheral injury.</p><p>In addition, the methods state that the tone bursts were &quot;…presented monaurally in an open field&quot; and then states, &quot;ABRs were assessed bilaterally in all animals…&quot;. Are the thresholds presented in Figure 2 an average of ABR thresholds for each ear?</p><p>(2) There is a disconnect between the auditory cortex physiology results and the behavior. The memory task does not rely on auditory processing or auditory plasticity. Therefore, the relationship between auditory cortex measures and an AD-associated behavioral phenotype should be addressed.</p><p>(3) The difference in ROS is dramatic between control and sensory-deprived AD mice. Could the authors confirm these findings by other tools? Does such a dramatic increase in ROS cause apoptosis of neurons, in addition to the reduction in spine density?</p><p>(4) Changes in ROS and in HO1 expression are only correlative and not linked to functional and structural impairments observed in AD model mice. In the previous studies, the authors show that cochlear impairments can be reversed by Q10. A possible causal link between oxidative stress and impairments in CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission / spine density can be tested by local injections of antioxidants to the hippocampus. Otherwise, these results remain purely correlative and do not imply that it is ROS that impairs homeostatic capabilities of hippocampus and auditory cortex in AD model.</p><p>(5) The study used only male mice, but did not provide a rationale for doing so. There is a broad literature that indicates sex-specific differences in age-related hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss, and progression of AD /cognitive decline. Therefore, it would be particularly important for a study of this sort to consider sex as a critical biological variable.</p><p>(6) There is a potential concern regarding the statistical approach: For example,</p><p>In Figure 4, the groups in Figure 4C and 4D appear to have been analyzed using two separate ANOVAs. Since the dependent variable (i.e., number of spines) is the same for the different groups/conditions, one ANOVA should be used to establish whether or not a main effect is observed.</p><p>In Figure 3D, individual data points between Ctrl and Noise are largely overlapping, so significance may be influenced by the 'outlier' in the Ctrl group.

The authors use a paradigm of noise exposure that induces hearing loss by hair cell loss and by decreased synaptic transmission between inner hair cells and primary afferent fibers, as has been previously shown by the authors (Fetoni et al., 2013; Paciello et al., 2018). While short-term (1-month) effects of hearing loss have been previously established, the current manuscript is focused on the long-term (4-months) effects of hearing loss in WT and AD model. The authors demonstrate that hearing loss and its dynamics is similar between WT and AD model mice in response to noise exposure. However, the CNS response of AD mice to hearing loss is different in comparison to WT mice. WT mice show reversible changes in basal synaptic transmission and spine density in response to noise exposure in both, the auditory cortex and the hippocampus. In contrast, AD model mice show decreased basal synaptic transmission and spine density in the same brain structures 4 months after the noise exposure. Moreover, long-term hearing loss in AD, but not in WT mice, impaired performance of AD mice in novel object recognition task at the presymptomatic disease stage. Finally, the authors show that hearing loss increased tau phosphorylation, pro-inflammatory markers, ROS levels and reduced HO-1 expression. This work strongly suggests that familial AD mutations impair the compensatory system of the auditory cortex and the hippocampus, leading to long-term synaptic impairments. While electrophysiological and spine density measurements are well performed, the authors need to make a better link between the molecular changes they describe and the functional impairments induced by sensory deprivation in AD model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study addresses the epidemiological link between adult induced hearing loss and cognitive decline associated with a genetic model of Alzheimer's disease. The study evaluates the structural and functional changes in both the auditory cortex and hippocampus following noise-induced hearing loss in adult mice. Their results suggest that noise-induced hearing loss caused long-lasting synaptic and morphological changes to auditory cortex neurons, but only in the mouse model of AD (i.e., 3-Tg-AD mice). 3-Tg-AD mice with noise-induced hearing loss also displayed hippocampal dysfunction (e.g. elevated tau-phosphorylation, elevated neuroinflammation, altered oxidative stress levels) and poorer memory (e.g., novel object recognition). The strength of the study is the breadth of assessments used which provide useful information about the additive effect of hearing loss in animals with Alzheimer's-associated genetic deficits. However, the study has weaknesses that undermine the interpretation and impact of the results. For instance, the control animals display age-related hearing loss at a fairly early stage of mouse development (possibly due to the C57BL6 background), the ABR analysis is not carried out rigorously, and there is no relationship between the auditory cortex findings and the behavioral assay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors use a range of tools to address the effects of hearing impairment on neuronal function and behavior in the 3xTg model of AD. They report that in this specific model noise-induced hearing loss produces persistent functional (ie, fEPSP) and structural (ie, spine numbers, pGluA1, PSD95) impairments not only in the primary auditory cortex but also more remotely in the hippocampus, also leading to an earlier onset of memory impairment. They also report that these deficits correlate with an increase in pTau, TNFalpha and Il-1beta as well as increased levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Understanding the link between hearing loss and dementia is timely and important, however I feel more focus on investigating the key mechanisms that explain their results could improve the paper.</p><p>In Figure 1, it seems that a large number of mice was included in this study (74 3xTg and 67 WT) but it is difficult to understand how these mice were distributed to individual experiments. Do the authors have individual mice that underwent all (or most) of the experimental steps, and if so an analysis on an animal-by-animal basis would be appreciated.</p><p>In Figure 3D, individual data points between Ctrl and Noise are largely overlapping, and I am worried that significance is influenced by the 'outlier' in the Ctrl group. Please clarify, and also if all assumptions for a Student's t-test are met here.</p><p>More information regarding animals would be helpful, e.g. were mutant and wild-type mice housed together? Were also only male wild type mice used? This must be stated clearly. Were any mice single housed? This may affect behavior. Were experimenters blinded for the behavioral experiments?</p><p>I was wondering how well the noise-induced hearing loss represents the type of midlife hearing loss that is present in humans, and I feel this should be justified more explicitly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70908.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The ABR analysis did not include important information, especially which wave or waves were used for determining thresholds.

Specifically, hearing threshold levels were determined as the stimulus intensity at which a Wave I peak could be identified. We agree with the Reviewer that the later waves do not reflect cochlear injury. In fact, the mouse ABR is composed of four components, reflecting neural activity chiefly from the auditory nerve (Wave I), the cochlear nucleus (Wave II), the superior olivary complex (Wave III), and the lateral lemniscus and/or inferior colliculus (Wave IV) (Alvarado et al., Neurosci Res 2012; Scimemi et al., Acta Oto Ital 2014, Willot, Handbook of Mouse Auditory Research: From Behavior to Molecular Biology: Taylor and Francis, 2001). To measure auditory thresholds we used Wave I, that in mice is the largest and usually the last wave to disappear as the sound stimulus decreases (Willot, Handbook of Mouse Auditory Research: From Behavior to Molecular Biology: Taylor and Francis, 2001). It has been documented that Wave I is affected by noise exposure in several models and it correlated with damage to inner hair cells and loss of auditory nerve fibers (Kujawa and Liberman, J Neurosci 2009; Lavinsky et al., PLOS Genet 2015; Mehraei et al., J Neurosci 2016; Jongkamonwiwat et al., Cell Rep 2020). In mice most studies use Wave I to determine thresholds (Willot, Handbook of Mouse Auditory Research: From Behavior to Molecular Biology: Taylor and Francis, 2001). Nonetheless, in the revised manuscript we added the analysis of Wave I and Wave II latency-intensity curves (reflecting the speed of neural transmission) to provide further electrophysiological data supporting noise-induced cochlear damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the methods state that the tone bursts were &quot;…presented monaurally in an open field&quot; and then states, &quot;ABRs were assessed bilaterally in all animals…&quot;.

Specifically, to verify normal hearing before noise exposure, ABRs were recorded bilaterally to ensure no consistent left-right ear ABR asymmetry due to ear pathologies. After noise exposure, we do not expect inter-aural differences, considering that acoustic trauma delivered in open field induces bilateral and symmetric hearing loss. Thus the ABRs were recorded from the right ear only to increase the efficiency of data acquisition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a disconnect between the auditory cortex physiology results and the behavior.

Our data revealed no correlation between hearing thresholds and memory performance in NOR test. However, in noise exposed AD mice a high correlation between spine loss in auditory cortex and memory performance in NOR test was found (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.96; P = 0.019; see page10, lines 226-239 and Figure 7- supplement 2). These results suggest a correlation between structural plasticity of the auditory cortex and memory performance. Literature data suggest a relationship between auditory processes and cognitive functions (Griffiths et al., Neuron 2020; Johnson et al., Brain 2020; Slade et al., Trends Neurosci 2020); nevertheless, more in depth analyses of the anatomical substrates linking alterations of auditory cortex plasticity and neural circuits underlying memory deserve further investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The difference in ROS is dramatic between control and sensory-deprived AD mice. Could the authors confirm these findings by other tools? Does such a dramatic increase in ROS cause apoptosis of neurons, in addition to the reduction in spine density?</p></disp-quote><p>To address these issues we performed additional Western blot experiments further investigating oxidative stress and apoptosis.</p><p>Specifically, our analyses in the hippocampus of 3×Tg-AD mice revealed an increase of Nitrotyrosine in transgenic mice exposed to noise, reflecting an enhancement of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation and confirming oxidative/nitrosative stress in AD mice exposed to noise. Moreover, increased expression of active Caspase-3 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were observed, suggesting activation of apoptotic pathways in the AD mice exposed to noise.</p><p>The results of these experiments are reported at pages 12-13, lines 287-298 and shown in Figure 10- supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Changes in ROS and in HO1 expression are only correlative and not linked to functional and structural impairments observed in AD model mice. In the previous studies, the authors show that cochlear impairments can be reversed by Q10. A possible causal link between oxidative stress and impairments in CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission / spine density can be tested by local injections of antioxidants to the hippocampus. Otherwise, these results remain purely correlative and do not imply that it is ROS that impairs homeostatic capabilities of hippocampus and auditory cortex in AD model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional experiments would be required to unequivocally demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between changes in ROS/HO1 expression and functional/structural impairments observed in AD model mice. However, we would like to draw the reviewer’s attention on the fact that, according to Italian laws, new experiments including local injection of antioxidants to the hippocampus require a specific approval from the Ethics Committee of our University followed by additional authorization by the Italian Ministry of Health. These administrative procedures require many months, that would delay much the submission of our manuscript revision. We would appreciate very much if this Reviewer accepted that such control experiment is postponed to a follow-up study. In the revised manuscript, we acknowledged that in our experimental model changes in ROS/HO1 expression are potentially responsible for functional and structural impairments observed in AD model mice and that further experimental evidence is required to establish a cause-effect relationship (see page 17, lines 414-420).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The study used only male mice, but did not provide a rationale for doing so. There is a broad literature that indicates sex-specific differences in age-related hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss, and progression of AD /cognitive decline. Therefore, it would be particularly important for a study of this sort to consider sex as a critical biological variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers on the crucial role of gender differences. We have considered this potential criticism in planning our experiments. A rationale for the use of male animals has been added to the revised version of the manuscript (see page 19, lines 444-451). In fact, sex differences in the prevalence, risk and severity of AD have been demonstrated in numerous clinical and epidemiological studies (Zhu et al., Cell and Mol Life Sci 2021). Animal research with mouse models of AD also supports the greater susceptibility to AD in females (Koran et al., Brain Imaging Behav 2017; Laws et al., Curr Opin Psychiatry 2018;Yang et al., Neurosci. Bull 2018).</p><p>On the other hand, sexual hormones can influence noise-induced hearing loss in rodents (Milon et al., Biol Sex Differ 2018). Specifically, estrogens may have neuroprotective function in the inner ear (Meltser et al., J Clin Invest 2008; Shuster et al., J Acoust Soc Am 2019; Delhez et al., Cell Mol Life Sci 2020).</p><p>Taken together, females are more susceptible to AD pathology but they are less susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss. Based on this evidence and taken into account that male mice are more susceptible to noise-induced cochlear damage, we opted to focus our study on male animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) There is a potential concern regarding the statistical approach: For example,</p><p>In Figure 4, the groups in Figure 4C and 4D appear to have been analyzed using two separate ANOVAs. Since the dependent variable (i.e., number of spines) is the same for the different groups/conditions, one ANOVA should be used to establish whether or not a main effect is observed.</p></disp-quote><p>A two-way ANOVA comparing all groups has been performed. Statistical results (F values and level of significance) have been added to the revised manuscript (see page 7, lines 151-152 and 155-156).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3D, individual data points between Ctrl and Noise are largely overlapping, so significance may be influenced by the 'outlier' in the Ctrl group. Please clarify, and also if all assumptions for a Student's t-test are met here.</p></disp-quote><p>To identify outliers in our data set, we used the Outlier calculator in GraphPad Prism Software. This analysis identified no outliers from the curve fit and, therefore, no records were excluded from data analysis. However, we checked if statistical significance was affected by the highest data point in the Ctrl group and, after its removal, the level of significance was still &gt; 0.05.</p><p>Statistical analysis has been revised and two-way ANOVA has been performed rather than Student’s t-test (see page 6, lines 129-130 and 132-133).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure 1, it seems that a large number of mice was included in this study (74 3xTg and 67 WT) but it is difficult to understand how these mice were distributed to individual experiments. Do the authors have individual mice that underwent all (or most) of the experimental steps, and if so an analysis on an animal-by-animal basis would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>Sample size used for different experimental procedure is specified in each figure legend. Several animals underwent more than one experimental procedure (i.e., ABR, NOR, spine density evaluations). In the revised manuscript, we identified the subgroup of animals undergoing NOR test, ABR measurements and spine density and we performed an additional linear regression analysis to evaluate correlation index among these variables. Results of animal-by-animal analysis have been added in the revised manuscript (see page 10, lines 226-239) and shown in Figure 7- supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) More information regarding animals would be helpful, e.g. were mutant and wild-type mice housed together? Were any mice single housed? This may affect behavior. Were experimenters blinded for the behavioral experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>WT and AD mice and, within each group, noise-exposed and no-noise mice, were housed separately, in cages containing from 3 to 5 animals (see page 19, lines 455-456).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) It should be discussed / justified more explicitly how well the noise-induced hearing loss represents the type of midlife hearing loss that is present in humans.</p></disp-quote><p>Noise-induced hearing loss caused by single exposure to very loud sounds or repeated exposures to lower intensity sounds over an extended period is a major source of hearing disability worldwide. Moreover, noise for occupational or leisure exposures is considered one of the major risk factors for hearing loss in midlife (Nelson et al., 2005; Dobie, 2008; European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2002; Lancet committee 2020). Furthermore, in experimental studies, noise-induced hearing loss represents a reliable and replicable model of sensorineural hearing loss.</p><p>Our paradigm of acoustic trauma of repeated and high intensity stimulation can be representative of dangerous exposure in humans, in whom exposure to intensities &gt; 85-87 dB are generally considered limit safe values (ISO 1990; https://www.who.int; https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html). Furthermore, based on the mouse lifespan, the age of 3-6 months can be considered has a mature adult age (https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2017/november/when-are-mice-considered-old) and considering that 3×Tg-AD mice at the age of 2-3 months can be considered a model of preclinical AD, whereas the onset of AD phenotype manifests at 7 to 9 months, we focused our study on 6 months of age animals. Details have been added in the revised manuscript (see page 19, lines 440-441 and page 20, lines 468-470).</p></body></sub-article></article>
