animals, can provide unique insights into the changes in gene content that preceded the origin of animals. However, only two choanoflagellate genomes are currently available, providing poor coverage of their diversity. We sequenced transcriptomes of 19 additional choanoflagellate species to produce a comprehensive reconstruction of the gains and losses that shaped the ancestral animal gene repertoire. We identified ~1944 gene families that originated on the animal stem lineage, of which only 39 are conserved across all animals in our study. In addition, ~372 gene families previously thought to be animal-specific, including Notch, Delta, and homologs of the animal Toll-like receptor genes, instead evolved prior to the animal-choanoflagellate divergence. Our findings contribute to an increasingly detailed portrait of the gene families that defined the biology of the Urmetazoan and that may underpin core features of extant animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34226.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All animals, from sea sponges and reef-building corals to elephants and humans, share a single common ancestor that lived over half a billion years ago. This single-celled predecessor evolved the ability to develop into a creature made up of many cells with specialized jobs. Reconstructing the steps in this evolutionary process has been difficult because the earliest animals were soft-bodied and microscopic and did not leave behind fossils that scientists can study.</p><p>Though their bodies have since disintegrated, many of the instructions for building the first animals live on in genes that were passed on to life forms that still exist. Scientists are trying to retrace those genes back to the first animal by comparing the genomes of living animals with their closest relatives, the choanoflagellates. Choanoflagellates are single-celled, colony-forming organisms that live in waters around the world. Comparisons with choanoflagellates may help scientists identify which genes were necessary to help animals evolve and diversify into so many different species. So far, 1,000 animal and two choanoflagellate genomes have been sequenced. But the gene repertoires of most species of choanoflagellates have yet to be analyzed.</p><p>Now, Richter et al. have cataloged the genes of 19 more species of choanoflagellates. This added information allowed them to recreate the likely gene set of the first animal and to identify genetic changes that occurred during animal evolution. The analyses showed that modern animals lost about a quarter of the genes present in their last common ancestor with choanoflagellates and gained an equal number of new genes. Richter et al. identified several dozen core animal genes that were gained and subsequently preserved throughout animal evolution. Many of these are necessary so that an embryo can develop properly, but the precise roles of some core genes remain a mystery. Most other genes that emerged in the first animals have been lost in at least one living animal.</p><p>The study of Richter et al. also showed that some very important genes in animals, including genes essential for early development and genes that help the immune system detect pathogens, predate animals. These key genes trace back to animals’ last common ancestor with choanoflagellates and may have evolved new roles in animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>choanoflagellates</kwd><kwd>Urmetazoan</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>ancestral gene content</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisen</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Central Europe Summer Research Institute Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chang-Lin Tien Fellowship in Environmental Sciences and Biodiversity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004584</institution-id><institution>Conseil Régional de Bretagne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French Government &quot;Investissements d'Avenir&quot;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCEANOMICS (ANR-11-BTBR-0008)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDEN IOS 0955517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fozouni</surname><given-names>Parinaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genomes of animal progenitors evolved as mosaics of old, new, rearranged, and repurposed protein domains, genes and pathways and paved the way for the origin and evolution of animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biology of the first animal, the ‘Urmetazoan,’ has fascinated and confounded biologists for more than a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dujardin, 1841</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">James-Clark, 1867</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Haeckel, 1869</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Haeckel, 1873</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Haeckel, 1874</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kent, 1880</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Leadbeater and McCready, 2000</xref>).

These two choanoflagellates are the strictly unicellular <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic> and the emerging model choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta,</italic> which differentiates into a number of sexual and asexual cell types, ranging from single cells to multicellular rosette colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). The <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic> genomes revealed that many genes critical for animal biology, including p53, Myc, cadherins, C-type lectins, and diverse tyrosine kinases, evolved before the divergence of animals and choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fairclough et al., 2013</xref>), whereas many other genes essential for animal biology, including components of the Wnt, Notch/Delta, Hedgehog, TGF-β, and innate immune pathways (e.g., Toll-like receptors) have not been detected in choanoflagellates, and therefore have been considered textbook examples of animal innovations.</p><p>Nonetheless, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic> are relatively closely related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2017</xref>), leaving the bulk of choanoflagellate diversity unexplored. Moreover, both species have demonstrably experienced gene loss, as some genes conserved among animals and non-choanoflagellates are apparently missing from <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>. Examples include RNAi pathway components, which are present across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Shabalina and Koonin, 2008</xref>), the cell adhesion protein β-integrin, and T-box and Runx transcription factor families, which have been detected in the filasterean <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Sebé-Pedrós and Ruiz-Trillo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ferrer-Bonet and Ruiz-Trillo, 2017</xref>). Gene loss can lead to false negatives during ancestral genome reconstruction, and the phenomenon in choanoflagellates parallels that of animals, where two species selected for early genome projects, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, were later found to have lost numerous genes (e.g., Hedgehog and NF-κΒ in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and fibrillar collagens in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) that are critical for animal development and otherwise conserved across animal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Aspöck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gilmore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Rubin et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To counteract the impact of gene loss in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta,</italic> and gain a more complete picture of the Urmetazoan gene catalog, we analyzed the protein coding genes of 19 previously unsequenced species of choanoflagellates representing each major known lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2017</xref>). By comparing their gene catalogs with those of diverse animals and other phylogenetically relevant lineages, we have greatly expanded and refined our understanding of the genomic heritage of animals. This more comprehensive data set revealed that ~372 gene families that were previously thought to be animal-specific actually evolved prior to the divergence of choanoflagellates and animals, including gene families required for animal development (e.g., Notch/Delta) and immunity (e.g., Toll-like receptors). We find that an additional ~1944 gene families evolved along the animal stem lineage, many of which likely underpin unique aspects of animal biology. Although most of these animal-specific genes were subsequently lost from one or more species, 39 core animal-specific genes are conserved in all animals within our data set, likely because of their importance to core features of animal biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The phylogenetic distribution of animal and choanoflagellate gene families</title><p>To reconstruct the genomic landscape of animal evolution, we first cataloged the protein coding potential of nineteen diverse choanoflagellate species by sequencing and assembling their transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Next, we used subsets of our data to reconstruct the phylogeny of choanoflagellates. We found that the positions of two species lying on long terminal branches (<italic>Salpingoeca dolichothecata</italic> and <italic>Codosiga hollandica</italic>) were poorly supported or recovered at inconsistent locations (Materials and methods). Therefore, to avoid basing our comparative genomics efforts on a potentially incorrect phylogeny, and because the focus of our study was on reconstructing large-scale patterns of gene family evolution between animals and choanoflagellates, we designed our analyses to be independent of species relationships within either group. [For display purposes only, we relied on a consensus of previously published phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Philippe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2017</xref>)].</p><p>We next compared the choanoflagellate gene catalogs with those of diverse animals and phylogenetically relevant outgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to identify orthologous gene families and determine the ancestry of genes present in animals (see Materials and methods for rationale underlying inferences of gene family orthology). In summary, two features that distinguish our analyses from prior reconstructions of ancestral animal gene content are (1) the additional breadth and depth provided by 19 phylogenetically diverse and newly-sequenced choanoflagellates and (2) a probabilistic and phylogenetically-informed approach designed to avoid the artificial inflation of ancestral gene content resulting from methods that rely on binary decisions for gene family presence or absence in each species while remaining independent of currently unresolved or contentious species relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, Materials and methods).</p><p>By grouping gene families by their phylogenetic distribution on a heat map, we were able to visualize and infer their evolutionary history, as well as their presence or absence in each species analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Several notable observations emerged from this visualization. First, the origins of animals, choanoflagellates, and choanozoans [the monophyletic group composed of animals and choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>)] were each accompanied by the evolution of distinct sets of gene families (i.e., synapomorphies), some of which likely underpin their unique biological features. Second, the numbers of gene families gained on the animal and choanoflagellate stem lineages are roughly equivalent (~1944 and ~2,463, respectively), indicating that the specific functions of novel gene families, not their quantity, were critical to the very different phenotypes each clade went on to have. Finally, although different sets of gene families can reliably be inferred to have been present in the last common ancestor of each group, gene family loss was rampant during animal and choanoflagellate diversification. [After these analyses were complete, several additional genomes from early-branching holozoans and animals became available. Incorporating them <italic>post hoc</italic> into the heat map did not substantially change any of the above observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; Materials and methods)].</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34226.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The evolution of gene families in animals, choanoflagellates and their eukaryotic relatives.</title><p>Top, a consensus phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Philippe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2017</xref>) of the species whose gene contents were compared.

pathways known to be critical for animal biology. Indeed, this set of genes includes seven from the Wnt pathway (including Frizzled, Dishevelled, TCF/LEF and β-catenin), five involved in cell-cell adhesion (including integrin α, laminin, and vinculin), and other well-known animal gene families such as JNK, caspases, and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The 39 core animal gene families also include several that are less well characterized or whose specific contributions to animal origins and animal biology are not immediately obvious, such as two subunits of the transcription-regulating Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>) and the ubiquitination-associated BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">DeAndrade et al., 2012</xref>). For comparison, choanoflagellates have a similarly small set of 75 gene families (out of ~2463 choanoflagellate-specific gene families) that are conserved in all 21 choanoflagellate species that we sampled; 27% of these gene families encode Pfam domains related to kinase signaling (including protein kinases, phosphatases and adapters; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>While novel features of animal biology might have evolved with the emergence of new gene families, the loss of ancient genes also influenced animal origins. We detected ~1645 gene families that evolved prior to the choanoflagellate-animal divergence that were retained in choanoflagellates and lost entirely from animals. These include gene families in pathways necessary for the biosynthesis of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, histidine, lysine and threonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The shikimic acid pathway, which is required for the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine, and other aromatic compounds, was also lost along the animal stem lineage [although subsequently regained in cnidarians through horizontal gene transfer from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fitzgerald and Szmant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Starcevic et al., 2008</xref>)]. We thus demonstrate that components of the biosynthesis pathways for nine amino acids that are essential in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Payne and Loomis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Guedes et al., 2011</xref>) were lost on the animal stem lineage, and not prior to the divergence of choanoflagellates and animals. The SLN1 two-component osmosensing system, which has been shown in fungi to regulate acclimation to changes in environmental salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Posas et al., 1996</xref>), is also conserved in choanoflagellates but absent in animals. [Although these amino acid synthesis and osmosensing pathway components were retained in choanoflagellates, several other gene families involved in diverse biosynthetic pathways were instead lost on the choanoflagellate stem lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>)]. Together, the ensemble of animal gene family losses reflects the substantial changes in metabolism and ecology that likely occurred during early animal evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Choanozoan-specific gene families: innovation and loss</title><p>In addition to the set of gene families that evolved on the animal stem lineage, those that originated on the holozoan and choanozoan stem lineages also contributed to the genomic heritage of animals. Our increased sampling of choanoflagellate diversity allowed us to ask whether gene families previously thought to have been animal innovations, due to their absence from <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and other outgroups, may in fact have evolved before the divergence of animals and choanoflagellates. We found that ~372 gene families previously thought to be restricted to animals have homologs in one or more of the 19 newly sequenced choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref> for a list of pathways with components gained or lost on the Choanozoan stem lineage).</p><p>Within this set of genes are the Notch receptor and its ligand Delta/Serrate/Jagged (hereafter Delta), which interact to regulate proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis during animal developmental patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). Intact homologs of these important signaling proteins have never previously been detected in non-animals, although some of their constituent protein domains were previously found in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and <italic>C. owczarzaki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Suga et al., 2013</xref>). In our expanded choanoflagellate data set, we detected a clear Notch homolog in <italic>Mylnosiga fluctuans</italic> with the prototypical EGF (epidermal growth factor), Notch, transmembrane and Ank (ankyrin) domains in the canonical order, while five other choanoflagellates contain a subset of the typical protein domains of Notch proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). Similarly, the choanoflagellate species <italic>S. dolichothecata</italic> expresses a protein containing both of the diagnostic domains of animal Delta (MNNL and DSL, both of which were previously thought to be animal-specific) and four other choanoflagellate species express one of the two diagnostic domains of Delta, but not both. The distributions of Notch and Delta in choanoflagellates suggest that they were present in the Urchoanozoan and subsequently lost from most (but not all) choanoflagellates, although it is formally possible that they evolved convergently through shuffling of the same protein domains in animals and in choanoflagellates. A similar portrait emerges for the cadherins Flamingo and Protocadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chae et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Usui et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Frank and Kemler, 2002</xref>) that were previously thought to be animal-specific, but are found in a subset of choanoflagellates within our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, Materials and methods).</p><p>We also found evidence that numerous gene families and pathways that originated in animals arose through shuffling of more ancient protein domains and genes that were already present in the Urchoanozoan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ekman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Grau-Bové et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the new choanoflagellate gene catalogs confirm that several signature animal signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog, Wnt, JNK, JAK-STAT, and Hippo, are composed of a mixture of gene families that were present in the Urchoanozoan and others that evolved later on the animal stem lineage or within animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Snell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hausmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Richards and Degnan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Babonis and Martindale, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

The patchwork ancestry of the Urmetazoan genome is illustrated by the fact that many gene families responsible for animal development, immunity and multicellular organization evolved through shuffling of protein domains that first originated in the choanozoan stem lineage together with ancient or animal-specific domains (e.g. the TGF-β ligand and receptor; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). In addition, other gene families found in the Urchoanozoan were subsequently combined into new pathways in the animal stem lineage along with newly evolved genes (e.g., the TLR and Hedgehog pathways; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Moreover, the history of the Urmetazoan genome is not simply one of innovation and co-option, as ~1,645 Urchoanozoan genes were lost on the animal stem lineage, including genes for the synthesis of nine essential amino acids <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">[Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">(Payne and Loomis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Guedes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Erives and Fassler, 2015</xref>)]. A study based on similar methodology that incorporated two of the 21 choanoflagellate species analyzed here (<italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>) was recently published and found a similar pattern of gene innovation on the animal stem lineage, while also identifying many of the same core animal-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Paps and Holland, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The origin of multicellularity in animals provided novel niches for bacteria to exploit, requiring the first animals to evolve new mechanisms for mediating interactions with pathogenic and commensal bacteria. In addition, the progenitors of animals interacted with bacteria – both as prey and pathogens – and the roots of animal innate immunity clearly predate animal origins. We have found that choanoflagellates express TLRs, transmembrane receptors that trigger the animal innate immune response, as well as its canonical downstream signaling target, NF-κB, suggesting that both existed in the Urchoanozoan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,c</xref>). Like modern choanoflagellates and sponges, the Urchoanozoan likely preyed upon bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Richter and King, 2013</xref>), and bacterial cues can induce life history transitions in choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">2017</xref>), although the mechanisms by which choanoflagellates capture bacteria and sense bacterial cues are unknown. We hypothesize that the core TLR/NF-κB pathway functioned in prey sensing, immunity, or more complex processes in the Urchoanozoan that subsequently formed the basis of a self-defense system in animals. Because critical pathway members linking TLR and NF-κB appear to be animal innovations (e.g., MyD88), the animal signaling pathway may have evolved to diversify downstream signaling processes to tailor responses in a multicellular context. This pathway diversification may have included the evolution of roles in development, as TLRs have been implicated in both NF-κB-dependent and NF-κB-independent developmental signaling (in addition to their functions in immunity) in bilaterians and in the cnidarian <italic>N. vectensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brennan et al., 2017</xref>). The uncharacterized choanoflagellate-specific Kinase TLRs and Kinase TIRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>) may function as part of a streamlined signaling pathway that mediates responses to extracellular cues, including bacteria, although further research will be required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our study provides a detailed view of the changes in gene content that laid the foundation for animal origins. Innovations in gene and protein regulation in the Urmetazoan also likely contributed to animal evolution, as features of animal phosphoproteome remodeling, gene co-regulation and alternative splicing (but not animal promoter types and enhancers) have been found in <italic>C. owczarzaki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">2016b</xref>) and in the holozoan <italic>Creolimax fragrantissima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">de Mendoza et al., 2015</xref>). Multicellularity has also evolved independently in a number of other eukaryotic lineages, including slime molds, brown algae, fungi, and chlorophytes. In each transition to multicellularity, the underlying genomic changes are distinct from those that occurred on the animal stem lineage. For example, in the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, many novel gene families are involved in extracellular sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Glöckner et al., 2016</xref>), similar to the marked increase in signal transduction gene families found in the multicellular brown alga <italic>Ectocarpus siliculosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cock et al., 2010</xref>). Gene innovations in multicellular ascomycete fungi are enriched for functions related to endomembrane organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>) and the gene complement of the multicellular green alga <italic>Volvox carteri</italic> is largely distinguished from its unicellular relative <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> by expansions or contractions within gene families, rather than the evolution of new families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Prochnik et al., 2010</xref>). Through our analyses of genomes and transcriptomes representing the full breadth of choanoflagellate and animal diversity, we have provided a genome-scale overview of the gene families whose invention or co-option distinguished the Urmetazoan from all other organisms and therefore may have provided a basis for the evolution of unique mechanisms regulating development, homeostasis and immunity in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The sections on Quality trimming, Error correction, <italic>De novo</italic> transcriptome assembly, Identification and removal of cross-contamination, Prediction of amino acid sequences from assembled transcripts and elimination of redundant transcripts, and Measurement of expression levels and elimination of noise transcripts were described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Peña et al., 2016</xref>).

We initially treated each culture with all ten antibiotics. We selected initial treatments that decreased bacterial density and diversity, and then repeatedly diluted the cultures into fresh medium with the same antibiotic until no further change in bacterial density or diversity was observed. We then re-treated each of these cultures with an additional test of all ten antibiotics, as their modified bacterial communities often responded differently from their initial communities.

We used filtered water (Milli-Q, Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts) when preparing all solutions. For marine species, we used 32.9 grams per liter of artificial seawater (Tropic Marin, Montague, Massachusetts, United States).

Once cool, we removed large particles of cereal grass by repeated vacuum filtration through a ceramic Buchner funnel with a double layer of Grade one cellulose filter paper (Whatman, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States).

We produced a rough estimate of the amount of choanoflagellate total RNA present in each sample by calculating the ratio of choanoflagellate to bacterial ribosomal RNA peaks (18S vs. 16S and 28S vs. 23S) and multiplying the resulting fraction by the total amount of RNA present in the sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Test of polyA selection to separate choanoflagellate from bacterial RNA</title><p>The standard library preparation protocol for Illumina mRNA sequencing used poly-dT beads to separate polyadenylated mRNA from other types of non-polyadenylated RNA such as rRNA and tRNA.

We began by using the ‘fastq-converter.pl’ script to convert from FASTQ and to discard reads with more than one ambiguous character ‘N’ in any window of 13 bases. For reads with one ‘N’, we chose the character ‘a’ as the substitute for ‘N’, as all of the characters in our input reads were in upper case (A, C, G, or T); thus, we could later recognize ‘N’ bases converted in this step. Next, we tuned parameters using the ‘seq-analy’ utility following the authors’ instructions, in four steps: (1) Running ‘seq-analy’ with default settings. (2) Adjusting the input settings to ‘seq-analy’ using the results from step 1. For all species, we set MaxBadQPerKmer to eight and KmerLen to 25 (to match the k-mer length used in Trinity). (3) Re-running ‘seq-analy’ using the adjusted input settings. (4) Creating the input settings to ‘Reptile’ based on the output of step 3. We set KmerLen to 13 and step to 12 for all species. The values of QThreshold, T_expGoodCnt, T_card and Qlb differed by species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All other parameters were left at their defaults to run Reptile.</p><p>We noticed that the locations within reads of errors identified by Reptile fell into two general classes: sporadic errors not located adjacent to any other error, and clustered errors, in which several adjacent bases within the same k-mer window were identified as errors. In some extreme cases, every single base within a sequence read was identified as a target for error correction; we observed this phenomenon in the set of read corrections for every species. We reasoned that this was an unintended consequence of the iteration-to-exhaustion approach (step 2d) of the Reptile algorithm. Therefore, we designed a method to correct sporadic errors, but not clustered errors. For each species, we began by grouping each read according to the total number of errors identified. Within each group, we built a distribution of the number of adjacent errors within the same k-mer window. For sporadic errors, this number should be close to 0, but for clustered errors, the number could be up to the k-mer size minus one. There was a clear pattern within each of these distributions, with some errors identified with no neighbors (sporadic errors), a smaller number identified with one neighbor, and an increasing number beginning at two or more neighbors (clustered errors). We used these empirical distributions to set the maximum allowable amount of neighboring errors within a k-mer window as the count just prior to the beginning of the secondary increase within each distribution. For example, for <italic>D. grandis</italic>, in the case of the group of reads containing four total identified errors, there were 316,103 errors with no neighbors within the same k-mer, 197,411 with one neighbor, 156,043 with two neighbors, and 353,639 with three neighbors (that is, all four errors were within the same k-mer window). Thus, for the group of reads containing four total identified errors in <italic>D. grandis</italic>, we only corrected errors with up to two neighboring errors in the same k-mer window. After running Reptile error correction of sequence reads and quality files subject to these cutoffs, we performed a final step of restoring ambiguous bases converted by ‘fastq-converter.pl’ (from ‘N’ to ‘a’) that were not subsequently corrected by Reptile back to their original value of ‘N’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>De novo <italic>transcriptome assembly</italic></title><p>We performed de novo transcriptome assembly on trimmed, corrected sequence reads and quality files with Trinity release 2013-02-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>) with ‘--min_contig_length’ set to 150 and all other parameters at their default values. We chose a minimum contig length of 150 (rather than the default of 200) so as not to exclude assembly fragments that might encode predicted proteins with lengths between 50 and 66 amino acids, because some domains in the Pfam database are as short as 50 amino acids. Because none of the species we sequenced had an available genome assembly, we did not know whether transcripts might be encoded in overlapping positions within the genome. To test this possibility, we repeated each Trinity assembly with the addition of the ‘--jaccard-clip’ option and compared the estimated number of fusion transcripts predicted by Transdecoder release 2012-08-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Haas et al., 2013</xref>).

We ran blastn version 2.2.26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) with a maximum E value of 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> to query contigs from each species against all other species. Because of the evolutionary distances among the choanoflagellates we sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), most contigs from one species had no matches in any other species. Within the contigs that did have cross-species matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>), we observed a large number that were identical or nearly-identical, which were likely cross-contaminants, and another set of matches distributed around roughly 80% identity, likely representing highly conserved genes. The two cases were separated at roughly 96% identity. After exploring the distribution of match lengths in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>), we considered matches at 96% or greater identity of at least 90 bases in length to be cross-contaminated.</p><p>Next, we identified the sources of cross-contaminated contigs by comparing the number of reads mapping from both species for each match. We first masked contigs with Tandem Repeats Finder version 4.04 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Benson, 1999</xref>), with the following parameter values: match = 2, mismatch = 7, indel penalty = 7, match probability = 80, mismatch probability = 10, min score = 30, max period = 24.

We ran BWA ‘aln’ with the ‘-n 200’ option to allow up to 200 equally best hits to be reported, and all other parameter values left at their defaults. Based on the distribution of read mapping ratios between the pair of species matching for each cross-contaminated contig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>), we retained only contigs for the species in a pair with 10 times or more reads mapping, and discarded all other contigs, with one exception: if a contig had at least 10,000 reads mapping, we did not discard it, regardless of read mapping ratio. We observed that many contigs encoding conserved genes (for example, α-tubulin and elongation factor 1α) also tended to be the most highly expressed, and thus the read mapping ratio was often close to one for these contigs. We identified as cross-contaminated and removed between 1.7 and 8.8% of contigs for each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Furthermore, we also observed many contigs whose predicted proteins were a strict subset of the predicted proteins from another contig. For example, contig one might encode predicted proteins A and B, and contig two might encode two predicted proteins exactly matching A and B, and a third predicted protein C.

Although numerous approaches are currently available, no existing algorithm can yet identify all orthologous genes while perfectly separating orthologs from spurious BLAST hits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Quest for Orthologs consortium et al., 2016</xref>).

Approaches based on binary presence/absence calls, originally developed for morphological characters where the probability of homoplasy is considered to be much lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Farris, 1977</xref>), may be vulnerable to yielding hyperinflated estimates of the gene content of the Urchoanozoan, since any gene family containing at least one protein from animals and one from choanoflagellates could be inferred to have been present in the Urchoanozoan. Indeed, we observed a number of gene families containing many animals but only one or two choanoflagellates, and vice versa (for example, there were 130 gene families containing one choanoflagellate and ≥15 animal species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). If these gene families represented true orthologous groups and were therefore present in the ancestral Choanozoan, they would require several independent loss events within one of the two groups; we reasoned that it was more parsimonious that some proportion of these genes evolved in only one of the two groups and that the isolated BLAST hits from the other group represented false positives.</p><p>To address this problem, we produced membership probabilities for each protein within each gene family, based on its average BLAST E value to all other proteins within the gene family (the absence of a BLAST hit between a pair of proteins was treated as the maximum possible (i.e., least probable) E value). A true ortholog should have low E value hits to nearly all other members of its gene family, resulting in a low average E value. In contrast, a false ortholog should have higher E value hits to only one or a few members of the gene family, resulting in a high average E value. If there were multiple proteins from the same species in a gene family, we chose the protein with the lowest average BLAST E value. To produce probabilities from average E values, we rescaled them using the empirical cumulative density function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">van der Vaart, 1998</xref>, p. 265) of all E values from the initial all versus all homology search. We ordered E values from highest to lowest to produce a probability between 0 and 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Within the resulting probabilities, a protein with low E value BLAST hits to all other members of its gene family had a probability close to 1, and a protein with high E value BLAST hits to only a few members of its gene family had a probability close to 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>). We found that most proteins fell close to one of these extremes, and that the probabilities clearly distinguished hits between proteins within the same gene family versus hits between proteins in two different gene families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>). In addition, proteins within gene families identified above containing many choanoflagellates and many animals had probabilities closer to 1, whereas some proteins within gene families with few choanoflagellates and many animals were assigned low probabilities, which are likely to be false orthologs, and some were assigned high probabilities likely representing true orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f</xref>). We conclude that this approach was able to identify and remove a substantial proportion of false orthologs, resulting in a set of gene families highly enriched for (although still not entirely composed of) truly orthologous families.</p><p>We tested the effectiveness of our approach to screen out false positive orthologs by building a phylogenetic tree using gene family 9066 as an example. This gene family contains numerous animal sequences and a single choanoflagellate sequence, which was assigned a probability of 0.03 for gene family membership due to its high average blastp E value to other members of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). We first aligned the protein sequences in gene family 9066 using MAFFT version 7.130b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) with the parameters ‘--maxiterate 1000 --localpair’ and trimmed alignments using trimAl version 1.2rev59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) with the parameter ‘-gt 0.5’. We next built an HMM for the trimmed alignment using hmmbuild from the HMMer package version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eddy, 2011</xref>) and searched the full protein complement of each species using hmmsearch, both with default parameter values. For each species, we retrieved the top hit among sequences not present in gene family 9066. We aligned the sequences found by hmmsearch together with those from gene family 9066 using MAFFT and trimAl as above, modifying the trimAl missing sequences threshold to be ‘-gt 0.25’, in order to include parts of the alignment only present in sequences from gene family 9066 (which represented slightly more than one quarter of the sequences included in the alignment).

Based on the resulting distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>), for a gene family to be considered present in a major group, we required this sum to be ≥10% of the number of species in the major group (stated alternatively, we required the average presence probability in the group to be ≥10%). Notably, the 10% threshold was independent of the tree topology within each major group, thereby minimizing the impact of currently unresolved within-group species relationships [e.g., among early-branching animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">King and Rokas, 2017</xref>)]. For choanoflagellates and animals, each of which have 21 species in our data set, this equates, for example, to a gene family represented at high probability (≥70%, corresponding to an average BLAST E value of 1 × 10<sup>−20</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>) in three or more species, or at 35% probability (E value of 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) in six or more species. Therefore, the only truly orthologous gene families likely to be excluded by this threshold are those with weak homology (i.e., average BLAST E values &gt; 10<sup>−10</sup>) to only a few species in a major group, a rare case which would also require numerous independent losses of the gene family within the group.</p><p>Next, we developed a set of parsimony-based rules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) to determine the origin of each gene family. If a gene family was present within two separate major groups, we considered it to have been present in their last common ancestor. For gene families containing proteins from species in only one major group, we considered it to have been present in the last common ancestor of that major group only if it was present (i.e., satisfying the 10% probability threshold) within two or more separate sub-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

An animal-specific gene family present in at least two of these three sub-groups would be considered to have been present in the Urmetazoan (and thus to have evolved on the animal stem lineage); this inference would not change if either sponges or ctenophores were the earliest-branching animals. Similarly, a choanoflagellate-specific gene family was required to be present within both craspedids and loricates [two well-defined groups of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Leadbeater, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carr et al., 2017</xref>)] to be considered present in the Urchoanozoan.

As a consequence, counts of gene families originating in different groups should represent relatively conservative estimates.</p><p>To produce a heat map for visual display of gene families, we ordered them by their patterns of presence within the five major species groups.

The three different methods produced substantially different estimates of ancestral gene family content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). We performed Dollo parsimony analysis on presence/absence data for all gene families using PHYLIP version 3.695 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Felsenstein, 2013</xref>) with default parameter values.

We supplied presence/absence data only for gene families present in more than one species (i.e., we eliminated singletons), and specified the options ‘noabsencesites’ and ‘nosingletonpresence’ to correct for unobservable site patterns following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Pisani et al., 2015</xref>), with <italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic> as the outgroup, gamma-distributed rate variation among sites, and other parameters left at their defaults. We ran separate analyses for each ancestral node of interest, each time including the species descended from that node as a topology constraint. We ran each analysis with a sampling frequency of 1000 generations until the average standard deviation of split frequencies between runs reached 0.01 (between 5 million and 10 million generations, depending on the ancestral node of interest). For the two analyses that produced probabilities of gene family presence at internal nodes (maximum likelihood and Bayesian), we calculated total counts as follows: for gene family presence, we summed the probabilities across all gene families. For gene family gains, we summed the difference in probability between each node of interest and its parent (e.g., the Urmetazoan and its parent, the Urchoanozoan) only for the gene families with a higher probability of presence in the node of interest compared with its parent. For gene family losses, we performed an analogous sum only for the gene families with lower probabilities in the node of interest in comparison to its parent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Test of gene family presence in recently released genomes</title><p>Because new genome sequences are continuously becoming available, we tested whether the ancestral gene content reconstruction we performed would be influenced by the addition of new genome-scale data from two key sets of species: early-branching animals and early-branching holozoans. We chose species with high-quality publicly available protein catalogs that would maximize the phylogenetic diversity added to our data set. For early-branching animals, we selected two sponges, the demosponge <italic>Tethya wilhelma</italic> version v01_augustus_prots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Francis et al., 2017</xref>) and the calcareous sponge <italic>Sycon ciliatum</italic> version SCIL_T-PEP_130802 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fortunato et al., 2014</xref>), and one ctenophore, <italic>Pleurobrachia bachei</italic> version 02_P-bachei_Filtered_Gene_Models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Moroz et al., 2014</xref>).

Because we planned to implement a best reciprocal BLAST approach, which might be confounded by paralogs present within any of the species, we began by removing redundancy separately for each species using CD-HIT version 4.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>) with default parameter values. We then performed best reciprocal blastp from the protein catalog of each additional species versus all 59 species included in our original analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), with the same maximum E value (1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). We retained only top reciprocal blastp hits. We next calculated gene family presence probabilities for each additional species, using a slightly modified procedure. Because we retained only the top hit for each additional species protein to each original species, an additional species protein could only match to a single representative per species within each gene family, although the family might contain multiple representatives per species. Thus, instead of calculating average E value from each additional species protein to all members of each gene family (as we did for the original set), we calculated the average of best hits to each species within the family. Next, because each protein from an additional species might hit multiple different gene families, we chose the single gene family match with the lowest average E value. Finally, for each gene family and each additional species, we selected the lowest average E value of any protein in the species to the gene family and translated those to probabilities using the same empirical cumulative density function as for the original analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>To visualize whether the additional species might substantially impact our inferences of ancestral gene content, we inserted their presence probabilities into the original heat map of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> without reordering gene families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The additional sponges display similar patterns of gene family presence probability to the original sponge species in the analysis, as does the additional ctenophore in comparison to the original ctenophore. With these species added, the number of gene families present in the Urmetazoan in our original data set, ~8,418, would increase by 37, sixteen of which would be previously choanoflagellate-specific gene families newly classified as shared with animals. Within the early-branching holozoans, <italic>C. perkinsii</italic> appears to show slight evidence for the presence of animal-specific gene families, but generally with low probabilities, roughly comparable to the choanoflagellate <italic>S. dolichothecata</italic>. Thus, we estimate that a very small number of animal-specific gene families would instead be classified as originating in Holozoa with the addition of early-branching holozoans (13 of ~1,944). In addition, since we only included one representative early-branching holozoan (<italic>C. owczarzaki</italic>) in our original analysis, a subset of gene families originally classified as originating in Choanozoa would instead be assigned to Holozoa with the additional species (30); in general, however, we did not strongly emphasize the distinction between choanozoan-origin and holozoan-origin gene families in our results. Furthermore, as described below (Protein domains and evidence for gene presence based on domain architecture), the additional species would have a negligable effect on our inferences of gene family presence based on protein domain architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Species tree and phylogenetic diversity</title><p>We attempted to produce a robustly supported phylogenetic tree reflecting the relationships among <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and the choanoflagellate species we sequenced.

Furthermore, because our major findings were based on comparisons among groups whose phylogenetic relationships are well established (animals, choanoflagellates, <italic>C. owczarzaki</italic>, fungi and other eukaryotes), differences in tree topology within any of these groups should be of minor importance.

Second, gene families containing repeated or repetitive protein domains (e.g. EGF or Ankyrin) might cause inappropriate inferences of sequence homology in our BLAST-based approach. Third, a true orthologous gene family present in all animals could be erroneously partitioned by OrthoMCL into two or more gene families, neither of which would then be considered present in all animals. Fourth, a gene family which duplicated on the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of a group could produce two gene families, among which paralogs are incorrectly partitioned, resulting in one or more species appearing to lack one of the two families.

We found that the domain architecture of LRR, transmembrane domain and TIR, in that order, was unique to choanozoans, consistent with the independent evolution in plants of immune-related proteins that contain the same protein domains but with distinct domain architectures, different pattern recognition, and different downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ausubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>). The domain architectures LRR, transmembrane, Pkinase, TIR (‘Kinase TLRs’) and Pkinase, TIR lacking a transmembrane domain (‘Kinase TIRs’) were both unique to choanoflagellates. We did not distinguish among members of the LRR and TIR families (whose names in Pfam take the form of LRR_X, where X is a number, or TIR/TIR_2), because we found that different animal TLRs could contain domain combinations of each type. For example, <italic>M. musculus</italic> TLR11 (UniProt Q6R5P0, NCBI GI 45429992) contains LRR_8 and TIR_2 domains, whereas <italic>M. musculus</italic> TLR6 (UniProt Q9EPW9, NCBI GI 157057101) contains LRR_4 and TIR domains. We also did not attempt to differentiate among single vs. multiple cysteine cluster LRR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Imler and Zheng, 2004</xref>), because we found that TLRs containing a multiple cysteine cluster LRRNT Pfam domain as the final LRR prior to the transmembrane region were restricted to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> within our data set.</p><p>We tested whether phylogenetic evidence could be used to confirm or contradict our findings based on protein domain architecture, although we anticipated that the repeated nature of LRR domains and the relatively short length of TIR domains might interfere with the resolution of phylogeny reconstructions. We aligned all proteins in our data set containing two of the three of LRR, Pkinase and TIR with MAFFT version 7.130b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) with default parameters (we were unable to build an alignment using MAFFT high accuracy parameters due to the large number of proteins involved). We trimmed the alignment using trimAl version 1.2rev59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) with the option ‘-gt 0.4’ and built phylogenetic trees using RAxML version 8.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>), with the options ‘-m PROTGAMMALGF’ and ‘-f a -N 100’. We visualized trees and removed branches with less than 50% bootstrap support using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) web site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Letunic and Bork, 2016</xref>). The resulting tree was largely unresolved, as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), although there were no cases in which a choanozoan-type TLR (LRR, transmembrane, TIR) was found in the same supported clade as a plant protein, consistent with the hypothesis that they evolved independently.</p><p>Although we did not find strong evidence for canonical animal TLR domain architecture in sponges, <italic>M. leidyi</italic> and <italic>T. adhaerens</italic>, we did detect proteins in sponges and cnidarians matching the domain content of animal interleukin receptors, which can also signal via MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">O'Neill and O’Neill, 2008</xref>): an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular TIR domain [as found previously for the sponge <italic>A. queenslandica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gauthier et al., 2010</xref>)]. This architecture was not present in choanoflagellates nor any other non-animal in our data set. We note that, in our analyses, the proteins previously identified as TLR2 homologs in <italic>A. queenslandica</italic>, <italic>O. carmela</italic> and other sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Riesgo et al., 2014</xref>) appear to have domain architectures matching interleukin receptors or other proteins, but not TLRs.</p><p>For genes in the canonical <italic>M. musculus</italic> TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway, we collected information on domain architectures in the Pfam 31.0 database (which did not include the choanoflagellates sequenced in this study) and on the species present in the same gene family as the <italic>M. musculus</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>). With the exception of adapters and kinases containing the Death domain, there were no architectures that were both specific to animals and present across animal diversity, two features required of diagnostic architectures for a gene family. Similarly, we did not identify any gene families restricted to holozoans (as would be expected for genes participating in the TLR/NF-κB pathway) and whose choanoflagellate members we could unequivocally identify as orthologous to the <italic>M. musculus</italic> proteins in the family. Thus, we restricted our current analyses to TLRs, adapters containing TIR or Death domains, and NF-κB. Future analyses more focused on detecting individual signaling components [e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gilmore and Wolenski, 2012</xref>)] are likely to further elucidate their evolutionary histories.</p><p>We built an alignment for all proteins in the gene family containing SARM1 (gene family 6840), with the addition of the human sequence (UniProt Q6SZW1), since previous work has focused on the human SARM1 protein. We aligned proteins with MAFFT 7.130b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) with the parameters ‘--maxiterate 1000 --localpair’ for high accuracy alignments. We visualized the alignment with JalView 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to SARM1 and Kinase TIRs, choanoflagellates also encoded a diversity of protein domains associated with intracellular TIR domain-containing proteins (lacking a transmembrane domain). Domains found associated with TIR in multiple choanoflagellate species included ankyrin repeat (Ank) and armadillo (Arm) protein-protein interaction domains and Src homology 2 (SH2) kinase signal transduction domains.</p><p>In addition to TLRs, we also searched the choanoflagellates in our data set for cytosolic immune sensing genes. Several classes of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins have previously been detected in the <italic>A. queenslandica</italic> genome, suggesting that NLRs were present in the Urmetazoan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). The architecture of NLRs consists of a protein interaction domain (either Death or CARD), a nucleotide binding domain (NACHT) and multiple LRRs. Although we detected proteins encoding both NACHT and LRR domains in multiple choanoflagellates, neither the Death or CARD domain was present in any choanoflagellate we studied. The CARD domain in animal NLRs either directly or indirectly mediates activation of caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">von Moltke et al., 2013</xref>), which are among the 39 core animal-specific gene families that we detected, suggesting that both NLRs and associated caspase downstream signaling activity may be animal innovations. Plants possess an analogous intracellular sensing pathway, NBS-LRR, which, like the TLR pathway, is thought to have evolved independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Urbach and Ausubel, 2017</xref>). Diagnostic domains were absent in choanoflagellates for four additional cytosolic sensors: three containing CARD domains [mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)] and one containing HIN and PYRIN domains [absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)]. However, we did find evidence for two other sensors previously reported in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Wu et al., 2014</xref>): STING is present in both <italic>Salpingoeca macrocollata</italic> and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, based on the presence of the diagnostic Pfam domain TMEM173, and cGAS, identified by the Pfam domain Mab-21, is present in <italic>S. macrocollata</italic>, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>M. fluctuans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>RNAi machinery in choanoflagellates</title><p>To define ‘strong’ evidence for the presence of Argonaute in our data set, we used the conserved Pfam domain architecture DUF1785, PAZ and Piwi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). To detect ‘strong’ evidence for Dicer, we searched for the architecture Dicer_dimer, PAZ and Ribonuclease_3 (we considered the Dicer_dimer domain alone to be ‘moderate’ evidence).

Piwi is thought to repress transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aravin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>, the only choanoflagellate species that has been investigated for transposable elements, appears to have very few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carr et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Argonaute and Dicer were each lost five times independently in choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), although these could both be overestimates if the genes were not expressed in our culture conditions. A similar pattern of repeated parallel loss has also been previously observed in kinetoplastids, a group of single-celled eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Matveyev et al., 2017</xref>). Curiously, in contrast to the case for kinetoplastids, where Argonaute and Dicer were generally lost together, we detect five choanoflagellate species in which Argonaute is present and Dicer is absent or vice versa. These absences could reflect the presence of non-canonical RNAi genes or Dicer-independent RNAi pathways in choanoflagellates, as previously reported in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and in <italic>M. musculus</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Drinnenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cheloufi et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Cell adhesion: Flamingo, Protocadherins, and Integrins</title><p>Diverse cadherins have previously been identified in choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedin and King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Nichols et al., 2012</xref>), but two classes of cadherins involved in animal planar cell polarity and development were thought to be animal-specific: Flamingo and Protocadherins.</p><p>The first described Flamingo cadherin (also known as starry night) is involved in the Frizzled-mediated establishment of planar polarity in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chae et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Usui et al., 1999</xref>).

Strain information: information about the cultures used, including American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) number for each culture and NCBI Taxonomy ID for each species. Previous names for cultures indicate prior names used as labels in culture collections or publications, but which were subsequently determined to have been incorrectly applied [some of these species names are no longer valid (<italic>Codosiga gracilis</italic>, <italic>Acanthoecopsis unguiculata</italic>, <italic>Diplotheca costata</italic>, <italic>Savillea micropora</italic>, <italic>Monosiga gracilis</italic> and <italic>Monosiga ovata</italic>), whereas others are still valid at the time of publication, but their descriptions did not match the cultures (<italic>Salpingoeca amphoridium</italic>, <italic>Salpingoeca minuta</italic>, <italic>Salpingoeca pyxidium</italic>, <italic>Salpingoeca gracilis</italic> and <italic>Salpingoeca napiformis</italic>)]. Previous names for species were never applied to the cultures used, but are considered to be invalid names that were previously used for the species and have been subsequently replaced. Origin of cultures: source, isolation location and year, if known. Growth media, antibiotic treatments and cell types: the sequence of antibiotic treatments used to obtain a culture for high-volume growth, the growth medium and temperature, and the estimated proportion of each cell type in sequenced cultures. Culture conditions in large batches for harvesting: information on how each culture was grown and harvested for mRNA sequencing. Amount of total RNA used for each sample and groupings for preparation and sequencing: the amount of total RNA used for each culture, based on the estimated proportion of choanoflagellate RNA versus bacterial RNA in each total RNA extraction, with the goal of beginning each sequencing preparation with 2 µg of choanoflagellate total RNA. Library prep. group and Seq. flow cell group are arbitrary labels to indicate which sets of samples were prepared for sequencing at the same time or sequenced on the same flow cell. Read counts and quality trimming: results of sequencing before quality trimming and after quality trimming. Read error correction: parameters for error correction by Reptile, adapted to each set of reads independently. Assembly read counts and N50s: the counts of contigs and predicted proteins at each step of the assembly process. N50 is the length at which 50% of the nucleotides/amino acids in the assembly are contained in contigs/proteins greater than or equal to that length. NCBI Short Read Archive: identifiers to retrieve the raw, unprocessed reads for each library at the NCBI Short Read Archive. NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA): identifiers to retrieve the unannotated assembled contigs for each species, the counts of contigs entirely excluded or trimmed due to adapter or bacterial sequences identified during the submission process, and the counts of contigs removed because they were below the minimum length of 200 bases (after trimming) imposed by the TSA.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-34226-supp1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34226.030</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Results of running BUSCO to search for conserved eukaryotic genes in each species’ protein catalog.</title><p>Each value represents a percentage of genes in the BUSCO eukaryotic gene set (eukaryota_odb9).</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-34226-supp2-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34226.031</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Species used for gene family construction and their data sources.</title><p>Note that we sequenced and assembled two strains of <italic>Stephanoeca diplocostata</italic>.

The higher gene family counts produced by Dollo parsimony on our data set in comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fairclough et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The ancestral animal genetic toolkit revealed by diverse choanoflagellate transcriptomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Casey Dunn (Reviewer #2); Warren Francis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an extremely interesting and very well executed paper that sets a new benchmark in understanding the evolution of gene content within and between animals, choanoflagellates, and their relatives. This is fundamental to answering basic questions about the history of the evolution of genomes and many phenotypes of broad interest.</p><p>The authors have sequenced 19 new choanoflagellate transcriptomes and used them to reassess which animal genes have pre-metazoan origins. It's an interesting paper – the data are valuable.</p><p>- The results are biologically interesting. It clearly pinpoints in much greater detail than previous studies the history of gene gain and loss along key branches in the tree of life.</p><p>- It will be a great technical resource. Investigators interests in particular gene families can refer to this paper to understand where their favorite genes have been gained and lost, and which organisms they are in. Investigators interested in particular branches in this portion of the tree can refer to the paper to see how gene inventory changed along these branches.</p><p>I found the results to be well presented, and appreciated how clear and clean the figures are.</p><p>The paper does much to clarify what doesn't make animals special – an essential part of understanding what does make them special. Like other lineages, animals have lost many genes. There has not been a march toward increased gene content in animals, with other extant lineages representing snapshots in animal history, as is often implied or assumed (based on scant evidence). There has been gain and loss of genes along many branches, including a similar rate of gain and loss in animals and choanoflagellates.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Phylogeny: Please at minimum discuss the following in any response. If necessary comment on the possible impact of using a different phylogeny.</p><p>The authors reference the phylogeny of Carr et al., 2017 for the interpretation of their results (e.g. Figure 3). This analysis is based on 6 genes, and differs somewhat from a phylogenomic analysis in Simion et al.. 2017 e.g. in the position of <italic>Codosiga</italic> and <italic>Salpingoeca dolichothecata</italic>. I think these discrepancies are important as they affect how parsimonious some of the purported choanoflagellate gene losses are. It is a shame that the authors do not present a more definitive phylogeny using the data that they have produced, or at least discuss interpretative issues in light of different phylogenetic possibilities (even if to say there are no serious issues).</p><p>Methodology: My major concern is with the OrthoMCL based approach – it really isn't clear what an OrthoMCL gene family corresponds to (in terms of orthologs/paralogs). This makes summary numbers suspect (1700 gene families with origins in the animal stem lineage of which 36 are conserved across animals). What is an OrthoMCL gene family in terms of true biological entities?</p><p>The authors highlight a number of specific examples of gene loss from <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, (TLRs, Delta etc.), but leaving these vignettes aside, and the 350 number in the Abstract (which I don't find in the main text), I cannot find a discussion of how anomalous/representative the authors consider the two taxa with sequenced genomes to be. It would be helpful to include this.</p><p>Table 1. I think there's a difference between what the reader is likely to think has been done and what actually has been done, and as the 36 number makes it to the Abstract, it's quite important to be clear. WNT ligands, for instance are a classic example of a metazoan novelty (and to the best of my knowledge have still not been reported in non-animals). The OrthoMCL based protocol breaks up these ligands into a number of different animal specific families, none of which feature in Table 1, perhaps because no single family is present in all animals studied. Yet the innovation itself, the invention in the animal stem lineage of the first Wnt seems to me as though it is exactly the sort of thing the paper is suggesting it will report. I would like to see a clearer discussion of what the 36 number means and how robust it is to methodological approach. If I constructed an alignment and phylogeny for each gene in the dataset and assessed when it had an ortholog in all other animals would I get a number even close to 36? Would the authors be happy for people to cite this paper saying that there were only 36 conserved animal specific gene families?</p><p>Surprised that no gene trees are presented. Phylogenetic analyses of gene families could do much to clarify some of the patterns that are discussed. For example, in the section &quot;Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence&quot; the authors hypothesize that cases where a gene is present in one choano but many animals are due to false positives with blast. Building a multiple sequence alignment and gene tree would be a simple and informative way to evaluate this.

If necessary comment on the possible impact of using a different phylogeny…..</p><p>The authors reference the phylogeny of Carr et al., 2017 for the interpretation of their results (e.g. Figure 3). This analysis is based on 6 genes, and differs somewhat from a phylogenomic analysis in Simion et al.. 2017 e.g. in the position of Codosiga and Salpingoeca dolichothecata. I think these discrepancies are important as they affect how parsimonious some of the purported choanoflagellate gene losses are. It is a shame that the authors do not present a more definitive phylogeny using the data that they have produced, or at least discuss interpretative issues in light of different phylogenetic possibilities (even if to say there are no serious issues).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that the different tree topologies among published choanoflagellate phylogenies had the potential to lead to different inferences about choanoflagellate gene loss. Knowing this, we designed our principal analyses of choanoflagellate gene loss to be largely independent of the internal topology of the choanoflagellate phylogeny. We addressed the issues surrounding choanoflagellate phylogenetics in three specific ways:</p><p>1) Early in our analyses of choanoflagellate transcriptomes, we performed phylogenetic analyses using protein sequences from hundreds of gene families, with the goal of generating a robust choanoflagellate phylogeny. We found that the positions of the two species highlighted by the reviewers (<italic>Codosiga hollandica</italic> and <italic>Salpingoeca dolichothecata)</italic> were inconsistent among different gene family sets and phylogenetic inference methods, and that their branches frequently had low support values. We believe this is because both species are isolated on long terminal branches. Genome-scale sequence data are currently unavailable from closely-related sister groups to either species (e.g., other <italic>Codosiga</italic> species for <italic>C. hollandica,</italic> or <italic>Salpingoeca tuba</italic> for <italic>S. dolichothecata</italic>). Moreover, we considered the construction of a robust species tree to be outside the scope of the present work. Accordingly, we added the following sentence to the Results: “Although the focus of our study was on reconstructing large-scale patterns of gene family evolution between animals and choanoflagellates, and not on phylogenetics, the availability of a comprehensive set of gene predictions raised the possibility that we could generate a well-supported and well-resolved phylogeny of choanoflagellates. However, we found that the positions of two species lying on long terminal branches (<italic>Salpingoeca dolichothecata</italic> and <italic>Codosiga hollandica</italic>) were poorly supported or recovered at inconsistent locations.” We also updated the Materials and methods <underline>(subsection “Species tree and phylogenetic diversity”</underline>) with details of these analysis.</p><p>2) Importantly, we designed the principal analysis of our paper, the reconstruction of ancestral gene content, to be independent of the presently unresolved phylogenetic relationships within choanoflagellates or within animals. To accomplish this, for gene families shared among major groups of species (e.g., choanoflagellates, animals, fungi), we applied a 10% minimum average probability criterion (Materials and methods, subsection “Group-specific core gene families found in all extant members”, first paragraph) for gene family presence that did not depend on the phylogeny within the group. Similarly, for gene families found only in choanoflagellates or in animals, to be considered present in the common ancestor of the group, we required at least two sub-groups of species to pass the 10% average probability criterion. We chose sub-groups such that our results should not depend on currently unresolved phylogenetic relationships. For choanoflagellates, the sub-groups were craspedids and loricates (which are well-defined groups (Leadbeater, 2015; Carr et al., 2017); see Supplementary file 4). To emphasize this aspect of our analysis, we added the following sentence to the Results: “Therefore, to avoid basing our comparative genomics efforts on a potentially incorrect phylogeny, we designed our analyses to be independent of species relationships within either animals or choanoflagellates. [For display purposes only, we relied on a consensus of previously published phylogenies (Philippe et al., 2009; Burki et al., 2016; Carr et al., 2017)].” We also added further details in the Materials and methods (subsection “Species tree and phylogenetic diversity”, second paragraph).</p><p>3) We agree with the reviewer that the parsimony of gene losses within choanoflagellates necessarily depends on the topology of their species tree. Because of current uncertainties in the phylogenetic relationships among choanoflagellates, and the fact that this study is most focused on reconstructing the origin of animal genomes, we deferred analyses of gene family loss within choanoflagellates to future studies, and we discussed gene family loss on the choanoflagellate stem lineage as an aside in the Results: “[Although these amino acid synthesis and osmosensing pathway components were retained in choanoflagellates, several other gene families involved in diverse biosynthetic pathways were instead lost on the choanoflagellate stem lineage (Supplementary file 9).]” We also note that the gene family loss we observed was frequently so widespread within choanoflagellates that numerous independent losses would be required regardless of the species tree topology (e.g., RNAi machinery, Materials and methods subsection “RNAi machinery in choanoflagellates” and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This is also true within the animals (see, for example, Figure 3 or Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodology: My major concern is with the OrthoMCL based approach – it really isn't clear what an OrthoMCL gene family corresponds to (in terms of orthologs/paralogs). This makes summary numbers suspect (1700 gene families with origins in the animal stem lineage of which 36 are conserved across animals). What is an OrthoMCL gene family in terms of true biological entities?</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of the OrthoMCL approach was to identify true orthologous gene families. There are currently no optimal strategies to achieve this goal for genome-scale analyses (Altenhoff et al., 2016), and we therefore chose OrthoMCL because it provides a reasonable balance of sensitivity and specificity compared to other methods (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009). Furthermore, we coupled OrthoMCL with a technique to remove non-orthologous sequences from resulting gene families (described in the Materials and methods, subsection “Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence”). We concluded that this technique was effective in enriching gene families for true orthologs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f); please also see our response to the comment on phylogenetic trees below, in which we tested the technique with a phylogenetic approach.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, when we first introduce OrthoMCL gene families (Results), we now refer the reader to a discussion in the Materials and methods on their interpretation, as follows: “We next compared the choanoflagellate gene catalogs with those of diverse animals and phylogenetically relevant outgroups (Supplementary file 3) to identify orthologous gene families and determine the ancestry of genes present in animals (see Materials and methods for rationale underlying inferences of gene family orthology).” We updated and clarified the two corresponding sections in the Materials and methods: “Our goal in constructing gene families was to identify groups composed of orthologous proteins. Although numerous approaches are currently available, no existing algorithm can yet identify all orthologous genes while perfectly separating orthologs from spurious BLAST hits (Altenhoff et al., 2016). We chose OrthoMCL due to its widespread use in previous studies, including analyses of animal gene family evolution based on the genomes of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> (Fairclough et al., 2013), and due to its relative balance of sensitivity and specificity in comparison to other algorithms (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009)” and “We conclude that this approach was able to identify and remove a substantial proportion of false orthologs, resulting in a set of gene families highly enriched for (although still not entirely composed of) truly orthologous families.”</p><p>In addition, throughout our manuscript, in order to emphasize the uncertainties in using OrthoMCL gene families, we precede all estimated gene family counts with a tilde (~). Furthermore, we focus on relative comparisons of gene family counts rather than on the absolute number of gene families lost or gained; for example, in the Results: “the numbers of gene families gained on the animal and choanoflagellate stem lineages are roughly equivalent (~1,944 and ~2,463, respectively), indicating that the specific functions of novel gene families, not their quantity, were critical to the very different phenotypes each clade went on to have.” This is further discussed in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors highlight a number of specific examples of gene loss from M. brevicollis and S. rosetta, (TLRs, Delta etc.), but leaving these vignettes aside, and the 350 number in the Abstract (which I don't find in the main text), I cannot find a discussion of how anomalous/representative the authors consider the two taxa with sequenced genomes to be. It would be helpful to include this.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis, any gene family present in multiple choanoflagellate species would be inferred to have been present in their last common ancestor (see Materials and methods subsection ““Group-specific core gene families found in all extant members”). Therefore, we were able to determine how representative <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic> are compared to other choanoflagellate species by calculating the number of gene families they retained from the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates, and subsequently comparing their gene retention to other choanoflagellates, as presented in Figure 3 (in particular, Figure 3c) and its figure supplements. To clarify the relevance of this analysis in responding to the reviewer’s question, we updated the Results, as follows: “Notably, the two choanoflagellate species with previously-sequenced genomes, <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, retain among the fewest ancestral gene families, indicating that they are less representative of Urchoanoflagellate gene content than are most choanoflagellate species we sequenced.”</p><p>The 350 number in the Abstract that was difficult to find in the main text referred to the number of gene families previously thought to have been animal-specific that are now found in choanoflagellates. To respond to this point (and to another reviewer suggestion that numbers in the Abstract correspond exactly to those in the text) we have revised this value to ~372 in the Abstract so that it corresponds directly to the value discussed in the Introduction and the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 1. I think there's a difference between what the reader is likely to think has been done and what actually has been done, and as the 36 number makes it to the Abstract, it's quite important to be clear. WNT ligands, for instance are a classic example of a metazoan novelty (and to the best of my knowledge have still not been reported in non-animals). The OrthoMCL based protocol breaks up these ligands into a number of different animal specific families, none of which feature in Table 1, perhaps because no single family is present in all animals studied. Yet the innovation itself, the invention in the animal stem lineage of the first Wnt seems to me as though it is exactly the sort of thing the paper is suggesting it will report. I would like to see a clearer discussion of what the 36 number means and how robust it is to methodological approach. If I constructed an alignment and phylogeny for each gene in the dataset and assessed when it had an ortholog in all other animals would I get a number even close to 36? Would the authors be happy for people to cite this paper saying that there were only 36 conserved animal specific gene families?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We have tried to clarify the meaning of the core animal-specific gene families, while also expanding our analysis, as follows:</p><p>1) We have added the following sentence to the Results immediately after introducing core animal-specific gene families: “This count of core animal-specific gene families is likely to be an underestimate due to methodological tradeoffs in the genome-scale analysis that we used to identify gene families (see Materials and methods).” We also modified the Materials and methods to add the scenario proposed by the reviewer (orthologous genes broken up into a number of different animal-specific gene families) to the list of potential technical artifacts that was already present, which now reads as follows: “These core gene families are subject to several potential technical artifacts. First, an incomplete genome or transcriptome assembly could result in a species appearing to lack a gene family. […] Thus, the lists of core gene families should not be considered exhaustive, especially for serially duplicated or repeat-containing gene families.”</p><p>2) We added an additional analysis to make it clear to readers that, although there are very few core animal-specific gene families, there are many other animal-specific gene families missing in only a small number of animals. This analysis is reflected in a new figure and in a new sentence in the Results: “By reducing the stringency of the requirement for conservation, we identified a total of 153 gene families that were missing in no more than two animals from our data set (i.e., approximately 10%; Figure 3—figure supplement 3)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Surprised that no gene trees are presented. Phylogenetic analyses of gene families could do much to clarify some of the patterns that are discussed. For example, in the section &quot;Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence&quot; the authors hypothesize that cases where a gene is present in one choano but many animals are due to false positives with blast. Building a multiple sequence alignment and gene tree would be a simple and informative way to evaluate this. There is also the risk that some choano data could be contaminated with animal sequences, and phylogenetic trees would help clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to construct phylogenetic trees in order to clarify the patterns of gene family evolution we discussed. Although this is not feasible on a genome-wide scale, we performed three separate types of phylogenetic analyses to address the concerns raised in this comment:</p><p>1) To test the ability of our technique to identify false positives in gene families (e.g., those with few choanoflagellates and many animals), we selected the representative gene family presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2c. This gene family, 9066, contains numerous animal proteins but only a single choanoflagellate protein. The choanoflagellate protein was assigned a probability of 0.03 due to its high average blastp E value to other members of the family. We searched for closely-related outgroup sequences from our full data set and built a phylogenetic tree for the gene family including the additional outgroup sequences. The choanoflagellate protein was indeed more closely related to the outgroup sequences than to any of the animal proteins inside the gene family, and thus correctly identified as a false positive by our probability assignment method (as presented in a new figure, Figure 2—figure supplement 10). We added the details of this analysis to the Methods (subsection “Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence”).</p><p>2) To assess whether the choanoflagellate transcriptomes we produced were contaminated with animal sequences, we built phylogenetic trees for all seven protein coding genes with previously available sequences for multiple choanoflagellates in GenBank (which we used as a positive control to verify species identity). We observed no instances with ≥ 50% bootstrap support in which a choanoflagellate sequence was nested within a clade of animal sequences, indicating that none of the choanoflagellate transcriptome sequences we tested appeared to be of animal origin (newly produced tree files are in Figure 2—source data 1). These results are detailed in a new section of the Materials and methods, “Tests of choanoflagellate species identity and contamination with animal sequences”. They also confirm the effectiveness of the protocols we implemented to avoid contamination during each step of the mRNA preparation and sequencing process, as described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) To validate previously animal-specific gene families we newly identified as present in choanoflagellates, we built phylogenetic trees for three examples: TLRs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), Notch and Delta (Figure 2—figure supplement 12). In each case, there were no well-resolved branching patterns contradicting the hypothesis that these three gene families evolved on the stem lineage leading to the last common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates. We added details for these analyses to the Materials and methods (TLRs, subsection “Toll-like receptor signaling and innate immunity”; Notch and Delta, subsection “Notch and Delta”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also isn't clear to me why the authors didn't use standard maximum likelihood and Bayesian character evolution methods to trace the gain and loss of gene families on the species phylogeny. This would also infer ancestral state probabilities for gene presence/absence under explicit models of evolution. Such methods are well established and highly relevant here.</p></disp-quote><p>A novel aspect of our analysis was the calculation of probabilities of presence for each species within each gene family generated by OrthoMCL. We demonstrated that probabilities are more appropriate than simple presence or absence (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Materials and methods subsection “Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence”, and above in our response). We are not aware of any existing method for phylogenetic reconstruction of character evolution that is capable of accepting probabilities as inputs (e.g., the 24 ancestral reconstruction methods surveyed in (Joy et al., 2016)). Therefore, we defined an average probability threshold for ancestral reconstruction. Instead of using simple presence/absence, the average threshold retains the uncertainty represented by individual probabilities within a group of species (animals, choanoflagellates, etc.) to determine whether a gene family was present or absent within the group (described in Materials and methods, subsection “Test of existing methods of ancestral gene content reconstruction”).</p><p>To implement the reviewer’s suggestion, we also tested three types of existing ancestral reconstruction methods using presence/absence data as input: Dollo parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian. We found that these methods each produced substantially different estimates of ancestral gene family content. For example, for the last common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates, estimates ranged from 6,679 gene families present (maximum likelihood via Mesquite) to 19,579 (Dollo parsimony via PHYLIP) to 29,519 (Bayesian via MrBayes); complete results are in a new table, Supplementary file 13. Full details of these analyses can be found in a new section of the Methods, “Test of existing methods of ancestral gene content reconstruction”.</p><p>Thus, we feel our technique represents an improvement over existing methods due to its ability to input probabilities for gene family presence, while we eagerly await the development of maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods capable of doing the same. The estimates of gene family innovation based on our technique were also congruent with previous analyses conducted before our data set became available (Srivastava et al., 2010; Fairclough et al., 2013; Simakov and Kawashima, 2017). In recognition of the uncertainties in ancestral gene content reconstruction, as described in our response above, throughout our manuscript we precede all estimated gene family counts with a tilde (~) and we focus on relative comparisons of gene family counts rather than on the absolute number of gene families lost, present or gained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The phylogenetic distribution of animal and choanoflagellate gene families”, first paragraph: I do not think that the use of BUSCO is appropriate for measuring the completeness of transcriptomes, particularly as the whole point of this study was to examine the gene content of choanos relative to animals, hence of a group which is not currently well-represented (for instance, it does not appear that Monosiga or Salpingoeca were in the BUSCO set).</p><p>How many gene families/proteins are recovered by the transcriptomes for either or both of the species with genomes i.e. does the RNAseq get most of the genes predicted from the genomes?

This is mentioned in the Materials and methods, but may be better explicitly discussed in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of the comparison using BUSCO was to demonstrate that none of the new transcriptomes was significantly deficient in terms of gene content, and thus suitable for further analysis. This was the case, since the conserved gene content of the transcriptomes we produced was similar to the two sequenced choanoflagellate genomes. Regarding recovery of gene families by transcriptomes, the analysis we presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2a estimated the proportion of genes predicted from the <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> genome that were present in its transcriptome (as part of a test of protocols we modified for polyA selection; Materials and methods, subsection “Test of polyA selection to separate choanoflagellate from bacterial RNA”). This analysis indicated that 93% of genes predicted from the genome (green line) were represented in the transcriptome over ≥ 90% of their length (yellow line). We have now tried to present this analysis more clearly.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we reorganized the corresponding section in the Results, first to report the completeness of the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> transcriptome versus the genome, and next to present BUSCO results, as follows: “Using multiple independent metrics, we found that the new choanoflagellate transcriptomes approximate the completeness of choanoflagellate genomes for the purposes of cataloging protein-coding genes. […] Furthermore, compared with the genomes of <italic>M. brevicollis</italic> and <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, which contain 83% and 89%, respectively, of a benchmark set of conserved eukaryotic genes [BUSCO; (Simão et al., 2015)], each of the new choanoflagellate transcriptomes contains between 88 – 96% (Supplementary file 2).” We also updated the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and the Materials and methods.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment regarding the variation in predicted proteins from the new choanoflagellate transcriptomes, we added the following sentences to the Results: “After performing de novo transcriptome assembly and filtering for cross-contamination, we predicted a catalog of between 18,816 – 61,053 unique protein-coding sequences per species. [These counts likely overestimate the true numbers of underlying protein-coding genes, as they may include multiple alternative splice variants for any given gene and redundant contigs resulting from intra-species polymorphisms or sequencing artifacts (Grabherr et al., 2011; Haas et al., 2013).]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene family construction, subsection “Construction of gene families and their probabilities of presence”: Relating to whether the &quot;residual probability&quot; genes are true orthologs, it would appear that this method might systematically miss gene presence from taxa with long-branches.

This was found to be the case in flatworms (see Martin-Duran et al., 2017 Genome Research). This could imply that homology of some fast evolving genes may be overlooked between animals and choanoflagellates.

Therefore, the only truly orthologous gene families likely to be excluded by this threshold are those with weak homology (i.e., average BLAST E values &gt; 10<sup>-10</sup>) to only a few species in a major group, a rare case which would also require numerous independent losses of the gene family within the group.”</p><p>In addition, we modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2b to indicate the correspondence between a probability of 10% and an individual BLAST E value of between 10<sup>-6</sup> and 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p><p>In the example case proposed by the reviewer (gene families in which a taxon of related long-branched animals have remote homology to the rest of the gene family), they would only be considered missing in animals if they were absent (or present at very low probability) from nearly all other animals outside the long-branched taxon. This, in turn, would imply numerous independent losses of the gene family within animals.
