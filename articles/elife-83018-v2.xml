We recently found that evoked dopamine secretion is fast and relies on active zone-like release sites. Here, we used in vivo biotin identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to assess which proteins are present at these sites. Using three release site baits, we identified proteins that are enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content, and they fell into several categories, including active zone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory, and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with vesicular exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM strongly decreased the hit number obtained with iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. α-Synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson’s disease, was enriched at release sites, and its enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and provide a proteomic assessment of the composition of these sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>RIMS</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS103484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS083898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS105159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kershberg</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lefler Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brooks Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Aditi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Quan Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kershberg</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Innovation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proximity proteomics combined with mouse genetics are used to assess the composition of active zone-like sites for dopamine release and reveal that the scaffolding protein RIM organizes these sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine is a critical neuromodulator and regulates target cells through G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Surmeier et al., 2014</xref>). In the vertebrate brain, midbrain dopamine neurons form a crucial regulatory system. The dopamine neuron somata are located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and one prominent target area of their axons is the striatum. In the striatum, dopamine is thought to act as a volume transmitter because only a small percentage of dopamine varicosities are directly apposed to postsynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Descarries et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wildenberg et al., 2021</xref>) and because dopamine receptors are found mostly extrasynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sesack et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uchigashima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yung et al., 1995</xref>). Hence, dopamine likely signals by diffusing through the extracellular striatal space before initiating responses in target cells. While much is understood about the mechanisms and molecules involved in the synaptic release of classical neurotransmitters, the machinery mediating the release of dopamine is less well known.</p><p>Spatial and temporal precision of vesicular exocytosis at classical synapses is established by the active zone, a conserved molecular machine that docks synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic plasma membrane close to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, primes the vesicles for release, and aligns these processes with postsynaptic receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biederer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Südhof, 2012</xref>). Several lines of evidence point to the existence of active zone-like protein complexes for the control of striatal dopamine release. First, dopamine release is rapid, has a high release probability, and occurs at small hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyene et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marcott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zych and Ford, 2022</xref>), indicating the need for vesicle tethering close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels before the stimulus arrives. Second, at least some dopamine receptors respond rapidly to local, high concentrations of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Condon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Courtney and Ford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gantz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marcott et al., 2014</xref>), which likely necessitates synchrony of vesicular release. Third, dopamine neuron activity and secretion often correlate with behavior on fast time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamilos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting the need for precise signaling mechanisms. Taken together these properties indicate the presence of protein machinery for rapid and efficient release of dopamine.</p><p>Indeed, our recent work has found that proteins for the control of spatial and temporal precision of synaptic vesicle exocytosis are important for evoked dopamine release. These proteins include the active zone scaffolds RIM and Liprin-α, the priming protein Munc13, and the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lebowitz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, the active zone scaffolds RIM-BP and ELKS are dispensable for axonal dopamine release, even though at least ELKS is present at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Striatal dopamine release only partially depends on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2 family, channels that are required for stimulated release at most synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brimblecombe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luebke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takahashi and Momiyama, 1993</xref>). Thus, there appear to be both similarities and differences in the secretory machines in dopamine varicosities compared with synapses. However, only a handful of proteins important for secretion are known to mediate dopamine release, and many pieces of the underlying secretory machine remain unidentified.</p><p>We here characterized the composition of dopamine release sites using an unbiased proteomic approach. We adapted in vivo biotin identification (iBioID), a method that allows for purifying proteins in close proximity to a marker protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). Using three different release site bait proteins, we found that 527 proteins were present at these sites when we applied a threshold of ≥2.0-fold enrichment over soluble axonal proteins. A total of 190 proteins were enriched in multiple bait conditions and 41 proteins with all three baits. Many proteins with previously known functions at classical synapses were identified, including active zone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory, and synaptic vesicle proteins, as well as proteins that presently do not have defined roles in axonal neurotransmitter secretion. We also tested whether structural scaffolding and dopamine release are important for the composition of these secretory sites. Conditional, dopamine neuron-specific knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM strongly decreased the number of detected proteins, while that of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Syt-1 to abolish synchronous dopamine release did not. We conclude that dopamine release sites are organized structures controlled by the scaffolding protein RIM, and we provide a proteomic assessment of the content of these release sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proximity proteomics to assess dopamine release site composition in the mouse striatum</title><p>With the overall goal to generate a comprehensive proteome of release sites in striatal dopamine axons, we adapted a proximity proteomic approach. We fused a promiscuous version of the biotinylase BirA (also called BirA*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>) to several proteins associated with dopamine release sites and expressed these bait proteins Cre-dependently using AAVs specifically in dopamine neurons of DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bäckman et al., 2006</xref>). To locally biotinylate proteins in vivo, we provided excess biotin through subcutaneous injection for 7 days. We then performed affinity purification of the biotinylated proteins from striatal homogenates and identified them by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The striatal dopamine axons are particularly well suited for this approach because they are elaborately branched in the striatum and can be easily separated from their midbrain somata and dendrites during tissue dissection, limiting confounds arising from the co-purification of somatodendritic proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vivo biotin identification (iBioID) for release site proteins in dopamine axons of the mouse striatum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experiment with AAVs for Cre-dependent BirA fusion protein expression (AAV2/5-DIO-BirA-fusion), followed by in vivo biotinylation, affinity purification, and analyses by mass spectrometry.

For a timeline of the experiment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. BirA-tdTomato was detected with anti-red fluorescent protein (RFP) antibodies. The RFP bands, reflecting self-biotinylated BirA-tdTomato, were only detected in mice subcutaneously injected with biotin, but not when biotin was not supplied or when BirA-tdTomato was not expressed. β-Actin was present in the brain input, but was depleted during affinity purification. BirA-tdTomato expression is too low to be detected in the input given that dopamine axons account at most for a few % of the striatal volume. The full-length BirA-tdTomato protein has a molecular weight of 91 kD. Because the smaller molecular weight bands detected with the anti-RFP antibodies (marked with *) are only present when BirA-tdTomato is enriched, they are likely degradation products.

ELKS2β-BirA is detected with anti-HA antibodies; Western blots from a single qualitative pilot experiment, 4 striata per condition.

In all experiments, we used BirA fused to tdTomato (BirA-tdTomato) that localizes throughout the axon for calculating enrichment. All constructs also contained hemagglutinin (HA)-tags for identification with HA antibodies.</p><p>To assess the axonal presence of these BirA fusion proteins, we injected the AAVs into the midbrain of DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice. After 6 weeks, we perfused the mice and stained striatal brain slices with antibodies against HA (to label the fusion proteins) and antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, to label dopamine axons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fusion proteins were detected within TH-labeled axons. RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA and ELKS2β-BirA were present in small punctate structures consistent with release site localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Ca<sub>V</sub>β4 appeared somewhat more widespread, similar to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in these axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>), and BirA-tdTomato was broadly overlapping with TH, likely reflecting a soluble axonal localization. We previously performed superresolution microscopy to assess the localization of select endogenous dopamine axonal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). High-quality super-resolved images could not be obtained here, likely because of the specific antibodies and conditions that were needed. In vivo biotinylation was next confirmed for the BirA fusion proteins with or without biotin injections (for 7 days) followed by pilot biotin-affinity purifications and Western blotting of the purified fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and 'Materials and methods'). This established that biotinylation and protein purification are efficient, and that background biotinylation in the absence of biotin is limited.</p><p>To determine dopamine release site composition, we performed iBioID using these three BirA bait proteins and BirA-tdTomato expressed in DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 4–6 weeks of expression, biotin injections were done on seven consecutive days, and 10–12 striata per condition and repeat were dissected and homogenized. Biotinylated proteins were then isolated using affinity purification. The eluates were depleted with antibodies against pyruvate carboxylase (PC), an endogenously biotinylated protein, before assessment of protein content with mass spectrometry. In total, four independent biological repeats per BirA fusion protein were performed (i.e., four times 10–12 striata per condition, conditions: RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA, ELKS2β-BirA, Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA, BirA-tdTomato, also see 'Materials and methods'). The four repeats were run as two large experiments for in vivo biotinylation, biotin affinity purification, and mass spectrometry; two repeats were run in parallel in each experiment, and the two experiments were run approximately 1 year apart from one another (the second experiment also contained analyses of conditional knockout mice described below).</p><p>Peptides from 1969 proteins were identified in at least one of the BirA conditions. A total of 300 (15%) of those proteins are mitochondrial proteins, which is common in iBioID, and these proteins were removed from further analyses unless noted otherwise, as has been done before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). To identify proteins enriched in the immediate vicinity of the bait proteins (RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA, ELKS2β-BirA, and Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA), the number of peptides identified for each protein and bait was normalized to the number of peptides found for the same protein in the BirA-tdTomato condition, effectively generating a ratio of enrichment over soluble dopamine axonal protein content as fold change. For proteins that were not detected with all BirA fusions, we assigned an average value of 0.5 peptides so that we could calculate fold change values for proteins that otherwise had a 0 in the denominator and log<sub>2</sub> of fold change for all detected proteins. After producing log<sub>2</sub> of the fold change, values &gt;0 represent proteins detected at levels higher than in the BirA-tdTomato condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, saturated colors), while proteins &lt;0 (light colors) were below. For the main analyses, 'hits' were proteins enriched ≥2.0-fold and have log<sub>2</sub> fold change values of ≥1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).

Only 30% of all proteins detected in the Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA condition were higher compared to BirA-tdTomato, and 9% were enriched ≥2.0-fold. These observations generally align with the morphological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), where Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA appeared more widely expressed than RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA and ELKS2β-BirA. They are also consistent with functional analyses that revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in dopamine axons is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>), while active zone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>) are only detected in 20–30% of the varicosities. In each condition, the protein that was used as a BirA bait was robustly enriched (individually labeled proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). This further establishes the approach, as self-biotinylation of the BirA fusion proteins should be high compared to other proteins if the labeling radius is small, which has been estimated to be 10–50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roux et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessment of the protein composition of release sites in dopamine axons</title><p>We next constructed Venn diagrams with proteins that were above the 2.0-fold enrichment threshold to assess the overlap of hits between the different bait conditions. In total, there were 527 proteins ≥2.0-fold enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The enrichment compared to BirA-tdTomato indicates that these proteins have a localization that is restricted compared to general dopamine axonal proteins. Of the 527 proteins, 190 were enriched in more than one condition and 41 were enriched with all three baits, RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA, ELKS2β-BirA, and Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA.</p><p>Given that the BirA baits are proteins with roles in transmitter secretion and are expressed in dopamine axons, it is expected that proteins with known roles in neurotransmitter release are enriched in the iBioID dataset. We assessed the hits by evaluating their cellular compartment annotations in SynGO, an expert-curated database that assigns localization and function of synaptic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>). Of the 527 enriched proteins, 194 (37%) have one or multiple synaptic cellular compartment annotations in SynGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), reflecting that their synaptic localization has been established. SynGO does not distinguish between synapse or neurotransmitter type, but instead broadly determines whether there is evidence to support the presence or function of a given protein at synapses in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To assess how the enrichment threshold of ≥2.0 influenced this overall assessment of the release site proteome, we constructed Venn diagrams with alternate enrichment thresholds of ≥1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or ≥2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Naturally, the overall number of proteins that reached threshold varied, with 991 proteins being ≥1.5-fold and 348 proteins ≥2.5-fold enriched, compared to the 527 proteins detected with the ≥2.0-fold enrichment threshold. Changing enrichment thresholds did not increase the percentage of synaptic proteins as identified via SynGO (31% for ≥1.5 and 33% for ≥2.5 thresholds, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), justifying the use of ≥2.0 as the threshold for further analyses.</p><p>We next categorized the proteins based on whether they are known to be localized pre- or postsynaptically in order to assess which types of synaptic proteins were enriched. Proteins with SynGO annotations may have multiple annotations and can be both pre- and postsynaptic, but do not require a more specific annotation. A total of 102 proteins (19% of the entire dataset, 53% of the SynGO synaptic proteins) have a presynaptic annotation with many having additional specific assignments to the active zone or synaptic vesicles, while 87 (17% of the entire dataset, 45% of the SynGO synaptic proteins) have postsynaptic annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Also, 43 proteins (8% of the entire dataset, 22% of the SynGO synaptic proteins) are annotated both pre- and postsynaptically.</p><p>If the iBioID approach used here enriched proteins at sites of dopamine release, it would be expected that proteins previously shown to localize to dopamine release sites are enriched. Indeed, RIM1 (<italic>Rims1</italic>), ELKS2 (<italic>Erc2</italic>), and Bassoon (<italic>Bsn</italic>), proteins that can be used as markers for dopamine release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and that were shown to be associated with synaptic vesicle docking sites using a different proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>), were all enriched across multiple conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Proteomic assessment of release site composition, like the one described here, can serve to identify new putative components. Of the 527 enriched proteins with the ≥2.0-fold threshold, 333 (63%) do not have a SynGO annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and 46 proteins are annotated broadly as 'synaptic' without more exact specification. Additionally, for the characterization of the dopamine axon secretory machinery, proteins known to be associated with classical synaptic release that have not been implicated in dopamine release can also be identified. One example of the latter category is Neuroplastin (<italic>Nptn</italic>), a transmembrane protein with pre- and postsynaptic roles at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beesley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smalla et al., 2000</xref>). Neuroplastin is strongly enriched across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but its association with dopamine release sites has – to our knowledge – not been described. To assess Neuroplastin localization with a secondary approach, we prepared striatal synaptosomes as we described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and stained them with antibodies against TH to mark dopamine synaptosomes, Bassoon to label release sites, and Neuroplastin. In particles labeled with TH, Neuroplastin antibody staining intensity was significantly higher when Bassoon was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that Neuroplastin is enriched in proximity to release sites of dopamine axons and provide an independent approach that helps validate iBioID for this specific hit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ablation of RIM, but not of Synaptotagmin-1, strongly decreased the number of proteins detected in the dopamine release site proteome</title><p>We next asked whether removing proteins important for dopamine release affects the composition of the dopamine release site proteome.

We then plotted the log<sub>2</sub> of the fold change of the average of all annotated proteins in each category. In the control dataset (gray bars), synaptic proteins were enriched as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and the extent of enrichment had a tendency to increase as the SynGO annotation became more specific (to presynaptic, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and to active zone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

The depletion is absent in the RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA condition in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, supporting that release site scaffolding is partially restored.

Applying a ≥2.0-fold enrichment threshold, we identified 527 proteins, of which 190 were enriched with multiple baits. This proteome contains known secretory machinery, including active zone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory, and synaptic vesicle proteins, and additional proteins not previously associated with vesicular exocytosis. Dopamine neuron-specific knockout of RIM, but not of Syt-1, strongly decreased the number of enriched proteins. We conclude that dopamine axons contain active zone-like sites with secretory machinery for rapid vesicular exocytosis and present an assessment of the protein composition of these sites. Each newly detected protein will require validation for a definitive assignment to dopamine release sites. Our findings establish that the integrity of these active zone-like sites strongly depends on the scaffolding protein RIM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Proximity proteomics establish a scaffolding role for RIM in dopamine axons</title><p>In previous studies, we found that several active zone proteins are present in release site-like structures of striatal dopamine axons, including Bassoon, RIM, Munc13, and ELKS. Using dopamine-neuron-specific knockout, we established that RIM and Munc13 are essential for evoked axonal dopamine release, while ELKS and RIM-BP are dispensable. RIM removal also induced deficits in Bassoon clustering in striatal dopamine axons. We proposed the model of active zone-like release sites for action potential-evoked dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu and Kaeser, 2019</xref>). We here used iBioID to generate a list of putative components of these sites. We found that active zone proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins, and many additional proteins are present. RIM was enriched across datasets, perhaps indicating a role for RIM in dopamine active zone assembly. RIM ablation from dopamine axons indeed resulted in a strong reduction in the number of proteins identified as release site components with iBioID. This loss of material was observed more strongly with ELKS2β-BirA and Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA than with RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA, suggesting that RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA partially restored release site composition. Together with previous data, these findings establish a key scaffolding role for RIM at dopamine release sites. The overall reduced number of hits in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice also suggests that many hits in the control proteome are specific.</p><p>Reductions in hit numbers in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice might at least in part arise from mislocalized BirA baits in their dopamine axons. However, aberrant bait localization likely does not explain all effects. Twenty-two proteins were enriched with all three baits in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, indicating overlapping labeling radii with a resulting proteome relying on bait colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In a previous study, overall dopamine axon morphology was not strongly disrupted in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice apart from changes in Bassoon clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Here, the general axonal proteome identified by BirA-tdTomato was similar between RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), arguing for a generally intact axonal arbor in these mice. Together, these points make it unlikely that bait mislocalization fully accounts for the disruption observed in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice.

RIM1 (<italic>Rims1</italic>), Bassoon (<italic>Bsn</italic>), and ELKS1 (<italic>Erc1</italic>), ELKS2 (<italic>Erc2</italic>), and P/Q-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, <italic>Cacna1a</italic>) and N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2, <italic>Cacna1b</italic>) were all detected, consistent with previous studies that assessed roles and/or localization of these proteins in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brimblecombe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daniel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ducrot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uchigashima et al., 2016</xref>), and overlapping with a proteomic study that determined release site composition at synapses via purifying proteins associated with docked synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>). The active zone proteins Liprin-α and RIM-BP were not present in the 2.0-fold enriched dataset. We found that Liprin-α2 and -α3 knockout has less severe effects on dopamine release compared to RIM knockout, while removal of RIM-BP leaves dopamine release unimpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the presence of active zone proteins in iBioID generally correlates with their known functional roles in dopamine release. One exception to this correlation is Munc13. Striatal dopamine release is strongly impaired after Munc13 ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>), but only enriched in some cases with iBioID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). At synapses, some Munc13 may be more broadly distributed than just at active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tan et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2022b</xref>), but this does not explain its nonenrichment here because in the BirA-tdTomato dataset, Munc13 was not strongly detected either. Hence, Munc13 may either be overall sparse despite its requirement for evoked dopamine release or may be difficult to detect, for example, because it is poorly biotinylated or not easily affinity-purified. Notably, Munc13 was also absent in the release site proteome assessed via docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, while a saturated proteome is challenging to obtain, many of the proteins previously shown to mediate dopamine release were detected with iBioID.</p><p>Dopamine neurons corelease glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). While GABA is loaded into vesicles via VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Melani and Tritsch, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>), glutamate corelease may or may not originate from the same vesicular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Silm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and it is currently not possible to determine whether some iBioID hits might be from dedicated release sites for glutamate. Overall, however, our results fit with candidate approaches on dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the proteome we describe might in general represent dopamine release sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Postsynaptic, unknown, and unexpected proteins in the dopamine release site proteome</title><p>There were 87 proteins with postsynaptic SynGO annotations in the release site proteome. Apart from experimental noise, multiple possibilities may account for this. First, SynGO may not have enough empirical evidence to designate any given protein as presynaptic. Some proteins with only postsynaptic annotations may be genuinely present in the dopamine release machinery. Second, dopamine axons receive input from cholinergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), and activation of nicotinic receptors triggers dopamine axon action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The structure and organization of this cholinergic input are commonly considered nonsynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2001</xref>), but synaptic-like transmission exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kramer et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, dopamine varicosities may in principle contain postsynaptic scaffolds, although nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were not detected with iBioID. Third, the estimated labeling radius of iBioID is up to 50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Striatal dopamine axons make sparse synaptic-like connections with medium spiny neurons that contain the GABAergic postsynaptic scaffold Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uchigashima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wildenberg et al., 2021</xref>). Gephyrin (<italic>Gphn</italic>) was indeed enriched with ELKS2β-BirA and RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Biotinylation across membranes may be common in iBioID, and detection of intramitochondrial proteins and of synaptic vesicle proteins with postsynaptic baits has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). It is noteworthy that in our experiments dopamine receptors were not enriched, consistent with their localization outside of the postsynaptic scaffolds in target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uchigashima et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The proteome presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> contains 63% proteins that are not annotated in SynGO. Some of these proteins may be real hits that are not included in SynGO, while others may be experimental noise. Cend1, for example, a protein associated with cell cycle exit, appears both in our data and a previous vesicle docking proteome, and electron microscopic studies suggested that it might be present at the presynaptic plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patsavoudi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Politis et al., 2007</xref>). It is surprising that <italic>Hist1h1d</italic> and <italic>Hist1h4a</italic>, genes encoding for the histone proteins H1.3 and H4, were robustly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These hits might be entirely unspecific or their co-purification could be due to biotinylation of H1 and H4 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stanley et al., 2001</xref>). It is also possible that there are unidentified synaptic functions of some of the unexpected proteins. An example for recently identified synaptic functions of nuclear proteins are those of the kinetochore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some hits might arise because the BirA baits are not exclusively at release sites. Localization away from release sites is in part expected because a fraction of any release site protein will be away from its endogenous target localization. It might also be caused or amplified by the approach, for example, through viral bait expression and/or modification of protein sequences through bait design. The baits are made in the soma and transported along the axon. Some hits could reflect activity during protein trafficking that occurs within the 7-day time window for biotinylation. Transport complexes may be distinct between the baits and BirA-tdTomato and thus show as enriched. Indeed, several kinesins (<italic>Kif21a, Kif21b, Kif5a, Kif5b</italic>) were enriched, possibly reflecting transport packets. The synaptic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that reached the 2.0-fold threshold across conditions may also reflect hits by non-active zone-localized bait proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary of conclusions and limitations</title><p>Altogether, we present an assessment of dopamine release site content. Each protein will require validation through morphological and functional characterization before an unequivocal assignment to dopamine release sites is possible. As discussed, some hits may be noise, viral expression of tagged and modified bait proteins may influence the results, and thresholding strongly affects the overall number of proteins included in the release site proteome. We note that iBioID does not identify direct interaction partners. Instead, the defining property is proximity to the bait. The estimated ~50 nm labeling radius goes beyond the radius of protein interactions for most proteins. Despite these limitations, we have made progress. The presented data support a model of active zone-like dopamine release sites for rapid and efficient dopamine secretion. The disruption of the iBioID-generated proteome when RIM is removed establishes a scaffolding role for RIM. This role appears more pronounced in dopamine axons compared to classical synapses. Although similar proteomic approaches were not performed, RIM ablation does not severely disrupt release site structure at classical synapses when assessed with microscopy, but redundant scaffolds might maintain the sites instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Jong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Emperador-Melero and Kaeser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kushibiki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tan et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

Tubes were then spun at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed leaving behind a protein pellet. The pellet was air dried and stored at –20°C until analysis by mass spectrometry. In pilot experiments, we assessed the efficiency of PC depletion. Before PC depletion, 28% and 10% of the detected peptides were from PC and the related protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCA), respectively.

Either the neutravidin bead pellet (some pilot experiments) or the TCA-precipitated protein pellet after PC depletion (all experiments to assess release site composition) were submitted to the facility. The pellet was subjected to 5 ng/µl trypsin digest overnight at 37°C and dried until further analysis. On the day of analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) onto the column after column equilibration. Peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of 97.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. As peptides were eluted, they were subjected to electrospray ionization and added to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the SEQUEST software program (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The data were filtered to establish a false discovery rate between 1% and 2% using a database of mouse protein sequences made up of half real protein sequences and half reversed sequences. Independent of whether the results were run against a mouse or a rat database, the number of peptides identified for bait proteins (which were made from rat cDNA) was similar.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analyses of mass spectrometry data</title><p>The control dataset consists of four repeats that stem from two separate mass spectrometry sessions (repeats 1 and 2 were run first, repeats 3 and 4 were run ~1 year later).

Peptide counts for each protein in each BirA condition (RIM<sup>PPCP</sup>-BirA, ELKS2β-BirA, Ca<sub>V</sub>β4-BirA, BirA-tdTomato) were first averaged for the two repeats that were acquired in the same mass spectrometry session. If the peptide count averaged from the two repeats was zero, it was assigned a value of 0.5 such that we could calculate circle size for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and more generally enrichment or depletion for all analyses. This assignment warranted that for a protein to be included, it had to be detected more than once with a single peptide. The average peptide count for a given protein for each of the three BirA baits was divided by the average peptide count for the same protein in the BirA-tdTomato condition. This is referred to as the fold change (FC) value. For the control dataset, the average fold change values of each mass spectrometry session were then averaged together to generate a final fold change value for every protein shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>; in the mutant datasets, this final averaging was not performed as all data stem from a single mass spectrometry session.

Circle size reflects average enrichment across repeats of an individual bait. For proteins enriched in multiple bait conditions, circle size corresponds to the condition with the largest average enrichment value.

TH+ ROIs that had a Bassoon signal less than 1× the average intensity of all pixels in the image were designated as Bassoon-negative (Bassoon-). Neuroplastin antibody signal intensities within Bassoon+ TH+ or Bassoon- TH+ ROIs were quantified and a frequency histogram was plotted. The experimenter was blind to which group a specific particle belonged to during image acquisition and analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Reinhard Jahn as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthijs Verhage (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the approaches chosen to identify proteins localized to dopaminergic release sites are excellent and cutting-edge. However, the reviewers also agree that while the data provide a valuable and useful resource for future work, both analysis of the data and their interpretation should be carefully reconsidered and revised accordingly:</p><p>1. It is not clear to the reviewers, how robust the findings are with respect to the thresholds used for the enrichment analysis (see comments by Ref. 3). For instance, how sensitive are the major trends towards increasing or decreasing the threshold values by e.g. 0.5 points?</p><p>2. The discussion should be reconsidered. As pointed out by Ref. 3, it is partially redundant whereas other relevant issues (e.g. completeness of the release site proteome, &quot;oddities&quot; in the data) are not mentioned. Moreover, as pointed out by Ref. 1, a more critical appraisal of the limitations of the chosen labeling procedure should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the protein composition of exocytotic sites in dopaminergic neurons is investigated. While extensive data are available for both glutamatergic and GABA-ergic synapses, it is far less clear which of the known proteins (particularly proteins localized to the active zone) are also required for dopamine release, and whether proteins are involved that are not found in &quot;classical&quot; synapses. The approach used here uses proximity ligation to tag proteins close to synaptic release sites by using three presynaptic proteins (ELKS, RIM, and the beta4-subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel) as &quot;baits&quot;. Fusion proteins containing BirA were selectively expressed in striatal dopaminergic neurons, followed by in-vivo biotin labelling, isolation of biotinylated proteins and proteomics, using proteins labelled after expression of a soluble BirA-construct in dopaminergic neurons as reference. As controls, the same experiments were performed in KO-mouse lines in which the presynaptic scaffolding protein RIM or the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 were selectively deleted in dopaminergic neurons. To control for specificity, the proteomes were compared with those obtained by expressing a soluble BirA construct. The authors found selective enrichments of synaptic and other proteins that were disrupted in RIM but not Syt1 KO animals, with some overlap between the different baits, thus providing a novel and useful dataset to better understand the composition of dopaminergic release sites.</p><p>Technically, the work is clearly state-of-the-art, cutting-edge, and of high quality, and I have no suggestions for experimental improvements. On the other hand, the data also show the limitations of the approach, and I suggest that the authors discuss these limitations in more detail. The problem is that there is very likely to be a lot of non-specific noise (for multiple reasons) and thus the enriched proteins certainly represent candidates for the interactome in the presynaptic network, but without further corroboration it cannot be claimed that as a whole they all belong to the proteome of the release site.</p><p>For instance, in Figure 2 it is shown that a surprisingly high number of postsynaptic proteins are labelled in all three datasets, showing that labelling is not as specific as hoped for (I acknowledge that the authors try to explain this with the presence of neighbouring postsynaptic sites but are they really this close?). The same applies to other proteins that are not expected to be enriched. One of the reasons may be the rather long labelling periods (7 days) which are likely to increase the number of labelled proteins. Recent work from the Rizzoli lab has shown that the half-life of synaptic proteins is around 7-10 days, which means that between 30 and 40 % of the proteins used as baits are turned over during the labelling period. Thus, it is to be expected that labelling is not restricted to the neighbours in the active zone but includes proteins interacting with the baits during their life cycle after biosynthesis and folding at the ribosome, during axonal transport and also during removal from the active zone and transport towards degradative pathways. In this respect, the comparison to the RIM-KO dataset becomes important (Figure 4). In this experiment: what happens to the postsynaptic proteins, to proteins of the presynaptic plasma membrane? Are they still present in the enriched samples?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Kaiser lab has been on the forefront in understanding the mechanism of dopamine release in central mammalian neurons. assessing dopamine neuron function has been quite difficult due to the limited experimental access to these neurons. Dopamine neurons possess a number of unique functional roles and participate in several pathophysiological conditions, making them an important target of basic research. This study here has been designed to describe the proteome of the dopamine release apparatus using proximity biotin labeling via active zone protein domains fused to BirA, to test in which ways its proteome composition is similar or different to other central nerve terminals. The control experiments demonstrating proper localization as well as specificity of biotinylation are very solid, yielding in a highly enriched and well characterized proteome data base. Several new proteins were identified and the data base will very likely be a very useful resource for future analysis of the protein composition of synapse and their function at dopamine and other synapses.</p><p>The authors find that loss of RIM leads to major reduction in the number of synaptically enriched proteins, while they did not see this loss of number of enriched proteins in the Syt1-KO's, arguing for undisrupted synaptome. Maybe I missed this, but which fraction of proteins and synaptic proteins are than co-detected both in the Syt1 and control conditions when comparing the Venn diagrams of Figure 2 and Figure 3 Suppl. 2? This analysis may provide an estimate of the reliability of the method across experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study Kershberg et al. use three novel in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) approaches in mice to isolate and identify proteins of axonal dopamine release sites. By dissecting the striatum, where dopamine axons are, from the substantia nigra and VTA, where dopamine somata are, the authors selectively analyzed axonal compartments. Perturbation studies were designed by crossing the iBioID lines with null mutant mice. Combining the data from these three independent iBioID approaches and the fact that axonal compartments are separated from somata provides a precise and valuable description of the protein composition of these release sites, with many new proteins not previously associated with synaptic release sites. These data are a valuable resource for future experiments on dopamine release mechanisms in the CNS and the organization of the release sites. The BirA (BioID) tags are carefully positioned in three target proteins not to affect their localization/function. Data analysis and visualization are excellent. Combining the new iBioID approaches with existing null mutant mice produces powerful perturbation experiments that lead and strong conclusions on the central role of RIM1 as central organizers of dopamine release sites and unexpected (and unexplained) new findings on how RIM1 and synaptotagmin1 are both required for the accumulation of α-synuclein at dopamine release sites.</p><p>It is not entirely clear how certain decisions made by the authors on data thresholds may affect the overall picture emerging from their analyses. This is a purely hypothesis-generating study. The authors made little efforts to define expectations and compare their results to these. Consequently, there is little guidance on how to interpret the data and how decisions made by the authors affect the overall conclusions. For instance, the collection of proteins tagged by all three tagging strategies (Figure 2) is expected to contain all known components of dopamine release sites (not at all the case), and maybe also synaptic vesicles (2 TM components detected, but not the most well-known components like vSNAREs and H<sup>+</sup>/DA-transporters), and endocytic machinery (only 2 endophilin orthologs detected). Whether or not a more complete collection the components of release sites, synaptic vesicles or endocytic machinery are observed might depend on two hard thresholds applied in this study: (a) &quot;Hits&quot; (depicted in Figure 2) were defined as proteins enriched {greater than or equal to} 2-fold (line 178) and peptides not detected in the negative control (soluble BirA) were defined as 0.5 (line 175). How crucial are these two decisions? It would be great to know if the overall conclusions change if these decisions were made differently.</p><p>Given the good separation of the axonal compartment from the somata (one of the real experimental strengths of this study), it is completely unexpected to find two histones being enriched with all three tagging strategies (Hist1h1d and 1h4a). This should be mentioned and discussed.</p><p>It would also help to compare the data more systematically to a previous study that attempted to define release sites (albeit not dopamine release sites) using a different methodology (biochemical purification): Boyken et al. (only mentioned in relation to Nptn, but other proteins are observed in both studies too, e.g. Cend1).</p><p>The Discussion section could be improved. It is rather long (7.5p) with some repetition from the Introduction, some issues already demonstrated convincingly before (2.5p on RIM being a scaffold in DA neurons) and a rather speculative discussion on RIM being associated with Parkinson's disease through dopamine release site recruitment of α-synuclein, possibly via protein interactions or through vesicle docking (but how is release site recruitment of α-synuclein important for protein interactions, vesicle docking or Parkinson symptoms?). Instead some of the more pressing questions (at least to this reviewer) are not discussed, such as the expectations mentioned above: why were expected components of release sites not detected, why only some but not all expected components of synaptic vesicles/endocytic machinery and why are two histones in the axonal compartment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83018.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

For instance, how sensitive are the major trends towards increasing or decreasing the threshold values by e.g. 0.5 points?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that thresholding criteria are critical decisions, both for our work and for papers using similar techniques. To illustrate why we chose 2.0 as an enrichment threshold beyond justification through literature <sup>1,2</sup>, we have included new figures showing analyses of the main release site proteome at varying thresholds. Figure 2 presents the 2.0 enrichment threshold, while Figure 2 —figure supplements 1 and 2 present the same data with 1.5 and 2.5 thresholds, respectively. Naturally, the overall size of the release site proteome varies considerably with 527 hits at 2.0, 991 hits at 1.5, and 348 hits at 2.5 enrichment thresholds. We then took each thresholded proteome and analyzed it with SynGO to determine the fraction of proteins previously associated with synapses (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). SynGO-annotated proteins were 37% (194 of 527) for 2.0, 31% (304 of 991) for 1.5, and 33% (116 of 348) for 2.5. Based on these analyses, and consistent with literature on other iBioID experiments, we think it is appropriate to select 2.0 as the threshold for further analyses and comparisons. The data that led to this decision are now fully incorporated in the manuscript, including the figures (Figure 2 —figure supplements 1 to 3) and a new paragraph in the Results section on lines 208-215. We further have added a summary of limitations together with conclusions in the last section of the discussion that includes the point of thresholding. This section is captioned “Summary of conclusions and limitations” (lines 501-518).</p><p>To complement the presentation of the control proteome with various thresholds, we also determined the number of hits in the release site proteomes of RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice at these thresholds. The major finding that RIM ablation disrupts this proteome was independent of thresholding, with 268 hits at 1.5, 198 at 2.0 and 82 hits at 2.5 enrichment thresholds. The overall number of hits in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice remained higher, with 602, 450 and 252 at the 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 enrichment thresholds, respectively. This is included in the revised manuscript on lines 298-301. Overall, the main findings are not affected by thresholding, but the numbers for proteins in each proteome vary based on threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Overall, we have shortened the discussion from 2400 words to 1900 words. We have removed redundancies between the discussion and the Results section and have included additional discussion of unexpected hits (for example: histones, lines 482-485; transport proteins, lines 493-497). We have also included a section on summarizing limitations, together with key conclusions, at the end of the discussion (lines 501-518). We specifically include a more in-depth discussion of noise, of oddities, of thresholding and of the fundamental point that the proteome is based on proximity, not on interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, the protein composition of exocytotic sites in dopaminergic neurons is investigated.

Most importantly, we have changed the final section from “Conclusions” to “Summary of conclusions and limitations” (lines 501-518) to summarize the limitations with equal weight to the conclusions. In the revised manuscript, we also included many specific additional points in this respect throughout the discussion and the results: many hits could be noise (lines 458, 478-479), thresholding affects the inclusion of proteins in the release site dataset (lines 208-215), the seven-day time window could deliver interactors from the soma to the synapse (lines 493-495), specific oddities (for example histones, lines 482-485), iBioID does not deliver an interactome <italic>per se</italic> but is simply based on proximity (lines 505-508), and several more. We also clearly state that each specific hit needs follow-up studies (lines 501-503: <italic>“Each protein will require validation through morphological and functional characterization before an unequivocal assignment to dopamine release sites is possible.</italic>”), and a similar statement was added on lines 374-375.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, in Figure 2 it is shown that a surprisingly high number of postsynaptic proteins are labelled in all three datasets, showing that labelling is not as specific as hoped for (I acknowledge that the authors try to explain this with the presence of neighbouring postsynaptic sites but are they really this close?). The same applies to other proteins that are not expected to be enriched. One of the reasons may be the rather long labelling periods (7 days) which are likely to increase the number of labelled proteins. Recent work from the Rizzoli lab has shown that the half-life of synaptic proteins is around 7-10 days, which means that between 30 and 40 % of the proteins used as baits are turned over during the labelling period. Thus, it is to be expected that labelling is not restricted to the neighbours in the active zone but includes proteins interacting with the baits during their life cycle after biosynthesis and folding at the ribosome, during axonal transport and also during removal from the active zone and transport towards degradative pathways. In this respect, the comparison to the RIM-KO dataset becomes important (Figure 4). In this experiment: what happens to the postsynaptic proteins, to proteins of the presynaptic plasma membrane? Are they still present in the enriched samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and have added these points to the results, discussion, and limitations sections mentioned above.</p><p>The RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> and control datasets reveal that axonal proteins assessed with BirA-tdTomato have high overlap, with 620 out of the 671 found in control also present in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup>. This suggests that the overall protein content is very similar. Importantly, in the release site dataset, presynaptic proteins decrease from 99 hits in the control to 43 hits in RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup>. Synaptic vesicle proteins decreased from 30 to 11, active zone proteins from 14 to 4, and postsynaptic proteins from 87 to 37. We now added these numbers to the legend of Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 and discuss postsynaptic proteins on lines 457-475. We have now also added analyses of postsynaptic proteins identical to how we assessed synaptic, presynaptic and active zone proteins. As we observed for the presynaptic and active zone annotations, RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> depleted postsynaptic proteins. This supports that enrichment of these proteins is specific and does not simply reflect noise. These new analyses are now included in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>These analyses support that the hits in the control dataset are generally specific and that the postsynaptic hits are not just noise; if they were noise, they should be similar between the control proteome and the RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> proteome. These proteins could either be detected because they are also present in dopamine axons, and/or because iBioID biotinylates proteins across membranes as long as they are close enough. We suspect that both factors contribute. We think that the latter point also matches with data from others: if PSD proteins are used as iBioID baits, synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins are generally detected <sup>2</sup>. Ultimately, we think that this may reflect that the pre- and postsynaptic compartments are within the labeling radius of each other and that reactive biotin can pass through lipid bilayers. The latter point is also vividly demonstrated by the notion that our and published proteomes contain intra-mitochondrial proteins <sup>2,3</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The Kaiser lab has been on the forefront in understanding the mechanism of dopamine release in central mammalian neurons. assessing dopamine neuron function has been quite difficult due to the limited experimental access to these neurons. Dopamine neurons possess a number of unique functional roles and participate in several pathophysiological conditions, making them an important target of basic research. This study here has been designed to describe the proteome of the dopamine release apparatus using proximity biotin labeling via active zone protein domains fused to BirA, to test in which ways its proteome composition is similar or different to other central nerve terminals. The control experiments demonstrating proper localization as well as specificity of biotinylation are very solid, yielding in a highly enriched and well characterized proteome data base. Several new proteins were identified and the data base will very likely be a very useful resource for future analysis of the protein composition of synapse and their function at dopamine and other synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors find that loss of RIM leads to major reduction in the number of synaptically enriched proteins, while they did not see this loss of number of enriched proteins in the Syt1-KO's, arguing for undisrupted synaptome. Maybe I missed this, but which fraction of proteins and synaptic proteins are than co-detected both in the Syt1 and control conditions when comparing the Venn diagrams of Figure 2 and Figure 3 Suppl. 2? This analysis may provide an estimate of the reliability of the method across experimental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for proposing to be clear in the comparison of the control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> data. A direct comparison of hit numbers is included on lines 323-324, with 37% overlap between control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> (vs. 15% between control and RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup>). A direct mapping of this overlap is included in Figure 4E. We think that this direct comparison is complicated by a number of factors, as outlined below, and did our best to include these complications in the discussion, including the last section (lines 501-518).</p><p>First, to assess overall similarity, the initial comparison should be to assess axonal proteins identified in the BirA-tdTomato samples. These datasets are quite similar, with 671 (control) and 793 (Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup>) proteins detected, and a high overlap of 601 proteins. We think that this indicates that the experiment <italic>per se</italic> is quite reproducible. The comparison of the release site proteome between control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> is more complicated. We think that the main point of this comparison is that the overall number of hits is quite similar, with 450 hits in the Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> proteome and 527 hits in the control proteome, and we now show that this similarity holds across multiple thresholds (lines 298-301; ≥ 1.5: Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> 602 hits, control 991, ≥ 2.0: 450/527, ≥ 2.5: 252/348). Detailed analyses of overlap reveals that known active zone proteins such as Bassoon, Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels, RIMs, and ELKS proteins are present in both proteomes, but the overlap is partial and incomplete with 191 proteins found in both proteomes. As discussed throughout and summarized on lines 501-518, the reasons for this partial overlap may be manifold. Trivially, it could be explained by noise or non-saturation (“<italic>incompleteness</italic>”) of the proteome. We also think that the Syt-1 proteome is not expected to be identical because there is a strong release deficit in these mice. If Syt-1 has a dopamine vesicle docking function (which it does at conventional synapses <sup>4</sup>), this could influence the proteome. We note that protein functions in the dopamine axon are not well established, but inferred from studies of classical synapses.</p><p>We have scrutinized the manuscript to not express that the control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> proteomes are identical; we know they are not and discuss the example of α-synuclein specifically (Figure 6, lines 347-362). Rather, the striking part is that the extent of the proteomes with high hit number, much higher than RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup>, are similar. Specific hits have to be assessed in a detailed way, one hit at a time, in future studies, as expressed unequivocally on lines 501-503).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study Kershberg et al. use three novel in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) approaches in mice to isolate and identify proteins of axonal dopamine release sites. By dissecting the striatum, where dopamine axons are, from the substantia nigra and VTA, where dopamine somata are, the authors selectively analyzed axonal compartments. Perturbation studies were designed by crossing the iBioID lines with null mutant mice. Combining the data from these three independent iBioID approaches and the fact that axonal compartments are separated from somata provides a precise and valuable description of the protein composition of these release sites, with many new proteins not previously associated with synaptic release sites. These data are a valuable resource for future experiments on dopamine release mechanisms in the CNS and the organization of the release sites. The BirA (BioID) tags are carefully positioned in three target proteins not to affect their localization/function. Data analysis and visualization are excellent. Combining the new iBioID approaches with existing null mutant mice produces powerful perturbation experiments that lead and strong conclusions on the central role of RIM1 as central organizers of dopamine release sites and unexpected (and unexplained) new findings on how RIM1 and synaptotagmin1 are both required for the accumulation of α-synuclein at dopamine release sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for assessing our paper, for summarizing our main findings, and for expressing genuine enthusiasm for the approach and the outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not entirely clear how certain decisions made by the authors on data thresholds may affect the overall picture emerging from their analyses. This is a purely hypothesis-generating study. The authors made little efforts to define expectations and compare their results to these. Consequently, there is little guidance on how to interpret the data and how decisions made by the authors affect the overall conclusions. For instance, the collection of proteins tagged by all three tagging strategies (Figure 2) is expected to contain all known components of dopamine release sites (not at all the case), and maybe also synaptic vesicles (2 TM components detected, but not the most well-known components like vSNAREs and H<sup>+</sup>/DA-transporters), and endocytic machinery (only 2 endophilin orthologs detected). Whether or not a more complete collection the components of release sites, synaptic vesicles or endocytic machinery are observed might depend on two hard thresholds applied in this study: (a) &quot;Hits&quot; (depicted in Figure 2) were defined as proteins enriched {greater than or equal to} 2-fold (line 178) and peptides not detected in the negative control (soluble BirA) were defined as 0.5 (line 175). How crucial are these two decisions? It would be great to know if the overall conclusions change if these decisions were made differently.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the thresholding decisions are important and have now better incorporated the rationale for these decisions in the manuscript.</p><p>Two-fold enrichment threshold. As outlined in the response to point 1 in the editorial decision letter, we now include figure supplements to illustrate the composition of the control proteome if we apply 1.5- or 2.5-fold enrichment thresholds (Figure 2 —figure supplements 1 and 2) instead of the 2.0-fold threshold used in Figure 2. This leads to more or less hits (991 and 348, respectively) compared to the 2.0-fold threshold (527 hits). It is noteworthy that the SynGO-overlap is the highest with the 2.0 threshold (37% vs. 31% at 1.5 and 33% at 2.5, Figure 2 —figure supplement 3), justifying this threshold experimentally in addition to what was done in previous work <sup>1,2</sup>. These data are now described on lines 208-215 of the manuscript. When we apply these different thresholds to RIM and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> datasets, the finding that RIM ablation disrupts release site assembly persists. The following hit numbers were observed in the mutants at the 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 enrichment thresholds, respectively: RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup> 268, 198 and 82 hits; Syt cKO<sup>DA</sup> 602, 450 and 252 hits. Hence, the extent of the release site proteome remains much smaller after RIM ablation independent of the enrichment threshold, bolstering the conclusion that RIM is an important scaffold for these release sites. This is included in the revised manuscript on lines 298-301.</p><p>Undetected peptides in BirA-tdTomato. We did not express this well enough in the manuscript. The undetected proteins were set to 0.5 such that a protein that was detected with a specific bait but not with BirA-tdTomato could be illustrated with a specific circle size, not to determine inclusion in the analyses. If the average peptide count across repeats with a specific bait was 1, this resulted in inclusion in Figure 2 and consecutive analyses with the smallest circle size. Hence, this decision was made to define circle size. It did not affect inclusion in Figure 2 beyond the following two points. If one were to further decrease it, this might result in including peptides that only appeared once as a single peptide for some of the experiments, which we wanted to avoid. If one would set it higher (to 1), this artificial threshold would be equal to proteins that were actually detected experimentally multiple times, which we wanted to avoid as well. We have now clarified this on lines 165-167 and lines 1119-1121.</p><p>Expected proteins. In general, interpreting our dataset with a strong prior of expected proteins is difficult. The literature on release site proteins specifically characterized for dopamine is limited. We have found Bassoon, RIM, ELKS and Munc13 to be present using 3D-SIM super-resolution microscopy <sup>5,6</sup>, and we indeed found these proteins in the data as discussed on lines 227-232 and lines 423-445 in the revised manuscript. The prediction for vesicular and endocytic proteins is complicated. Release sites are sparse <sup>5,7</sup>, and vesicle clusters are widespread in the dopamine axon, in some cases filling most of the axon (for example, see extended vesicle clusters filling much of the dopamine axon in Figure 7E of <sup>5</sup>). Furthermore, docking in dopamine axons has not been characterized, and it is unclear how frequently vesicles are docked. Hence, it is not clear whether vesicular proteins should be concentrated at release sites compared to the rest of the axon (the BirA-tdTomato proteome we use for normalization). Similar points can be made for proteins for endocytosis and recycling of dopamine vesicles. Within the dopamine system, it is unclear whether the recycling pathway is close to the exocytic sites. One consistent finding across functional studies is that depletion after activity is unusually long-lasting in the dopamine system, for tens of seconds, even after only mild stimulation <sup>5,8–13</sup>. Hence, endocytosis and RRP replenishment might be very slow in these axons. It is not certain that endocytic factors are predeployed to the plasma membrane, and if they are, it is unclear how close to release sites they would be. As such, we agree with the reviewer that the proteome we describe is a hypothesis-generator. With the limited knowledge on dopamine release, predictions beyond the previously characterized proteins in dopamine axons are difficult to make.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting to include a better analysis of different thresholds and for giving us the opportunity to clarify the other points that were raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the good separation of the axonal compartment from the somata (one of the real experimental strengths of this study), it is completely unexpected to find two histones being enriched with all three tagging strategies (Hist1h1d and 1h4a). This should be mentioned and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have addressed this point in the manuscript. This could either reflect noise, or there could be more specific reasons behind it. The manuscript now states on lines 482-485: “<italic>It is surprising that Hist1h1d and Hist1h4a, genes encoding for the histone proteins H1.3 and H4, were robustly enriched (Figure 2A). These hits might be entirely unspecific, or their co-purification could be due to biotinylation of H1 and H4 proteins (Stanley et al., 2001). It is also possible that there are unidentified synaptic functions of some of the unexpected proteins.</italic>” Ultimately, we do not know why these proteins are enriched, and we state clearly in the section “Summary of conclusions and limitations” that each new hit has to be validated in future studies (lines 501-503).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also help to compare the data more systematically to a previous study that attempted to define release sites (albeit not dopamine release sites) using a different methodology (biochemical purification): Boyken et al. (only mentioned in relation to Nptn, but other proteins are observed in both studies too, e.g. Cend1).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Boyken et al., 2013 <sup>14</sup> is an important resource for our paper and for the assessment of the proteomic composition of release sites. We have now introduced links and citations to this paper multiple times (for example, on lines 231, 241, 430, 443, 481) and have expanded the discussion of overlap between these proteomes, including on Cend1 (lines 479482).</p><p>We think that a systematic comparison with Boyken et al., 2013 <sup>14</sup> is complicated because (1) so little is known about dopamine release mechanics and (2) because the approach is very different between the two papers. In respect to (1), most prominently, it is not certain how frequently vesicles are docked in the dopamine axon. Only ~25% of the varicosities contain these release sites, and vesicle docking has not been characterized in striatal dopamine axons to the best of our knowledge. Hence, how a docking site at a classical synapse compares to a dopamine release site remains unclear at the outset. For point (2), the key difference is that “within dataset normalizations” are very different in these two studies. In our iBioID dataset, we normalize to soluble proteins defined as proximity to BirA-tdTomato. In ref. <sup>14</sup>, the authors express enrichment over “light”, regular synaptic vesicles purified with the same approach. This has a major impact on the proteome that strongly influences a direct comparison of hits, because there are large differences in the normalization. While each normalization makes sense for the respective paper, it complicates direct comparison.</p><p>With these points in mind, we have compared hits across both datasets class-by-class. For some classes, the datasets have reasonable overlap for ≥ 2-fold enriched proteins: for example for active zone proteins (3 of 7 hits in <sup>14</sup> appear in our control proteome) and adhesion and cell surface proteins (8 of 18). For other classes, the overlap is limited: for example for nucleotide metabolism/protein synthesis (0 of 16 hits in <sup>14</sup> appear in our dataset) and cytoskeletal proteins (5 of 29). We hope the reviewer agrees, that given these factors, the analyses and discussion needed for a systematic comparison goes beyond the scope of our paper. We have instead added a number of references to Boyken et al., 2013 <sup>14</sup>, as outlined above, when direct comparison is meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion section could be improved. It is rather long (7.5p) with some repetition from the Introduction, some issues already demonstrated convincingly before (2.5p on RIM being a scaffold in DA neurons) and a rather speculative discussion on RIM being associated with Parkinson's disease through dopamine release site recruitment of α-synuclein, possibly via protein interactions or through vesicle docking (but how is release site recruitment of α-synuclein important for protein interactions, vesicle docking or Parkinson symptoms?). Instead some of the more pressing questions (at least to this reviewer) are not discussed, such as the expectations mentioned above: why were expected components of release sites not detected, why only some but not all expected components of synaptic vesicles/endocytic machinery and why are two histones in the axonal compartment?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written the discussion. Specifically, we have (1) shortened it from ~2400 to ~1900 words, (2) cut down the RIM scaffolding section from 2.5 pages to 1 page, (3) removed the repeated discussion of α-synuclein as it is redundant with the Results section, (4) added more discussion on unexpected components (for example histones on lines 482-485, trafficking components on lines 493-497, and ribosomes on lines 497-498), (5) expanded the section on predicted active zone components (lines 423-445), and (6) more clearly described the limitations of the method throughout the manuscript (for example on lines 458, 478-479 for noise, on lines 208-215 for thresholding) and summarize this point in the last section (lines 501-518).</p><p>It is difficult to make specific predictions on vesicular and endocytic proteins, and we think those components are not necessarily expected to be enriched over their general axonal levels within 50 nm of the baits at rest. Vesicular proteins may be high within the rest of the axon because the axon is densely packed with vesicles and release sites are sparse <sup>5,7,15</sup>, and it is unclear how frequent dopamine vesicle docking is. It is also unclear whether endocytic machinery is predeployed to sites of exocytosis. Replenishment is astonishingly slow in dopamine axons (tens of seconds to a minute) <sup>5,8–13</sup>, it is uncertain where endocytosis happens relative to release sites, and it is unclear whether endocytic factors are concentrated at the release site compared to their average axonal protein content (detected with BirA-tdTomato). Hence, we think it is better to not describe the proteome with a prior, but to interpret it as it is. We hope that the reviewer agrees in light of these explanations and with the numerous adjustments that we have made to the discussion. There are strong predictions based on previous dopamine release site analyses what active zone proteins should be found at these sites, and we discuss them in detail (lines 423-445). Beyond these proteins, predictions are difficult to make.</p><p>References</p><p>1. Takano, T.; Wallace, J. T.; Baldwin, K. T.; Purkey, A. M.; Uezu, A.; Courtland, J. L.; Soderblom, E.
