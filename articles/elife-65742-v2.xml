condensates enriched in regulatory RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and RNAs under tight spatiotemporal control. Extensive recent work has investigated the molecular principles underlying RNP granule assembly, unraveling that they form through the self-association of RNP components into dynamic networks of interactions. How endogenous RNP granules respond to external stimuli to regulate RNA fate is still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate through high-resolution imaging of intact <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains that Tyramine induces a reversible remodeling of somatic RNP granules characterized by the decondensation of granule-enriched RBPs (e.g. Imp/ZBP1/IGF2BP) and helicases (e.g. Me31B/DDX-6/Rck). Furthermore, our functional analysis reveals that Tyramine signals both through its receptor TyrR and through the calcium-activated kinase CamkII to trigger RNP component decondensation. Finally, we uncover that RNP granule remodeling is accompanied by the rapid and specific translational activation of associated mRNAs. Thus, this work sheds new light on the mechanisms controlling cue-induced rearrangement of physiological RNP condensates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNP condensates</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>live-imaging</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE12-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besse</surname><given-names>Florence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE16-0010-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besse</surname><given-names>Florence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20180339161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besse</surname><given-names>Florence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SyncDev</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lagha</surname><given-names>Mounia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0028-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Besse</surname><given-names>Florence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lagha</surname><given-names>Mounia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI-17H03686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tyramine-dependent signaling triggers decondensation of neuronal RNP components and rapid translation activation of target mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Self-assembly of functionally related molecules into the so-called biological condensates has recently emerged as a prevalent process underlying subcellular compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Condensation of RNA molecules and associated regulatory proteins to form cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, in particular, has been observed in virtually all cell types and species, ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohan and Pappu, 2020</xref>). Different types of RNP granules have been defined based on their composition (e.g. S-foci), function (e.g. P-bodies), origin (e.g. Stress Granules), and/or the cell type they belong to (e.g. germ granules, neuronal granules) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Formicola et al., 2019</xref>). With the notable exception of Stress Granules, most of these RNP granules are found constitutively and have been implicated in the regulation of various aspects of RNA expression, from decay to subcellular RNA localization and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Formicola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ivanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marnik and Updike, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trcek and Lehmann, 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, both repressor and activator functions have been assigned to RNA condensation: clustering of transcripts into translation factories, for example, appears to enhance translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pichon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pizzinga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chouaib et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dufourt et al., 2021</xref>), while recruitment of mRNAs to P-bodies, germ granules, or neuronal granules is rather associated with translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Krichevsky and Kosik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fritzsche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ivanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Extensive recent work has investigated the molecular principles underlying the assembly and material properties of RNP granules, highlighting the importance of multivalent RNA–RNA, RNA–protein, and protein–protein interactions for demixing of RNP components from the cytoplasm, and formation of phase-separated RNP condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adekunle and Hubstenberger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corbet and Parker, 2020</xref>). These studies have also revealed that RNP granule components are not all equivalent. While ‘scaffolds’ are resident, highly multivalent molecules required for granule assembly, ‘clients’, in contrast, are dispensable and reversibly recruited by scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ditlev et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, the dense yet highly dynamic networks of interactions underlying condensate assembly and maintenance provide the basis for flexible and dynamic compositional changes. Indeed, any alteration in stoichiometry, valency, or binding affinity will dramatically impact on both scaffold condensation and recruitment of client molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ditlev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). Because they modulate both protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions, post-translational modifications have in this context been shown to alter the phase behavior of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in vitro, and to inhibit or promote their partitioning into endogenous condensates in a switch-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hofweber and Dormann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>).</p><p>This framework can in principle explain various aspects of RNP condensate regulation, from assembly to compositional changes or disassembly. Strikingly, the field has until now mostly focused on characterizing the regulatory mechanisms underlying RNP condensate assembly. Understanding how constitutive RNP condensates reversibly reorganize or disassemble in response to distinct stimuli is however equally important. Indeed, dynamic and specific release of condensate-associated mRNAs contributes to spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression in a wide range of physiological and developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sankaranarayanan and Weil, 2020</xref>). In mature neuronal cells, for example, neuronal RNP granules were shown to control general cell homeostasis, but also to mediate the long-range transport and on-site translation of pre- or post-synaptic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Formicola et al., 2019</xref>). Translational de-repression of granule-associated transcripts has been observed in response to specific neuronal stimuli, and linked to ‘RNA unmasking’ or dissolution of RNP condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zeitelhofer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Formicola et al., 2019</xref>). To date, however, how neuronal RNP granule components specifically and dynamically re-organize in the context of mature circuits to modulate the expression of associated RNAs is still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we uncover that the neuromodulator Tyramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Branchek and Blackburn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burchett and Hicks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) triggers the reversible remodeling of cytoplasmic RNP granules in the cell bodies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mushroom Body (MB) neurons. Through high resolution live imaging of intact brains, we show that this is characterized by the decondensation of two conserved components of RNP granules: the RBP Imp/ZBP1/IGF2BP and the DEAD box helicase Me31B/DDX-6/Rck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tiruchinapalli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hillebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vijayakumar et al., 2019</xref>). Functionally, we demonstrate that Tyramine signals through the TyrR receptor and through CamkII, a calcium-activated kinase associating with Imp, to induce RNP granule remodeling. Furthermore, we show that RNP granule remodeling is linked to the translation activation of granule-associated mRNAs, a process we monitor with unprecedented resolution <italic>via</italic> the SunTag amplification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>) recently implemented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dufourt et al., 2021</xref>). Together, our functional and cellular study sheds new light into the mechanisms underlying signal-induced disassembly of RNP granules. By illustrating how the properties of these macromolecular assemblies can contribute to dynamic and specific regulation of neuronal mRNAs, this work opens new perspectives on the regulation and function of constitutive RNP condensate in physiological contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tyramine induces a reversible remodeling of neuronal RNP granules in MB neurons</title><p>In resting brains of 10–15-day-old flies, 100-200 nm-sized cytoplasmic RNP granules are visible in the cell bodies of MB γ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’’ and C</xref>), a population of neurons known for its role in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keleman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akalal et al., 2010</xref>).

Among those are the RBP Imp and the DEAD box helicase Me31B, two conserved repressors of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Minshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hüttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hillebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate the response of neuronal RNP granules to changes in neuronal state, we treated brain explants with different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators known to activate MBs and/or to be involved in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campusano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Majumdar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iliadi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sabandal et al., 2020</xref>). The number of Imp-positive RNP granules was scored after 30 min treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Tyramine, a bioamine found in trace amounts in both invertebrate and mammalian brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burchett and Hicks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lange, 2009</xref>), triggered the strongest response, characterized by the decondensation of Imp molecules and a significant decrease in the number of Imp-containing granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Decondensation of Imp was accompanied by a significant, although less pronounced, relocalization of Me31B protein from the granular to the cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>). This relocalization did not impact on the number of Me31B-positive granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but translated into a decrease in the ratio between the granular and the cytoplasmic soluble pool of Me31B (partition coefficient; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, the re-localization of Imp and Me31B observed in the presence of Tyramine did not result from changes in protein levels, as similar levels of Imp and Me31B were observed with and without Tyramine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results thus indicate that the neuromodulator Tyramine triggers a remodeling of neuronal RNP granules characterized by the differential release of Imp and Me31B RNP components into the cytoplasm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuronal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules undergo remodeling in response to Tyramine.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Cell bodies of adult Mushroom Body (MB) γ neurons stained with anti-Imp (<bold>A, B</bold>, green in <bold>A’, B’</bold>) and anti-Me31B (<bold>A’, B’</bold>, red in <bold>A’, B’</bold>) antibodies.

Neurons exhibit a particularly complex collection of RNP granules composed of both shared and distinct components, raising the question of how granule composition is established and dynamically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fritzsche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Formicola et al., 2019</xref>). Frameworks have been proposed to explain RNP granule compositional control, in which scaffold molecules (or nodes) establish a core network of multivalent interactions essential for both granule nucleation and further recruitment of more dynamically associated client molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ditlev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). In this model, modulation of scaffold or client partitioning properties can lead to the differential release of granule-enriched proteins and RNAs. Whether and how these frameworks apply to endogenous neuronal RNP granules has remained unclear. Our results uncovered that Tyramine stimulation differentially impacts on neuronal RNP components, as a nearly complete release of granule-associated Imp, but only a partial relocalization of granular Me31B was observed in response to Tyramine. These results, together with our observation that inactivation of <italic>me31B</italic>, but not of <italic>imp,</italic> prevents granule assembly (K. Pushpalatha and F. Besse, unpublished) are consistent with a model in which Me31B behaves as a scaffold, and Imp as a client whose partitioning into granules depends on Me31B, and is specifically modulated by Tyramine. Interestingly, the release of Imp from neuronal granules is associated with the translational activation of its target RNA <italic>profilin</italic>, suggesting that differential release of client RBPs, rather than complete granule disassembly, might represent a means to modulate the expression of specific sets of client-associated RNAs in response to distinct stimuli. As further revealed by our real-time imaging experiments, translation activation and granule component decondensation, although both starting within minutes after Tyramine exposure, exhibit distinct temporal profiles. While translation activation occurs as a burst, decondensation of RNP components is a continuous and progressive process. This may result from the gradual depletion of the pool of translationally repressed mRNAs normally dynamically recruited to RNP granules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CamkII activity is required downstream of Tyramine to inhibit Imp partitioning</title><p>Phosphorylation is a rapid and reversible post-translational modification that dramatically impacts on both intra- and inter-molecular interactions. Not surprisingly then, phosphorylation was shown in vitro and in cells to regulate the partitioning of RNP components into condensates, either positively or negatively depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hofweber and Dormann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In living systems, studies have so far pointed to a role for granule-enriched kinases in the phosphorylation of scaffold proteins, leading to granule disassembly. This process is for example required for clearance of Stress Granule upon recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krisenko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shattuck et al., 2019</xref>), or for dissolution of anteriorly localized P-granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). If and how phosphorylation modulates the recruitment of client molecules to regulate RNP composition rather than assembly/disassembly has so far remained poorly explored. Here, we showed that the calcium-activated CamkII kinase interacts with Imp, and is required downstream of Tyramine to trigger Imp decondensation. As Tyramine induces a calcium response in MB neurons, our results thus suggest a model in which Tyramine-induced activation of CamkII may promote its association with Imp, thus inhibiting the partitioning of Imp into somatic RNP granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether CamkII directly phosphorylates Imp remains to be investigated. Although Imp contains four CamkII consensus phosphorylation sites (RXX<underline>S/T</underline>), mutating these four sites into RXXA by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated engineering did not prevent the decondensation of phosphomutant Imp proteins in response to Tyramine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). CamkII may thus either phosphorylate Imp through non-canonical sites, as described for other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennelly and Krebs, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sun et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herren et al., 2015</xref>), or phosphorylate partner(s) of Imp essential for its association with neuronal RNP granules. Interestingly, our results suggested that CamkII is not enriched within RNP granules, raising the hypothesis that kinases may modulate RNP granule composition by targeting the soluble pool of client molecules, rather than the granule-associated pool.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tyramine signals through the TyrR receptor to activate MB neurons and trigger RNP granule remodeling</title><p>Tyramine is a biogenic amine produced from Tyrosine in neurons expressing the Tyrosine decarboxylase enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lange, 2009</xref>). Although it has for long exclusively been considered as a precursor of Octopamine, recent work has revealed Tyramine-dependent but Octopamine-independent function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, identifying Tyramine as a neuroactive chemical modulating different aspects of animal physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schützler et al., 2019</xref>). A number of GPCRs responsive to Tyramine have been cloned and pharmacologically tested, and three have been defined as Tyramine receptors (Oct-Tyr, TyrR, and TyrRII). Only one was shown to bind Tyramine with high affinity and specificity: TyrR (also termed CG7431 or TAR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cazzamali et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ohta and Ozoe, 2014</xref>). As indicated by single-cell transcriptomic analyses, neither TyrR nor any of the other Tyramine receptors is significantly expressed in MB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). Our results, however, have shown that both the calcium response and the remodeling of neuronal RNP granules triggered in MB neurons by Tyramine depend on the function of TyrR. This thus suggests that Tyramine may act on MB neurons indirectly, through TyrR-expressing neurons innervating MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this idea, the calcium response we observed in MBs in response to Tyramine is slow, peaking 2–8 min after addition of Tyramine. Furthermore, Tyramine-dependent remodeling of neuronal RNP granules was significantly blocked upon Kir2.1-mediated hyperpolarization of MB neurons, a process that should inhibit evoked responses but not GPCR-mediated signaling. The identity of the TyrR-expressing neurons relaying Tyramine signal remains to be investigated. Previous experiments based on a knock-in line in which the <italic>TyrR</italic> locus has been deleted and replaced by Gal4 showed that this receptor is expressed in a restricted number of brain neurons, some of them (e.g. TyrIPS neurons) projecting in the vicinity of MBs and thus representing potential candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). In the future, it will also be interesting to determine in which physiological or behavioral contexts the neuronal circuit activated by Tyramine regulates the translation of RNP granule-associated RNAs, and whether this regulation might be local. Although the physiological roles of Tyramine have so far been poorly characterized, this conserved bioamine has been involved in the regulation of both metabolic and behavior traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lange, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ohta and Ozoe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schützler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roeder, 2020</xref>). Potentially relevant to the known functions of MB neurons, Tyramine was in particular shown to regulate the avoidance behavior of flies exposed to repulsive olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kutsukake et al., 2000</xref>) and to dampen male courtship drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Whether these responses involve post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms such as those described in the context of long-term olfactory habituation in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakthavachalu et al., 2018</xref>) however remains to be investigated. Thus, testing whether Tyramine, similar to its derivative Octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), modulates learning and memory processes known to depend on RNA regulation represents another interesting line of future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic> <break/></td><td>w1118</td><td>BDSC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:BDSC_3605">BDSC_3605</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic> <break/></td><td>Tubulin-Gal80ts;; OK107-Gal4 <break/></td><td>Besse team, IBV, Nice, FR</td><td/><td>This stock was obtained <italic>via</italic> genetic crosses so as to establish a stock carrying both the P{tubP GAL80ts} and the OK107 Gal4 driver.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic> <break/></td><td>Canton-S <break/></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23083740/">23083740</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr K.

Images were acquired with a pixel size of 0.043 μm and were processed with the automatic Airy Scan processing mode (strength 6.0). Note that MB γ neurons were located based on their position within MBs (estimated by DAPI) and the differential expression of Imp in MB neuron sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Medioni et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Brains of 10–15-day-old flies were dissected in HL3 at room temperature, and then transferred and mounted on a four chambered 35 mm dish with 20 mm bottom well (IBL, #D35C4-20-0-N) poly-lysinated before use (3 hr incubation at RT or overnight at 4°C). Once correctly oriented, brains were stabilized on the plate using low melting agarose (NuSieve GTG Agarose #50080, 0.07%, dissolved in HL3). Live imaging of RNP granule remodeling and time-course calcium imaging was performed using a 40× NA 1.1 water objective, on a Zeiss LSM880 inverted confocal microscope equipped with an Airy Scan module. Images were acquired every 30 s for 32 min. Tyramine (dissolved in HL3) or HL3 were added as a single drop 2 min after the start of imaging. To inhibit translation, puromycin (sigma, #P8833) was applied at a final concentration of 250 µM and incubated for 15 min prior to addition of Tyramine.</p><p>For Tyramine dose–response experiments, MB247-homer::GCamp3.0 brains were mounted on 35 × 10 mm petri dishes (Nunc, #153066) coated with poly-lysine and covered with HL3. MB calyx regions were then imaged with an upright Leica DM6000 TCS SP5 confocal microscope equipped with a HCX APOL 40X water (0.8 NA) objective. Two images of MB calyces were taken for each brain: one at t = 0 (before addition of Tyramine) and one at t = 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>RNP granule and RNA detection</title><p>For RNP quantifications, 114.9 µm<sup>2</sup> ROIs containing six to seven cells were cropped from single z slices (two independent ROIs per brain), treated with a Gaussian Blur filter, resized by a factor two using the Image Pyramid plugin and converted from 32-bit to 16-bit images, all in ImageJ. Granules were detected and quantified using the Small Particle Detection (SPaDe) algorithm available under the following link :<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01867805/document">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01867805/document</ext-link>. Minimal granule size was set to four pixels and threshold defined so as to optimize measured F1 scores (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Graeve et al., 2019</xref>). F1 scores were calculated by comparing the spatial coordinates of manually annotated RNP granules with the binary masks generated by SPaDe with different thresholds. Threshold used for detection of Imp and Me31B-positive granules was hence set to 0.6234. In experiments where Imp antibody staining was used, RNP granules of a size smaller than 13 pixels were excluded from analysis. A similar procedure was used for detection of smFISH RNA spots, using 0.3434 as SPaDe threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Me31B partition coefficient measurements</title><p>Me31B partition coefficients were defined as the ratio between the maximal intensities of individual RNP granules and the average diffuse cytoplasmic signal. Maximal RNP granule intensities were measured with ImageJ on the original raw images, using the masks generated by SPaDe. For cytoplasm measurements, masks were obtained using the following procedure: first, a Gaussian Blur filter (σ:8) was applied on images in which granule-containing pixels were previously blanked; second, the mean of the intensity signal was measured and used as lower limit for a thresholding interval (the upper limit being the maximum possible intensity value, 65000). Mean intensities were then measured on raw images using these masks.</p><p>To monitor RNP remodeling over time, two regions of 102.6 µm<sup>2</sup>, each containing six to seven cells, were cropped per movie. For each time point, Me31B partition coefficients were calculated for each granule of the cropped regions as described previously, and mean partition coefficients calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Me31B and Imp protein levels</title><p>Protein signals in the whole cytoplasm were measured in living samples at t = 0 and t = 32 using two regions per movie of respectively 102.6 µm<sup>2</sup> for Me31B and 71.2 µm<sup>2</sup> for Imp. Individual t = 32 values were normalized to their corresponding t = 0 measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Intracellular calcium quantification</title><p>Real-time calcium imaging was quantified as follows: a 155 µm<sup>2</sup> region was selected in the MB calyx of each imaged hemisphere and average intensity measured for each time point. Data were plotted as F(t)-F(0)/F(0), where F(0) is the mean of the four intensity values obtained before Tyramine was added (t0 to t3), and F(t) represents the intensity value measured at time t.</p><p>For the dose-dependent c response to Tyramine, GCamp3 mean fluorescence intensity was measured for each hemisphere in ImageJ, on the t = 0 and t = 30 images using a 17.5 μm<sup>2</sup> ROI.

Heads were collected at 4°C using two prechilled sieves of different mesh sizes (630 µm on top and 400 µm at the bottom) and crushed into powder using prechilled mortar and pestle. The head powder (3 g for each experiment) was then transferred to a prechilled 15 mL glass Dounce Tissue Grinder and homogenized in 10 mL DXB buffer (25 mM HEPES), pH 6.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 250 mM sucrose, 1/100 Halt Protease, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (# Thermo Scientific). The homogenate was cleared by two consecutive centrifugations (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C). 250 µL of GFP-Trap_A beads (ChromoTek, Germany) were then added to the cleared lysate in a 15 mL falcon tube and incubated on a rotator for 1.5 hr at 4°C. Beads were pelleted by mild centrifugation (2000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C), washed twice with DXB buffer and once with DXB buffer + 0.1% NP 40. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by addition of 1.6 mL of 0.2M glycine, pH 2.5 and incubation for 10 min on a rotator. Eluates were then collected and neutralized with 400 µL of 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8, before being concentrated on an Amicon Ultra-2 mL centrifugal filter, MWCO 10 kDa (Merck Millipore, USA) to obtain a final volume of 50 µL that was loaded on a polyacrylamide gel. Coomassie-stained gels were cut, trypsin-digested, and further processed through LC-MS/MS by the EMBL proteomic core facility. Peptides were searched using Mascot (search engine, v.2.2.07) against the Uniprot_<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> database, and then uploaded and analyzed using the Scaffold three software.

Your article, with proposed responses and additions to feedback from 3 peer reviewers has been reviewed by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>In this interesting and timely manuscript, Formicola et al. address the question whether external stimuli affect RNP assembly and mRNA regulation. The authors convincingly show that the bioamine tyramine induces reversible remodelling of RNPs containing the RNA-binding proteins Imp and Me31b. This remodelling is dependent on neuronal signalling through the TyrR receptor and on the activity of CamkII. Finally, tyramine treatment resulted in the translational derepression of Imp associated mRNAs. In sum, the data presented here should be of immediate interest to several fields, including RNA biology, RNP granules and learning and memory.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The experiments presented do not seem to show that the axonal / synaptic mRNP granules are altered by tyramine. Instead they show tyramine regulation of somatic granules, which may be reasonable, easily assayable surrogates for synaptic granules. While this is acceptable, it is recommended that this experimental gap be clearly acknowledged, because granules in neuronal processes are most likely the ones important to regulate for memory-related processes.</p><p>2. Please consider if the language used to describe the association of Imp and CamKII is optimal. Particularly, whether terms such as 'partner' and 'interaction' to discuss this issue may be subject to misinterpretation. It could be better to state that these proteins are found in the same complex etc.</p><p>3. Consider including citations to what appear to be relevant previous work. In particular Barbee et al. 2006 (10.1016/j.neuron.2006.10.028) which is probably the first report of Imp on a class of neuronal granule; and Bakthavachalu et al. 2018 (10.1016/j.neuron.2018.04.032), which describes experiments that perhaps most definitively argue for a function for neuronal RNP granules (and by inference their regulation) in long-term memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65742.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this interesting and timely manuscript, Formicola et al. address the question whether external stimuli affect RNP assembly and mRNA regulation.

Overall, the manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The figures are well designed and intuitive to understand. In general, the experiments are well designed to address the proposed questions and the data analysis and presentation is fitting.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>In Figure S1D, the authors make the important point that decondensation is reversible for Imp granules. It would be interesting to see if Me31b is also reassembled into the same granules.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have performed new experiments where we compared the partition coefficient of Me31B observed after Tyramine treatment with that observed after subsequent recovery. As shown in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Me31B efficiently re-partitioned into granules after recovery, similarly to what was observed for Imp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3 it would be interesting to see the effects of TyrR-/- without tyramine.</p><p>In Figure 4BC, the authors show the effects of the ala peptide under tyramine treatments. It would be interesting to see if the ala peptide triggers a phenotype without tyramine.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the two related suggestions. We had analyzed the phenotype of TyrR-/- (Figure 3) and ala (Figure 4) in the absence of Tyramine treatment but, as no significant difference was observed with the +/+ controls, decided to not show the data for the sake of clarity. As suggested by the reviewer, and as these data may be useful to interpret the experiments, we have included these controls in the revised Figures 3D,E and Figures 4B,C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 7, the authors argue that TyrR expressing neurons might relay to MB neurons. Which neurons could this be?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we don’t know the identity of these neurons, we now speculate in our revised discussion (page 12) about putative candidates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does RNP remodelling require both evoked responses and GPCR-mediated signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our results indicate that RNP remodeling require both evoked responses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) and GPCR-mediated signaling (Figure 3D,E). We added a sentence page 7 to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, it would be interesting to see the data for Kir2.1 without tyramine treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have included in our revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1D the Kir2.1 without Tyramine condition that we had analyzed but not shown on the initial graph. No difference was observed with the control condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 8 and 11, the authors indicate a physical interaction between Imp and CamKII. The authors may want to rethink indicating a direct interaction here, as the data do not exclude other proteins acting as mediators.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the interaction we have uncovered may not be direct and have replaced the term “physical interaction” by “association” (pages 4 and 8) or “interaction” (page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to see whether profilin mRNA changes its localization to Me31b granules upon tyramine treatment to determine the effects in correlation to translational derepression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To address this point, we performed smFISH experiments to detect <italic>gfp-profilin</italic> 3’UTR reporter RNA, or endogenous <italic>profilin</italic> transcripts, in brains expressing fluorescent granule markers. As shown in our revised Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, a significant decrease in the number of <italic>profilin</italic> transcripts associated with granules was observed in both cases after 10 minutes of Tyramine treatment (<italic>i.e.</italic> at the time of translational derepression), indicating that the release of mRNAs from RNP granules represents an early step of granule remodeling that temporally matches with translation activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This would also be interesting in the context of the SunTag data, where the authors show that nascent peptides can be detected within one minute after tyramine treatment. However, in Figure 2 it is seen that condensation of ME31b occurs somewhat slower. This raises the questions:</p><p>– if the decondensation kinetics of Imp are faster than those of Me31b,</p></disp-quote><p>To determine if Imp follows the same decondensation kinetics as Me31B, we treated GFP-Imp-expressing brain explants with Tyramine and imaged them in real-time for 30 minutes. As shown in our revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1, GFP-Imp appears to not decondense faster than Me31B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– or if profilin mRNA quickly relocalizes,</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have performed smFISH experiments 10 minutes after Tyramine treatment, <italic>i.e.</italic> at a time when translation is activated, but RNP component decondensation is only partial. As discussed above, our results (shown in Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) indicate that granuleassociated <italic>profilin</italic> transcripts indeed quickly relocalize to the cytoplasm upon Tyramine treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– or if the nascent SunTag signals colocalize with Imp/Me31b granules,</p></disp-quote><p>To perform this experiment, and image in real-time both SunTag signals and Imp/Me31B granules, we would need a chromosome expressing endogenous Imp (or Me31B) fused to a red fluorescent protein. Despite multiple attempts to CRISPR-tag Imp and Me31B with mcherry, mTomato or Apple (either Cterminally or N-terminally), we so far did not manage to obtain a line in which red fluorescent proteins do not ectopically aggregate in the context of live-imaging. Furthermore, for this experiment to be unambiguously interpreted, we also would need to image the RNA in addition to the SunTag signal and the Imp/Me31B signal, which is beyond current technical limits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– or if only already cytoplasmic profilin is translated.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we cannot formally exclude this possibility, our new results indicate i- that the total amount of <italic>profilin</italic> transcripts is not modified by Tyramine treatment (revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), and ii- that the translational de-repression of <italic>profilin</italic> temporally matches with a release of <italic>profilin</italic> transcripts from RNP granules (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). These new results thus further suggest that the observed increase in translation reflects the de-repression of transcripts initially associated with granules.</p><p>Together, our new results have shown that the release of granule-associated transcripts occurs before quantifiable decondensation of both Imp and Me31B, with kinetics matching that of translation activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>On page 8, the authors indicate that the ala peptide was expressed in MB neurons.

We think this reflects the fact that our immuno-precipitation experiments did not specifically target the granule-associated pool of Imp but rather were probably enriched in cytoplasmic soluble complexes. We have now added a sentence to explain this hypothesis in the Results section (page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 7, the authors argue that TyrR might be the main receptor involved in the observed decondensation of RNPs.

Our conclusion that TyrR is the main receptor involved in RNP decondensation is based on experiments shown in Figure 3D,E, in which we demonstrate that genetic inactivation of <italic>TyrR</italic> nearly abolishes Tyramine-decondensation of RNPs. Although we cannot exclude that other receptors may be marginally implicated, we do believe that TyrR has a predominant function. To take into account the reviewer comment, we have clarified the identity of the other known Tyramine receptors in our revised discussion (page 12), and highlighted that these receptors are not significantly expressed in MBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors are willing to share their unpublished data regarding the mutation of CamkII phosphorylation sites on Imp discussed on page 11, this would make an interesting and highly appreciated additional (supplemental) figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Quantitative analysis of this experiment is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D. How the line expressing GFP fusions with mutated CamkII consensus sites has been generated is also now explained in the revised Materials and Method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the impressive manuscript, Formicola et al. demonstrate tyramine-mediated decondensation of RNP granules in the intact <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and show that this process is associated with translational activation of mRNAs that associate with these structures. It is also shown that this process is mainly driven by a single tyramine receptor and involves CamKII, which they find is in a complex with the RNAbinding protein Imp. Almost all conclusions are strongly supported by the data (see below for one exception), which come from an impressive array of technical approaches. The manuscript is well written and the data well controlled and presented.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>Whilst RNP granule dynamics have been studied in other contexts, there is very little information on how these processes are orchestrated in neurons, particularly within an intact animal. Therefore the study has significant novelty. The principle that a neuromodulator can impact of granule decondensation is a novel concept that is likely to interest researchers working on both behaviour and molecular cell biology of biological condensates. The impact would be greater if the authors were able to find a direct target for CamKII in this system but it appears that they have already tried hard to do so. The study would also be more impactful if a connection could be made between behaviour and RNP dynamics, but this is likely to be beyond the scope of this study (which already covers a lot of ground).</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The authors conclude from the Kir2.1 overexpression experiments (Figure S1E) that tyramine-receptive neurons relay the signal to MB neurons. However, the superplots in the figure seem to show a stark difference in the outcome of the two replicates, with there being no clear suppression of Imp decondensation in one of them. This experiment needs repeating two or three more times to establish which of the outcomes in the current two replicates is robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing that out. We would however like to clarify that even if the suppression was milder for the first replicate (in red), it was still significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 in a Mann-Whitney test comparing control and Kir2.1 conditions in response to Tyramine). As this experiment was the only one performed “only” twice, we launched two new experimental replicates. As shown in the revised Figure 1figure supplement 1D, our four replicates indicate that blocking the firing of MB neurons significantly inhibits Tyramine-dependent RNP granule remodeling. Variations in the efficiency of inhibition are observed between replicates, which might result from small changes in temperature (as the Kir2.1 construct is expressed <italic>via</italic> the Gal4/UAS system) and/or differential responses of MB neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the absence of new functional data, it would be helpful to include some more speculation about how the processes uncovered in this work might relate to tyramine's known functions in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. My understanding is that tyramine has to date been mostly implicated in courtship behaviour. Is there any evidence that courtship paradigms studied in previous work on tyramine involve the studied MB neurons or mRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have implemented the Discussion section (page 12) so as to i- better refer to the few physiological functions attributed to Tyramine so far, ii- highlight functions that might be related to MBs, and iii- specify that Tyramine’s functions have so far not been linked to posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. The conclusion that decondensation of granules is reversible would be further supported by showing that this is the case for not just Imp (Figure S1D) but also Me31B.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this experiment has been performed (see our answer to the first point of reviewer 1) and the results are displayed in our revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I was curious why puromycin was used for some experiments and anisomycin for others. These molecules have very different effects on the translational machinery so some further explanation might be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in pointing out that puromycin and anisomycin have different effects on the translation machinery. While anisomycin prevents tRNA recruitment by binding to the ribosomal A-site cleft, puromycin enters the ribosomal A site as a tRNA analog and gets covalently coupled to the nascent peptide chain at the P site, thus terminating protein synthesis. Despite this different mode of action, both anisomycin and puromycin block peptide chain elongation and were used interchangeably as translation inhibitors in various systems. In this study, we initially used anisomycin to block translation of reporters RNAs as it had previously been shown to block translation in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain explants (Ashraf et al., 2006) and to work efficiently at lower concentrations than puromycin (Sidhu and Omiecinski, 1998). While we could have used anisomycin for our subsequent SunTag experiments, we switched to puromycin as this molecule has been used as a gold standard in all articles reporting SunTag experiments to demonstrate the specificity of SunTag translation foci (Pichon et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Boersma et al., 2019; Cioni et al., 2019; Dufourt et al., bioRxiv 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The label to Figure 4A indicates that RNase was present only in the input for the GFP only sample. Presumably this is a labelling error?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this labeling error out. In this assay, the initial lysate (input) was split into two halves, one of them only was treated with RNAse prior to immuno-precipitation. We have removed indication of RNAse treatment in the input fraction and have clarified the procedure used in the Materials and Method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

They used high resolution imaging of brain explants to decipher how RNP assemblies respond to different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. One of these neuromodulators, Tyramine, acts via the TyrR receptor to induce the reversible dissociation of RNP granules that contain the RNA-binding protein Imp and the DEAD box helicase Me31B. Tyramine stimulation has a differential effect on these components – a significant release of Imp, but only a partial relocalization of granular Me31B to the cytoplasm – suggesting that in these RNP assemblies, Me31B acts as a scaffold and Imp as a client. Moreover, they showed that to activate the RNP granule remodelling, a calcium-activated kinase CamkII physically interacts with Imp, which triggers the relocation of Imp and associated mRNAs from granules to the cytoplasm. This results in the translation activation of these mRNAs. Importantly, to demonstrate this, the authors used a new method, the SunTag amplification system, which allowed the high resolution monitoring of the dynamics of the process. In summary, this work contributes to our understanding of how the neuronal stimuli-dependent remodelling of RNP condensates affects the expression of neuronal mRNA.</p><p>This is a well-written paper with clear and convincing results. The key conclusions are well justified. The experiments are sufficiently replicated and statistical analyses are adequate.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>This research would be beneficial for neurobiologists and the scientists studying RNP granules to better understand the effects of neuromodulators and neurotransmitters on these granules and to understand the dynamics and consequences of RNP granule disassembly.

Suntag live-imaging experiments were performed using VT44966-Gal4, which is a γ neuron-specific driver. The only experiments in which MB γ neurons were not unambiguously identified are the live-imaging experiments displayed in Figure 2 (Me31-GFP live-imaging).

The experiments presented do not seem to show that the axonal / synaptic mRNP granules are altered by tyramine. Instead they show tyramine regulation of somatic granules, which may be reasonable, easily assayable surrogates for synaptic granules. While this is acceptable, it is recommended that this experimental gap be clearly acknowledged, because granules in neuronal processes are most likely the ones important to regulate for memory-related processes.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether synaptic mRNP granules are altered by Tyramine is indeed a question that was not addressed in this manuscript. To make it clearer, we have revised the text so as to emphasize that the granules we have been analyzing are found in MB cell bodies (see edits in the abstract, pages 4, 11). We have also modified the last part of our discussion (page 13) to highlight that looking at local regulation represents a future line of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please consider if the language used to describe the association of Imp and CamKII is optimal. Particularly, whether terms such as 'partner' and 'interaction' to discuss this issue may be subject to misinterpretation. It could be better to state that these proteins are found in the same complex etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that the term “partner”, frequently used in the context of complex purification, might be misleading, we don’t see why the term “interaction” or “interactor” should be avoided. As stated in all method textbooks (<italic>e.g.</italic> Protein-Protein Interactions book, Methods Mol Biol series), indeed, coimmunoprecipitation is a technique used to probe for protein-protein interactions (which can be direct or not). In the revised manuscript, we have thus removed the term partner, and have used either “interaction” or “association”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
