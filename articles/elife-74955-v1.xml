Yet, how gap junctions control the positioning of cells in organs is not well understood. Innexins compose gap junctions in invertebrates and affect organ architecture. Here, we investigate the roles of gap-junctions in controlling distal somatic gonad architecture and its relationship to underlying germline stem cells in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We show that a reduction of soma–germline gap-junctional activity causes displacement of distal sheath cells (Sh1) towards the distal end of the gonad. We confirm, by live imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and antibody staining, that bare regions—lacking somatic gonadal cell coverage of germ cells—are present between the distal tip cell (DTC) and Sh1, and we show that an innexin fusion protein used in a prior study encodes an antimorphic gap junction subunit that mispositions Sh1. We determine that, contrary to the model put forth in the prior study based on this fusion protein, Sh1 mispositioning does not markedly alter the position of the borders of the stem cell pool nor of the progenitor cell pool. Together, these results demonstrate that gap junctions can control the position of Sh1, but that Sh1 position is neither relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for the exit of germ cells from the stem cell pool.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innexin</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-19-231-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolkin</surname><given-names>Theadora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM134876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubbard</surname><given-names>E Jane Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG065672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubbard</surname><given-names>E Jane Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM100756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schedl</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM57173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenstein</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM144029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenstein</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24OD010943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Somatic gonad architecture is regulated by innexin function, but sheath cell position does not determine germ cell exit from the stem cell pool.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The relative positions of certain cells within larger organ structures are often important for tissue function. Yet the mechanisms by which cells reach and maintain their precise relative positions within organs are poorly defined. Gap junctions act as conduits for small molecules passed between cells and/or as rivets to ensure adhesion between cells (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skerrett and Williams, 2017</xref>). They have also been implicated in cell morphology within organs (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phelan, 2005</xref>), however this latter role is less well characterized. Here, we take advantage of well-characterized and stereotypical morphology, interactions, and relationships among cells in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to investigate the role gap junctions play in somatic gonad architecture and its consequences, or lack thereof, for the underlying germline stem cells.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite gonad provides a premier system for studying organogenesis and stem cell behavior (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubbard and Greenstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubbard and Schedl, 2019</xref>). Two gonad arms, anterior or posterior of a central uterus and vulva, are each capped by a single somatic cell, the distal tip cell (DTC), that establishes a stem cell niche. Germline stem cells and their proliferative progeny, which together are referred to as progenitors, are maintained by GLP-1/Notch-mediated signaling in the germ line in response to DSL family ligands LAG-2 and APX-1 produced by the DTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadarajan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yochem and Greenwald, 1989</xref>). Proximal to the DTC, five pairs of sheath cells (named as pairs Sh1 to Sh5, distal to proximal) provide additional support to the germ line. In particular, Sh1 is implicated in promoting germline progenitor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>). Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Sh1 promotes germline proliferation remain to be fully elucidated, it is clear that one mechanism for the function of these cells involves the formation of gap junctions with germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Invertebrate gap junctions are formed from octameric hemichannels of innexin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oshima et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, INX-8 and INX-9 associate to form hemichannels in the hermaphrodite somatic gonad which couple to germline innexin hemichannels (INX-14 with INX-21 or INX-22) to promote germline proliferation and inhibit meiotic maturation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, a reduction of <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-9</italic> via hypomorphic alleles or by RNA interference limits expansion of the pool of proliferative germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalfó et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starich and Greenstein, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). The mutant innexin allele combinations used in this study are proficient in promoting germline proliferation; however, as this work shows, many of them affect the position of Sh1 with respect to the distal end of the gonad.</p><p>Several prior observations point to a role for innexins in overall somatic gonad architecture. In young adult hermaphrodites, the DTC forms long extending processes reaching proximally towards Sh1, while the distal border of Sh1 is more regular, with filopodia extending distally towards the DTC. Extensive ultrastructural and both fixed and live image analysis demonstrated the existence of ‘bare regions’ in between the proximal-extending DTC processes and the distal-extending filopodial extensions of Sh1 in the adult hermaphrodite gonad. In these regions, germ cells are in contact with neither the DTC nor Sh1, but are covered only by a basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, the hypomorphic allele <italic>inx-14(ag17</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyata et al., 2008</xref>) causes Sh1 to reach almost to the distal end of the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>) and to obliterate any bare region between the DTC and Sh1. Similarly, a loss of bare regions was observed in <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0</italic>) double mutants in which germline proliferation was largely restored through expression of an <italic>inx-8::gfp</italic> transgene in the DTC only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). This latter result suggested that if Sh1 cannot form gap junctions with germ cells, Sh1 becomes distally mispositioned. However, the consequences of this mispositioning and the accompanying loss of the bare regions for germline stem cells have not been previously explored.</p><p>The spatial relationship between the DTC, Sh1 and the germ line summarized above was recently challenged, and an hypothesis put forth that Sh1 might guide an oriented and asymmetric division of stem cells, such that a daughter cell in contact with Sh1 enters the differentiation pathway while the other, in contact with the DTC, remains a stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). If oriented cell fate-determining germ cell divisions occur in this way, the expectation would be that germ cells undergoing such a division should be in contact with both the DTC and Sh1, and that closely spaced daughter germ cells that have recently undergone such a division would remain in contact with one or the other. The model predicts that there should be few, if any, germ cells that contact neither the DTC nor Sh1. If Sh1 drives cell fate-determining germ cell divisions, another expectation would be that altering the position of Sh1 in the distal–proximal direction should similarly alter the position of the germline stem cell fate decision. However, given that much of the analysis was performed using an INX-8 fusion protein marker that could conceivably alter the position of Sh1, and given that the precise relationship between the position of Sh1 vis-à-vis the border of the stem cell pool was not investigated, we wished to determine how hypomorphic innexin alleles alter the position of Sh1 and whether the position of Sh1 influences the border of the germline stem or progenitor pools.</p><p>In short, we characterize the natural variability of Sh1 position and confirm the presence of bare regions in gonads of early adult wild-type hermaphrodites. We show that reducing soma–germline gap-junction coupling causes Sh1 to be mispositioned distally. In addition, we show that the fusion protein used in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) encodes a dominant antimorphic allele of <italic>inx-8</italic> that also causes distal mispositioning of Sh1. Finally, we determine that when bare regions are absent due to Sh1 distal mispositioning, the borders of the stem or progenitor cell pools are not markedly altered. Together, these results demonstrate that while innexin function can dramatically impact the position of the distal border of Sh1, this position of Sh1 is not relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for germ cells to exit the stem cell pool.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>There is natural variability in the position of the distal border of Sh1, but gonads of wild-type hermaphrodites display bare regions where germ cells contact neither the DTC nor Sh1</title><p>As detailed below, we found that Sh1 is somewhat variably positioned in wild-type young adult hermaphrodites.

We designated as Class 1, those gonads in which &gt; 8 µm (a distance covered by 2 germ cell diameters) separated the DTC and Sh1. Class 2 includes those gonads in which Sh1 and DTC processes come within 8 µm or in which Sh1 extensions intercalate with DTC processes, up to the position of the mean length of DTC processes. Class 3 gonads are those in which the border of Sh1 is markedly shifted distally such that it lies between the distal end of the gonad and the mean DTC process length.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video1" xlink:href="elife-74955-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Confocal stack and 3D rendering of representative Class 1 gonad.</title><p>Strain DG5020.</p></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video2" xlink:href="elife-74955-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Confocal stack and 3D rendering of representative Class 2 gonad.</title><p>Strain DG5020.</p></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video3" xlink:href="elife-74955-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Confocal stack and 3D rendering of representative Class 3 gonad.</title><p>Strain DG5026.</p></caption></media><p>Using <italic>bcIs39[lim-7p::ced-1::GFP]</italic> to visualize Sh1, a transgene that produces a CED-1::GFP fusion protein that fully rescues the sheath cell function of CED-1 to engulf germ cell corpses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), we found that a majority of gonads (70%) are in Class 1, confirming the existence of bare regions.

We observed germ cells that contact neither a DTC process (nor fragment thereof) nor filopodial extensions of Sh1, and thus represent bare regions.

The INX-8 distribution pattern in wild type appears less punctate compared to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). We attribute this to several differences in imaging. (1) Images in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref> were obtained on a compound microscope, whereas the images shown here were acquired by confocal microscopy. (2) Except for the progenitor zone region (see point 3 below), images in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref> were captured to present a surface view, while images presented here are maximum projections of confocal stacks, as described above. This stack goes from the gonad surface down through to the surface germ cell nuclei, which results in the appearance of increased signal from junctions residing between intercalating Sh1 invaginations and germ cells, as well as from INX-8 trafficking through the secretory pathway. This gives the appearance of a more honeycomb antibody staining pattern than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>. Unlike the surface view image from the compound microscope, a projection of confocal images is necessary to capture both Sh1 and the DAPI- stained germ cell nuclei that served as a reference (DAPI is not shown). (3) For the progenitor zone (labelled M for mitotic region in the 2014 paper), the image in Figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref> shows a slightly more interior view (at the level of the rachis), revealing sparse punctate staining near the distal tip of the gonad. In this study, DTC staining is less apparent since the distal-most region is also maximum projection confocal stacks only from the gonad surface to the surface germ cell nuclei. Importantly, when viewing more interior planes of the Z-stack, sparse punctate staining is observed at positions consistent with DTC-rachis contact, as described in Figure 6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>.

In both <italic>tnIs6</italic> [<italic>lim-7p::gfp</italic>] or <italic>bcIs39</italic> [<italic>lim-7p::ced-1::gfp</italic>], the remaining 15% of gonads displayed either reduced Sh1 expression or expression in one, but not both, cells of the Sh1 pair, which may result from stochastic transgene downregulation. Finally, we binned these gonads into phenotypic Classes 1–3 based on measurements taken while observing either mKate2 <italic><underline>or</underline></italic> GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The number of Class 3 gonads is somewhat underestimated with the GFP markers. Nevertheless, we observe a striking distal shift of Sh1 in the <italic>inx-14</italic> and <italic>inx-8</italic> mutants bearing these markers. In sum, if the GFP markers were not marking the distal-most part of Sh1, we should not have been able to so readily detect the abnormal distal displacement of Sh1 in <italic>inx-14(ag17), inx-8(rf) or inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> strains bearing these markers.</p><p>We conclude that despite variability in the exact position of the Sh1 border, and despite minor differences in transgene expression, bare regions between the Sh1 and the DTC are present in the wild type, and they are greatly diminished due to a distal shift in the position of Sh1 in worms bearing reduced <italic>inx-14</italic> or <italic>inx-8</italic> function or bearing the mKate2::INX-8 fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>An mKate2::INX-8 fusion behaves as a dominant dosage-sensitive antimorph</title><p>Based on our observations that <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8)]</italic> gonads display a distally shifted border of Sh1, we hypothesized that this allele might encode an INX-8 protein that poisons innexin complexes thereby interfering with the channel and/or adhesion functions important for Sh1 positioning. If this were due to a toxic effect of the mKate2::INX-8 fusion protein on gap junctions, we would predict that the distal shift of Sh1 would be dependent on the presence of the INX-8 coding region. To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate <italic>inx-8</italic> null alleles in both the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) and wild-type genetic backgrounds. We generated deletions with identical breakpoints in the <italic>inx-8</italic> locus in both genetic backgrounds [i.e. <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) and <italic>inx-8(tn2034</italic>)] starting 136 bp upstream of the wild-type <italic>inx-8</italic> ATG start codon and extending 221 bp into <italic>inx-8</italic> exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) context, this deletion also removes the mKate2 moiety. These deletions are expected to constitute <italic>inx-8</italic> null alleles because, in addition to removing the start codon, they delete amino acids 1–349 (out of 382 amino acids), including virtually all residues essential for spanning the plasma membrane and forming a channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starich and Greenstein, 2020</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the deletion mutant <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) displays a significantly lower frequency of Class 3 gonads than the original <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) allele. Sh1 in the <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) deletion mutant is positioned more proximally, and therefore, like the wild type, exhibits bare regions that are lacking in <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). In addition, <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) exhibits a nearly normal brood size and suppresses the low-level embryonic lethality observed in the <italic>inx-8(qy78</italic>) starting strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Likewise, the identical deletion generated in the wild-type genetic background, <italic>inx-8(tn2034</italic>), also exhibits the wild-type Sh1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), with a normal brood size and negligible embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, the observation of a small percentage of Class 3 gonads in <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) and <italic>inx-8(tn2034</italic>) animals but not in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggests that the position of Sh1 is sensitive to the dosage of somatic gap junction hemichannels.

First, the marker transgenes do not have an appreciable effect on brood size or embryonic lethality in our hands. Second, genetic interactions exist between <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic>, <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> and the <italic>inx-9(ok1502)</italic> null mutation. Specifically, <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> enhances both the reduced brood size and embryonic lethality of <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic>; whereas <italic>inx-9(ok1502)</italic> weakly suppresses the embryonic lethality defect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Third, in the course of this analysis, we noted that strains bearing <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> displayed highly variable population growth dynamics that we attribute to stress. Although the relevant stressor has yet to be determined, we observed this effect over multiple generations after starvation or transport. Given our previous finding that key metabolites such as malonyl-CoA are transported through these junctions to support embryonic growth, this finding deserves future scrutiny.</p><p>Finally, to assess more fully the nature of the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> allele with respect to Sh1 position, we generated and imaged worms bearing this allele in heterozygous and hemizygous configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; we abbreviate <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> to ‘<italic>qy78’</italic> and null to (0), below, to aid comparison between genotypes). We infer loss-of-function behavior since other loss-of-function mutations affecting soma-germline gap junctions, such as <italic>inx-14(ag17),</italic> also cause a distal shift in the Sh1 border. Nevertheless, <italic>inx-8(qy78</italic>) is dominant: a substantial proportion of gonads in <italic>qy78/+</italic> are in Class 3, similar to <italic>qy78/qy78,</italic> but distinct from deletion heterozygotes [<italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031/+)</italic>]. However, in a hemizygous configuration (<italic>qy78/0</italic>), the Sh1 distal displacement phenotype is largely suppressed. Thus, <italic>qy78</italic> acts as a dosage-sensitive antimorph. We speculate that the fusion protein produced by <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) can form dysfunctional junctions on its own or with INX-8(+), but not when it is present below a certain abundance threshold. As also mentioned above, the <italic>inx-8</italic> deletion allele <italic>qy78tn2031</italic>, while largely suppressing the Sh1 distal mispositioning defect, displays a weak dominant haploinsufficient behavior consistent with dosage sensitivity. Alternatively, this behavior could result from genetic positional effects that impinge on nearby <italic>inx-9</italic> function and for which Sh1 position is particularly sensitive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The distal position of Sh1 does not influence the position of the stem cell pool border</title><p>A recent model proposed that the position of the Sh1 border influences the stem/non-stem decision in underlying germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>).

We analyzed the proximal extent of the pool of SYGL-1-positive cells bearing a well-characterized OLLAS epitope tag on SYGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) and compared that boundary relative to the distal Sh1 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Materials and methods). In the case of <italic>inx-14(ag17),</italic> although the distal border of Sh1 was shifted drastically and significantly, there was no significant change in the position of the border of the SYGL-1-positive stem cell pool. In the case of the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) allele, the border of the SYGL-1-positive pool was marginally shifted distally relative to the wild type, though not commensurate with the extent to which Sh1 shifted distally in this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the marginal shift of the border of the stem cell pool in <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) was suppressed when <italic>inx-8</italic> was deleted in both <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031</italic>) and <italic>inx-8(tn2034</italic>).

To detect any subtle correlation between the proximal border of the SYGL-1 pool and the distal border of Sh1, we plotted these against one another and computed an R value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The 2020 report demonstrated a lack of bare regions between the DTC and Sh1 in strains expressing an mKate2::INX-8 fusion protein. We now show that this marker perturbs innexin function. As a result of this perturbation, bare regions are not observed in strains carrying this fusion. Use of mKate2::INX-8 as a maker for Sh1 led to a model whereby Sh1 influences the stem cell fate decision in the underlying germ cells, participating in a direct handoff of cells from the DTC to Sh1. Instead, we show that the mKate2::INX-8 fusion itself, although it was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the context of the endogenous locus, mispositions Sh1 distally, obliterating the bare regions. Because of the redundant function of INX-9, we were able to remove the deleterious mKate2::INX-8 protein entirely and effectively restore the bare regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D-F</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we also examined Sh1 position in wild-type hermaphrodites that lack fluorescent marker proteins.

The remaining 78% of gonads exhibit a ‘gap’ or an overlapping ‘interface’ with the DTC, categories not unlike those we classified within Class 1 and Class 2. Because our analysis focused on those live worms that were oriented in such a way to image the entire distal gonad, it is possible that a minority of gonads were censored due to gonad migration defects. For example, it may not have been possible to distinguish gonad arms with migration defects from those where the gonad was obscured by the intestine. That said, when we imaged DG5133 <italic>inx-8(qy102) inx-9(ok1502</italic>), it was immediately obvious that many gonad arms were grossly misshapen, so we are confident in our ability to detect penetrant gross morphological defects. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref>, we observe that one of the two Sh1 cells is occasionally positioned slightly more proximal than the other. This is likely the result of a birth order difference of their ancestor sheath/spermatheca precursor cells during somatic gonad development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>).</p><p>More salient than the penetrance of migration defects in strain DG5020 bearing <italic>naIs37</italic> and <italic>bcIs39</italic>, is that all of the Sh1 markers we used (including <italic>bcIs39, tnIs5, tnIs6, fasn-1</italic>(av138), and <italic>acy-4(tnEx42</italic>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) show a similar range of Sh1 positioning (represented by Class 1 and Class 2) and that this position matches the previous and current TEM analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 1999</xref>; this work <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>) as well as the anti-INX-8 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref> also incorrectly state that Sh1 was thought to associate only with germ cells well into meiotic development. However, a previously published time course analysis demonstrates association of Sh1 with the progenitor zone during development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>An unresolved question is why several membrane-associated Sh1 markers exhibit patterns that are discordant with strains bearing <italic>bcIs39, tnIs5, tnIs6, fasn-1(av138)</italic>, <italic>acy-4(tnEx42</italic>) markers and with TEM and antibody analyses in unmarked strains. We hypothesize that, like strains bearing an mKate::INX-8 fusion protein, membrane-associated fluorescent proteins described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref> similarly disrupt functions that act to position Sh1, including CAM-1::mNeonGreen, INA-1::mNeonGreen, and <italic>lim-7p</italic>::GFP::CAAX that display reduced or absent bare regions. Since the gonadal architecture displayed by these markers differs from that established by analysis of unmarked strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>; this work), we hypothesize that these proteins, like mKate2::INX-8, disrupt the physiology of Sh1 in some manner. If so, they may, for example, display reduction-of-function or even dominant effects on the position of Sh1, as do strains bearing mKate2::INX-8. Although such tests of this hypothesis are beyond the scope of our study, it will be interesting to determine how these fusion proteins are perturbing Sh1 position and whether these membrane markers perturb Sh1–germline gap junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>The implications of Sh1 position for the stem cell fate decision</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref> experimentally altered germ cell fate or proliferative capacity of germ cells and assayed Sh1 position, whereas we tested directly the proposed model that Sh1 influences the stem cell border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) by altering Sh1 position and assaying expression of the direct GLP-1 target SYGL-1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref> report that the boundary of Sh1 correlates with the group of germ cells that is first to differentiate when GLP-1/Notch signaling or mitosis are blocked using temperature-sensitive mutations in <italic>glp-1</italic> or <italic>emb-</italic>30, which respectively encode the GLP-1/Notch receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin and Kimble, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yochem and Greenwald, 1989</xref>) or the APC4 subunit of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>). However, in all these experiments, Sh1 was marked with the mKate2::INX-8 fusion, which we demonstrate here acts as a dominant antimorph that causes distal mispositioning of Sh1. While the mispositioned Sh1 border in strains expressing mKate2::INX-8 does indeed correlate with the SYGL-1 border, if Sh1 were influencing the stem cell fate decision as proposed, the SYGL-1 border should move with Sh1, and it does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To assess the stem cell border, we examined GLP-1/Notch signaling using a direct target readout, SYGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref>, use comparatively indirect proxies. These include the presence of cells in mitotic prophase, which do not distinguish mitotic stem cells from mitotic non-stem progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox and Schedl, 2015</xref>), and the position of overt entry into meiotic prophase. The latter indicates the border of the progenitor zone (PZ) that includes mitotically competent non-stem progenitors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubbard and Schedl, 2019</xref> for a review of the germline stem cell system). We had also examined the relationship between Sh1 position and the PZ border as indicated with anti-CYE-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and we concur that the progenitor zone is modestly but significantly shorter in strains bearing mKate2::INX-8 compared to strains that are otherwise similarly marked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is not surprising since <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>) encodes a dominant antimorph and the <italic>inx-8 inx-9</italic> double mutant has a profound effect on germ cell proliferation, though not on cell fate as mediated by <italic>glp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the observed effect on the extent of the PZ is very modest compared to the effect of this allele on the position of Sh1, and on a gonad-by-gonad basis there is no correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that the position of the germline response to signaling from the DTC, as measured by expression of the direct GLP-1/Notch target, SYGL-1, is independent of the position of Sh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is also consistent with other observations from the literature. For example, males, which lack sheath cells altogether, exhibit stem cell pools similar to those in the hermaphrodite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crittenden et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the stem cell and progenitor pools are present in larval stages prior to DTC process elaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2014</xref>), when Sh1 is positioned several CD from the DTC, precluding the possibility of a DTC–Sh1 handoff at these stages (e.g. L4 stage, when stem/non-stem fate decisions are in progress; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>). Here, we observed that the distal border of Sh1 relative to the proximal stem cell border in the wild type is ≥5 CD in the majority of adult gonads we examined. Thus, the model suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>, that Sh1 physically orients divisions of stem cells to direct their fate, is also called into question by our results. Finally, using alleles that dramatically alter the position of Sh1, we found no evidence supporting the prediction that the stem/non-stem border is coincident with the Sh1 border. Together, these results indicate that Sh1 is not involved in the germline stem-progenitor fate decision.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-4"><title>Brood size analyses</title><p>An unresolved difference between our study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref> concerns observations of brood sizes in strains bearing <italic>bcIs39[lim-7p::ced-1::gfp]</italic>.

How might gap junctions influence the relative position of the DTC and Sh1 in the distal gonad arm? The DTC forms gap junctions with germ cells, which must be disassembled as germ cells enter a bare region, only to be reassembled again when in contact with Sh1 (and then again with more proximally located sheath cells Sh2–5). A detailed TEM analysis of the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 1999</xref>) led to the consideration that a constant interplay of association and dissociation likely occurs between Sh1 and the underlying germ cells that move proximally along the arm: as germ cell flux continually moves germ cells towards the proximal end of the gonad, the Sh1 cells presumably extend their filopodia distally and form new gap junction connections with incoming germ cells. Otherwise, the bare regions would increase in length along the distal-proximal axis. Under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, this constant association and dissociation between Sh1 and germ cells may be pushed to its limit.</p><p>To complement the role of gap junctions in promoting robust proliferation revealed by the <italic>inx-8 inx-9</italic> double loss-of-function mutant or loss of the germline-encoded channel components, the kinetics of gap junction coupling between the somatic gonad and germ cells may play a role in determining the strength of the interactions between the two cell types. Unlike sheath–oocyte junctions, which form large plaques containing many functional gap junctions, the gap junctions formed in the distal arm appear to represent looser associations of a few gap-junction channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, these associations may be sufficient to maintain adhesion with the underlying germline, functioning like regularly spaced rivets, albeit dynamic and removeable ones.</p><p>Disentangling the adhesive and channel functions of gap junctions is a complex issue. The mutants used in this study are competent to form soma–germline gap junctions—without these, germ cells fail to proliferate. However, they may form such junctions less efficiently than their wild-type counterparts. For example, the pattern of localization of gap junction puncta in <italic>inx-8(rf</italic>) and <italic>inx-14(ag17</italic>) appears more diffuse than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starich et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively or additionally, the mutant innexins in this study may assemble into hemichannels as readily as wild-type innexins, but the pairing or opening of gap junction channels may be compromised. Studies of connexin gap-junction channels in paired <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes strongly suggest that opening of hemichannels facilitates their assembly into gap junctions. That study proposed hemichannel opening collapses the intermembrane space between juxtaposed cells to allow the extracellular loops of connexins to dock into gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beahm and Hall, 2004</xref>). If a similar model applies to innexin-containing gap junctions, then rivet and channel function would be coupled.</p><p>How could impaired innexin function cause Sh1 to creep distally? One hypothesis is that when fewer junctions are made, Sh1 cannot adhere as well to germ cells. This scenario would be consistent with the observation that Sh1 is distally mispositioned when <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-9</italic> are missing from Sh1 but <italic>inx-8(+</italic>) is present in the DTC by virtue of heterologous expression of <italic>inx-8(+</italic>) in the DTC in an <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0</italic>) double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). It is also possible that the DTC and Sh1 engage in an active repellent or a passive space-excluding interaction that somehow involves gap junction function. Another possibility is that a deficit in gap-junction function might trigger Sh1 spreading as a means to increase the surface area over which junctions may form to supply sufficient active biomolecules that transit through these junctions. Nevertheless, our studies show that the position of the germline stem cell decision is not dictated by the position of Sh1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Live imaging and image analysis of live samples</title><p>Live specimens were grown at 20 °C, and staged by picking mid-L4 larvae, then allowing them to grow at 20 °C until imaging them 24 hr later.

Note that pSUN-1 staining is not shown in the figures, although it was used to assess the PZ border.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Assessment of distal position of Sh1</title><p>Anti-GFP antibody staining was used to visualize the sheath, where cell diameters were counted from distal end to the point where GFP staining became prominent.</p><p>To quantify the distance from the distal end to the border of expression of any protein, we have used either ~30 gonads for single-replicate experiments and ~20 gonads for multi-replicate experiments. We define a biological replicate as independently dissected and stained, along with the controls in the same tube, and images acquired with the same settings. During these experiments, no outliers were encountered. In rare cases, acquired images, which either failed to stitch by Fiji or had poor staining, were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Primary antibodies used</title><p>mouse anti-CYE-1 (1:100;

We apologize for the delay in reaching the decision.</p><p>Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ekaterina Voronina (Reviewer #1); Judith Yanowitz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the paper was reviewed favorably, and the paper is likely worthy of the publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. One major comment that requires additional experiment(s) is the clarification of inx-8-mkate allele. The interpretation of poisonous/antimorph/hypomorph etc is influenced by whether or not the allele was homozygote or heterozygote, but such information is not clearly provided in the manuscript that allows appropriate interpretation.</p><p>Furthermore, while the reviewers were discussing the decision of your manuscript, the other paper was submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> by Kacy Gordon's group, which is already posted on BioRxiv. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.08.467787v2</p><p>You will see that they reached a different conclusion. We reviewers agreed that some discrepancies may have derived from different markers, imaging conditions etc. Each paper will be reviewed for its own merit fairly, but as a journal, we need to ask both parties not to leave simple discrepancies that are caused by easy-to-address differences such as reagents and imaging conditions. Also, given that the different makers may be giving different results, we ask you to label the figure panels correctly (e.g. state the markers used, instead of 'what it is supposed to show (such as Sh1)') We ask both parties to communicate and put best effort into resolving discrepancies.</p><p>Other comments provided by reviewers are listed below, which we believe can be addressed mostly by textual editing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors used mean DTC process length to estimate DTC location, which allowed quantitative analysis of cellular organization, but does not directly challenge the &quot;interdigitated&quot; morphology proposed by Gordon et al. However, investigation of several innexin reduction of function mutants provides compelling evidence that the relative DTC/Sh1 positions are impacted by gap junctions between the germ and somatic cells. Furthermore, the conclusions that the changes in relative DTC/Sh1 positions do not concordantly affect the germ line stem cell pool size are strong and bring critical insight to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several suggestions below for experiments or experimental details that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors should clarify the relationship between the DTC and SH1 and whether innexin function is needed in one or both. The authors now show that there is overlap in the DTC and Sh1 marked regions. Are these cells growing over one another or are the projections intercalated? Can this be shown by EM or super-resolution imaging? Does the loss of innexin function in just Sh1 or the DTC change the border? This might help resolve their model about whether Sh1 is &quot;sensing&quot; reduced gap function number or function?</p><p>2) I would be reluctant to claim that they have &quot;Consistent trends… from multiple markers.&quot; (line 194) Ideally, they would use different promoters expressed in the same tissue. If this cannot be done because other well characterized promoters do not exist, then the authors need to say, &quot;Consistent results are obtained from independent transgenes&quot;? Similarly in the paragraph line 219 -226, it is unclear what you meant to test here is the strain was first tested with one of the transgenes.</p><p>3) The authors argue that the qy78 fusion protein acts an antimorph and a loss-of-function to rigorously test these statements they should show the behaviour of qy78/+ and qy78/null. This would allow them to determine if it is a hypermorph, antimorph, or neomorph and if truly recessive.</p><p>4) qy78tn2031 appears to be slightly more abnormal than the tn2034 (Figure 2-Suppl 2B) It might be worth acknowledging that the slight difference could be due to strain background variation? Or are there other reasons for this difference?</p><p>5) Lines 252-254: From table 1, it does not appear that inx-14 suppresses qy78. Also, the interpretation that inx-9 suppresses is also complicated by the fact that the original qy78 alleles gave brood sizes of ~155 whereas the outcross to the DG strains have lower brood sizes. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>6) Line 326: Re &quot;no significant change in the size of the SYGL-1-positive stem cell pool&quot;. The authors are not quantifying either the size of the stained region or (more appropriately) the number of nuclei that have SYGL-1 staining, just the extent of reach of the marker. If anything, a subset of the mutant germ lines (Figure 3) appear smaller than control. This should be addressed.</p><p>7) Similarly in this entire section, while it is clear that Sh1 is shifted distally (almost to the distal end of the germ line), it would be nice to know how the authors quantify proximal shift since the data is in microns which are not normalized for the total size of the germ line. Is there a change in the total number of nuclei or the numbers of rows?</p><p>8) No mention is made in the text of Figure 4 qy78tn2031 or tn2034 or of Figure 4D or Figure 4 figure supplement 1</p><p>9) Table 1 is very confusing because so much of the information in the footnotes refers to methods. It is also unclear, but does b represent the cumulative data from 2 different outcrosses both of which decreased brood size? Do they think there is a suppressor in the original strain? Either all the info in Table 1 footnotes should be included in a supplemental table or in the methods.</p><p>Also, it might be helpful to consolidate a lot of the information into one large table-specifically added a column to Table 1 that includes a yes/no or distance for positional information of Sh1. (maybe &quot;Sh1 edge moved distally&quot;)</p><p>10) The graphics of the genes and mutations should be combined into one figure.</p><p>There were a number of textual edit that need to be made:</p><p>Textual Edits</p><p>Line 241: &quot;must not appreciably perturb the function of inx-9&quot; Please clarify why you think this might be the case?</p><p>Lines 833-834: This parenthetical about pSUN-1 pSer8 not being shown should be included in the figure legends since it is mentioned in the text as being used to define the border and is not shown in the figure. Or simply add &quot;(see methods)&quot; after the &quot;pSUN-1(-) progenitor pool&quot;.</p><p>Line 52: &quot;Germ line&quot; should be one word.</p><p>Line 57: need a comma after &quot;(DTC)&quot;.</p><p>Line 62: Additional support for what?</p><p>Line 57 and 63: Figure 1C (just listed as Figure 1) is mentioned before Figures 1A and 1B.</p><p>Figure 1A: white &quot;inx-21&quot; hard to read on the yellow background. Also, the proteins names should be capitalized not lower case.</p><p>Line 80: &quot;germline&quot; should be &quot;germ line&quot;.</p><p>Line 81-83: The lof analysis does not follow from the rescue study.

This is however integrated at the inx-8 locus, so it would be helpful to comment on and reference why this might be seen with single copy integrants.</p><p>Line 244: Rather that &quot;further&quot; perhaps say &quot;in addition&quot; or &quot;moreover&quot;. Also, the space between the alleles &quot;qy78 tn2031&quot; should be deleted. (also in Figure 2A).</p><p>Line 250: I would say &quot;adhesion functions&quot; rather than &quot;rivet functions&quot; since the latter is an analogy to describe the adhesion role. Also &quot;germline&quot; should be &quot;germ line&quot; here and throughout since soma is a noun, presumably germ line should be as well.</p><p>Lines 323-324: reference for the sygl-1(OLLAS) should be provided.</p><p>Line 326: For consistence you should write &quot;inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])&quot; throughout or &quot;inx-8(qy78)&quot; but not both. Personally, the former is more helpful is reading the text.</p><p>Line 333: &quot;each other&quot; should be &quot;one another&quot;.</p><p>Line 343: &quot;1-2 cell diameters&quot;. What is the basis of this claim?</p><p>Line 439: Add a comma after &quot;organ system&quot;.</p><p>Line 495: is there a funding stream for Wormbase that can be cited?</p><p>Lines 686-687: I am presuming the chromosome insertion sites for cpIs122 and naIs37 are not known?</p><p>Line 832: &quot;until&quot; Not &quot;till&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer#3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Explanation of Figure 2 is a bit confusing. When they used CRISPR approach to remove poisonous inx-8-mKate gene, is the animal examined homozygous for inx-8 deletion, or heterozygous over wild type allele? If the claim of inx-8-mKate being poisonous is correct, inx-8-mKate/+ would also have phenotypes (reduced brood size, loss of the bare region), and the removal of mKate allele (in the presence of inx-8 wild type allele) should rescue the phenotype entirely. Alternatively, if the authors mean that inx-8-mkate's phenotype can be only observed as homozygote, it might mean that inx-8-mKate is a loss of function allele. Also, I see the possibility that the authors imply that inx8-mKate is poisonous to inx-9, and poisoning effect can be seen only as homozygote? Whereas the data itself is convincing, the terminology (poisonous = dominant-negative, hypomorph) as well as the description of genetics (heterozygote vs. homozygote) that can guide the determination of poisonous vs. hypomorph, is unclear to the readers. This should be clarified.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Innexin function dictates the spatial relationship between distal somatic cells in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> gonad without impacting the germline stem cell pool&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Especially notable are: 1) the inclusion of the new classification of DTC/Sh1 process positioning. It is very helpful to address morphological variation and to allow clear comparison among different strains and markers of DTC and Sh1. 2) the inclusion of immunostaining with anti-INX-8. This clearly removes the criticism of sub-optimal markers or a concern that distinct Sh1 boundary locations are attributable to using different markers. Anti-INX-8 clearly shows distinct locations of Sh1 boundary in the wild type vs inx-8(qy78[mKate::inx-8]) backgrounds.</p><p>Overall, this work challenges the Gordon et al., 2020 model of oriented cell divisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline and presents a significant advance in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript addresses all of the major concerns from the previous submission by using multiple reporters for each cell type, by creating a classification system, by providing EM reconstruction of the DTC/SH1 cell and processes, and by redoing all of the viability assays to address strain differences between labs. The importance of the paper remains both in its tale of woe for transgenic reporters, but more importantly, by providing a framework for detailed characterization and classification of cell:cell interactions. It also raises new and interesting questions about the roles of the sheath cells and that innexin proteins might slight haploinsufficiency, a phenotype that may be relevant to human disease.</p><p>There are minor changes to the text that should be addressed</p><p>Line 138- 139.

Accordingly, this manuscript substantially changes our current understanding of how germline stem cells and their differentiation are regulated in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad.</p><p>Whereas there remain some unresolved discrepancies between this manuscript and Gordon et al., the revised version of Tolkin et al. manuscript strongly supports their main conclusions, including the presence of 'bare region' (the area of germ cells that are not touched by Sheath cells or Distal Tip Cells), and the germ cell biology supported by such an architecture of the gonad. Even if some discrepancies may end up to be corrected in the future, their main conclusion is firm enough that merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Whereas their conclusion 'Sh1 position is neither relevant for GLP-1/Notch signaling nor for the exit of germ cells from the stem cell pool' (in the abstract) is correct in that the junction of DTC and Sh1 cells do not serve as the interface for GSCs' 'asymmetric division' (as Gordon 2020 paper suggested), it seems that inx influences the position of Sh1 and also impacts brood size (maybe they think 250 vs. 210 are not different, but have they run statistics on these numbers? It looks to me that there are correlation between Sh1 position and a slight reduction in brood size?). If there is any impact of inx8 mutant/dominant negative, it should be a bit more carefully described. I recommend revising the text to more accurately describe their important conclusions (that innexin mutant reduces bare region with likely functional consequences).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74955.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the paper was reviewed favorably, and the paper is likely worthy of the publication in eLife.

The most dramatic reductions in brood size and increases in embryonic lethality may be linked to recovery from stress; however, we have not verified this as the cause. Parenthetically, we note that <italic>inx-8(tn1513tn1555)</italic>, a reduction-of-function allele (T. Starich, unpublished results), recovers fertility poorly after prolonged starvation. The penetrance of this sterility is also variable (50–90%). Interestingly, and perhaps relevant to our observations with the INX-8 fusion, the Li et al. preprint reports that the KLG019 strain, which contains an N-terminal fusion of GFP with INX-9<italic>,</italic> exhibits a high level of embryonic lethality.</p><p>Once we fully appreciated this unusual situation, we repeated all of the brood and embryo counts with very strictly controlled conditions and report here in revised Table 1. We mention this in the context of other observations made from our brood size and embryonic viability analysis: “Third, in the course of this analysis, we noted that strains bearing <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> displayed highly variable population growth dynamics that we attribute to stress. Although the relevant stressor has yet to be determined, we observed this effect over multiple generations after starvation or transport. Given our previous finding that key metabolites such as malonyl-CoA are transported through these junctions to support embryonic growth, this finding deserves future scrutiny.”</p><p>In short, for <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8],</italic> our results are more similar to those of Li et al. preprint, and these results correct our <italic>bioRxiv</italic> report of high embryonic lethality. We considered putting Table 1 reporting the brood/viability information into the supplement but opted to keep it in the main text to most visibly correct the error in our <italic>bioRxiv</italic> report.</p><p>Nevertheless, <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> does not behave like the wild type. The brood size is lower than the wild type, and there is some embryonic lethality (likely an effect of altered function of proximal sheath–oocyte gap junctions). Our analysis also shows that embryonic lethality is enhanced in combination with a hypomorphic allele of <italic>inx-14</italic> [<italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic>] and appears suppressed in combination with a null mutation in <italic>inx-9</italic> [<italic>inx-9(ok1502)</italic>]. This behavior is consistent with the idea that the mKate2::INX-8 fusion alters the function of the channels in which it is incorporated since <italic>inx-8</italic> intragenic null mutations ameliorate these effects.</p><p>We are still surprised by the low brood and high embryonic lethality defects reported by Li et al. for strains bearing <italic>bcIs39</italic>. We do not observe these phenotypes, neither in some of the same strains they examined, nor in a strain with <italic>bcIs39</italic> alone. We offered to resend/send all strains to Dr. Gordon.</p><p>The more important point is that in properly-controlled experiments (that is, where innexin mutants are being compared to strains bearing wild-type innexin genes and the same markers for each), we see similar effects on the distal border of Sh1 regardless of the Sh1 markers used.</p><p>Brood sizes and viability phenotypes remain secondary to the question of Sh1 position and its influence on germline stem cells.</p><p>(2) “bare regions” in the wild type</p><p>This, unfortunately, is not a “simple discrepancy.”</p><p>We stand by our conclusion that the loss of the bare regions, which they (and we) observe in strains carrying mKate2::INX-8, is a direct result of the distal mispositioning of Sh1 caused by altered innexin function. We pointed out this possibility to Dr. Gordon on several occasions prior to our initial submission.</p><p>By assuming that the Sh1 position in the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> strain was the “normal” position (counter to previously published results), mKate2 expression was interpreted as visualizing new Sh1 membrane not seen using previous markers. When analyzing live mKate2::INX-8-bearing strains, we also see that the minimum distance between DTC and Sh1 is often about 1–2 cell diameters. This distance could give the impression that Sh1 might direct asymmetric division of GSCs. Nevertheless, without observing the positional relationship between Sh1 and the direct GLP-1/Notch target SYGL-1, the claim that Sh1 directs asymmetric division remained weak.</p><p>As summarized below, we have further characterized the natural variability in Sh1 position in the wild type, introducing a phenotypic classification scheme to compare genotypes (2.1), and we bolstered our conclusions from the original manuscript with additional strains and independent techniques (2.2).</p><p>(2.1) In our revised manuscript, we introduce a phenotypic classification scheme (see revised Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3) that helps convey:</p><p>(i) the natural variability in the position of Sh1 in the wild type, as visualized with different markers,</p><p>(ii) that Sh1 is often many germ cell diameters distance away from the DTC (an important point that argues against the Gordon (2020) model of oriented cell divisions),</p><p>(iii) that several different alterations in innexin function result in similar distal mis-positioning of Sh1, and</p><p>(iv) that <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::INX-8]</italic> produces a dominantly acting toxic product.</p><p>(2.2) In our revised manuscript, as detailed in sections (2.2.1-3) below, we use additional live markers (including one generated using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, to argue against the concern of multicopy transgenes), we perform immunohistochemistry in the wild type (no markers present), and present analysis of serial sectioning transmission electron microscopy using high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, to study the position and arrangement of Sh1, the DTC, and germ cells in the distal gonad of the wild type and innexin mutants.</p><p>We were disappointed that the Li et al. preprint did not address our observation that Sh1 is almost invariantly mispositioned (distally) in <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]),</italic> the strain used as a “marker” for Sh1, and that this is a phenotype shared by another <italic>inx-8</italic> mutant and by <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic>. Instead, their preprint focused on variability in Sh1 position between markers, and suggested that the markers we used failed to illuminate the distal part of Sh1. It is well known in the field (as they note) that marker strains can be variable—both in expression level and in their effects on specific phenotypes. That is why one compares genotypes only between similarly marked strains.</p><p>However, there is an unfortunate logical flaw in their argument. If it were the case that our markers fail to detect the distal part of Sh1, we should not have been able to quantify a significant distal shift of the Sh1 boundary in several different live markers in innexin-deficient backgrounds that we document in this manuscript (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>All that said, no markers are perfect. As we showed in our original submission, the frequency of perfect overlap between <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate::inx-8])</italic> and <italic>bcIs39(lim-7p::CED-1::GFP)</italic> or between <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate::inx-8])</italic> and <italic>tnIs6(lim-7p::GFP)</italic> is 85% (not 100%). Nevertheless, the frequency of distal placement of Sh1 increases significantly in the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8)])</italic> background. In revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3D, we provide results obtained by scoring images using mKate2 <italic>or</italic> using GFP, in strains carrying both <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> and concurrently-expressed <italic>lim-7p</italic>-based GFP markers. While the GFP strains modestly underestimate Sh1 mis-positioning, the penetrance of mis-positioning is nevertheless striking.</p><p>(2.2.1) In our revision, we add analysis of live worms bearing two non-<italic>lim-7</italic> promoter-driven markers. These display the expected wild-type Sh1 position and have normal broods, (or even more progeny, as in the case of the single-copy CRISPR-Cas9 generated <italic>fasn-1(av138[GFP])</italic>. In <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> we see a distally mispositioned Sh1 but no viability defects. These points are added to Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and the revised manuscript text.</p><p>(2.2.2) In our revision, we add an anti-INX-8 antibody staining analysis in the wild type with no markers at all and in the <italic>inx-8(qy78)</italic> allele (revised Figure 2B and C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This analysis shows that the distal boundary of INX-8 expression is significantly closer to the distal end of the gonad in the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8)])</italic> (homozygous) genetic background than in a wild-type background with no additional markers.</p><p>In sum, regardless of whether markers do or do not detect the distal part of Sh1, the anti-INX-8 antibody staining should have shown no significant difference in the distal boundary of Sh1 between <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> and <italic>inx-8(+)</italic> if mKate2::INX-8 is marking the wild-type boundary of Sh1.</p><p>(2.2.3) In our revision we add EM analysis that demonstrates that a wild-type distal gonad contains bare regions in which germ cells do not contact either the DTC or Sh1 and are covered only by a basal lamina, as described in Hall et al., (1999). We have added David Hall and Ken Nguyen to the author list as they contributed the EM analysis. Our study is consistent with and extends our previously published work and corrects a misconception in the field that has recently taken root because of the 2020 <italic>eLife</italic> report.</p><p>Regarding the new EM analysis: it would have been difficult to do a similar analysis in 1999 because all images had to be taken on glass negatives. Even with a digital camera today, this was laborious and technically demanding work. However, we do now provide a more extensive description of the variability in the length and arrangement of the bare regions using confocal microscopy and image reconstructions. Taken together, these findings argue against the model that interactions with Sh1 promote stem cell niche exit and differentiation of germ cells as proposed by Gordon et al., (2020).</p><p>In our revision, we also present additional new findings showing that <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8)])</italic> behaves as a dominant antimorphic mutant that interferes with germline–soma gap junctional activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Finally, and of importance to the central question of all of these manuscripts, if Sh1 played a key role in directing differentiation of germline stem cells, we should have observed concomitant changes in the border of SYGL-1 expression between innexin mutants and the wild type, which we do not. Neither Gordon et al. (2020) nor Li et al., (2021) <italic>bioRxiv</italic> pre-print examined the position of the stem cell border relative to Sh1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, given that the different makers may be giving different results, we ask you to label the figure panels correctly (e.g. state the markers used, instead of 'what it is supposed to show (such as Sh1)').</p></disp-quote><p>There is no disagreement between us or with any others in the field, including Dr. Gordon, that the markers mark the cells of interest (DTC and Sh1). The only “disagreement,” as noted above, is whether the Sh1 markers we use marks “all” of this very large Sh1 pair of cells. Therefore, we have opted to indicate both the marker names and “DTC” and “Sh1” on each figure as this helps the reader to follow the results as described in the text, especially as we present data using 2 different DTC markers and 4 different Sh1 markers. In sum, all figures clearly indicate the marker used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We ask both parties to communicate and put best effort into resolving discrepancies.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to our original submission, we communicated extensively with Dr. Gordon. We obtained the <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic>-bearing strain directly from her. It is also worth pointing out that effect of <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> on the distal extent of Sh1 was noted by Starich et al., (2014, see Figure 7D). Since the editors have emphasized the importance of communication between our groups, we would like to alert the editors that in an email from June 14, 2020 one of us (DG) alerted Dr. Gordon that loss of innexin function in the germline or sheath cells could cause Sh1 to extend to the distal tip, based on the aforementioned published studies. We similarly communicated with her as we obtained results presented herein, and, as noted in the Li et al. preprint, we sent all our strains as well as our original submission.</p><p>Finally, we have posted our revised manuscript on <italic>bioRxiv</italic> and notified Dr. Gordon. We have offered to send all strains, and have offered to meet and discuss our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments provided by reviewers are listed below, which we believe can be addressed mostly by textual editing.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors used mean DTC process length to estimate DTC location, which allowed quantitative analysis of cellular organization, but does not directly challenge the &quot;interdigitated&quot; morphology proposed by Gordon et al. However, investigation of several innexin reduction of function mutants provides compelling evidence that the relative DTC/Sh1 positions are impacted by gap junctions between the germ and somatic cells. Furthermore, the conclusions that the changes in relative DTC/Sh1 positions do not concordantly affect the germ line stem cell pool size are strong and bring critical insight to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.</p><p>Our findings support our previous claim that there are “bare regions” between the proximal end of the DTC and distal end of Sh1 (Hall et al., 1999). In the 1999 paper, we noted that the distal filopodia of Sh1 reach approximately 19 ± 6 germ cell diameters from the distal tip of the gonad (p. 113), findings that are essentially replicated here. However, in that 1999 paper, we did note that “the precise length and arrangement of the bare regions seem to be variable (legend to Figure 11B, p. 117).” In 1999, we lacked the tools to describe in a more comprehensive manner the variability in the bare regions because we were unable to mark the DTC and Sh1 simultaneously with different colored fluorophores.</p><p>A key contribution of our revised manuscript is that we have now described the variability of the bare regions through extensive confocal analyses. These results are also supported by a new EM reconstruction using high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution preparation methods. Yet, this natural variability is perhaps most easily seen plotted in revised Figure 1G and subsequent “barbell” plots of that kind and in the green dots representing the position of the distal border of Sh1 as visualized with <italic>bcIs39</italic>, <italic>tnIs5</italic>, <italic>fasn-1(av138[GFP])</italic> and <italic>tnEx42</italic> (revised Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we see a highly variable Sh1 position as marked by anti-INX-8 antibody in the wild-type without any markers (revised Figure 2B and C), often positioned at over 100 µm from the distal end, far proximal to the position occupied by DTC processes (as seen with DTC-marked strains in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 panel E).</p><p>Supporting the results presented in the first submission and addressing reviewers’ concerns, after extensive analysis (including a new slice-by-slice analysis of our live images, collection of additional live images, EM reconstruction, additional antibody staining, and analysis of additional markers) we settled on a new classification scheme to better define and quantify the variability we see. In short, we stratified our images into 3 classes based on the position of the distal-most border of Sh1 (indicated in all figures by a green dot) relative to the proximal reach of the DTC (indicate in all figures by a pink dot), the mean reach of DTC processes (indicated by a blue dot – now also added to all “barbell” graphs for each gonad), and the distal end of the gonad.</p><p>This new classification scheme highlights a key finding of our work: that alterations of <italic>inx-14</italic> or <italic>inx-8</italic> activity dramatically shift the border of Sh1 toward the distal end of the gonad.</p><p>We defined phenotypic classes as follows based on the position of the DTC and Sh1</p><p>(see revised Figure 1C-F):</p><p>As shown in revised Figure 1F, when we classified wild-type gonads (that is, <italic>inx-x(+)</italic> with markers), ~70% are in Class 1, whereas the vast majority of gonads in strains bearing reduction of <italic>inx-14</italic> or <italic>inx-8</italic> function are in Class 3, regardless of marker combinations (revised Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 2). Measurements are broken down by individual gonad (e.g., revised Figure 1 panel G, as in the original Figure 1), but with the addition of a blue dot on each gonad representing the position of the mean length of DTC processes.</p><p>In new Videos 1–3, we provide 3-dimensional renderings (made with Imaris) of gonad arms representing each phenotypic class.</p><p>In a new Figure 1—figure supplement 2, we provide an EM reconstruction of a gonad arm from a young adult wild-type hermaphrodite (unmarked strain), sliced from distal to proximal, outlining the DTC and Sh1. The images and reconstruction are provided in new videos 4 and 5, with highlights of germ cells that are/are not in contact with the DTC or with Sh1.</p><p>In revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we compare the results shown in Figure 1 with alternate DTC and Sh1 markers, including <italic>tnIs5[lim-7p::GFP]</italic> and newly constructed and analyzed strains bearing other markers, (including two that are not driven by <italic>lim-7p</italic>) and/or <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic>.</p><p>While different markers do alter the <italic>exact</italic> proportion of Class 1 (gap) and Class 2 (small gap/intercalation) gonad arms, <italic>regardless of the markers used</italic>, reducing the activity of <italic>inx-14 dramatically</italic> shifts the distal border of Sh1 toward the distal end of the gonad such that almost 90–100% of the gonads are Class 3 (distal Sh1 position) (revised Figure 1— figure supplement 2 panel C). Measurements are broken down by individual gonad where the position of each Sh1 border can be seen in panel D and averages with statistics in panel E.</p><p>In revised Figure 2D–F, we apply the same classification scheme to <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic>, and to the strain in which the <italic>inx-8</italic> fusion has been deleted. Here, we see that, measuring with <italic>bcIs39</italic> [<italic>lim-7p::ced-1::GFP</italic>], the strains bearing <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic> display a reproducible shift of the Sh1 border to the distal end. Moreover, when the fusion-protein (mKate2::INX-8) coding sequence is removed in <italic>inx-8(qy78tn2031)</italic>, the distal Sh1 shift is suppressed.</p><p>In revised Figure 2B–C, we present new information further supporting this conclusion. In <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8])</italic>, with no other markers present, as detected by immunohistochemistry with anti-INX-8 antibodies, the distal border of Sh1 is shifted distally relative to the wild type.</p><p>Supporting our description of the nature of <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> as a “poisonous” allele, new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 provides a similar analysis as in Figures 1 and 2 for additional strains, including <italic>inx-8(qy78)</italic> (or the equivalent <italic>qy102</italic>), with and without <italic>inx-9 mutations</italic>, as well as <italic>inx-8(qy78)/+</italic> and <italic>inx-8(qy78)/inx-8(0).</italic> In short, these data show that <italic>qy78</italic> is a dominant allele that, because of its similar phenotype to reduction of innexin function scenarios (e.g., <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> and <italic>“inx-8(rf)”</italic>), we could consider an antimorphic behavior.</p><p>However, it is not simple. Although the presence or absence of <italic>inx-9</italic> (that is partially redundant with <italic>inx-8</italic>) does not affect the phenotype of <italic>inx-8(qy102)</italic> (which is equivalent to <italic>qy78</italic>), the phenotype of <italic>inx-8(qy78)/+</italic> is far more severe than <italic>inx-8(qy78)/inx-8(0)</italic>, indicating that the dosage of the mutant allele relative to wild-type is important. In the revised manuscript, we comment on this point and its likely relevance to the multimeric structure of the innexins.</p><p>Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3 panels A–C retain the overlap analysis for <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> and <italic>bcIs39</italic> [<italic>lim-7p::CED-1::GFP</italic>]. We added a new panel D with the slice-by-slice classification analysis performed using either <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> and <italic>bcIs39</italic> [<italic>lim-7p::CED-1::GFP</italic>] or <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> and <italic>tnIs6(lim-7p::GFP)</italic> as the Sh1 marker.</p><p>The results, once again, demonstrate that <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::inx-8]</italic> virtually eliminates Class 1 and shifts the distally the border of Sh1 the majority of the time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are several suggestions below for experiments or experimental details that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors should clarify the relationship between the DTC and SH1 and whether innexin function is needed in one or both.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 12A of Starich et al., (2014) shows an <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0)</italic> double null mutant in which <italic>inx-8::gfp</italic> is expressed in the DTC using the <italic>lag-2</italic> promoter. This expression substantially restores germline proliferation to the <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0)</italic> double null mutant. In such “mosaic animals,” sheath cells are unable to form gap junctions with germ cells, but the DTC can. As seen in the image, this results in Sh1 positioning at the distal tip of the gonad.</p><p>The converse analysis with <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0)</italic> DTC and <italic>inx-(+)</italic> sheath cells is a bit more problematic. Although <italic>inx-8(0) inx-9(0); tnEx202[lim-7p::inx-8::gfp]</italic> hermaphrodites can be maintained as a self-fertile strain, they often produce short gonad arms (see Starich et al., 2014, Figure 15, C–E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors now show that there is overlap in the DTC and Sh1 marked regions. Are these cells growing over one another or are the projections intercalated? Can this be shown by EM or super-resolution imaging?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see reply to Reviewer 1, Figure 1 supplements, and Videos 1–3. In short, for Class 2 gonads there can be “intercalation” when viewed as a maximum projection rendering. (However, as seen in 3D rendering, these cell processes can be quite far apart). When Sh1 is very far distal in a mutant genetic background (Video 3 example), we often observe apparent interference such that the DTC processes are located under Sh1. We think this is really interesting and deserves additional mechanistic study, but such an analysis is well beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the loss of innexin function in just Sh1 or the DTC change the border? This might help resolve their model about whether Sh1 is &quot;sensing&quot; reduced gap function number or function?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question, and we restated the point in our revision so as not to imply more than we intended: “sensed” was a poor word choice in retrospect. As shown in each “barbell” graph (green dots) and in the cognate box plots in relevant supplements, the position of the Sh1 border changes with respect to the distal end of the gonad. The position of the DTC is not significantly different in similarly marked strains with and without <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> (e.g., blue dots on “barbell” graphs and average DTC measurements in box plots) while the position of Sh1 is significantly different in each case. We therefore interpret the change as primarily a movement of Sh1 distally. As mentioned above, Starich et al., (2014) indicated that loss of <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-</italic>9 from the Sh1 causes Sh1 to be mispositioned distally (see Figure 12A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I would be reluctant to claim that they have &quot;Consistent trends… from multiple markers.&quot; (line 194) Ideally, they would use different promoters expressed in the same tissue. If this cannot be done because other well characterized promoters do not exist, then the authors need to say, &quot;Consistent results are obtained from independent transgenes&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to our analysis of the wild-type two markers with alternate Sh1-expressed promoters, as well as <italic>inx-14(ag17)</italic> with one of them. Notably, <italic>fasn-1(av138[fasn-1::GFP])</italic> is not a “transgene” as such. It is a CRISPR/Cas9 GFP insertion into the genomic locus. See revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly in the paragraph line 219 -226, it is unclear what you meant to test here is the strain was first tested with one of the transgenes.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret the reviewer to be asking, “It is unclear what you meant to test here IF the strain was first tested with one of the transgenes”? In any case, here we are challenging the result presented in Figure 1—Figure Supplement 1 panel C of Gordon et al. (2020). We only see the result presented in Gordon et al. (2020) in 15% of gonads. We have re-written the text to be more explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that the qy78 fusion protein acts an antimorph and a loss-of-function to rigorously test these statements they should show the behaviour of qy78/+ and qy78/null. This would allow them to determine if it is a hypermorph, antimorph, or neomorph and if truly recessive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated and analyzed these strains, as well as going further by analyzing <italic>inx-8(0)/+</italic>. The results are in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 panels B–E. In short, with respect to the distal Sh1 phenotype, <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate2::INX-8]</italic> is dominant and dosage-dependent. That is, the Sh1 distal mis-positioning defect of q<italic>y78/+</italic> is similar to <italic>qy78/qy78</italic>, and the defect is partially mitigated in q<italic>y78/0,</italic> indicating that either the interaction of the fusion protein with the wild-type protein or the presence of the fusion protein in two copies causes the most penetrant defects, while insufficient quantity of the fusion protein is not as deleterious. We have added these results and a discussion of their implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) qy78tn2031 appears to be slightly more abnormal than the tn2034 (Figure 2-Suppl 2B) It might be worth acknowledging that the slight difference could be due to strain background variation? Or are there other reasons for this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Assuming the reviewer was actually referring to original Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (now revised supplement 2)? As shown in panel C of that figure (now panel E), with respect to mean process length and distal position of Sh1, these two strains are virtually identical. Panel B just shows examples. The length of the longest DTC process is indeed more variable in <italic>qy78tn2031</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Lines 252-254: From table 1, it does not appear that inx-14 suppresses qy78. Also, the interpretation that inx-9 suppresses is also complicated by the fact that the original qy78 alleles gave brood sizes of ~155 whereas the outcross to the DG strains have lower brood sizes. This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>See above response to editor, with respect to Table 1 corrections, which should provide the requested clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 326: Re &quot;no significant change in the size of the SYGL-1-positive stem cell pool&quot;. The authors are not quantifying either the size of the stained region or (more appropriately) the number of nuclei that have SYGL-1 staining, just the extent of reach of the marker. If anything, a subset of the mutant germ lines (Figure 3) appear smaller than control. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of the term “size” in line 326 was our editorial error which we regret, and which we have removed here and elsewhere. In other instances where we talk about the stem cell pool, the phrases “proximal border” and “proximal extent” were (and in revision, are) used. In the revised manuscript, we do not refer to “size”, but rather to the position of borders.</p><p>By way of further explanation, the relevant measurement here is the <italic>proximal border</italic> of the SYGL-1-positive cell pool relative to the <italic>distal border</italic> position of Sh1. This measure addresses the issue of whether Sh1 can orient the spindle of germ cells as they leave the stem cell pool, as claimed by Gordon et al. (2020). We made these measurements both in microns in main figures 3 and 4 and in “cell diameters” (CD) in supplements to figures 3 and 4. The reason the size/number of cells in the stem cell pool is not the relevant measure is that the thickness/thinness of the PZ can change the number of stem cells without altering the proximal border of the stem cell pool. An example is <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> which is thinner than wild type (Michaelson et al., 2010).</p><p>Given the importance of the measured position of the proximal border of the SYGL-1-positive zone/stem cell pool, we have added new Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and referred to it in the Materials &amp; Methods. The Supplemental Figure is a graph of SYGL-1 level versus distal-proximal position, where the proximal extent of the SYGL-1-positive region as determined by image inspection, is compared with the SYGL-1 level measured by staining intensity, relative to the distal position of Sh1. The point here is that we reproducibly “call” the CD position for the SYGL-1 proximal border by eye, and that this position corresponds to a slightly greater than 90% fall in SYGL-1 level. In addition, the figure demonstrates that the SYGL-1 expression levels are very similar between genotypes, independent of the distal position of Sh1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Similarly in this entire section, while it is clear that Sh1 is shifted distally (almost to the distal end of the germ line), it would be nice to know how the authors quantify proximal shift since the data is in microns which are not normalized for the total size of the germ line. Is there a change in the total number of nuclei or the numbers of rows?</p></disp-quote><p>This is why we measured in both µm (main Figures 3 and 4) and “cell diameter” (CD; supplements to Figures 3 and 4). Please also see explanation in previous point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) No mention is made in the text of Figure 4 qy78tn2031 or tn2034 or of Figure 4D or Figure 4 figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the manuscript to refer to these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Table 1 is very confusing because so much of the information in the footnotes refers to methods. It is also unclear, but does b represent the cumulative data from 2 different outcrosses both of which decreased brood size? Do they think there is a suppressor in the original strain? Either all the info in Table 1 footnotes should be included in a supplemental table or in the methods.</p><p>Also, it might be helpful to consolidate a lot of the information into one large table-specifically added a column to Table 1 that includes a yes/no or distance for positional information of Sh1. (maybe &quot;Sh1 edge moved distally&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree. In revised Table 1, we included strain names, added an indication of Sh1 position phenotype on the table, and we removed the methods from the legend. The yes/no information regarding Sh1 was complicated by the fact that some strains could not be directly measured (due to the need for markers).

When they used CRISPR approach to remove poisonous inx-8-mKate gene, is the animal examined homozygous for inx-8 deletion, or heterozygous over wild type allele? If the claim of inx-8-mKate being poisonous is correct, inx-8-mKate/+ would also have phenotypes (reduced brood size, loss of the bare region), and the removal of mKate allele (in the presence of inx-8 wild type allele) should rescue the phenotype entirely. Alternatively, if the authors mean that inx-8-mkate's phenotype can be only observed as homozygote, it might mean that inx-8-mKate is a loss of function allele. Also, I see the possibility that the authors imply that inx8-mKate is poisonous to inx-9, and poisoning effect can be seen only as homozygote? Whereas the data itself is convincing, the terminology (poisonous = dominant-negative, hypomorph) as well as the description of genetics (heterozygote vs. homozygote) that can guide the determination of poisonous vs. hypomorph, is unclear to the readers. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to address this point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, Tolkin et al. addressed all of reviewers' suggestions and included new data that significantly strengthened the manuscript.

It is very helpful to address morphological variation and to allow clear comparison among different strains and markers of DTC and Sh1. 2) the inclusion of immunostaining with anti-INX-8. This clearly removes the criticism of sub-optimal markers or a concern that distinct Sh1 boundary locations are attributable to using different markers. Anti-INX-8 clearly shows distinct locations of Sh1 boundary in the wild type vs inx-8(qy78[mKate::inx-8]) backgrounds.</p><p>Overall, this work challenges the Gordon et al., 2020 model of oriented cell divisions in C. elegans germline and presents a significant advance in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment and very much appreciate their critiques of the original submission, as well as the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised manuscript addresses all of the major concerns from the previous submission by using multiple reporters for each cell type, by creating a classification system, by providing EM reconstruction of the DTC/SH1 cell and processes, and by redoing all of the viability assays to address strain differences between labs.

The text from line 138 was meant to introduce two points: the observed variability of Sh1 position, and what characterizes “bare regions”, thereby setting up a series of observations and measurements, including visualization of germ cells by DIC microscopy, that further substantiate the existence of the bare regions in the gonad. We felt it necessary to explain first the system for classification and the 8 µm threshold in the subsequent paragraphs before stating that we confirmed with DIC. Therefore, we modified these introductory sentences slightly as follows, and put the references to specific figures in the relevant subsequent sections.</p><p>The text now reads,</p><p>“As detailed below, we found that Sh1 is somewhat variably positioned in wild-type young adult hermaphrodites.

It looks to me that there are correlation between Sh1 position and a slight reduction in brood size?). If there is any impact of inx8 mutant/dominant negative, it should be a bit more carefully described. I recommend revising the text to more accurately describe their important conclusions (that innexin mutant reduces bare region with likely functional consequences).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment brings up an interesting question, “what is the biological significance of the bare regions?” The reviewer notes that innexin mutations that reduce or eliminate the bare regions often exhibit a modestly decreased brood size. However, we are unable to ascribe this effect to an absence of the bare regions <italic>per se</italic> because the innexins have multiple functions in germline development (Starich et al., 2014, 2020; Starich and Greenstein, 2020). We have addressed this point by revising the Discussion. We added the following text in a brief new paragraph as follows (lines 508–514),</p><p>“Our observation that loss of the bare regions correlates with only a relatively modest effect on brood size (Table 1) raises the question of what, if any, biological significance the bare regions might have. Because the innexins have multiple functions in germline development (Starich et al., 2014, 2020; Starich and Greenstein, 2020), we are unable to ascribe the observed brood-size reduction in strains lacking bare regions to the absence of the bare regions <italic>per se</italic>. Thus, any potential roles for the bare regions vis-à-vis brood size and germline development will require additional study.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
