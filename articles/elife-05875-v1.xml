chloride currents; neither the target, nor mechanism, is known. We demonstrate that secreted CLCA1 activates calcium-dependent chloride currents in HEK293T cells in a paracrine fashion, and endogenous TMEM16A/Anoctamin1 conducts the currents. Exposure to exogenous CLCA1 increases cell surface levels of TMEM16A and cellular binding experiments indicate CLCA1 engages TMEM16A on the surface of these cells. Altogether, our data suggest that CLCA1 stabilizes TMEM16A on the cell surface, thus increasing surface expression, which results in increased calcium-dependent chloride currents. Our results identify the first Cl<sup>−</sup> channel target of the CLCA family of proteins and establish CLCA1 as the first secreted direct modifier of TMEM16A activity, delineating a unique mechanism to increase currents. These results suggest cooperative roles for CLCA and TMEM16 proteins in influencing the physiology of multiple tissues, and the pathology of multiple diseases, including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and certain cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05875.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05875.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05875.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many biological processes that are important for our health involve the movement of ions into, and out of, our cells. For example, the flow of chloride ions out of cells controls the production of the sticky mucus that lines our windpipe and other airways. This mucus helps trap pollution and other foreign particles before they reach our lungs, and thus protects the lungs from harm. However in some diseases—such as cystic fibrosis and asthma—excessive amounts of thick mucus are produced; this can lead to breathing difficulties and an increased risk of infection.</p><p>Proteins belonging to the CLCA protein family were first thought to act as channels that allow chloride ions to flow through cell membranes. Later studies then revealed that these proteins are not channels; instead they trigger the movement of chloride ions across cell membranes by activating other channel proteins. However, the identity of these channel proteins was unknown, and it was unclear how CLCA proteins might activate these channels.</p><p>Sala-Rabanal, Yurtsever et al. have now shown that a member of the CLCA protein family, called CLCA1, is released from human cells and causes nearby cells to release chloride ions when the channel detects calcium ions. The movement of chloride ions triggered by CLCA1 looked very similar to the way chloride ions flow through a channel protein called TMEM16A, and so Sala-Rabanal, Yurtsever et al. asked whether these two proteins interact.</p><p>TMEM16A was discovered several years ago, but remains the only calcium-dependent chloride channel known in mammals. Sala-Rabanal, Yurtsever et al. showed that adding CLCA1 to cells caused more TMEM16A channels to appear in the cell surface membrane and thereby increased the flow of chloride ions. The CLCA protein also physically interacted with the chloride channel in the membrane to stabilize it; no other protein has been shown to regulate ion channels in this way before.</p><p>The findings of Sala-Rabanal, Yurtsever et al. provide a much clearer understanding of how the CLCA protein and the chloride channel work. Both of these proteins are known to contribute to excess mucus production in airway diseases; and both have been linked to cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. These new findings may therefore also help researchers to target these proteins and develop treatments for these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05875.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05875.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion channel regulation</kwd><kwd>calcium activated chloride channel</kwd><kwd>chronic inflammatory airway disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL119813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brett</surname><given-names>Tom J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRE19970008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yurtsever</surname><given-names>Zeynep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002590</institution-id><institution>American Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG-196051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brett</surname><given-names>Tom J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL54171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>Colin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pilot and Feasibility Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brett</surname><given-names>Tom J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A functional link between representative family members of the CLCA channel regulator family and TMEM16 channels suggests that these protein families may cooperate in influencing multiple homeostatic and disease physiologies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The calcium-activated chloride channel regulator (CLCA- previously known as chloride channel calcium activated) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cunningham et al., 1995</xref>) are a family of secreted self-cleaving metalloproteases that activate calcium-dependent chloride currents (I<sub>CaCC</sub>) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>). CLCA family members are highly expressed in mucosal epithelia where they play important roles in mucus homeostasis and related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Patel et al., 2009</xref>). For example, human CLCA1 plays a central role in interleukin (IL-) 13-induced mucus cell metaplasia, the main source of inflammatory mucus overproduction in chronic obstructive airway diseases, such as asthma and COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alevy et al., 2012</xref>). Both clinical and animal model studies suggest a compensatory role for CLCAs in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF): the fatal intestinal disease, meconium ileus, arising in CFTR-deficient mice is corrected by overexpression of mCLCA3 (an orthologue of human CLCA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Young et al., 2007</xref>) and, correspondingly, mutations in <italic>CLCA1</italic> are found in a subset of CF patients with aggravated intestinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van der Doef et al., 2010</xref>). At the cellular level, overexpression of CLCA proteins leads to activation of calcium-dependent chloride currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elble et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenwood et al., 2002</xref>), and this functional observation had caused CLCAs to be initially misidentified as calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cunningham et al., 1995</xref>). However, further bioinformatic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that CLCA proteins are secreted, soluble proteins and that they act to modulate CaCCs that are endogenous to mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>). The molecular identity of these channels, the mechanism of CLCA activation, and their potential roles in CLCA-mediated diseases, remain unknown.</p><p>TMEM16A (also known as Anoctamin1/DOG1) was recently identified as the first genuine CaCC in mammals by three independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). 10 members of the TMEM16/Anoctamin family have been identified (TMEM16A-K, or Ano1-10); these proteins, predicted to be transmembrane proteins with eight membrane-spanning helices, have been found to function predominantly as CaCCs (TMEM16A and B) or as phospholipid scramblases (TMEM16C, D, F, G, and J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</xref>). TMEM16A, the best-characterized member of the family to date, is expressed in airway epithelia and smooth muscle, and its activity recapitulates some of the airway disease traits associated with CLCA1. Not only is TMEM16A expression significantly increased by IL-13 and IL-4 in primary cell models of chronic inflammatory airway disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alevy et al., 2012</xref>), but TMEM16A overexpression is also linked to mucus cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scudieri et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, TMEM16A-specific inhibitors decrease mucus secretion and airway hyperreactivity in cellular models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Although experiments with purified TMEM16A protein reconstituted in liposomes indicate that it can form a functional channel on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Terashima et al., 2013</xref>), several cytosolic modulators and interaction partners, such as calmodulin, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), ezrin, radixin, and moesin, have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perez-Cornejo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pritchard et al., 2014</xref>). However, no secreted regulators of TMEM16A activity have been identified as of yet. Here we report that secreted CLCA1 modulates TMEM16A-dependent calcium-activated chloride currents, and that this activation can occur in a paracrine fashion. Furthermore, we show that CLCA1 and TMEM16A co-localize and physically interact on the surface of mammalian cells, and that CLCA1 increases the level of TMEM16A protein at the cell surface, representing a novel mechanism of channel regulation by a secreted protein. We thus demonstrate a first downstream target of CLCA proteins and provide the first example of a secreted protein modulator of TMEM16A activity. These findings have significant implications for the roles of CLCA1 and TMEM16A proteins as cooperative partners, not only in the physiology and pathophysiology of the airways, but also in those of other tissues and organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Secreted CLCA1 can activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chloride currents in a paracrine fashion</title><p>We previously demonstrated that I<sub>CaCC</sub> are activated in HEK293T (293T) cells overexpressing human CLCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>). Given that CLCA1 proteins are cleaved and secreted from these cells, we hypothesized that exogenous CLCA1 may activate I<sub>CaCC</sub>. In a first set of experiments to test this idea, GFP-expressing cells that had been co-cultured overnight with cells transfected with CLCA1-pHLsec plasmid (CLCA1) or with empty pHLsec vector (pHLsec) were tested for I<sub>CaCC</sub> by means of whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the presence of 10 μM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and physiological concentrations of extracellular Cl<sup>−</sup>, robust, slightly outward rectifying currents were activated in cells co-cultured with CLCA1-transfected cells, but only substantially smaller currents were detected in cells co-cultured with vector-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In a complementary experiment, whole-cell I<sub>CaCC</sub> were measured in untransfected cells that had been cultured in medium obtained from CLCA1- or from pHLsec-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed activation of large currents in cells exposed to CLCA1-conditioned medium that had the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and voltage-dependence properties as those induced in cells co-cultured with CLCA1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, outward rectification of the CLCA1-activated current decreases at higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In addition, current reversal potential shifts positive upon lowering extracellular Cl<sup>−</sup>. These features are in agreement with the properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance observed in CLCA1-expressing 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>), and consistent with those of CaCCs in native cells and heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamazaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>).

We previously demonstrated that CLCA1 is cut into two fragments by self-cleavage and that the N-terminal fragment is necessary and sufficient to activate CaCCs in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, for these assays we developed a CLCA1 cell-staining reagent composed of the N-terminal fragment of CLCA1 (N-CLCA1) containing a specific biotinylation motif on the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Biotinylated N-CLCA1 was coupled to SA-PE (streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin) to produce a tetrameric fluorescent reagent with enhanced avidity toward its ligand. Cell-binding assays were carried out in the presence or absence of an anti-TMEM16A antibody raised against epitopes in the last extracellular loop and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The tetramerized N-CLCA1 displayed robust binding to intact HEK293T cells compared to background, and this binding was significantly reduced by pre-incubating the cells with the anti-TMEM16A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Two control antibodies, one raised against an intracellular epitope of TMEM16A and the other an isotype control, did not affect N-CLCA1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In order to validate that the biotinylation of N-CLCA1 did not adversely affect function, we carried out whole-cell patch clamp experiments where either purified N-CLCA1 or purified biotinylated N-CLCA1 was exogenously applied to HEK293T cells.

However, a recent proteomics approach has identified a large number of endogenous proteins implicated in protein trafficking, surface expression, folding and stability that interact with TMEM16A, including SNAREs such as syntaxins and syntaxin-binding proteins, and the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) scaffolding complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perez-Cornejo et al., 2012</xref>). Our data identify CLCA1 as the first secreted direct regulator of TMEM16A, and our findings suggest that CLCA1 may modulate TMEM16A channel activity by stabilizing it at the cell surface, much like the SNARE and ERM protein networks of the TMEM16A interactome.</p><p>So how does CLCA1 modulate TMEM16A currents? We observe that CLCA1 increases TMEM16A surface expression without increasing expression of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A model consistent with our data and the current literature is that CLCA1 engages and stabilizes dimeric TMEM16A on the surface of the cell. Previous studies have shown that TMEM16A can exist as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fallah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>), dimerization being mediated by an intracellular region in the N-terminus of TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tien et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations to this region abolish dimerization, prevent protein trafficking to the plasma membrane, and, consequently, ablate channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tien et al., 2013</xref>). These observations indicate that dimerization regulates TMEM16A trafficking and channel activity. It is possible that TMEM16A dynamically shuttles between the cell surface and intracellular compartments. One possibility is that CLCA1 engages monomeric TMEM16A and drives dimerization; alternatively, CLCA1 may engage and stabilize dimeric TMEM16A on the cell surface, thereby preventing its removal and, consequently, increasing calcium-dependent chloride currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This highlights an unprecedented mechanism for regulating ion channel currents by a secreted protein.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05875.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for CLCA1 modulation of TMEM16A-mediated calcium-dependent chloride currents.</title><p>Following secretion and self-cleavage of CLCA1, the N-terminal fragment (N-CLCA1) acts in paracrine fashion (1).

Results are presented as mean ± S.E., differences between two groups were assessed by unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test with Welch's correction, and differences between more than two groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA and <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey test (Prism 5.0c, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For staining experiments, cells were either transfected or exposed to conditioned medium as described above. Following 24 hr incubation, cells were fixed on glass slides with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 1% blocking solution in PBS (Life Technologies) and then incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-human CLCA1 polyclonal antibody 1228 at 1:100 dilution and goat-anti-human-TMEM16A polyclonal antibody S-20 at 1:50 dilution) overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed and incubated with WGA-Alexa Flour 633 conjugate (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate at 1:250 dilution and donkey anti-goat IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate at 1:200 dilution) for 2 hr at room temperature. Washed slides were then mounted in VECTASHIELD H-1200 Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). The images were acquired with LSM 4.2 software and batch processed with AxioVision 4.8.2 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry binding assay</title><p>Human CLCA1 was assayed for binding to cell-surface TMEM16A using a flow cytometry-based binding assay. Prior to staining, intact HEK293T cells were treated with human FcR blocking reagent at 1:100 dilution (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA) for 15 min. The biotinylated N-CLCA1 was pre-incubated with SA-PE at a 4:1 molar ratio for 15 min at room temperature to produce fluorescently labeled tetramers of N-CLCA1 (N-CLCA1/SA-PE). Cells (4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/sample) were either stained with SA-PE alone (1:50) or N-CLCA1/SA-PE (1:50) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA (FACS buffer) at 4°C. In order to validate specific binding of N-CLCA1/SA-PE to cell surface TMEM16A, goat-anti-human-TMEM16A polyclonal antibody S-20 (1:10), which was raised against a 15–20 amino acid peptide within residues 820–870 (corresponding to the last extracellular loop; UniProt Q5XXA6), was added prior to addition N-CLCA1/SA-PE. A goat polyclonal IgG antibody for human Aquaporin5 was used (1:10) as an isotype control for the blocking antibody S-20. Mouse-anti-human-TMEM16A monoclonal antibody C5, which binds a cytosolic epitope, was used as a second control antibody (1:10). Following staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting and densitometric quantitation</title><p>HEK293T cells were pelleted, lysed in lysis buffer (1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 137 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 in deionized water), and then diluted 1:2 in 2× SDS containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and then loaded on a 4–12% bis-tris Nupage gel (Life Technologies). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using an iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked by 0.5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% TWEEN. Primary antibodies (mouse α-human CLCA1 8D3, 1:4000; mouse-anti-human-TMEM16A monoclonal antibody C-5, 1:1000; mouse-anti-actin monoclonal antibody C4, 1:5000) in blocking buffer were incubated on the membrane for 15 min. Following three washes with PBS-TWEEN, secondary antibodies (goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate 1:5000) in blocking buffer were applied for 15 min. After three PBS-TWEEN washes, signal was detected using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Developed films were scanned and converted to 8-bit tiff files. Protein bands were processed equally and the pixel intensities were quantified with ImageJ 1.48 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Richard Aldrich, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>They found the work to be interesting and potentially quite important. However there remains some necessary additional work to validate the conclusions and to rule out alternative interpretations of the results. Satisfactory completion of the following experiments will be necessary for further consideration. They should be relatively easily completed with existing approaches.</p><p>CLCA proteins are a family of soluble proteins that activate Ca-dependent chloride currents in mammalian cells. The mechanism by which this occurs has been unknown. In this work, the authors conclude that secreted CLCA1 binds directly to TMEM16a channels to stabilize them at the plasma membrane. This conclusion is of interest because it identifies the molecular target of CLCA1 (TMEM16a) and proposes a mechanism by which the activation of TMEM16a occurs. The proposed mechanism would likely be of relevance to many other CLCA and TMEM family members.</p><p>The proposed mechanism by which TMEM16a is activated is suggested by a combination of two types of experiments:</p><p>(1) Functional assays: Endogenous Ca-dependent chloride currents are activated by co-culturing HEK293T cells with CLCA1-expressing cells or by culturing HEK293T cells with extracellular media obtains from cells expressing CLCA1</p><p>(2) Co-localization and binding assays: (2a) Antibody staining shows colocalization of CLCA1 AND TMEM16A, and (2b) a fluorescent biotinylated N-CLCA1 construct interacts with TMEM16a-expressing cells as detected by flow cytometry.</p><p>1) Upon viewing the first set of experiments, we wondered whether there might be other explanations for the activation of Ca-dependent chloride currents, perhaps something other than the CLCA1 secreted by the cells is responsible for activating the currents. (Or, less interestingly, perhaps there is an artifact from incomplete washing of transfection reagents.) It would be straightforward for the authors to alleviate these concerns, simply show that direct addition of the CLCA1 protein is sufficient to activate the currents. In previous work, the authors have demonstrated their ability to express and purify CLCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yurtsever et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>2) Further, in this work, the binding experiments were done with a biotinylated CLCA1 variant. To be certain that this binding is relevant to activation, it should be shown that this variant not only binds but also induces the expected functional result (i.e. activation of TMEM16a currents). These experiments can be done with existing reagents using methods (patch-clamp recording) already performed in this study. If CLCA1 protein cannot be shown to activate currents, then the model presented for the mechanism of activation is not supported.</p><p>3) The identification of TMEM16a channels as the molecular target for CLCA1 is reasonable based on the properties of the currents and the siRNA experiments, but the experiments with inhibitors are not convincing and should either be improved or eliminated from the manuscript. The inhibitors used are said to be “potent” but are used at high concentration (10 uM). At such concentrations off-target effects become likely. This is particularly of concern because of the method by which inhibition was detected: cells incubated in inhibitor were compared to cells that were not incubated with inhibitor. A more convincing experiment would be to measure currents before, after, and upon washout of inhibitor (at a reasonable concentration).</p><p>4) The authors present only a cursory analysis of the properties of the complex's currents under rather “extreme” conditions (+100 mV, high internal Cl-, high internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and long incubations with inhibitors). For example, is the CLCA1-induced current increase the same at all voltages and/or at all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05875.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Upon viewing the first set of experiments, we wondered whether there might be other explanations for the activation of Ca-dependent chloride currents, perhaps something other than the CLCA1 secreted by the cells is responsible for activating the currents.

In previous work, the authors have demonstrated their ability to express and purify CLCA1 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"><italic>Yurtsever et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>Care was taken to remove the transfection mixtures in these experiments, and we have now more explicitly stated that in the Methods section. In addition, we have carried out the suggested experiment (exogenously applying purified N-CLCA1 to 293T cells) and have demonstrated that this purified protein is capable of activating the calcium-activated chloride currents we observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Further, in this work, the binding experiments were done with a biotinylated CLCA1 variant. To be certain that this binding is relevant to activation, it should be shown that this variant not only binds but also induces the expected functional result (i.e. activation of TMEM16a currents). These experiments can be done with existing reagents using methods (patch-clamp recording) already performed in this study. If CLCA1 protein cannot be shown to activate currents, then the model presented for the mechanism of activation is not supported</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the suggested patch-clamp experiments using the purified, biotinylated N-CLCA1 added exogenously to the 293T cells. This biotinylated protein activates the calcium-activated chloride currents just as robustly as the non-biotinylated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), indicating that the biotinylated N-CLCA1 is functional and, furthermore, supporting our presented model.</p><p><italic>3) The identification of TMEM16a channels as the molecular target for CLCA1 is reasonable based on the properties of the currents and the siRNA experiments, but the experiments with inhibitors are not convincing and should either be improved or eliminated from the manuscript. The inhibitors used are said to be “potent” but are used at high concentration (10 uM). At such concentrations off-target effects become likely. This is particularly of concern because of the method by which inhibition was detected: cells incubated in inhibitor were compared to cells that were not incubated with inhibitor. A more convincing experiment would be to measure currents before, after, and upon washout of inhibitor (at a reasonable concentration)</italic>.</p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have removed the inhibitor data from this manuscript and plan to perform more comprehensive experiments with these inhibitors in a future manuscript. Because these experiments have been removed, we have removed one author from the manuscript (Arthur Romero), as his sole contribution was the synthesis of one of the inhibitors (MONNA).</p><p><italic>4) The authors present only a cursory analysis of the properties of the complex's currents under rather “extreme” conditions (+100 mV, high internal Cl-, high internal Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>and long incubations with inhibitors). For example</italic>, <italic>is the CLCA1-induced current increase the same at all voltages and/or at all Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>concentrations?</italic></p><p>We have addressed this by performing a more detailed assessment of the biophysical properties of the CLCA1-dependent currents, and our manuscript now includes experiments in physiological and reduced extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> concentrations, and in the presence of 0, 1 or 10 μM free pipette Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As suggested by the reviewers, we have eliminated the experiments with inhibitors (see reply to Comment #3 above). Also, we are now displaying the current-voltage relationships in the full experimental range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1C and 2C</xref>), in addition to highlighting the changes in maximum current density (pA/pF at +100 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1D and 2D</xref>), and the right shift in reversal potential by decreasing extracellular chloride. We believe that our data robustly show that CLCA1-mediated currents display essentially the same Ca<sup>2+</sup>-, voltage- and Cl<sup>–</sup> dependence as those described in the literature for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>–</sup> channels, and in particular TMEM16A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
