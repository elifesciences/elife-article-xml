DEAD-box RNA helicases, whose name is inspired by a characteristic sequence motif (D-E-A-D, in single letter code), are enzymes that utilize ATP to bind and remodel RNA and RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). While <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> eIF4A (~10<sup>5</sup> copies per cell) is roughly five times more abundant in the cell than Ded1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>), both helicases are essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linder and Slonimski, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>eIF4A unwinds RNA duplexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrick, 2015</xref>). In the cell, the helicase interacts with the large scaffolding protein eIF4G that also binds the cap-binding protein eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hinnebusch,2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>). The complex containing eIF4G, eIF4E and eIF4A is called eIF4F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrick, 2015</xref>). eIF4A binds to a MIF4G domain of eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schütz et al., 2008</xref>), and this interaction stimulates RNA- and ATP-binding, and ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity of eIF4A in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>). In translation initiation, eIF4A is thought to be critical for steps during and subsequent to the recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parsyan et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, eIF4A appears to promote at least one step necessary for the translation of most or all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Ded1p unwinds RNA duplexes in vitro as a trimer, whose formation requires the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). Ded1p also facilitates strand annealing, RNA structure conversions, and the remodeling of RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iost et al.,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Jankowsky, 2005</xref>). Both, Ded1p and human DDX3X interact with the cap binding protein eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2008</xref>), and with eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soto-Rifo et al., 2012</xref>). Ded1p uses its C-terminus to bind to the C terminus of eIF4G, a region distinct from the eIF4A binding site in eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>). The interaction with eIF4G interferes with Ded1p oligomerization and thus inhibits RNA unwinding by the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). In translation initiation, Ded1p and DDX3X have been implicated in the mRNA recognition by eIF4F, recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit to the mRNA, the scanning process, start codon selection and joining of the two ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sharma and Jankowsky, 2014</xref>). Misregulation of DDX3X expression and mutations in the helicase core of DDX3X are associated with tumors, including medulloblastoma, lung- and colorectal cancer and T-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heerma van Voss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>). DDX3 is also targeted by multiple pathogenic viruses including HIV, HCV, other flaviviridae, poxviridae, and HBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Valiente-Echeverría et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous data indicate genetic interactions between eIF4A and Ded1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Cruz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>), and a recent, transcriptome-wide study in yeast shows overlapping, but not identical functions of eIF4A and Ded1p in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). While these data suggest a possible link between the two helicases, Ded1p and eIF4A have been generally viewed as separately functioning factors. Despite the central biological roles of the two enzymes, their level of conservation, and their implication in numerous diseases, it is unknown whether and how eIF4A and Ded1p are linked biochemically and physically, and if their functions are coordinated. The answer to these questions is of considerable importance for understanding eukaryotic translation initiation on the molecular level. However, experimentally addressing the link between the two enzymes presents significant challenges. First, as RNA helicases, eIF4A and Ded1p share basic biochemical properties including RNA binding, unwinding, ATP binding and ATP turnover. Therefore, enzymatic readouts are similar and potentially difficult deconvolute. Second, both helicases interact with eIF4G, which also binds RNA. The multitude of possible individual interactions significantly complicates the analyses of coupling between the proteins. Third, interactions between the proteins are likely transient or dynamic, given that both, Ded1p and eIF4A bind and hydrolyze ATP, which in turn modulates RNA binding by the helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). Functional analysis of dynamic multi-component assemblies is not well developed, even though such RNA-protein complexes are numerous in biology.</p><p>Here, we have confronted the experimental challenges associated with links between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, ATP and RNA. Using quantitative biochemical and enzymological approaches, we show that Ded1p and eIF4A directly interact with each other and that both helicases simultaneously interact with eIF4G. We devise an unbiased, comprehensive thermodynamic framework for the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP. This framework indicates that eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, acts as a modulator for activity and substrate preferences of Ded1p, and that Ded1p functions as the RNA remodeling unit in complexes with eIF4A. Our observations reveal an unexpected interdependence between both RNA helicases and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral part of the eIF4F complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A and eIF4G</title><p>We identified eIF4A in a screen for genes that suppress a cold-sensitive growth defect conferred by <italic>DED1</italic> mutations (<italic>ded1-tam</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression of eIF4A partially restored growth at non-permissive temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that eIF4A can promote Ded1p's function, but not completely substitute for its tasks.

Hippuristanol inhibits the activities of eIF4A, but not those of Ded1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordeleau et al., 2006</xref>). Here, Hippuristanol diminished growth of the <italic>ded1-95</italic> strain, compared to the WT <italic>ded1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that targeted inhibition of eIF4A can impact a growth defect associated with a mutation in <italic>DED1</italic>. Collectively, these observations expand the scope of genetic interactions between the two DEAD-box helicases. However, the data did not reveal the physical nature of the link between Ded1p and eIF4A.</p><p>To probe physical connections between the two helicases, we performed pull-down experiments with recombinant, purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Previous data had shown that both helicases bind to distinct regions of the scaffolding protein eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrick, 2015</xref>). It was thus important to determine whether Ded1p could directly interact with eIF4A, and to probe whether both proteins could interact simultaneously with eIF4G. Reactions were performed with RNases to exclude possible RNA bridging of the three RNA binding proteins. EIF4A bound directly to Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 2). This observation indicates a direct interaction between the two DEAD-box helicases that does not depend on RNA or another factor. EIF4A increased the amount of eIF4G bound to immobilized Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3). As expected, Ded1p bound to immobilized eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 7). Ded1p increased the amount of bound eIF4A to eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 7). Together, the data reveal a direct interaction between Ded1p and eIF4A and promotion of Ded1p-eIF4G binding by eIF4A.

To our knowledge, no comparable framework exists for any dynamic complex with multiple RNA binding proteins. To devise an instructive quantitative model, it was important to measure the interactions under conditions where ATP binding and turnover as well as RNA binding and remodeling occurred simultaneously.

To independently verify the calculated high stability of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, we used microscale thermophoresis (MST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seidel et al., 2013</xref>) to directly measure binding of Ded1p to a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in the absence of RNA and ATP.

Given the high thermodynamic stability of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, we suggest to consider Ded1p, like eIF4A, as integral functional part of eIF4F. We note that high thermodynamic stability does not equal persistence of the complex. In fact, the complex between the three proteins is unlikely to be long-lived, given that both eIF4A and Ded1p constantly turn over ATP.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16408.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional parameters of complexes with Ded1p, eIF4A, or both.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Free energies ΔG° for complexes formed between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA (25 nt 3‘-overhang, 16 bp duplex) and ATP in the combinations shown, calculated with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.

Ded1p is stimulated by eIF4A at lower Ded1p concentrations because the complexes with eIF4A bind as single units with hyperbolic binding isotherms, whereas Ded1p oligomerizes cooperatively, which results in a sigmoidal isotherm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, stimulation of Ded1p by eIF4A, with or without eIF4G, decreases at higher Ded1p concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The similar unwinding rate constants at ATP and protein saturation for the Ded1p trimer, the Ded1p-eIF4A and the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complexes are consistent with the notion that a Ded1p protomer acts as the unwinding unit in the complexes with eIF4A.

To this end, we obtained functional affinities for the various protein complexes for a substrate with 10 nt 3' overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These parameters were calculated from sets of unwinding reactions with the 10 nt tailed substrate with varying concentrations of Ded1p, eIF4A, and eIF4G, analogous to the process described for the substrate with the 25 nt overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then compared the functional affinities for the 10 and the 25 nt tailed substrates for each protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For Ded1p alone, affinity increased for a 25 nt vs. a 10 nt tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lower panel), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2007a</xref>). Addition of eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, increased the relative affinity of the complexes for 25 nt vs. 10 nt tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Yet, at low Ded1p concentrations, eIF4A and eIF4G stimulated Ded1p unwinding stronger for a substrate with a 10 nt tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), compared to a substrate with a 25 nt tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The stronger stimulation for substrates with shorter tails arises from the hyperbolic shape of the functional binding isotherm of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, compared to the sigmoidal isotherm for the Ded1p trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These data show that activity stimulation can scale with the concentration of components, without a marked change in affinity.</p><p>Finally, we examined the impact of duplex length on the degree by which eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, modulated the unwinding activity of Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since duplex length impacts only the unwinding rate constant, but not the substrate affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>), we calculated unwinding rate constants at ATP and enzyme saturation for duplexes of different length using our thermodynamic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and data collected from substrates with 13, 16, and 19 basepairs and identical 3', 25 nt overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The shortest duplex was unwound fastest by the eIF4A-Ded1p complex, and slowest by the eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p complex. For the longest duplex, this order was reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The scaling of the unwinding rate constants with duplex length correlates with the process of strand separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). The data thus indicate that both eIF4A and eIF4G directly affect the strand separation step by the Ded1p protomer. EIF4A most likely increases the time by which partially opened duplex stands are kept apart, while decreasing the number of basepairs opened per strand separation event. In contrast, eIF4G and eIF4A together appear to decrease the time by which partially opened duplex stands are kept apart, while increasing the number of basepairs opened per strand separation event. For substrates containing a 5' tail, no comparable scaling of the stimulation with the duplex length was seen, although the stimulation was somewhat higher for the longer duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, our data show that substrate architecture influences the degree by which unwinding activity of Ded1p is impacted by eIF4A and eIF4G, alone and in combination. Our observations further reveal that eIF4A and eIF4G directly influence the strand separation step of Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and that substrate affinity of each protein complex scales with the length of the unpaired tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate direct and functional interactions between the DEAD-box helicases eIF4A and Ded1p. Although both helicases have been firmly implicated in translation initiation, they had not been viewed as physically connected. Our data further show that eIF4A and Ded1p simultaneously interact with eIF4G to form a thermodynamically stable complex. The findings reveal a physical and functional connection between Ded1p, eIF4A and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral functional part of the eIF4F complex.</p><p>Our data show that Ded1p, eIF4A and eIF4G, all of which bind RNA, can form four discrete complexes (Ded1p-eIF4A, Ded1p-eIF4G, Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G, eIF4A-eIF4G) with defined biochemical properties. Most importantly, Ded1p is the primary RNA remodeling unit in all complexes where it is present. Compared to previously described complexes between eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4B, the complexes with Ded1p display orders of magnitude more potent RNA remodeling activity than complexes that only contain eIF4A. This observation raises the possibility that remodeling of stable RNA structures in cellular 5'UTRs, which is often attributed to eIF4A, might in fact be carried out by complexes that contain Ded1p.</p><p>Our data suggest that the various complexes readily form at physiological concentrations of protein, RNA and ATP. Affinities determined with our model and reported cellular concentrations of the proteins, RNA and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koç et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>), allowed us to estimate the prevalence of all complexes at concentrations around the physiological concentrations of Ded1p and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These calculations suggest that all complexes exist under physiological conditions, thus rationalizing reported co-immunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>). The calculations further show that at the reported cellular concentrations of Ded1p and eIF4G (~1 μM), the majority of the two proteins is bound in the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Almost all of the remaining Ded1p and remaining eIF4G is bound to eIF4A, and only little Ded1p oligomer is present.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16408.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Calculated prevalence of complexes formed between Ded1p, eIF4A and eIF4G at physiological protein concentrations.</title><p>Fraction of Ded1p (left) and eIF4G (right) present in the various complexes with eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, at three different Ded1p and eIF4G concentrations around their reported physiological concentrations of ~1 μM (RNA = 6 μM, ATP = 2.5 mM).

For Ded1p, the changes in the complex ratio have only little impact on helicase activity, since complexes with Ded1p have similar unwinding activities and RNA affinities, although this depends somewhat on the duplex length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). Increasing eIF4G concentrations dramatically decreases the fraction of eIF4G that is associated with Ded1p and thus with potent remodeling activity. These observations suggest that Ded1p, in addition to eIF4A, might be important for the function of eIF4G. The data provide a possible rationale for the roughly equal cellular concentration of eIF4G and Ded1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firczuk et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complex is thermodynamically most stable, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation to favor formation of this complex. For this reason, we suggest to consider Ded1p, like eIF4A, as integral part of eIF4F. Our data highlight a previously unknown role of eIF4A as a co-factor for Ded1p. This function is consistent with recently discovered overlapping roles of Ded1p and eIF4A in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sen et al., 2015</xref>), and with the partial complementation of <italic>ded1</italic> mutations by overexpression of eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since the cellular eIF4A concentration exceeds the Ded1p concentration by a factor of approximately five, our findings do not exclude roles of eIF4A in translation initiation that are independent of Ded1p.</p><p>Our results define a basic functional architecture of the complexes between Ded1p eIF4A and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most notably, Ded1p utilizes distinct regions to bind to eIF4A and eIF4G. If eIF4A is present, the Ded1p N-terminus is most critical for binding, whereas the Ded1p C-terminus is critical for binding to eIF4G alone. eIF4G and eIF4A allosterically affect the unwinding activity of the Ded1p protomer. In energetic terms, these effects are smaller than the allosteric impact of co-factors on RNA helicases seen in other multi-component complexes, such as the TRAMP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 2011</xref>). However, Ded1p allosterically impacts eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, as reflected in the marked increase in RNA affinity for the two proteins. This increase in the RNA affinity most likely indicates a function of the proteins as RNA binding adaptors for the Ded1p protomer that separates the strands. Unwinding activity and RNA affinity in the Ded1p-eIF4A, and Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complexes depends on the substrate architecture to a moderate degree, but substrate preferences of Ded1p are not drastically altered by eIF4A or by eIF4A-eIF4G.</p><p>The intricate connection between Ded1p, eIF4G and eIF4A implies that removal of Ded1p or disruption of the interaction between Ded1p and eIF4A profoundly affects RNA remodeling by complexes that contain eIF4A. In addition, complexes containing Ded1p are more sensitive to ATP depletion and inhibition by AMP than complexes containing only eIF4A, because Ded1p has a weaker ATP affinity than eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>). Complexes with Ded1p might therefore be more sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell than complexes with only eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013</xref>). A broad regulatory potential is thus likely to be associated with the interaction between Ded1p to eIF4A. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Ded1p N-terminus that binds to eIF4A, harbors a multitude of proven and potential sites for post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sharma and Jankowsky, 2014</xref>). Modification of these sites could affect the interaction with eIF4A.</p><p>Finally, our quantitative analysis of dynamic complexes formed by multiple RNA binding proteins emphasizes that the effects of these proteins on each other cannot simply be described as 'stimulating' or 'inhibiting'. Because multiple sub-complexes are often simultaneously present, both in vitro and in the cell, observed effects depend on the concentration of individual proteins, relative to each other and in absolute molar terms, and on ATP and RNA concentrations. For these reasons, frameworks such as the one developed in this study are required to adequately describe biochemical features of individual complexes, and to define the interactions between all factors, especially if the complexes are not long lived. The approaches outlined in this work could therefore be useful for the quantitative analysis of other dynamic complexes that contain multiple RNA-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Ded1p and mutant Ded1p proteins</title><p>Wild type Ded1p with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag (plasmid: pET-22b(+)-<italic>DED1</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21) and purified and characterized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Jankowsky, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The plasmid for recombinant Ded1p<sup>T408I</sup> with N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag (pEJ13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pET-22b(+)-<italic>DED1</italic>with primers X11 and X12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

Briefly, Ded1p was incubated with 0.5 nM radiolabeled RNA for 5 min in reaction buffer, and reactions were initiated with ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Where applicable, eIF4G, eIF4A, or both were included. Aliquots were removed at indicated times, and reactions were stopped and applied to 15% nondenaturing PAGE. Gels were dried and RNAs visualized and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager and the ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Observed rate constants were calculated as described, considering simultaneously occurring strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Jankowsky, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein-protein crosslinking</title><p>In vitro protein‐protein crosslinking with formaldehyde was essentially performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>), with Ded1p (0.3 µM), eIF4A (2 µM for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, or indicated concentrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), RNA (2 µM, 16bp, 25 nt 3’-overhang) and 0.5 mM ADPNP-MgCl<sub>2</sub> in buffer used in unwinding reactions. Formaldehyde [1% (v/v)] was added, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Crosslinking was quenched with 0.5 mM Tris-Glycine (pH 6.8). Proteins were applied to and resolved on the NuPAGENovex 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels (1.5 mm) in MOPS buffer (pH7.7, Life Technology).

Excess dye was removed by buffer exchange into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 30% glycerol and 100 mM NaCl using <italic>Zeba</italic>spin desalting columns (0.5 mL, 7K MWCO, ThermoFisher Scientific # 89882). The protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, with the diluted BSA (Roche) and unlabeled eIF4A in known concentration as standards.</p><p>Microscale thermophoresis measurements were performed at room temperature on a Monolith NT.115 system (NanoTemper Technologies) with standard treated glass capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies). Buffers were identical to those used in unwinding reactions, complemented with 0.5 µg/µL BSA (Roche) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween, to prevent absorption of the proteins to the glass capillaries, and with 25 µg/mL RNase A (USB) to remove residual RNA. 20% IR-laser power was used to locally generate the temperature jump in the capillaries. Fluorescence change in the heated field was monitored with 20% LED power. Laser on and off times were set at 30 s and 5 s, respectively. The eIF4A-eIF4G complex was formed for at least 10 min prior to the addition of Ded1p. Measurements were performed multiple times, averages of individual points were calculated and the resulting binding isotherm was fitted with the quadratic binding equation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Thermodynamic model and data fit</title><p>Kinetic modeling was performed with KINETK EXPLORER (Kintek, Austin, TX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2009b</xref>) using data obtained in this and earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). The thermodynamic framework to describe the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA, and ATP was built on the previously established kinetic framework for duplex unwinding by the Ded1p oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). eIF4A and eIF4G only interact with a Ded1p monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The resulting framework contains 108 binding reactions, listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The model was constrained by considering energy conservation. That is, the change in free energy for transition of one complex into another is independent of the reaction pathway. In addition, we incorporated the experimentally determined RNA affinity of eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>). We further considered that the comparably weak RNA independent ATPase activity of Ded1p was not affected by eIF4G and eIF4A to a measurable degree (data not shown). This notion allowed us to use the Ded1p affinity for ATP in the absence of RNA for multiple Ded1p complexes. Collectively, these considerations enabled us to describe the entire framework in 16 groups of thermodynamically linked binding steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Ten complexes are theoretically capable of unwinding: Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4-eIF4G, Ded1p-eIF4G, Ded1p-eIF4A (with ATP bound to Ded1p, eIF4A, or both), Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G (with ATP bound to Ded1p, eIF4A, or both). Given that eIF4A<sup>E171A</sup> (ATPase deficient) was able to stimulate unwinding by Ded1p, while Ded1p<sup>E307A</sup> (ATPase deficient) did not stimulate unwinding by eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we considered ATP binding to eIF4A irrelevant for the unwinding activity of the Ded1p-eIF4A complex. In the presence of eIF4G, ATP binding by eIF4A was required for the impact on Ded1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We therefore considered the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complex with ATP bound to both helicases as active unwinding complex. Collectively, these considerations simplified the number of unwinding complexes to six: Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4-eIF4G, Ded1p-eIF4G, Ded1p-eIF4A (with ATP bound to Ded1p independent of ATP binding to eIF4A), Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G (with ATP bound to Ded1p and eIF4A). We did not include ATP hydrolysis steps in our analysis for any complex, except for Ded1p alone, for which we had previously characterized the respective steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putnam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Global data fitting was performed using Kintek Global Explorer. 20 datasets for unwinding of the 16 bp duplex with 3’-25 ntssRNA overhang were fit simultaneously. A dataset includes all time courses for titration of 1 component (e.g., protein or ATP) with other components held constant. For each complex at least one dataset was included for a titration of each component (e.g., Ded1-eIF4G: 1 Ded1p titration, 1 eIF4G titration, 1 ATP titration).Datasets were as follows: Ded1p-eIF4A (4 datasets), Ded1p-eIF4G (3 datasets), eIF4A-eIF4G (4 data sets), and Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G (9 datasets). Multiple iterations were performed until the best fit to all data sets was achieved. Data were fit assuming that all binding steps for Ded1p with eIF4A, and eIF4G were in rapid equilibrium. Parameters for the best fit values are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Variables not well constrained by the data are reported as limits. Errors are not always symmetrically distributed around the best fit value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Uncertainty in each parameter is presented as a range calculated at the 95% confidence interval. To visually assess the quality of fit, experimental data were plotted versus values predicted with the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Jerry Pelletier (McGill Univ., Montreal) for Hippuristanol, Dr. Derek Taylor (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland) for SUMO plasmids, Dr. Michael Altmann (Univ.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Coupling between the DEAD-box RNA helicases Ded1p and eIF4A&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of work:</p><p>This paper presents the novel findings that eIF4A, alone and together with eIF4G, allosterically modulates the rate and substrate preferences of RNA unwinding by helicase Ded1 in the context of complexes containing Ded1 and eIF4A, or all three proteins. They do an extensive set of unwinding assays with Ded1 and these other two proteins over a range of different protein, RNA, and ATP concentrations, allowing them to model a thermodynamic framework that generates functional affinity constants (<italic>K<sub>1/2</sub> </italic>values) for forming all of the different potential combinations of these 3 proteins with and without RNA and ATP. Based on these affinity constants and known information about cellular concentrations, they argue that the trimeric complex of Ded1/eIF4A/eIF4G is the predominant form in cells. This would change the way we think about Ded1 as functioning independently of eIF4F (4E/4G/4A) on a subset of mRNAs with highly structured 5'UTRs towards the view that it generally functions as a subunit within eIF4F and that its activity is modulated by eIF4F components. They also have evidence that eIF4A and eIF4G activities are likewise modulated by Ded1. In addition, they examine the effects of eIF4A and eIF4G on unwinding by Ded1 for substrates with 3' versus 5' overhangs, finding the greater stimulation for the former. And they measure unwinding activities for substrates of different duplex lengths from which they deduce different effects of eIF4A alone or together with eIF4G on unwinding by the trimeric complex.</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, the Reviewing Editor came to the decision that it is necessary for you to address all of the essential comments provided in all four reviews (shown below), except for the suggestion of Reviewer #2 that you determine unwinding rates in yeast cytoplasmic extracts that have eIF4A and Ded1p mutants; and the suggestion of Reviewer #3 that you employ Surface Plasmon Resonance to measure the on- and off-rates of the heterotrimeric eIF4G/eIF4A/Ded1 complex. It is also requested that you make the necessary revisions to address each of the less critical comments of the reviewers, as you see fit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper by Gao et al. presents a tour-de-force kinetic analysis of the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP during ongoing unwinding reaction. The data analysis is carried out by global modeling of a huge dataset using KinTek Explorer. The datasets are comprehensive and more than sufficient to make the modeling. In addition, key statements are tested directly by alternative methods which further strengthen the conclusions. This type of analysis is extremely challenging and innovative. The results provide a new insight into the function of helicases in eukaryotic translation and demonstrate the importance of the protein networks in shaping their functional activity. I have only one uncertainty concerning the statistical evaluation of data. In my opinion, correlations between the observed and calculated constants are only the first step in the assessment of the data fit and alone it is insufficient to judge the quality of the fit. Another key piece of fitting is the error analysis for the lower and upper bounds of the calculated values. This is not documented sufficiently. It would be important to provide the information about the σ value, Ch2 Threshold and provide a supplemental figure with the symmetry distributions (see of KinTek manual).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study proposes that Ded1p is the primary unwinding helicase of the preinitiation complex and that eIF4A plays a rather minimal role in restructuring mRNA. If true, this would be a very important finding and transform our understanding of initiation in yeast. Nevertheless, while the in vitro data are convincing for the complexes studied, one does wonder if the in vitro reconstituted complex truly reflects what occurs in vivo and whether eIF4A unwinding activity is increased by an untested accessory factor (e.g. eIF4B in the presence of Dedp1). One possible set of experiments to test this would be to determine unwinding rates in yeast cytoplasmic extracts that have eIF4A and Ded1p mutants.</p><p>It is certainly possible that the function of eIF4G and eIF4B in promoting eIF4A unwinding activity is not conserved between yeast and humans. This raises a rather important point, which is that there now appears to be a rather significant difference between yeast and human eIF4A unwinding potential using purified components in vitro. Is it that the human eIF4G and eIF4B provide the necessary regulation of eIF4A activity, which the yeast homologs just can't accomplish (they are certainly quite different at the sequence level)? Or, is yeast eIF4A naturally a poor unwinding enzyme even in the presence of eIF4G and eIF4B and therefore requires Ded1p? The authors write the introduction as if the two systems can be viewed as the same mechanism, but this is increasingly becoming less likely. As it stands, the authors should rewrite their introduction to raise this fact. While I appreciate stating the link between eIF4A and disease (cancer), the function of yeast eIF4A may have nothing to do with how the human system is regulated.</p><p>Some specific points:</p><p>The authors provide pull-down data to test if eIF4G-DED1-eIF4A can form a trimeric complex. A limitation of this approach is that the amount of eIF4A pulled down with eIF4G or ded1 is extremely small. As a result, the interpretation that a trimeric complex is formed from this data is not convincing.</p><p>In the absence of RNA, equilibrium dissociation constants are determined by microscale thermophoresis. Interestingly, this assay generates rather different data to that previously published for yeast proteins by the Lorsch lab (Mitchell et al. Mol. Cell. 2010 Sep 24;39(6):950-62; not cited). In the Lorsch study, eIF4A binds to an eIF4G-eIF4E complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is calculated to be &lt;30 nM. In the current study the apparent affinity of eIF4A to an eIF4G-eIF4E complex (the authors state that eIF4E is in all eIF4G complexes on in the Results section) with an apparent affinity of 500 nM. An order of magnitude difference in measured affinity seems rather large. Do the authors have any explanation for this? These kinds of discrepancies could seriously alter the proposed models of complex formation between components.</p><p>An equilibrium dissociation constant of Ded1p to an eIF4G-eIF4A complex is measured to be 7 nM. This doesn't seem to correspond to such a low amount of this complex obtained in the pull-down assay (In the absence of RNA and ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Wouldn't one expect a higher amount of protein retained in the pull-down assay with what must be a relatively slow off-rate (in the absence of ATP and RNA)? The explanation that this complex may not be long lived in the presence of ATP and RNA does not explain why these proteins are not retained on the pull-down in the absence of ATP and RNA. This could be tested by showing that the interaction of an ATPase dead mutant of eIF4A and Ded1p to eIF4G should be enhanced in cells.</p><p>It is briefly mentioned that eIF4E is also present in the unwinding assays to preserve eIF4G stability. Human eIF4E has been shown to promote duplex unwinding by eIF4A – have the authors tested this mechanism, or is this also a human specific function of eIF4E?</p><p>Human eIF4A has recently been shown to possess a very precise step size no matter what accessory protein(s) are bound to it – this required single molecule data to definitely prove (Science. 2015 Jun 26;348(6242):1486-8; not cited). Do the authors really feel that step size is going to change for yeast factors in the presence of accessory proteins compared with human factors? Since the bulk assays provided here can't monitor processivity this claim seems unsupported.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper presents the novel findings that eIF4A, alone and together with eIF4G, allosterically modulates the rate and substrate preferences of RNA unwinding by helicase Ded1 in the context of complexes containing Ded1 and eIF4A, or all three proteins.

And they measure unwinding activities for substrates of different duplex lengths from which they deduce different effects of eIF4A alone or together with eIF4G on unwinding by the trimeric complex.</p><p>Critical comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> provides evidence for Ded1-eIF4A interaction, and shows that addition of eIF4A increases the binding of eIF4G to Ded1, but it's very puzzling that less eIF4A binds to Ded1 in the presence of eIF4G than in its absence, directly at odds with later measurements of Kd values from the thermodynamic modeling – as if interaction between eIF4A and 4G competes with Ded1-eIF4A interaction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the increases in Ded1 and eIF4A interaction with eIF4G when all three components are present are quite modest, perhaps ~3-fold or less, whereas the thermodynamic modeling later in the paper predicts a 3-order of magnitude increase in affinity for the heterotrimeric complex compared to all 3 dimeric complexes. The authors suggest later in the paper that the Ded1 interaction with eIF4G/eIF4A will have a high off-rate owing to ATP hydrolysis; however, the affinities predicted by the thermodynamic model for the heterotrimeric complex are subnanomolar even in the absence of ATP and RNA-the conditions of the pull-down experiments. One wonders whether the on-rate would have to exceed the diffusion limit to account for the pull-down data on the hetertrimeric complex. Later on, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, they measure the affinity of Ded1 for a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in vitro with microscale thermophoresis as &lt;7nM (the limit of the instrument). This is consistent with the high affinity deduced from the thermodynamic model; however, it would be superior to employ Surface Plasmon Resonance to confirm that the heterotrimeric complex has a high off-rate, albeit much slower than the on-rate, in the manner required to unify their pull-down data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C-D</xref> (and later in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) with the other measurements of the Kd for the heterotrimeric complex. The important discrepancy between the different approaches used to establish the stability of the key heterotrimeric complex needs to be resolved.</p><p>In addition, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref> need to quantified and expressed as the averages of% input bound, calculated from replicate binding experiments.</p><p>It's interesting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> that an inactive eIF4A mutant can stimulate Ded1 unwinding; which is reversed by eIF4G, supporting their claim that Ded1 is the unwinding activity in Ded1/eIF4A complexes, but the increase in activity over Ded1 alone seen for the Ded1/eIF4A-mut combination is less than that observed with WT eIF4A. Presumably, they want to propose that eIF4A is allosterically stimulating Ded1 activity, and ATP binding to eIF4A enhances this effect without being required for it. But don't these results also argue that Ded1 is not the sole unwinding activity in the complex and that eIF4A also makes an important contribution to it, with Ded1 enhancing eIF4A activity? This latter possibility is also suggested by the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that the inhibitory effect of hippurstanol on the Ded1-eIF4A complex is much greater than on eIF4A alone.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that 4A can stimulate by ~5x the unwinding activity of a C-terminally truncated Ded1, but not that of an N-terminally truncated Ded1 protein. 4G has no effect on the former, which makes sense, but stimulates the latter even though 4G inhibits WT Ded1. They give an ad hoc explanation for these results about eIF4G increasing RNA binding, but it doesn't make sense because they acknowledge that eIF4G increases RNA binding by both WT Ded1 and the N-terminally truncated Ded1, yet has opposite effects on unwinding by these two Ded1 proteins.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, the pulldown of C-term truncated Ded1 with GST-eIF4A is barely observed, which is the positive control for the failure of the N-term truncated Ded1 to be pulled down with GST-eIF4A, again indicating an extremely weak interaction between these proteins in vitro. As above, quantification of replicate experiments is required to substantiate these results.</p><p>It should be examined whether overexpression of eIF4A does not suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype of the N-term truncation of Ded1. If so, this would provide needed evidence that the genetic suppression observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for ded1-TAM is dependent on Ded1-eIF4A interaction and thus a manifestation of the ability of eIF4A to enhance Ded1 function rather than acting in parallel to Ded1.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is not entirely convincing. It would improve the analysis to show by Western blotting that eIF4A is present in the deduced Ded1-eIF4A heterodimer, and that addition of additional eIF4A can eliminate all of the Ded1-Ded1 dimer and increase the amount of the Ded1-eIF4A heterodimer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>I recommend acceptance after minor edits.</p><p>This manuscript investigates functional and physical interactions of the yeast DEAD-box protein Ded1p with eIF4F complex components eIF4A and eIF4G. Using quantitative biochemical approaches the authors show that Ded1 and eIF4A interact with one another and simultaneously interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G. Utilizing a framework of binding and unwinding reactions with different protein combinations, they characterize thermodynamic stability of all three possible binary complexes as well as the ternary complex (eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p), and find that the ternary complex is the most stable species. They find that while all complexes are competent for unwinding, the ternary complex exhibits the highest unwinding activity. Importantly, the authors show that within the ternary complex, Ded1 is responsible for the bulk of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding/remodeling activity, while eIF4A and eIF4G are solely stimulatory. The authors suggest that Ded1 is an integral and dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. In addition, they identify the N-terminus of Ded1p as the region responsible for its interaction with eIF4A. Combined with their previous finding that the C-terminus of Ded1 makes interaction with eIF4G, this allows the authors to hypothesize about the overall structural organization of the ternary complex.</p><p>The paper establishes a previously missing functional and physical link between the two key DEAD-box proteins involved in translation initiation, Ded1 and eIF4A. It presents compelling evidence that Ded1p may be regarded as a dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. The latter is an important and potentially paradigm-shifting finding for the field of translation regulation as well as our understanding of the early events in translation initiation. The conventional view of translation initiation suggests that eIF4F is comprised of well-defined and stably associated components, and the same eIF4F complex acts on all mRNAs. The new evidence presented here shows that dynamic association of Ded1p with eIF4A and eIF4G can result in an array of complexes with variable properties, which paints a much more dynamic picture of early initiation events. Jankowsky and coworkers also show that, depending on their structure (i.e., 3'-tailed vs 5'-tailed duplex), RNA substrates bind different complexes with different affinities. This suggests that populations of mRNAs with different 5' UTR structures can be differentially expressed depending on the profile of prevalent eIF4F complexes. Importantly, they show that even relatively small changes in expression levels (~2-fold) of Ded1 or eIF4G can lead to drastic changes in the abundance of the binary and ternary complexes, and consequently to large effects on translation initiation efficiency.</p><p>This is a comprehensive study with well-designed experiments and thorough data analysis that is sure to be of interest to researchers in the field of translation regulation as well as the general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.

The data analysis is carried out by global modeling of a huge dataset using KinTek Explorer. The datasets are comprehensive and more than sufficient to make the modeling. In addition, key statements are tested directly by alternative methods which further strengthen the conclusions. This type of analysis is extremely challenging and innovative. The results provide a new insight into the function of helicases in eukaryotic translation and demonstrate the importance of the protein networks in shaping their functional activity.</italic></p><p> <italic>I have only one uncertainty concerning the statistical evaluation of data. In my opinion, correlations between the observed and calculated constants are only the first step in the assessment of the data fit and alone it is insufficient to judge the quality of the fit. Another key piece of fitting is the error analysis for the lower and upper bounds of the calculated values. This is not documented sufficiently. It would be important to provide the information about the σ value, Ch2 Threshold and provide a supplemental figure with the symmetry distributions (see page 66 of KinTek manual).</italic> </p><p>We have now included a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) to illustrate Χ<sup>2</sup> symmetry distributions for two cases, one where increase and decrease in the parameter (<italic>K<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) relative to the optimal value results in a poorer fit, and another where only a decrease of the parameter, but not an increase result in a poorer fit. We trust this figure sufficiently explains the 95% confidence intervals that we have listed for each parameter in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The symmetry distributions for each Χ<sup>2</sup> value are apparent in these tables from the respective lower and upper limit for each parameter relative to the optimal parameter.</p><p>For the visual assessment of the data fit, we feel that displaying the correlation between calculated and experimental values for the observed unwinding rate constants is the most intuitive way to visually inspect the quality of the datafit, along with respective plots for subgroups of data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). We favor this representation over plots for σ values for individual datasets because of the sheer number of the datasets used. Plots for σ values for individual datasets would, in our opinion, render a visual inspection of the model quality essentially impossible. Our plot, in contrast, allows a global assessment of the model quality</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>This study proposes that Ded1p is the primary unwinding helicase of the preinitiation complex and that eIF4A plays a rather minimal role in restructuring mRNA. If true, this would be a very important finding and transform our understanding of initiation in yeast. Nevertheless, while the in vitro data are convincing for the complexes studied, one does wonder if the in vitro reconstituted complex truly reflects what occurs in vivo and whether eIF4A unwinding activity is increased by an untested accessory factor (e.g. eIF4B in the presence of Dedp1). One possible set of experiments to test this would be to determine unwinding rates in yeast cytoplasmic extracts that have eIF4A and Ded1p mutants.</italic> </p><p> <italic>It is certainly possible that the function of eIF4G and eIF4B in promoting eIF4A unwinding activity is not conserved between yeast and humans. This raises a rather important point, which is that there now appears to be a rather significant difference between yeast and human eIF4A unwinding potential using purified components in vitro. Is it that the human eIF4G and eIF4B provide the necessary regulation of eIF4A activity, which the yeast homologs just can't accomplish (they are certainly quite different at the sequence level)? Or, is yeast eIF4A naturally a poor unwinding enzyme even in the presence of eIF4G and eIF4B and therefore requires Ded1p? The authors write the introduction as if the two systems can be viewed as the same mechanism, but this is increasingly becoming less likely. As it stands, the authors should rewrite their introduction to raise this fact. While I appreciate stating the link between eIF4A and disease (cancer), the function of yeast eIF4A may have nothing to do with how the human system is regulated.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the reference to the link between eIF4A and cancer. We have also carefully examined the remainder of the introduction for statements that could be understood as implicit or explicit suggestion that yeast and human eIF4A-eIF4G and associated factors could be viewed as using the same mechanism. In the current form, the introduction does not contain any such statements.</p><p>Since our work does not test the mammalian system we have been careful to avoid any suggestion to similarities or differences between mammalian and yeast translation initiation machineries, other than stating the undeniable sequence similarity between yeast and mammalian eIF4A, and between yeast Ded1p and mammalian DDX3.</p><p> <italic>Some specific points:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors provide pull-down data to test if eIF4G-DED1-eIF4A can form a trimeric complex. A limitation of this approach is that the amount of eIF4A pulled down with eIF4G or ded1 is extremely small. As a result, the interpretation that a trimeric complex is formed from this data is not convincing.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the pull-down data alone would not adequately permit to conclude the existence of a trimeric complex. For this reason we have stated that the data suggest that all three proteins can interact simultaneously. We feel that this statement adequately reflects the data. Most importantly, however, we provide several orthogonal lines of functional evidence that all three proteins can interact simultaneously.</p><p> <italic>In the absence of RNA, equilibrium dissociation constants are determined by microscale thermophoresis. Interestingly, this assay generates rather different data to that previously published for yeast proteins by the Lorsch lab (Mitchell et al. Mol. Cell. 2010 Sep 24;39(6):950-62; not cited). In the Lorsch study, eIF4A binds to an eIF4G-eIF4E complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is calculated to be &lt;30 nM. In the current study the apparent affinity of eIF4A to an eIF4G-eIF4E complex (the authors state that eIF4E is in all eIF4G complexes on in the Results section) with an apparent affinity of 500 nM. An order of magnitude difference in measured affinity seems rather large. Do the authors have any explanation for this? These kinds of discrepancies could seriously alter the proposed models of complex formation between components.</italic> </p><p>We are aware of the noted study that reported several dissociation rate constants for the eIF4A-eIF4G complex. We apologize for inadvertently omitting the reference, which is now included.</p><p>Before specifically addressing the reviewer's point, we emphasize that the values reported in this study, with the exception of the noted dissociation constant for eIF4A binding to the eIF4G-eIF4E complex, are in excellent agreement with our parameters. Given that the values in both studies were measured by fundamentally different approaches, the overall agreement speaks for the robustness of the protein system and for all of the used approaches.</p><p>Having said this, we do appreciate the difference between the dissociation constants for eIF4A binding to the eIF4G-eIF4E complex, which are an order of magnitude larger in our measurements than in the previous study. Given the agreement of the other values in both studies, we believe that the difference reflects a distinction between our functional approach (based on enzymatic activity) vs. the equilibrium binding used in the previous study. In the fluorescence-based equilibrium binding, proximity of eIF4A to eIF4G-eIF4E is measured. For our measurements, the complex resulting in eIF4A binding to eIF4G-eIF4E only shows an impact if it further interacts with Ded1p and thereby affects Ded1p's unwinding activity. It is possible that eIF4A can bind to eIF4G-eIF4E to form a complex that does not interact with Ded1p, and that this complex forms with higher affinity than seen in our data. If the binding and dissociation dynamics of this complex are fast compared to the timescale of our experiments, our model would be insensitive to such a complex. As with all models for reaction systems that contain multiple components, our framework contains only the minimally required stages to describe the observed data. Additional physical stages for components that do not directly participate in the reaction can never be ruled out. Thus, the noted discrepancy does not alter the proposed models of complex formation between components.</p><p> <italic>An equilibrium dissociation constant of Ded1p to an eIF4G-eIF4A complex is measured to be 7 nM. This doesn't seem to correspond to such a low amount of this complex obtained in the pull-down assay (In the absence of RNA and ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Wouldn't one expect a higher amount of protein retained in the pull-down assay with what must be a relatively slow off-rate (in the absence of ATP and RNA)? The explanation that this complex may not be long lived in the presence of ATP and RNA does not explain why these proteins are not retained on the pull-down in the absence of ATP and RNA. This could be tested by showing that the interaction of an ATPase dead mutant of eIF4A and Ded1p to eIF4G should be enhanced in cells.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the amounts of proteins retained in the pull-down experiments appear to not very well correspond to the dissociation constants determined later. However, pull-down assays are by their very nature not conducted under equilibrium conditions. As described in the Methods section, our pull-down assays involve several stringent washings steps, which had to be included to provide a clear signal to background ratio. Pull-down assays that include Ded1p had to be particularly stringently washed, to remove Ded1p that non-specifically adhered to the beads. We speculate that the high level of non-specific adherence is seen because Ded1p contains on both N- and C-termini regions of low complexity that are also very basic. In addition, surface immobilization of a component does affect binding behavior, by (a) affecting the degrees of freedom of the system, and (b) creating a microenvironment that might be unfavorable to binding. Given the considerations above, it is perhaps not surprising that the amount of complex retained on beads does not closely correspond to the apparent dissociation constants measured in solution. It is well established that pull-down experiments often reflect solution affinities poorly, especially for dynamic systems. We nevertheless decided to include the pull-down data to provide a qualitative visualization of the protein-protein interactions. However, we emphasize that we quantitatively examine the interactions with suitable functional solution methods.</p><p>With regard to the suggested experiment examining whether the interaction of an ATPase-dead mutant of eIF4A and Ded1p to eIF4G is enhanced in cells, we note that Ded1p is an essential protein and that a variant with inactivated ATPase activity is dominant negative in vivo (Hilliker et al., 2011). For this reason, the proposed experiment is not technically feasible.</p><p> <italic>It is briefly mentioned that eIF4E is also present in the unwinding assays to preserve eIF4G stability. Human eIF4E has been shown to promote duplex unwinding by eIF4A – have the authors tested this mechanism, or is this also a human specific function of eIF4E?</italic> </p><p>We have not explicitly tested the impact of eIF4E alone of eIF4A. However, we have examined the impact of eIF4G-eIF4E on eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). It is formally possible that the impact on eIF4A is in part due to eIF4E.</p><p> <italic>Human eIF4A has recently been shown to possess a very precise step size no matter what accessory protein(s) are bound to it – this required single molecule data to definitely prove (Science. 2015 Jun 26;348(6242):1486-8; not cited). Do the authors really feel that step size is going to change for yeast factors in the presence of accessory proteins compared with human factors? Since the bulk assays provided here can't monitor processivity this claim seems unsupported.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer refers to a study where processive duplex unwinding by mammalian eIF4A is reported in an optical tweezers setting. Ded1p does not make consecutive unwinding steps, and therefore step size or processivity are not instructive parameters. The strand separation step we are referring to describes the strand opening event by Ded1p, as defined in Putnam et al. (2015) and Yang et al., (2007). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> show that eIF4A and eIF4G-eIF4A impact the number of basepairs opened by Ded1p in this strand separation step, the time the opened strands are held apart, or both. The important take-home message from these data is that eIF4A and eIF4G-eIF4A affect the strand opening step by Ded1p in a subtle, yet notable fashion. This is what we state.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>This paper presents the novel findings that eIF4A, alone and together with eIF4G, allosterically modulates the rate and substrate preferences of RNA unwinding by helicase Ded1 in the context of complexes containing Ded1 and eIF4A, or all three proteins. They do an extensive set of unwinding assays with Ded1 and these other two proteins over a range of different protein, RNA, and ATP concentrations, allowing them to model a thermodynamic framework that generates functional affinity constants (K<sub>1/2</sub>values) for forming all of the different potential combinations of these 3 proteins with and without RNA and ATP. Based on these affinity constants and known information about cellular concentrations, they argue that the trimeric complex of Ded1/eIF4A/eIF4G is the predominant form in cells. This would change the way we think about Ded1 as functioning independently of eIF4F (4E/4G/4A) on a subset of mRNAs with highly structured 5'UTRs towards the view that it generally functions as a subunit within eIF4F and that its activity is modulated by eIF4F components. They also have evidence that eIF4A and eIF4G activities are likewise modulated by Ded1. In addition, they examine the effects of eIF4A and eIF4G on unwinding by Ded1 for substrates with 3' versus 5' overhangs, finding the greater stimulation for the former. And they measure unwinding activities for substrates of different duplex lengths from which they deduce different effects of eIF4A alone or together with eIF4G on unwinding by the trimeric complex.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Critical comments:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> provides evidence for Ded1-eIF4A interaction, and shows that addition of eIF4A increases the binding of eIF4G to Ded1, but it's very puzzling that less eIF4A binds to Ded1 in the presence of eIF4G than in its absence, directly at odds with later measurements of Kd values from the thermodynamic modeling – as if interaction between eIF4A and 4G competes with Ded1-eIF4A interaction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the increases in Ded1 and eIF4A interaction with eIF4G when all three components are present are quite modest, perhaps ~3-fold or less, whereas the thermodynamic modeling later in the paper predicts a 3-order of magnitude increase in affinity for the heterotrimeric complex compared to all 3 dimeric complexes. The authors suggest later in the paper that the Ded1 interaction with eIF4G/eIF4A will have a high off-rate owing to ATP hydrolysis; however, the affinities predicted by the thermodynamic model for the heterotrimeric complex are subnanomolar even in the absence of ATP and RNA-the conditions of the pull-down experiments. One wonders whether the on-rate would have to exceed the diffusion limit to account for the pull-down data on the hetertrimeric complex. Later on, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, they measure the affinity of Ded1 for a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in vitro with microscale thermophoresis as &lt;7nM (the limit of the instrument). This is consistent with the high affinity deduced from the thermodynamic model; however, it would be superior to employ Surface Plasmon Resonance to confirm that the heterotrimeric complex has a high off-rate, albeit much slower than the on-rate, in the manner required to unify their pull-down data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C-D</xref> (and later in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) with the other measurements of the Kd for the heterotrimeric complex. The important discrepancy between the different approaches used to establish the stability of the key heterotrimeric complex needs to be resolved.</italic> </p><p>As noted in response to a comment by reviewer 2, we agree with the notion that the amounts of proteins retained in the pull-down experiments do not correspond well to the dissociation constants in solution that are determined later in the manuscript. We refer to our response to this comment. We believe the stringent washings steps necessary to achieve a clear pull-down signal emphasize the off rate constants for respective components, which might differ from the trend in dissociation constants. A case in point is perhaps the traditionally weak signal seen in pull down experiments of yeast eIF4A by 4G (or vice versa), even though it is clear that both proteins interact with appreciable affinity. We included the pull-down data to qualitatively visualize protein-protein interactions.</p><p>The reviewer makes a keen observation regarding the association rate constants, given the sub-nanomolar dissociation constant and dissociation rate constants that would need to be invoked to account for the low pull-down efficiencies. A back of the envelope calculation using a conservative estimate for the diffusion limited second order association rate constant of k<sub>diff</sub> ~ 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup> (the limit is likely higher, which would result in greater dissociation rate constants and shorter half lives) and the obtained dissociation constant of Ded1p binding to eIF4A-eIF4G of <italic>K<sub>1/2</sub></italic>= 0.7 nM yields a dissociation rate constant of k<sub>off</sub> ~ 0.7 min<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponds to a half life of the complex of t<sub>1/2</sub> ~ 1 min. This half life is exceeded many times in the washing steps of the pull down experiments. We therefore believe that observations from the pull-down experiments are consistent with functional data.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer in that it would be desirable to measure rate constants for the trimeric complex by a direct method, such as SPR. We have in fact spent a significant amount of time (and money) on SPR experiments to accomplish this goal (before we submitted the manuscript). However, we were unable to identify a suitable chip for use with Ded1p. Inclusion of Ded1p was in all cases associated with a very strong background signal, presumably due to non-specific adherence of Ded1p to the chips. For this reason, we resorted to the use of MST, which is a solution method.</p><p> <italic>In addition, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref> need to quantified and expressed as the averages of% input bound, calculated from replicate binding experiments.</italic> </p><p>We have included the requested quantitative information in the figure captions.</p><p> <italic>It's interesting in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> that an inactive eIF4A mutant can stimulate Ded1 unwinding; which is reversed by eIF4G, supporting their claim that Ded1 is the unwinding activity in Ded1/eIF4A complexes, but the increase in activity over Ded1 alone seen for the Ded1/eIF4A-mut combination is less than that observed with WT eIF4A. Presumably, they want to propose that eIF4A is allosterically stimulating Ded1 activity, and ATP binding to eIF4A enhances this effect without being required for it. But don't these results also argue that Ded1 is not the sole unwinding activity in the complex and that eIF4A also makes an important contribution to it, with Ded1 enhancing eIF4A activity? This latter possibility is also suggested by the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that the inhibitory effect of hippurstanol on the Ded1-eIF4A complex is much greater than on eIF4A alone.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer notes, we are making the point that eIF4A affects the activity of Ded1p. The hippuristanol data also suggest that ATP and RNA binding by eIF4A (without eIF4G) have an impact. This is not surprising, since our observations suggest that eIF4A serves as loading adaptor for a Ded1p protomer, as we note in the discussion. As loading adaptor, eIF4A would bind the unapaired tail of the RNA substrate, and this binding is most likely influenced by the ability of eIF4A to bind ATP, RNA, or both. EIF4A would thus be sensitive to compounds that interfer with either or both of these activities. Yet, the unit responsible for the strand separation is still solely Ded1p. Of course, since Ded1p and eIF4A form a complex, they both ultimately contribute to the activity of the complex.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that 4A can stimulate by ~5x the unwinding activity of a C-terminally truncated Ded1, but not that of an N-terminally truncated Ded1 protein. 4G has no effect on the former, which makes sense, but stimulates the latter even though 4G inhibits WT Ded1. They give an ad hoc explanation for these results about eIF4G increasing RNA binding, but it doesn't make sense because they acknowledge that eIF4G increases RNA binding by both WT Ded1 and the N-terminally truncated Ded1, yet has opposite effects on unwinding by these two Ded1 proteins.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the ad hoc impression of our explanation for the seemingly opposite effects of eIF4G on the N-terminally truncated Ded1p and wtDed1p. The key to appreciate the differences lies in the superposition of several effects – altered RNA affinities and different unwinding activities for the complexes vs. the Ded1p variants without eIF4G. To visualize this point, we have included a schematic figure below, showing observed unwinding rate constants (with and without eIF4G as indicated), as a function of the Ded1p concentration, and the concentration where the reported experiments were conducted.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16408.025</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16408.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16408.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16408-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p> <italic>In Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, the pulldown of C-term truncated Ded1 with GST-eIF4A is barely observed, which is the positive control for the failure of the N-term truncated Ded1 to be pulled down with GST-eIF4A, again indicating an extremely weak interaction between these proteins in vitro.

Using quantitative biochemical approaches the authors show that Ded1 and eIF4A interact with one another and simultaneously interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G. Utilizing a framework of binding and unwinding reactions with different protein combinations, they characterize thermodynamic stability of all three possible binary complexes as well as the ternary complex (eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p), and find that the ternary complex is the most stable species. They find that while all complexes are competent for unwinding, the ternary complex exhibits the highest unwinding activity. Importantly, the authors show that within the ternary complex, Ded1 is responsible for the bulk of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding/remodeling activity, while eIF4A and eIF4G are solely stimulatory. The authors suggest that Ded1 is an integral and dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. In addition, they identify the N-terminus of Ded1p as the region responsible for its interaction with eIF4A. Combined with their previous finding that the C-terminus of Ded1 makes interaction with eIF4G, this allows the authors to hypothesize about the overall structural organization of the ternary complex.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The paper establishes a previously missing functional and physical link between the two key DEAD-box proteins involved in translation initiation, Ded1 and eIF4A. It presents compelling evidence that Ded1p may be regarded as a dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. The latter is an important and potentially paradigm-shifting finding for the field of translation regulation as well as our understanding of the early events in translation initiation. The conventional view of translation initiation suggests that eIF4F is comprised of well-defined and stably associated components, and the same eIF4F complex acts on all mRNAs. The new evidence presented here shows that dynamic association of Ded1p with eIF4A and eIF4G can result in an array of complexes with variable properties, which paints a much more dynamic picture of early initiation events. Jankowsky and coworkers also show that, depending on their structure (i.e., 3'-tailed vs 5'-tailed duplex), RNA substrates bind different complexes with different affinities. This suggests that populations of mRNAs with different 5' UTR structures can be differentially expressed depending on the profile of prevalent eIF4F complexes. Importantly, they show that even relatively small changes in expression levels (~2-fold) of Ded1 or eIF4G can lead to drastic changes in the abundance of the binary and ternary complexes, and consequently to large effects on translation initiation efficiency.</italic> </p><p> <italic>This is a comprehensive study with well-designed experiments and thorough data analysis that is sure to be of interest to researchers in the field of translation regulation as well as the general readership of eLife.

In addition, as described in response to reviewer #1, we have included a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) illustrating chi squared symmetry distributions. The Χ<sup>2</sup> values for each of the more than 100 calculated parameters are given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3) The representation of the framework of interactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is very confusing. I suggest the conventional way of showing reactions with double arrows, and making this panel one of the supplementary figures.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this point. We have tested many different ways to represent the framework, including the suggested double arrows. However, this does make the framework virtually impossible to assess by visual means. We finally settled on the shown representation, because this allowed us to include color bars for dissociation constants. This allows the inclined reader to visually assess differences in dissociation constants for the various complexes. For example, dissociation constants for RNA binding are grouped underneath each other, thus providing what we believe intuitive means to digest the complex data.</p><p>We also appreciate the suggestion to move the framework to a supplementary figure. However, since the framework is a pivotal aspect of our paper, we prefer to keep it in a main figure.</p><p> <italic>4) Using pie charts to show complex composition shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> doesn't seem ideal. It is confusing and contains redundant information. Is there any better way to present this? Perhaps a ternary plot?</italic> </p><p>Again, we appreciate this point. Here, as above, we have extensively experimented with different ways to visualize the data, including ternary plots. We decided against this representation, because we would need to track six distinct species, which would require as many ternary plots. Even then, the important points (presence of Ded1p in the complexes with 4A and 4G at physiological concentrations of the components, and presence of 4G in complexes with Ded1p at physiological concentrations of the components) are not readily apparent, possibly requiring another layer of graphics. We settled on the shown plots, because we felt those showed somewhat intuitively the prevalence of the complexes containing Ded1p as a function of the concentration of 4G and Ded1p.</p></body></sub-article></article>
