The L1 mRNA encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both essential for retrotransposition. ORF2p has reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities, while ORF1p is a homotrimeric RNA-binding protein with poorly understood function. Here, we show that condensation of ORF1p is critical for L1 retrotransposition. Using a combination of biochemical reconstitution and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions and trimer conformational dynamics together tune the properties of ORF1p assemblies to allow for efficient L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation in cells. Furthermore, we relate the dynamics of ORF1p assembly and RNP condensate material properties to the ability to complete the entire retrotransposon life-cycle. Mutations that prevented ORF1p condensation led to loss of retrotransposition activity, while orthogonal restoration of coiled-coil conformational flexibility rescued both condensation and retrotransposition. Based on these observations, we propose that dynamic ORF1p oligomerization on L1 RNA drives the formation of an L1 RNP condensate that is essential for retrotransposition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>condensates</kwd><kwd>LINE-1</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM132447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Liam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 CA240765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Liam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA9550-21-1-3503 0091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Liam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AG051449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeke</surname><given-names>Jef D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002374</institution-id><institution>The Vilcek Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vilcek MSTP Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sil</surname><given-names>Srinjoy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH Medical Scientist Research Service Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sil</surname><given-names>Srinjoy</given-names></name><name><surname>Ettefa</surname><given-names>Farida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH Medical Scientist Research Service Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM136573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sil</surname><given-names>Srinjoy</given-names></name><name><surname>Ettefa</surname><given-names>Farida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The LINE-1 retrotransposon protein, ORF1p, forms a condensate on RNA that is essential for retrotransposition, and may explain <italic>cis</italic>-preference through a co-translational assembly mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retrotransposons are genetic elements that replicate themselves within a host genome in a process known as retrotransposition by a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism that utilizes an RNA intermediate. The Long Interspersed Nuclear Element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) family of retrotransposons comprises 17% of the human genome by sequence and is the only autonomously active retrotransposon in the human genome, encoding proteins necessary for its own transposition. L1 also drives propagation of non-autonomous retrotransposons and processed pseudogenes, which make up an additional 21% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jurka, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dewannieux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kazazian and Moran, 2017</xref>).

These proteins are both necessary for retrotransposition and exhibit <italic>cis</italic> preference, a phenomenon in which they are more likely to mobilize the mRNA from which they were expressed than a co-expressed L1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). While the mechanism for <italic>cis</italic> preference remains unclear, a prevalent model is that ORF1p and ORF2p bind to the mRNA from which they were translated cotranslationally or immediately after translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boeke, 1997</xref>). The two proteins are translated non-stoichiometrically, with a large excess of ORF1p, and co-assemble with L1 mRNA to form the L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which is the functional unit of L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hohjoh and Singer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). ORF2p has at least two crucial enzymatic activities required for retrotransposition, the reverse transcriptase (RT) required to produce dsDNA from the RNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cost et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>) and the endonuclease (EN), which defines the target site in genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cost et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>). Once assembled, the L1 RNP must translocate to the nucleus where ORF2p uses its endonuclease activity to create a single-stranded nick in the DNA, and reverse transcribes the L1 mRNA into DNA. The ORF2p-encoded reverse transcriptase uses the free 3’-hydroxyl of the nicked DNA as a primer, directly synthesizing the L1 complementary DNA (cDNA) into the host genome in a mechanism called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cost et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mathias et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luan et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>ORF1p is a 40 kDa nucleic acid binding protein that assembles into a homotrimer, and has nucleic acid binding activity that is necessary for L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martin and Bushman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kulpa and Moran, 2005</xref>).

These biomolecular condensates demix from the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm and serve specific functions by selectively including proteins and nucleic acids based on their biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). The process by which these membraneless compartments form is known as biomolecular condensation. One mechanism of condensation is phase separation, a density transition in which the constituent molecules exceed a critical concentration and separate into two coexisting phases, one with a higher density of the molecules of interest and one that is relatively depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Flory, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huggins, 1942</xref>). An alternative mechanism of condensation is gelation or percolation, which is a networking transition in which a dispersed solution of monomers and oligomers (a sol) switches into a system-spanning network (a gel) when a concentration threshold known as the percolation threshold is exceeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broadbent and Hammersley, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harmon et al., 2017</xref>). Recent conceptual work has proposed that phase separation and percolation can be coupled in certain cases, such that phase separation drives the formation of a dense phase that then undergoes percolation as the molecular concentration in the dense phase exceeds the percolation threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). Phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP) allows for the formation of dense phases with viscoelastic material properties at higher concentrations while also driving oligomerization and the emergence of pre-percolation clusters in subsaturated solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harmon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). Importantly, whether these condensed phases behave more like viscous liquids or elastic solids depends on the timescales on which they are observed/perturbed and the densities and lifetimes of the molecular interactions that serve as physical crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshareedah et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alshareedah et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Across the numerous characterized phase-separating RNA-binding proteins, shared molecular features such as multivalency, intrinsically disordered domains, and structured RNA binding have been shown to be important for condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>). Given that ORF1p exhibits all three of these molecular features of phase-separating proteins, we hypothesized that ORF1p undergoes condensation to carry out its roles in L1 RNP formation and chaperoning of L1 machinery. Recent work has confirmed that purified ORF1p is able to form a liquid-like condensed phase <italic>in vitro</italic> and that a truncated protein containing only the NTR and CC is sufficient for condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Newton et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that ORF1p expressed from a full-length active L1 element rapidly forms cytoplasmic condensates in cells that exhibit <italic>cis</italic> preference. We found that structured and unstructured charged residues and coiled coil flexibility were all necessary for cellular condensation. Biochemical reconstitution experiments revealed that the material properties of the reconstituted ORF1p condensates and their response to differing protein-RNA stoichiometries predicted their propensity to assemble in cells. ORF1p condensation <italic>in vivo</italic> correlated with L1 retrotransposition activity: disruption of nucleic-acid binding motifs or a critical flexibility motif led to loss of condensation and abrogated retrotransposition, while orthogonal restoration of trimer dynamics rescued both condensation and retrotransposition. Together these results indicate that condensation is critical for L1 retrotransposition. We propose that the biochemical properties of ORF1p are tuned to efficiently nucleate L1 RNP condensates cotranslationally, while also allowing for dynamic interactions between fully assembled L1 RNPs and host proteins and nucleic acids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ORF1p forms punctate foci in live cells</title><p>Previous studies focusing on the ORF1 protein in mammalian cells and tissues have reported a variety of localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Doucet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rodić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mita et al., 2018</xref>). We used fluorescence microscopy to directly observe the behavior of the protein in live mammalian cells. We designed an inducible, active, endogenous-like L1 expression construct in which ORF1p was fused at its C-terminus to a HaloTag (ORF1-Halo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Los et al., 2008</xref>). We were then able to use the fluorescent Janelia Fluor HaloTag Ligands JF549 and JF646 (Halo-JF549 and Halo-JF646) to visualize ORF1p in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also used a reporter to assess the ability of this engineered construct and its variants to complete the full L1 retrotransposition cycle. We used the well-characterized GFP-AI retrotransposition in the 3’ UTR of our construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ostertag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">An et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mita et al., 2018</xref>). The GFP-AI cassette contains the EGFP coding sequence interrupted by the γ-globin intron. This intron is in the opposite orientation as the coding sequence and disrupts the GFP open reading frame. A CMV promoter and a thymidine kinase (TK) poly(A) signal flank the EGFP sequence, and the entire cassette is oriented antisense to the L1 sequence. When the L1 is transcribed, the γ-globin intron is removed by splicing, and successful retrotransposition of this spliced L1 mRNA construct allows for the subsequent expression of the uninterrupted EGFP coding sequence from a novel insertion site. This reporter enabled us to relate changes in ORF1p behavior upon mutation to the biological L1 retrotransposition function. Thus, we are able to directly relate the dynamics of ORF1p assembly to the ability to complete the entire retrotransposon life-cycle.</p><p>After 6 hr of L1 induction using the Tet-On system in HeLa cells, we noted the formation of bright, punctate, and highly uniform ORF1-Halo structures against a weaker background of diffuse ORF1-Halo signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These foci were absent without induction, appeared as early as three hours following induction with doxycycline, and increased in number, but not size, with induction times up to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The ORF1p assemblies also increased slightly in fluorescence intensity with increasing induction times, indicating that this process is not pure phase separation with a fixed saturation concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Flory, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huggins, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). The ORF1 puncta that we describe in live cells are similar in size and uniformity to ORF1p assemblies seen using immunofluorescence in unstressed embryonal carcinoma cell lines <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/Tctc+17ds">(</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>). Characterization of endogenous ORF1p in other cell lines has proven difficult due to the low L1 expression in somatic and non-transformed cells. Larger, stress-granule-like ORF1 condensates have been described in exogenous L1 expression systems and in cells that have been stressed with arsenite or thapsigargin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>). We observed similar stress-granule-like ORF1 condensates after inducing expression of our L1 construct for 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that these larger assemblies are a result of very high ORF1p expression levels, while the monodisperse puncta seen after 6 hr may be more representative of ORF1p behavior at physiological expression levels. Although the diffuse ORF1-Halo signal remained predominantly cytoplasmic, nuclear ORF1-Halo puncta began to appear at longer induction times. Nuclear ORF1-Halo puncta had similar morphology and fluorescence intensity but very different diffusion behavior compared to cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>): diffusivity was approximately 25 times higher for cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

This phenomenon is known as <italic>cis</italic> preference, but its molecular mechanism remains unclear. There is functional evidence for the <italic>cis</italic> preference of ORF1p, as expression of an intact L1 only minimally complemented the retrotransposition of a co-expressed marked L1 encoding an ORF1 with an RNA-binding deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>). Additionally, the L1s that were identified in cases of novel insertional mutagenesis were always derived from intact full-length L1s, suggesting that active L1s are far more likely to drive <italic>cis</italic> retrotransposition than they are to mobilize the much more abundant mutated or truncated L1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kazazian et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Woods-Samuels et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dombroski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holmes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Moran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boeke, 1997</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the ORF1p assemblies that we observed would form cotranslationally and stay separate, or conversely, could mix with each other, either directly through fusion events or indirectly through protein exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm.</p><p>To address this question, we simultaneously expressed two separate L1 elements differing only in the type of tag on the ORF1p (HaloTag or mNeonGreen2 (mNG2)) in the same cell. We used the Halo-JF549 to visualize ORF1-Halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, magenta) and identified cells with expression of both ORF1-Halo and ORF1-mNG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, green). We almost always found singly-labeled puncta and only rarely observed puncta that contained both ORF1-Halo and ORF1-mNG2 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). As a positive control for our computational analysis of colocalization, cells co-expressing ORF1-Halo and ORF1-mNG2 were stained with Halo-JF646 in addition to Halo-JF549 prior to fixation. Each ORF1-Halo puncta contains many ORF1-Halo proteins and, therefore, stochastic incorporation of the two HaloDyes should lead to strong colocalization of Halo ligand signals. Indeed, we found that the JF646 signal at JF549+ puncta was significantly higher than the JF646 signal at an equal number of randomly selected intracellular spots of the same radius (p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, the mNG2 signal at JF549+ spots was more similar to that of random intracellular spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, there was occasional mNG2 signal at JF549+ spots: 21% of JF549+ had detectable mNG2, compared to 56% with detectable JF646 signal (detection defined as an intensity three standard deviations above the median intensity of random spots, Materials and methods). These results suggested that ORF1p assemblies do not rapidly exchange protein with the surrounding cytoplasm or undergo frequent fusion events and are perhaps instead kinetically trapped in an assembled form cotranslationally. This observation is consistent with previous work on the functional <italic>cis</italic> preference of L1-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82991-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Co-expressed ORF1 puncta exhibit minimal mixing in live HeLa cells.</title><p>A representative movie of a HeLa cell co-expressing two L1s with ORF1 tagged with either HaloTag or mNeonGreen2 (mNG2) for 4 hr.

This finding indicated that the ORF1 puncta visualized after 6 hr of induced L1 expression likely represented L1 RNPs. The absence of RNA signal in some ORF1 puncta could reflect a propensity for ORF1 puncta to fail to incorporate their <italic>cis</italic> RNA or could indicate a technical limitation of RNA FISH to efficiently label RNA inside ORF1 assemblies; for example, it may be difficult for the FISH probes to penetrate the ORF1p condensate. In this way, we showed that ORF1p puncta undergo surprisingly minimal mixing in live cells and incorporate <italic>cis</italic> RNA, suggesting a role for rapid ORF1p assembly in the <italic>cis</italic>-preference of L1 RNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Purified ORF1p forms liquid-like droplets and co-condenses with RNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Next, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry to determine whether a minimal reconstituted system could form ORF1 condensates.

Decreasing protein concentration at a fixed salt concentration decreased the total condensed phase area but increased the protein partition coefficient. At 200 and 300 mM KCl, the range of protein concentrations tested spanned the phase boundary such that higher protein concentrations led to detectable condensate formation but lower protein concentrations did not.

We generated a 2 kb fluorescently labeled RNA corresponding to the 5’ of the L1 mRNA for use in <italic>in vitro</italic> condensation assays. We used this 2 kb fragment because it was difficult to consistently generate full-length L1 RNA by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. It has been estimated that an RNA that is fully coated by ORF1p could be bound by one ORF1p trimer every 75 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). The full-length 6-kb L1 mRNA would therefore require ~80 ORF1p trimers or 240 ORF1p molecules to fully cover the L1 mRNA, and our 2 kb RNA would require 30 trimers or 90 ORF1p molecules, resulting in a predicted ORF1p:RNA ratio of 90:1. We decided to explore the effects of a large range of RNA stoichiometries on ORF1p droplet formation at a fixed protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We noted that the ORF1p droplets became less spherical at 1,000:1 protein:RNA, with the dominant species appearing to be short chains of slowly fusing droplets. At 300:1 protein:RNA, the ORF1p condensed phase was primarily composed of a large network of branched fibrillar structures. These non-spherical structures that exist at higher relative RNA concentrations may reflect a combination of a change in the material properties of the droplets and the formation of new effective polymer interactions that lead to novel conformational restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keenen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Seim et al., 2022</xref>). The formation of these non-spherical structures at a protein:RNA stoichiometry lower than that predicted for a fully bound L1 RNA was surprising and appeared to be at odds with the diffusive ORF1 puncta observed in cells. However, our reconstitution approach mixed preformed ORF1p trimers with RNA, which is distinct from the cotranslational assembly process that is likely to occur in cells. The kinetics of these assembly processes are distinct and may lead to different architectures with differing resultant material properties. Additionally, the simple reconstituted system does not contain host factors [e.g. RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tauber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodier et al., 2012</xref>)], nor does it recapitulate the complex, crowded intracellular environment, which can have dramatic effects on biomolecular condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the limitations of our reconstitution approach, we showed that the physical properties of ORF1p condensates are strongly impacted by RNA abundance, with increasing RNA concentrations leading to the formation of non-spherical structures rather than droplets.</p><p>We wondered how RNA addition would affect the propensity of ORF1p to condense in buffers with increasing salt concentrations. To enable comparison of the properties of the RNA-containing droplets with those containing protein alone, we used a low RNA stoichiometry (3,000:1 protein:RNA). This stoichiometry maintains a liquid-like condensed phase, thereby facilitating characterization by standard biophysical methods. When we mixed RNA with ORF1p at this stoichiometry, the labeled RNA was robustly recruited to the ORF1p condensed phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Introduction of RNA into condensates at this stoichiometry did not strongly affect the total condensate area but did significantly decrease the protein partition coefficient compared to the corresponding condition without RNA, suggesting that RNA may compete with ORF1p protein-protein interactions for incorporation into condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Notably, we observed that the RNA partition coefficient increased with decreasing protein concentration and increasing salt concentration, indicating that more extensive protein condensation may limit RNA incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). With these experiments, we showed that ORF1p co-condenses with RNA, with RNA incorporation leading to decreased protein partitioning, and increased protein concentrations leading to decreased RNA partitioning. These findings suggest that the protein-RNA interactions that promote RNA incorporation into ORF1p condensates are in competition with protein-protein interactions that drive ORF1p partitioning.</p><p>Taken together with our observation of non-spherical condensates at higher effective RNA concentrations, we wondered whether the RNA was altering the physical properties of the droplets. To assess the physical properties of the condensed phase, we analyzed droplet fusion events in time-lapse movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshareedah et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The dynamics of liquid droplet fusion are influenced by the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid as well as the size of the droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eggers et al., 1999</xref>). We analyzed each fusion event over time by fitting an ellipse to the fusion intermediate at each timepoint and calculating its aspect ratio. In a liquid-like fusion event, the aspect ratio will decrease exponentially to 1, which corresponds to a spherical fusion product. Analysis of other reconstituted protein droplets have shown that such fusions can occur on the order of a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>). Droplets containing ORF1 protein alone exhibited slow fusion kinetics, requiring 3 min to reach a plateau of the aspect ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, the aspect ratio plateau was greater than 1, indicating that the fused droplets retained an ovoid shape. This could be explained by a high ratio of viscosity to surface tension, or could reflect a droplet maturation effect in which the droplets behave more like elastic solids rather than viscous liquids when observed over the course of minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jawerth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). All RNA-containing ORF1p condensates fused more slowly than protein-only condensates, but surprisingly this decrease was non-monotonic with increasing RNA concentration: the addition of 10,000:1 and 1,000:1 protein:RNA resulted in fusions that plateaued at high aspect ratios, while 3,000:1 RNA condensates were able to fuse to similar final aspect ratios as the ORF1p protein alone but took more time to reach the plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These experiments indicated that addition of RNA to the ORF1p condensed phase changes its viscosity and surface tension in a way that slows droplet fusion kinetics. Additionally, they suggested that physical properties of the ORF1p condensed phase may change depending on the ratio of ORF1p to RNA, an effect that has been observed in other protein-RNA condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, if cotranslational assembly drives L1 RNP assembly in cells, the physical properties of L1 condensates are likely to change during RNP assembly as ORF1p timers are sequentially added to the forming RNP, increasing the amount of ORF1p relative to the L1 RNA over time.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82991-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>ORF1p droplets exhibit slower fusion kinetics in the presence of RNA.</title><p>Movies of ORF1p condensates settling out of solution and coalescing in the presence of varying amounts of RNA (from left to right: no RNA, +10,000:1 RNA, +3,000:1 RNA, and +1,000:1 RNA). 10 µM protein and 150 mM KCl were used in all conditions.

The decreased condensation of the R261A mutant was unexpected, as we predicted that mutating a core RNA-binding residue would only affect condensation in the presence of RNA.

Both mutants robustly recruited the fluorescently labeled 2-kb L1 RNA into their condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). While the addition of RNA did not appreciably change the phase diagram of WT or K3A/K4A, the total area of R261A condensed phases increased with the addition of RNA, and co-condensation with RNA allowed R261A condensates to stably form at higher salt concentrations than protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additionally, the R261A condensed phases generally had higher RNA partition coefficients than WT or K3A/K4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), despite the protein’s reported deficiency in binding to structured RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>). The recruitment of RNA to R261A condensates indicates that other parts of ORF1p are able to bind RNA with a moderate affinity, with likely areas including the disordered NTR and the N-terminal half of the coiled coil that were not included in the ORF1p constructs that initially identified R261A as a mutant with loss of RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>). Enhanced condensation of R261A but not K3A/K4A with RNA addition suggests that the contributions of K3/K4 and R261 to ORF1 protein condensation are mechanistically distinct and that the partial rescue of R261A condensation with RNA is dependent on K3 and K4. Indeed, the protein partition coefficients in matched conditions decreased with the addition of RNA for WT and R261A but not K3A/K4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), providing evidence for N-terminal charge patch contributions to competing protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Overall, these experiments showed that ORF1p K3A/K4A and ORF1p R261A are able to co-condense with RNA and demonstrated that both K3/K4 and R261 contribute to distinct protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that drive ORF1p condensation.</p><p>Given the altered condensation properties of these ORF1p mutants <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next sought to characterize their condensation in mammalian cells. After expressing WT, K3A/K4A, and R261A ORF1p in the context of a full-length L1 element for 6 hours in HeLa cells, we observed a stark reduction in puncta formation of the ORF1p mutants compared to WT. ORF1p K3A/K4A formed infrequent assemblies that appeared much smaller and dimmer than WT foci, while R261A staining was diffuse without any indication of condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Quantification of the number puncta per cell confirmed the abrogation of bright puncta formation in both mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Flow cytometry experiments showed that ORF1p protein expression was similar across cells expressing the WT and mutant L1s, indicating that loss of puncta formation was likely due to defective assembly rather than decreased protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). These experiments revealed that ORF1p K3A/K4A and R261A are not able to form WT-like assemblies when expressed in the context of full-length L1 in live cells, which contrasted with their mild condensation deficiencies in reconstitution experiments.</p><p>We wondered whether the loss of the ability to form bright ORF1p foci would have effects on L1 retrotransposition activity. A major advantage of our system is that these tagged ORF1p proteins were expressed in the context of an active L1 element with the GFP-AI retrotransposition reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ostertag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">An et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mita et al., 2018</xref>), which we used to assess the ability of each mutant to complete the entire L1 life-cycle. Using a well-characterized retrotransposition paradigm that involves 72 hr of L1 expression, we found that our tagged WT element had readily detectable activity, undergoing retrotransposition in approximately 1% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>); this retrotransposition rate is consistent with previously reported rates for L1RP in similar constructs expressed in HeLa and HEK-293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ostertag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">An et al., 2011</xref>).

Insertions or deletions in this heptad repeat pattern have been shown to create local under- or overwinding of the supercoil that can affect coiled coil stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 1996</xref>). Previous studies characterizing the ORF1p coiled coil showed that the C-terminal half of the coiled coil is sufficient for trimerization <italic>in vitro</italic> and has a higher evolutionary conservation than the N-terminal half of the coiled coil, which was found to undergo transitions between alpha-helical and unwound states rather than maintaining the tight three-fold symmetry of the C-terminal coiled coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018</xref>).

We reasoned that there the ORF1p stammer motif could lead play a role in ORF1p condensation through two non-exclusive mechanisms: (1) the chemical properties of the stammer’s M, E, or L residues are necessary for condensation, or (2) the three-residue interruption in the heptad repeat pattern destabilizes the coiled coil leading to increased conformational dynamics that promote condensation. To test these hypothetical mechanisms, we generated two additional ORF1p mutants with orthogonal stammers, one with the stammer residues mutated to three alanines (StammerAAA) and one with the wild-type E92 restored in the tri-alanine stammer (StammerAEA). We chose to specifically investigate the role of E92 because it was shown to be the only stammer residue that is conserved across primate L1s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/3VlH">(Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018)</ext-link>.

Quantifying the average number of puncta per cell confirmed the StammerDel variant’s inability to form condensates and revealed that StammerAAA formed a similar number of puncta per cell as WT, while StammerAEA formed about half as many puncta as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We were surprised to find that restoring the wild-type E92 actually decreased ORF1p condensation; we note that E92 is adjacent to a methionine residue in all primate ORF1p sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/3VlH">Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018</ext-link>), suggesting that the precise chemical properties of the stammer amino acids are finely tuned for optimal coiled-coil behavior. Flow cytometry confirmed that ORF1p expression in all three stammer mutant constructs was similar to WT, making it unlikely that these differences in condensation were due to protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then assayed the retrotransposition of these constructs and found that, while StammerDel was inactive, StammerAAA and StammerAEA both had readily detectable retrotransposition activity (50% of WT activity for AAA and 20% for AEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The pattern of retrotransposition activity strikingly mirrored the relative levels of puncta formation, with StammerAAA exhibiting a greater rescue of retrotransposition activity than StammerAEA, although both had less activity than WT. These findings demonstrated that synthetic stammer insertions are capable of restoring ORF1p condensation and enable retrotransposition activity to an extent that corresponds to their relative ability to form cellular puncta. Together, these experiments suggest that efficient ORF1p condensate formation is crucial for L1 retrotransposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ORF1p variants that form puncta in cells exhibit specific changes in physical properties at increasing RNA stoichiometries <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We purified full-length StammerAAA and StammerAEA ORF1p proteins with the aim of identifying <italic>in vitro</italic> condensed-phase behaviors that distinguish ORF1p variants that form puncta in cells from those that do not. Both stammer mutants were purified using the same protocol as WT. Both mutants eluted from size exclusion chromatography as trimers, indicating correct folding and assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We were unable to purify native StammerDel ORF1p. Previous characterization of the stammer-deleted coiled coil alone required purification from inclusion bodies using denaturation followed by refolding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/3VlH">Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018</ext-link>); we felt that using denatured and refolded proteins in <italic>in vitro</italic> condensation assays would complicate interpretation of our results, therefore we did not characterize this protein. When we assayed the AAA and AEA stammer mutants for condensation in buffer with physiological pH and salt concentration, we found that they formed round droplets but had a reduced total condensed-phase area compared to WT and even R261A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, top). Adding very low concentrations of labeled 2-kb L1 RNA (10,000:1 RNA) at this protein concentration further reduced the condensate area of the stammer mutants, while the WT and R261A condensed phases were less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).

Both stammer mutants exhibited decreases in their limited condensed phase areas with the addition of very low concentrations of RNA (100,000:1–3,000:1 RNA), forming punctate condensates and irregular droplet fusion intermediates that contrasted with the spherical droplets that WT formed under these conditions. Additionally, the stammer mutants both formed branched fibrillar condensates at 1,000:1 RNA, while WT and R261A retained a morphology similar to chains of slowly fusing droplets at the same RNA concentration. Similar to the stammer mutants, the ORF1p K3A/K4A condensed phase also transitioned to a fibrillar morphology at 1,000:1 RNA, despite being unaffected by lower RNA concentrations, suggesting that the N-terminal lysine residues and the stammer properties both play a role in maintaining the dynamic polymer network interactions that are necessary for spherical ORF1p-RNA co-condensates. These findings showed that the ORF1p stammer mutants, which robustly condense in cells, exhibit attenuated <italic>in vitro</italic> condensate formation and altered condensed phase material properties compared to WT ORF1p and the basic motif mutants across a large range of RNA concentrations.</p><p>We then wondered whether the <italic>in vitro</italic> material properties of the stammer-mutant condensed phases, rather than their droplet areas and morphologies, are better predictors of their propensity to assemble into condensates in cells. We analyzed droplet fusion events for all mutants in the absence of RNA and in the presence of two low RNA concentrations, 10,000:1 and 3,000:1 RNA (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Notably, StammerAAA did not undergo a sufficient degree of condensation at either RNA concentration to evaluate fusion characteristics, and is therefore not included in this analysis. Measuring the aspect ratio of droplet fusion events over time showed that WT and StammerAEA exhibited faster fusion kinetics than the other mutants in the absence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>, left). We had difficulty detecting fusion events for StammerAEA without RNA. Given the extremely sharp reduction in aspect ratio over time for this mutant, this is likely because most fusions occur too rapidly in this condition to be detected at our imaging rate of once per minute. However, with the addition of a very low concentration of RNA (10,000:1 RNA), both WT and StammerAEA exhibited much slower fusion kinetics than they did in the absence of RNA, while the behavior of other mutants was largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>, middle). At a slightly higher RNA concentration (3,000:1 RNA), the fusion kinetics of all mutants were similar, with the exception of R261A, which fused more slowly than the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>, right).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82991-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Mutant ORF1p condensates exhibit differential changes in condensed phase material properties with the addition of RNA.</title><p>Movies of ORF1p condensates settling out of solution and coalescing either without RNA (top) or in the presence of 10,000:1 RNA (bottom).

We then divided each fusion event’s <italic>τ</italic> by its characteristic length <italic>ℓ</italic> to determine the ratio of the condensed phase’s viscosity to its surface tension (<italic>η∕γ</italic>), a value that is also known as its inverse capillary velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshareedah et al., 2021a</xref>). When we compared the inverse capillary velocity of WT ORF1p across the RNA conditions, we noted a non-monotonic effect. The WT inverse capillary velocity increased sharply with the addition of a very low concentration of RNA (10,000:1 RNA) and subsequently decreased at a slightly higher concentration of RNA (3,000:1 RNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left). K3A/K4A and R261A had markedly different responses to RNA addition. K3A/K4A showed no appreciable changes in inverse capillary velocity in response to RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle left). R261A, in contrast to both, did not exhibit a change in inverse capillary velocity at the lower RNA concentration but had a substantial increase at the higher RNA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle right). Significantly, StammerAEA showed a similar non-monotonic relationship between inverse capillary velocity and RNA stoichiometry as WT, exhibiting a steep increase at the lower RNA concentration and remaining stable at the higher RNA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right). Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that WT and StammerAEA ORF1p exhibit distinct non-monotonic changes in the inverse capillary velocity of their <italic>in vitro</italic> condensed phases in response to increasing RNA concentration, suggesting that differential condensed phase material properties in the presence of varied protein-RNA stoichiometries might be important for condensate formation in cells.</p><p>Since these droplet fusion experiments required micromolar concentrations of ORF1p in order to observe fusion events, we wondered if the differential effects of protein-RNA stoichiometry on the ORF1p variants could be observed at sub-micromolar protein concentrations. To that end, we assayed the condensation of ORF1p variants at high nanomolar concentrations, without RNA and in the presence of 10,000:1 or 3,000:1 RNA. Notably, all variants assayed formed punctate, sub-micron assemblies both in absence and presence of RNA, which appeared to be more consistent with the cellular ORF1 puncta than the previously observed droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We observed that the ORF1p variants exhibited a differential propensity to partition RNA into condensates at the two RNA stoichiometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We noted that WT, StammerAAA, and, to a lesser extent, StammerAEA have an attenuated partitioning of RNA into ORF1p condensates with increasing protein and RNA concentrations, while R261A more strongly partitions RNA into condensates with increases in both protein and RNA. While all variants formed protein condensates that strongly colocalized with RNA, R261A was the only variant that had lower colocalization at the higher RNA stoichiometry, which was likely due to the formation of RNA foci with protein content that was below our limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). Notably, the RNA partitioning behaviors across ORF1p variants paralleled the trends observed for the material properties of ORF1p-RNA condensates across protein-RNA stoichiometries, suggesting that the differential fusion properties across variants are due to differences in protein and RNA partitioning at the tested stoichiometries. Taken together, these findings suggest that the biochemical properties of ORF1p are finely-tuned to balance protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in a way that is critical for condensation of ORF1p in cells and downstream L1 retrotransposition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the established importance of RNP formation for L1 retrotransposition and the recent appreciation of the contribution of dynamic interactions to the function of RNA-binding proteins, we investigated how the properties of ORF1p assemblies contribute to L1 retrotransposition. Although ORF1p’s major role in retrotransposition is thought to involve the formation of an RNP with the L1 mRNA and ORF2p in the cytoplasm, the diversity of ORF1p mutations that abrogate retrotransposition suggests the possibility of additional roles, including mediating RNP interactions with host proteins and participation in the downstream steps of nuclear translocation, DNA search for integration sites, or reverse transcription and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kulpa and Moran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adney et al., 2019</xref>). Using a well-characterized L1 expression system and modifying it to allow for live-cell imaging of ORF1p is a significant first step towards relating the physical properties of higher order ORF1p assemblies to L1 function in cells. Expanding the use of this approach to investigate the role of ORF1p in cells and tissues with high endogenous L1 expression, including germline tissues and neoplastic tissues, will likely provide further insights into ORF1p interactions with host cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branciforte and Martin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rodić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ardeljan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>High spatiotemporal resolution imaging of ORF1p in live cells allowed us to investigate long-standing hypotheses regarding L1 RNP assembly. In particular, the ability of L1-encoded machinery to specifically drive retrotransposition of L1 mRNA while minimizing transposition of off-target substrates was hypothesized to occur through cotranslational binding of ORF1p and ORF2p to their encoding L1 mRNA in <italic>cis</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/aEmt">Boeke, 1997</ext-link>). This idea was substantiated with data demonstrating that two coexpressed L1 constructs exhibit only minimal <italic>trans</italic> complementation when one has a loss-of-function mutation in ORF1p or ORF2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>). Our work adds additional evidence supporting the <italic>cis</italic> preference model. The minimal mixing observed for co-expressed fluorescent ORF1p puncta suggests that the physical properties of these assemblies minimize fusion events and protein exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm, providing a biophysical mechanism for L1 <italic>cis</italic> preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). This type of kinetically arrested condensate has been described in simulations and has been proposed as a mechanism for the coexistence of many small condensates at low, endogenous concentrations, rather than the thermodynamic expectation that the condensates would coalesce into a single, large equilibrium-like assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ranganathan and Shakhnovich, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). A mechanism involving reversible co-condensation of ORF1p together with the L1 RNA from which it was translated would allow for <italic>cis</italic> substrate preference without sequence-specific RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kolosha and Martin, 2003</xref>). Recent work has provided cellular evidence that disrupting the spatiotemporal regulation of expression of an RNA-binding protein and the RNAs it condenses with can abrogate the formation of compositionally distinct condensates, emphasizing the importance of dynamical control of protein-RNA co-condensation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We propose that ORF1p condensation in cells occurs cotranslationally, creating a viscous condensate with the L1 mRNA. Since this condensation must occur with the L1 mRNA from which it was translated for successful propagation, it requires a protein that is exquisitely sensitive to very low concentrations of RNA, which we found to be a biochemical characteristic shared by the ORF1p variants that robustly formed punctate assemblies in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Cotranslational condensation of ORF1p with its <italic>cis</italic> RNA would also require initial low concentrations of protein to favor protein-protein assembly while limiting protein-RNA condensation to avoid incorporating non-template RNA molecules in the L1 RNP, which we found to be another shared feature of the ORF1p variants that underwent condensation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>-preferential L1 RNP assembly driven by dynamical control of ORF1p co-condensation with its source RNA is an attractive model due to the necessary spatiotemporal association between the L1 RNA and ORF1p during translation, but further work is required to understand how this type of cotranslational assembly would function on a mechanistic level. This proposed role of ORF1p condensation in L1 RNP assembly would further imply that L1s expressing ORF1p defective in condensation may exhibit increased <italic>trans</italic> mobilization of off-target RNAs. Data supporting this hypothesis has been reported for retrotransposition of the mammalian SINE <italic>Alu</italic>, which was observed to transpose twice as efficiently when driven by an L1 with ORF1p deleted rather than an intact L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dewannieux et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The behavior of ORF1p condensates in biochemical reconstitution experiments was distinct from the puncta properties observed in cells. In particular, the extensive droplet-like phase and the droplet fusion events seen in reconstituted ORF1p contrasted with the uniform punctate morphology and lack of mixing seen in cells. We found that reducing protein concentrations and titrating RNA concentrations allowed us to better approximate the punctate condensates seen in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). However, our reconstitution system did not fully recapitulate our observations in cells, in which WT ORF1p assembled but K3A/K4A and R261A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Our simple biochemical reconstitution experiments involve equilibrium mixing of protein and RNA, allowing for nucleation, growth, and fusion of condensates in the absence of additional perturbations. While we posit that the discrepancies we observe are due to a dynamical control mechanism in cells that is not reflected in our reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lin et al., 2023</xref>), there are many other buffer parameters and non-equilibrium processes in cells that could play a role in modifying ORF1p assembly kinetics, including macromolecular crowding, ATP hydrolysis, and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller and Keating, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carlson et al., 2020</xref>). Given this array of cellular parameters that may affect condensation of proteins in cells, we strove to ensure that we could characterize the behavior and properties of ORF1p assemblies in a cellular expression system that allowed us to simultaneously assess protein function. The ORF1 mutants in this study indicate that ORF1p condensation is critical for L1 retrotransposition. We are now poised to further leverage this system to more precisely elucidate the emergent properties conferred to L1 RNPs as a result of condensation and how they contribute to ORF1p’s essential roles in retrotransposition.</p><p>A recent study also described phase separation behavior of ORF1p in biochemical reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Newton et al., 2021</xref>). That study characterized the formation of an ORF1p condensed phase <italic>in vitro</italic> that is mediated by electrostatic interactions. The authors additionally demonstrated that a truncated ORF1p containing just the disordered NTR and coiled coil (residues 1–152; NTR-CC) is sufficient for condensation. This description of NTR-CC sufficiency for condensation in reconstitution experiments is in agreement with our characterization of R261A, which has greatly reduced structured RNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Khazina et al., 2011</xref>) but is still able to condense <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). We predict that both ORF1p R261A and the truncated NTR-CC protein undergo condensation <italic>in vitro</italic> through a mechanism similar to complex coacervation, which requires only unstructured charge-charge interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aumiller and Keating, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that the ORF1p RRM participates in protein-protein interactions that drive condensation in the absence of RNA, while the unstructured NTR plays a smaller role in protein-only condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the NTR charge patch allows for stark modulation of the physical properties of the condensate in response to low stoichiometries of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is critical for condensation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). The RRM has lesser contributions to the physical properties of ORF1p-RNA condensates but appears to downregulate the incorporation of RNA into the co-condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), and we find that the combination of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of both the NTR basic patch and the RRM drives the formation of a condensate that is highly sensitive to very low RNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Furthermore, the flexibility of the coiled coil that separates these two motifs appears to be critical to the roles of the NTR and RRM in condensation, since the StammerDel mutant that has a more rigid coiled coil (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/KWzSHy/3VlH">Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018</ext-link>) exhibits starkly reduced assembly in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). In this way, we propose that two distinctive basic motifs and a flexible coiled-coil scaffold allow ORF1p to undergo rapid, dynamically controlled condensation with <italic>cis</italic> RNA within the complex environment of the cell.</p><p>The L1 system characterized in this work employs a uniquely powerful combination of biochemical reconstitution, live-cell imaging, and functional phenotyping in cells. <italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution allows us to study the biophysical properties of condensates in a minimal and controllable system. We can use live-cell imaging to observe assembly in cells and identify factors and mutations that modulate condensate formation and behavior in the cellular milieu. A well-characterized retrotransposition assay enables us to correlate changes in cellular condensation with functional effects on the entire retrotransposon life-cycle. Further characterization of this system will reveal additional biophysical determinants of L1 retrotransposition, which will deepen our understanding of functional biomolecular condensation within the complex cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LINE-1 retinitis pigmentosa (L1RP;

Fusion movies were imaged immediately following plating of all conditions, with images taken every minute. The plate was imaged on an Andor Yokogawa CSU-X confocal spinning disc on a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with 488 and 640 nm lasers (Coherent) used to excite the labeled protein and RNA, respectively. Brightfield and fluorescence images were recorded using a Prime 95B scMOS camera (Photometrics) with a 100 x objective (Plan Apo 100 x DIC, Nikon, oil, NA = 1.45, part number = MRD01905, pixel size: 0.09 µm).</p><p>End-point assay images were loaded in FIJI, and each field of view (FOV) was segmented into two regions (condensed phase and background) based on the 488 protein fluorescence signal, with the condensed phase intensity needing to be at least 2 x background intensity. Using the Analyze Particles function with a minimum particle size of 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>, this segmented image was then used to calculate total condensed phase area, mean condensed phase protein intensity, and mean condensed phase RNA intensity, as well as protein partition coefficient and RNA partition coefficient by taking the ratio between the mean protein or RNA intensity in the condensed phase and the mean protein or RNA intensity in the background area. Total droplet area and protein and RNA partition coefficients were plotted using R, filtering out partition coefficient values for conditions with less than 1% of the field of view occupied by condensed phase. For the nanomolar protein concentration experiments, the minimum particle size was decreased to 0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>. For pairwise analyses between ORF1p variants or RNA stoichiometries, protein concentration-salt concentration conditions in which both variants/stoichiometries underwent measurable condensation were identified, and matched condensate values (total condensate area, protein/RNA partition coefficient) were compared using a paired two-tailed t test and plotted with lines connecting values from matched conditions. For colocalization, images underwent background subtraction, and the protein and RNA channels were analyzed for colocalization using the Coloc2 package in FIJI. Pearson’s R value derived from the correlation of pixel intensities between the two channels was used as the colocalization statistic.</p><p>Droplet fusion movies were loaded in FIJI and underwent 3D drift correction. Individual droplet fusion events were extracted from each movie, with the criteria that the fusion had to occur primarily within the focal plane and was not affected by a third droplet during the 15 min fusion duration. Each fusion movie underwent segmentation to isolate the condensed phase, as previously described, and then the Analyze Particles function was used to fit an ellipse to the fusing droplets in order to determine the aspect ratio and the major and minor axis lengths of an ellipse fit to the fusing droplets in each frame of the 15 min fusion. The aspect ratio vs. time plot for each fusion event was fit to a One Phase Decay non-linear fit in Prism 9 (GraphPad) with the constraints K&gt;0 and Plateau &gt;1, allowing for the extraction of values for fusion time constant <italic>τ</italic> from each fusion event. Only fits with R<sup>2</sup> values greater than 0.95 were used for analysis. Average aspect ratio vs. time plots for the fusions from each mutant-RNA condition were generated in Prism 9. In order to calculate the inverse capillary velocity, or the ratio of viscosity to surface tension (<italic>η∕γ</italic>), we used the equation <italic>τ ≈ (η∕γ) · ℓ</italic>, dividing the fusion time constant <italic>τ</italic> by geometric mean fusion length ℓ = |(ℓ<sub>major</sub>(t=0) − ℓ<sub>minor</sub>(t=0)) · ℓ<sub>minor</sub>(t=0)|<sup>1∕2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eggers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>). The inverse capillary velocity for each analyzed fusion event was then plotted per mutant per RNA condition and differences in the mean and distribution of values was compared across RNA conditions for each mutant using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>HeLa M2 cells [a gift from Gerald Schumann, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hampf and Gossen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weidenfeld et al., 2009</xref>)] were cultured in DMEM containing high glucose and sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, product number 10313–039) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini, product number 100–106), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, product number 25030–081), and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, product number 15-140-122) (complete medium).</p><p>For transfection, HeLa M2 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (Fisher Scientific, product number 50-202-137) on the day before transfection and were transfected with 1 µg of plasmid DNA per well using FuGENE-HD reagent (Promega, product number E2312) per manufacturer guidelines. HeLa M2 cells transfected with the L1 expression vector on a pCEP-puro episomal plasmid vector were selected and maintained in complete medium supplemented with 1 µg/mL puromycin dihydrochloride (MedChem Express, product number HY-B1743A); the supplemented media with puromycin was sterile filtered with a 0.22 µm filtration device (Worldwide Medical Products, product number 51101007) prior to use (complete puromycin media). Transfected HeLa M2 cells were considered ‘quasi-stable’ for experimental use after at least 10 days of culture in complete puromycin media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mita et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cells were regularly split in fresh medium upon reaching 80–90% confluency.

Prior to imaging, the cells were induced with 1 µg/mL doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich D9891) added to the conditioned media for the stated number of hours. The induced cells were then stained with 100 nM HaloTag Ligand JF549 (Promega, product number GA1111) and 500 nM SiR-DNA (Cytoskeleton, product number CY-SC007) in conditioned media per manufacturer instructions for 30–60 min. The cells were washed one time with DPBS (Fisher Scientific, product number 14-190-250) and fresh complete puromycin media was added to the cells for imaging.</p><p>Live cells were imaged on an Andor Yokogawa CSU-X confocal spinning disc on a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope equipped with a stage top incubation system (Tokai Hit and World Precision Instruments) to maintain a temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in the recirculated air. The Halo and SiR-DNA signals were obtained using 561 and 640 nm lasers (Coherent), respectively, and fluorescence images were captured using a Prime 95B scMOS camera (Photometrics) with a 60 x objective (CFI Apo 60 x, Nikon, oil, NA = 1.49, part number = MRD01691, pixel size: 0.13 µm). 10 µm Z stacks of Halo and SiR-DNA fluorescence were taken for puncta counting, with 1 µm steps between frames. For puncta tracking, Halo signal was acquired at 10 frames-per-second (fps) for 10 s and a matched SiR-DNA image was acquired to differentiate nuclear and cytoplasmic puncta.</p><p>All live-cell images were analyzed in FIJI. For puncta enumeration, Z stacks were projected using maximum intensity and cells were manually outlined using Halo signal and were saved to the ROI Manager. Puncta in the Z-projected image were then identified using the Find Maxima function with a Prominence value of 75 and the number of maxima located within each cellular ROI was recorded. Cells with extremely high expression levels were excluded due to the inability to correctly identify puncta using the fixed prominence value, and mitotic cells were excluded since the Z stack did not include their full volume. Cells with zero maxima were included. The mean and SEM of the puncta count per cell for each induction condition or mutant was determined in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft). The average and SEM of the puncta count per cell for each induction condition or mutant was determined across three biological replicates using Prism 9 (GraphPad) and was plotted. The puncta count per cell values were compared across conditions or mutants using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction where shown.</p><p>Puncta tracking was performed with the Mosaic suite of FIJI, using the following typical parameters: radius = 2, cutoff = 0, 20% of fluorescence intensity (Per/Abs), a link range of 1, and a maximum displacement of 5 px, assuming Brownian dynamics. Mean-square displacement (MSD) was then calculated for every 2D trajectory, selecting trajectories with more than 10 time points to reduce tracking error from particles moving in and out of the focal plane. We then fitted the time-averaged MSD of each selected trajectory with linear time dependence based on the first 10 time intervals (1 s): MSD(<italic>τ</italic>)<italic><sub>T</sub></italic>=4D<sub>eff</sub><italic>τ</italic>, where <italic>τ</italic> is the imaging time interval and D<sub>eff</sub> is the effective diffusion coefficient with the unit of <italic>µm</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>s</italic>, which ignores the effects of sub-diffusion and super-diffusion on individual tracks but allows for better comparison across different conditions. We used the median value of D<sub>eff</sub> among all trajectories within each field of view as a single data point and determined the mean and distribution of D<sub>eff</sub> values across all fields of view. This analysis was implemented in a Python software developed in our lab called GEMspa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shu et al., 2021</xref>). Image areas corresponding to nuclei which contained tracked particles were manually outlined and a mask was generated that contained only those areas. The mask was inverted to create a mask containing all non-nuclear tracks, and these masks were used to analyze nuclear tracks and cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) tracks separately. Particle intensities were calculated using the average pixel intensities for a 5x5 square around each particle’s x,y position and were averaged across the length of the trajectory to generate a particle intensity for each track.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ORF1 puncta colocalization assay, colocalization analysis, and fixed cell imaging</title><p>Quasi-stable HeLa M2 cells with the pLH2035 construct were transfected with pLH2060 in 6-well plates using Fugene-HD transfection reagent as previously described. The transfection mixture was replaced with complete puromycin media after 24 hr of incubation with the cells. The transfected cells were then seeded on non-coated glass-bottom 6-well plates (Cellvis, product number P6-1.5H-N) for 2 days. The cells were induced with doxycycline for 5 hr as previously described, and were subsequently stained with 100 nM Halo Ligand JF549 (Promega, product number GA1111) and 100 nM Halo Ligand JF646 (Promega, product number GA1121) for 1 hr in conditioned media containing doxycycline. The cells were then washed once with DPBS and were fixed in freshly diluted 4% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, product number HT5012) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently washed once with a PBS-Glycine solution (1 X PBS + 10 mM glycine + 0.02% sodium azide + 0.2% Triton X-100 [Thermo Fisher Scientific, product number BP151-500]) and twice with 1 X PBS. The cells were stained with 1 µM Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 62249) for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark and were subsequently stored in PBS at 4 °C in the dark until imaging. The fixed plates of cells were imaged on an Andor Yokogawa CSU-X confocal spinning disc on a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope at room temperature. The fluorescence signals were obtained using DAPI epifluorescence excitation and the 488, 561, and 640 nm lasers (Coherent), and images were captured using a Prime 95B scMOS camera (Photometrics) with a 100 x objective (Plan Apo 100 x DIC, Nikon, oil, NA = 1.45, part number = MRD01905, pixel size: 0.09 µm). 8 µm Z stacks of Halo and SiR-DNA fluorescence were taken for puncta counting, with 1 µm steps between frames.</p><p>The images were analyzed in 3D space using a custom python script. Briefly, JF549+ spot positions on the 3D images were detected with the Laplacian of Gaussian method using the python package scikit-image (skimage.feature.blob_log). This function returns spot positions in the x, y and z planes, as well as spot radii. Quality checking was performed manually and input parameters for this function were adjusted based on the background level of an image. Spot positions were assigned to individual cell ROIs that had been manually drawn in ImageJ based on their x and y positions and spots outside of ROIs were excluded from the analysis. The mean intensity signal over a circle with matching radius and (x, y) position at a single z-level for each spot detected was measured and recorded for each channel of the image (JF646 and mNG2). To randomize spots, a count of spots was obtained per ROI and an equivalent number of random positions were selected from the pixel coordinates of each ROI. Since the ROI was drawn in two dimensions, but the spot localizations were in 3D, the z-channel position for each randomly chosen 2D position within an ROI was selected uniformly from the distribution of z-channel positions for the detected spots. The random spot radii were chosen in a similar manner. The intensities at a given spot were normalized within each ROI by dividing the given channel intensities by the median channel intensity of the random spots in the same ROI. The distributions of JF646 and mNG2 normalized intensities at JF549+ spots versus random spots were compared by Mann-Whitney tests in Prism 9 (GraphPad). JF646 and mNG2 were considered detected at a spot if the normalized intensity in the given channel was greater than 1.1. This threshold value was chosen as the normalized intensity value three standard deviations above the median intensity of the random spots in both the mNG2 and JF646 channels; the threshold value of 1.1 corresponds to a greater than 99th percentile value for mNG2 and JF646 intensity at random spots.</p><p>For qualitative imaging of ORF1-Halo in fixed cells, quasi-stable HeLa cells with episomal inducible L1 expression constructs were seeded in triplicate in glass-bottom 96-well plates (Cellvis, product number P96-1.5H-N) in complete puromycin media containing 1 µg/mL doxycycline for 72 hr. Cells were then stained with 100 nM Halo Ligand JF549 for 30 min in conditioned media containing doxycycline and washed once with DPBS. The cells were fixed as described above, using 4% formalin with washes with PBS-Glycine solution and PBS. Cells were stained with 100 nM SiR-DNA (Cytoskeleton, product number CY-SC007) for 1 hr at room temperature and were stored in the dark at 4 °C until imaging.

The only additional consideration was to focus the analysis on cytoplasmic spots due to the high number of nuclear RNA spots (likely nascent transcripts) that we would not expect to localize to L1 RNPs. Spots were localized to either the cytoplasm or nucleus based on the nuclear signal. The mean intensity of the signal in the nuclear channel was determined for each spot. Then, a cutoff value for nuclear channel intensity was found to classify each spot as either nuclear or cytoplasmic using the average of 2 methods: k-means clustering (scikit-learn) and Otsu thresholding (skimage.filters.threshold_otsu). This calculation was performed separately for each ROI to account for cell-to-cell variation in nuclear channel signal. After classification, spots were displayed overlaid on the DAPI image to manually check that the classification was accurate. Detected spots classified as nuclear were removed from the analysis. When placing random spots, positions within the nucleus were avoided by using the predetermined thresholds: if a random position was chosen with corresponding nuclear signal greater than the threshold, then a new random position was chosen until an appropriate position was found. Spots were considered RNA-positive if the normalized RNA intensity exceeded 1.15. This threshold value was chosen based on normalized RNA intensities determined by spot-calling on the RNA channel of the colocalization images; the threshold value of 1.15 corresponds to the 3rd percentile of normalized RNA intensity for called RNA spots and the 89th percentile of normalized RNA intensity for random RNA spots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Retrotransposition assays and FACS</title><p>Retrotransposition assays were conducted as described previously using quasi-stable HeLa M2 cells maintaining a pCEP-puro L1RP element containing a GFP-AI cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mita et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, quasi-stable HeLa cells were seeded in three separate wells of a six-well plate (Fisher Scientific, product number 50-202-137) for each L1 construct using complete puromycin media with 1 µg/mL doxycycline. After 72 hours, the cells were washed once with DPBS and were stained with 1 µm Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, product number 62249) for 30 min at 37 °C.

A total of 25,000 cells per condition were analyzed for GFP and Hoechst signals, which were compensated before analysis. The cutoff of GFP+ cells was set according to cells cultured for 72 h in complete puromycin media without doxycycline, and the average percentage of GFP+ cells across all three technical replicate wells was reported as a single biological replicate for a given L1 construct. The average GFP+ rates across three biological replicates for each L1 construct were plotted in Prism 9 (GraphPad) and were compared using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation at eLife has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Based on your manuscript, the reviews and your responses, we invite you to submit a revised version incorporating the revisions as outlined in your response to the reviews plus the following comments. Please take these concerns seriously, as the revised manuscript will be evaluated by experts among our Reviewing Editors.</p><p>When preparing your revisions, please address the following points in addition to your revision plan:</p><p>The narrative strongly claims that ORF1p undergoes &quot;LLPS&quot;. This is a high bar to cross. What is the evidence to insist that the coexisting phases are in fact liquids? We presume you want to imply liquid to mean simple, Newtonian fluids. At a minimum, the prefix of &quot;LL&quot; must be dropped. &quot;PS&quot; is fine. However, the analysis focuses on RNA molecules influencing the material properties. You make a case for conversion to solids (an equilibrium phenomenon) but they also hint at a dynamical arrest behavior. Condensates are viscoelastic materials. The phase behavior is best described as a coupling of associative and segregative transitions. This is not the same as simple LLPS. And because of the complications of associative transitions, dynamical arrest of phase separation is a reality, especially with RNA molecules. The narrative unfortunately glosses over complexities in favor of a simple presentation, which becomes misleading. We agree that the in vitro reconstitutions are indeed incomplete. We would also offer that we do not know if arrested states are or can be processed by ATP dependent RNA binding proteins, i.e., helicases. The mutational work is interesting, but for now the material properties of the condensates are unresolved. Further, we do not know what material states are functionally relevant in cells. One should be careful with the term &quot;LLPS&quot; as soon as one sees a round object in diffraction limited microscopy. The internal organization of molecules will most certainly be inhomogeneous.</p><p>Therefore, please go beyond your current thinking about how you place condensates and condensation in the context of ORF1p functions. To help you, here are some recent papers that could aid in clarifying the nomenclature but also help in rethinking your experimental design and analysis.</p><p>- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2022.05.018</p><p>- https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821038116</p><p>- https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.474545v2.</p><p>The experiments go beyond what has been published before, including work from the Furano, Williams and Weichenrieder labs, and it might be useful to discuss what methodological advances have allowed for the new insights described here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82991.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>General Statement</p><p>The goal of this study was to further our understanding of the behavior and function of the L1 ORF1 protein using live-cell imaging for the first time. We subsequently assayed the properties of purified wild-type and mutant ORF1p in vitro in order to determine the biochemical properties of the protein that enable formation of the homogeneous punctate assemblies that wild-type ORF1p forms in cells. Initially, we found discrepancies between the in vitro and cellular experiments, where the K3A/K4A and R261A ORF1p mutants form droplets in vitro but do not efficiently form puncta in cells. Upon assaying an additional set of ORF1p mutants, however, we found that measuring the variation of the physical properties of wild-type and mutant ORF1p droplets across RNA concentrations demonstrates that a high ORF1p sensitivity to RNA in vitro correlates with more efficient puncta formation in cells. This result along with experiments demonstrating <italic>cis</italic> preference of ORF1p in live cells are consistent with a model in which newly translated ORF1 proteins rapidly assemble with each other and their <italic>cis</italic> L1 RNA to form a stable L1 RNP. Importantly, we also present evidence that formation of ORF1p assemblies correlates with L1 retrotransposition activity.</p><p>We note that while Newton et al. (2021) published similar in vitro ORF1p droplet data, we performed ORF1p biochemistry experiments at much lower protein concentrations and included RNA to better approximate the ORF1p-RNA interactions involved in RNP assembly in cells. We additionally correlated the properties of these in vitro droplets with ORF1p puncta formation in cells. We acknowledge that the lack of a clear correlation between in vitro droplet formation and cellular puncta formation suggests that the cellular puncta likely do not form by conventional liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and we are careful to suggest that the cellular puncta form through a kinetic and possibly cotranslational assembly or condensation mechanism rather than an equilibrium process like LLPS; this idea will be clarified in revisions to the main text. We also acknowledge that there are a number of loose ends that remain in need of further investigation, including a thorough analysis of nuclear ORF1p assemblies and a closer look at a hypothetical cotranslational ORF1p assembly mechanism. However, we believe that the work we have done in observing and analyzing the behavior of cellular ORF1p assemblies in live cells and correlating cellular behavior with retrotransposition activity and in vitro ORF1p droplet properties is a large step that merits publication before further characterization of specific aspects of cellular ORF1p.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>“On several occasions, the authors propose that ORF1p-HALO dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> is linked to its co-translational association with L1 RNA. However, they never show the presence of L1 RNAs in ORF1p-HALO puncta <italic>in vivo</italic>. To strengthen the conclusion that the puncta observed <italic>in vivo</italic> are L1 RNPs, the authors should add experiments showing the presence of L1 RNA in the cytoplasmic puncta (by RNA FISH) or that the puncta are dependent on the presence of L1 RNA (expressing ORF1p-HALO alone should not be sufficient for puncta formation). These experiments seem to be realistic in few weeks with the tools already available in the laboratory.”</p></disp-quote><p>Showing the presence of L1 RNA in the condensates would certainly be helpful to cement the connection between our live-cell puncta observations and the retrotransposon life-cycle. We plan to design FISH probes against the HaloTag sequence in order to specifically visualize our modified L1RP RNA and optimize a protocol for visualizing both ORF1-Halo and the synthetic L1RP RNA. The experiment will be done on HeLa cells expressing L1 for 6 hours. We disagree that expressing ORF1-Halo by itself would definitely be insufficient for puncta formation, as we do not have data that would help us predict how the length or sequence of the ORF1p-encoding RNA will affect puncta formation in live cells. Additionally, observing the loss of puncta formation in this experiment could also indicate that ORF2p is necessary for puncta formation in cells.</p><p>We successfully completed the FISH experiments and conclude that <italic>cis</italic> L1 reporter RNA is indeed present within ORF1p-Halo condensates.

Could the authors discuss this point?”</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we mention in the text that it is interesting that the decrease in droplet fusion rate is non-monotonic with the amount of RNA added, with the intermediate amount of RNA leading to faster droplet fusion (similar to WT) and the lower and higher amounts of RNA resulting in slower fusion events. The fusion events in the 1,000:1 and 10,000:1 conditions tend to arrest as partial fusion intermediates and hence have a high aspect ratio plateau. As described later in the manuscript, the fusion time of Newtonian droplets is proportional to the ratio of the fluid’s viscosity to its surface tension and is additionally proportional to the size of the droplets undergoing fusion (<italic>τ ≈ (η∕γ) · ℓ</italic>; Eggers, Lister, and Stone 1999; Brangwynne, Mitchison, and Hyman 2011). We propose that the addition of 2-kb RNA to the ORF1 protein both increases the viscosity and modulates surface tension of the generated phase. It appears that increased droplet viscosity is the dominant effect at the low RNA concentrations, which is the predicted effect for long RNA molecules (&gt;250 nt) based on simulated data (Tejedor et al. 2021). This accounts for the slow and incomplete fusions seen in the 10,000:1 condition. We posit that the faster fusion rates in the 3,000:1 condition is a result of increased surface tension of the droplets that is able to overcome the increase in droplet viscosity. At an even higher RNA concentration, it is likely that the accumulated negative charge of RNA on the surface of the droplets leads to decreased surface tension that subsequently leads to slow and incomplete fusions in the 1,000:1 condition. Increases in protein-nucleic acid stoichiometries that lead to increased surface tension at low nucleic acid concentrations and decreased surface tension at high nucleic acid concentrations with a fixed increase in viscosity have been described in in vitro studies using short peptides and DNA oligomers (Alshareedah, Thurston, and Banerjee 2021).</p><p>Interpretation of droplet fusion experiments was clarified in lines 328-331, 338-343, and 560-575.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>“(A) The functional relevance of condensate formation by IDR-containing proteins has been questioned (Martin, E. W. and A. S. Holehouse – 2020; Emerging Topics in Life Sciences 4: 307). These authors conclude their review as follows: &quot;In summary, IDRs are ubiquitous and play a wide range of functional roles across the full spectrum of biology, and in a large number (likely the majority) of cases their biological function has nothing to do with the ability to form large macroscopic liquid droplets. The notion that the presence of an IDR means a protein has evolved to phase separate is an inaccurate inference that has unfortunately been used to justify questionable lines of inquiry and questionable experimental design.&quot; And in terms of ORF1p this admonition is exemplified by the findings of Newton et al. (2021, Biophys J 120;2181) cited by the present authors. This study showed that phase separated condensates readily form by just the N-terminal 152 amino acids (NTD + coiled coil). As this region of ORF1p cannot bind NA, condensate formation is indifferent to RNA binding, an obviously critical function of ORF1p.”</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree that IDRs are ubiquitous and are in many cases affinity-tuning domains. As binding affinity is a key biochemical parameter, IDRs are likely generally crucial for biological function. important for biological function. In the case of ORF1p, a protein with no catalytic activity whose primary function is an RNA chaperone that acts in a unique cis-preferential manner, we argue that IDR-mediated condensation of ORF1p with RNA plays a significant role in the protein’s function. We agree that the sufficiency of the N-terminal 152 amino acids of ORF1p for droplet formation is intriguing because of its independence on RNA binding; this is why we pursued the study of full-length wild-type ORF1p and RNA-binding mutant ORF1p R261A in vitro, with and without RNA, and in cells. We do not agree that the fact that the N-terminal half of ORF1p can undergo phase separation without RNA binding indicates that phase separation is unimportant for ORF1p function, as we have shown that in vitro ORF1p condensate properties (e.g. inverse capillary velocity) change with the addition of RNA and that ORF1p R261A fails to form punctate assemblies in cells. Thus, the ability to form higher order assemblies in a simple reconstitution cannot predict assembly states in a complex intracellular environment. By analogy, kinases may phosphorylate targets in vitro, but there may be low to undetectable phosphorylation at steady-state <italic>in vivo</italic> due to the opposing action of phosphatases. This is why detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are crucial. We would argue that the Newton et al study is an interesting reductionist approach that provides structural insights, while our results indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> L1 RNP assemblies involve a more complex network of interactions, within which RNA-ORF1 interactions are crucial.</p><p>The similar but distinct roles of K3/K4 and R261 in our in vitro ORF1p condensation experiments have been clarified in lines 387-405 and Figure 3 Supp 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(B) Earlier studies (Ostertag et al. – 2000; NAR 28:1418) showed that sufficient retrotransposition events have occurred by 48 hours after introduction of an L1 retrotransposition reporter to be readily detectable by whole cell staining for the retrotransposition-generated reporter gene product. The 48-hour lag presumably reflects the time to accumulate sufficient L1RNPs or their retrotransposed products to be detectable. Does this mean that the puncta (Figure 1F) accumulating during the first 24 hours after introduction of their full-length L1 retrotransposition reporter (Figure 1C) are the L1RNPs generated by the reporter? If not, what are they? If they are L1RNPs, are they thought to be or expected to exhibit the properties of phase separated condensates or are such properties just a feature of disembodied ORF1p that the authors posit could form an active L1RNP? The Ostertag paper should be cited here given its relevance to this issue.”</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe that the puncta accumulating in the first 24 hours (and even in the first 6 hours) of expression of the full-length L1 reporter are the L1 RNPs generated by the reporter. We note that the expressed ORF1p localizes to discrete bright foci (dense phase) against a background of dim cytoplasmic background (dilute phase); this is a hallmark of condensation. We do not believe that these assemblies are liquid-like given their uniformity in size and the dearth of fusion events observed in live-cell imaging, which is particularly exemplified in the two-color <italic>cis</italic> preference experiments. However, the assemblies could still be liquids with low surface tension that do not undergo fusion (Alshareedah, Thurston, and Banerjee 2021), or they could be gel-like assemblies (Maharana et al. 2018). We posit that the liquid-like behavior of purified ORF1p in vitro may be representative of ORF1p behavior during L1 RNP assembly, but the assembled, diffusive foci we primarily observe do not readily undergo fusion events (Discussion paragraph 2). Notably, the addition of varying amounts of RNA to the in vitro ORF1p condensates also decreases their propensity to undergo fusion events, which is more similar to the behavior of the L1 RNPs in cells than the behavior of in vitro condensates with ORF1p alone (Discussion paragraph 3). To clarify the point about the timing of retrotransposition, we believe that a sufficient number of L1 RNPs for retrotransposition are likely generated in less than 24 hours but that other steps, including nuclear translocation, target site identification, successful TPRT, and accumulation of GFP from the newly integrated reporter, require the remainder of the 48 hours. We will incorporate these ideas and our expectations into the first section of the Results as well as the Discussion, and Ostertag et al. 2000 will be cited appropriately. Additionally, using RNA FISH to detect our modified L1RP RNA inside the ORF1p puncta as described previously will confirm that these assemblies that are formed after 6 hours are likely to be L1 RNPs.</p><p>We successfully completed the FISH experiments and conclude that <italic>cis</italic> L1 reporter RNA is indeed present within ORF1p-Halo condensates after only 6 hours of expression induction. The results of this experiment are in revised Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(C) Four of the IDRs in ORF1p harbor or are juxtaposed to phosphorylation sites essential for retrotransposition (their citation – Cook et al., 2015). As the authors expressed their purified proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is not phosphorylated and would not only be inactive for retrotransposition and given the structural effects of phosphorylation (e.g., Bah, A., et al.;2015; Nature, 510, 106) it would differ significantly from the structure of the active protein. As variables they introduce into ORF1p several not too subtle mutations particularly regarding the ORF1 coiled coil. They thereby aim to assess the role or particulars of ORF1p condensate formation for L1 retrotransposition. In their Abstract they state (p.1, l. 11) &quot;…we propose that ORF1p oligomerization on L1 RNA drives the formation of a dynamic L1 condensate that is essential for retrotransposition.&quot;”</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we are aware of Cook et al. (2015) and their data supporting the necessity of ORF1p phosphorylation by PDPKs for L1 retrotransposition in cells. As you point out, our purified ORF1 protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and is therefore not phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of ORF1p, particularly in the NTR (S18 and S27), may change the propensity of ORF1p to undergo condensation. However, phosphorylation in cells is a dynamic process that likely links ORF1p phosphorylation to host cell behavior, like cell cycle state and stress response. In Cook et al. (2015), the phosphomimetic mutants S18D and S27D largely rescued the retrotransposition deficits incurred by S18A and S27A mutations, respectively, but S18D and S27D notably still had reduced retrotransposition rates compared to wild-type ORF1p, with the double phosphomimetic mutant S18D/S27D having less than 50% of wild-type activity. As a result, we did not feel that characterizing a “fully phosphorylated” ORF1p in vitro would be inherently more representative of ORF1p condensation behavior, even though comparing the droplet formation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ORF1p in vitro could certainly be interesting. One phosphomimetic mutant (S27D) was studied in Newton et al. (2021), where they found that the mutant may have enhanced droplet formation compared to wild-type. It will be interesting to further explore phosphorylation in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“(D) Although the authors provide no direct experimental evidence for the above statement and whatever the authors mean by &quot;dynamic L1 condensate&quot; how does this conclusion materially differ from the conclusions published by Naufer et al., in 2016 (NAR; 44,281), which also was not cited by the authors. Naufer et al. used single molecule studies and highly purified ORF1p that had been expressed in insect cells (and thus was fully phosphorylated, Cook et al., 2015). They showed that oligomerization of nucleic acid (NA)-ORF1p complexes to a compacted stably bound polymer was positively correlated with retrotransposition. Both properties could be eliminated by coiled coil mutations that had no effect on biochemical assays of ORF1p activity – high affinity NA binding and NA chaperone activity. As both properties map to the carboxy terminal-half of ORF1p, the inactivating coiled coil mutations are an example of the numerous instances of strong epistasis exerted by amino acid substitutions in the coiled coil on the retrotransposition activity of ORF1p. In some cases epistasis is exerted at the single residue level (e.g., Martin,et al. – 2008, Nucleic Acids Res., 36, 5845; Furano, et al. – 2020, PLOS Genetics 16 e1008991.)</p><p>While the authors are apparently also not mindful of the PLOS Genetics paper examining the effect of a single inactivating coiled coil substitution at the level of microscopically observed condensates could have provided compelling evidence linking their formation and retrotransposition. On the other hand, lack of a condensate-based readout for single amino acid inactivating coiled coil mutations would question the validity of equating ORF1p condensates with retrotransposition competence.</p><p>(E) The afore mentioned Callahan et al. study (2012, NAR, 40, 813) in addition to producing results partly recapitulated in Figure 2 of the present paper, showed that ORF1p polymerization was mediated by interactions between the highly conserved RRM-containing region of ORF1p. This observation is consistent with previous studies showing RRM-mediated protein interactions of other proteins (Clery, et al. 2008, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 18, 290; Kielkopf, et al. Genes Dev., 18, 1513)”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, it was an oversight to miss citing Naufer et al. (2016), as our results are a logical extension of their findings that indicate that ORF1p function can be lost with alterations in ORF1p oligomerization kinetics on nucleic acids (NAs), even if NA binding affinity and NA chaperone activity is preserved. Our assertion in Figure 4 is that distinct alterations of the physical properties (inverse capillary velocity) of ORF1p condensates in response to changing RNA concentrations is predictive of both punctate assembly of ORF1p in cells and retrotransposition activity. Indeed, this conclusion is similar to that of Naufer et al., as ORF1p oligomerization kinetics likely dictate the physical properties of the resulting ORF1p-RNA condensates. Importantly, our work shows that changes in these ORF1p assembly properties that are measured in vitro result in changes in L1 RNP formation in cells as measured by live-cell confocal microscopy, which in turn correlate with retrotransposition rate. Callahan et al. (2012) similarly finds that full-length ORF1p is able to stabilize or “cage” mismatched duplex DNA at low protein concentrations but melt it at higher protein concentrations, while the predominantly monomeric RRM fragment of ORF1p melts the mismatched duplex DNA at low and high protein concentrations without exhibiting a caging effect, thus arguing that trimer or higher-order oligomer structure (rather than RRM properties alone) is critical for particular ORF1p-NA interaction characteristics that are necessary for retrotransposition. Our findings are in accordance with this conclusion, as we find that the physical properties of ORF1p-RNA condensates in vitro are altered by mutations in the NTR, CC, and RRM of ORF1p in ways that correlate with assembly formation in cells and retrotransposition. While Callahan et al. provides evidence that the RRM may be able to oligomerize without the coiled coil, the assertion is complicated by the retention of 3.5 heptads of the coiled coil in RRM construct, including two chloride ion-coordinating heptads and a canonical stabilizing salt bridge that likely contribute to oligomerization even in the absence of the remainder of the coiled coil (Khazina and Weichenrieder, 2018). Their observation that the transition from full-length ORF1p-mediated mismatched duplex DNA caging to DNA melting is dependent on ORF1p concentration rather than ORF1p:NA stoichiometry may reflect that this transition is dependent on ORF1p condensation, which occurs at a particular critical protein concentration and is independent of NA concentration (Alberti et al. 2019). Both Callahan et al. and Naufer et al. hypothesize that ORF1p-NA interaction properties may be able to drive cotranslational assembly of ORF1p on its <italic>cis</italic> RNA, thus allowing for <italic>cis</italic> preference; our work is in agreement with this notion and provides the first microscopy-based evidence of the <italic>cis</italic> preference of two species of ORF1p in L1 RNP assemblies that are co-expressed in the same cell.

This paper states that &quot;Additional biophysical characterizations suggest that L1ORF1p trimers form a semi-stable structure that can partially open up, indicating how trimers could form larger assemblies of L1ORF1p on LINE-1 RNA.&quot; However, the cited Khazina structural data ((PDB) entry (6FIA)) were derived from coiled coils that had been solubilized to monomers in guanidinium HCl from inclusion bodies (insoluble aggregates) that had accumulated during their synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>…a common condition for highly expressed proteins. Fully denatured ORF1p coiled coils such as these, which also lack the entire NTD are an in vitro artifact and never exist in &quot;nature&quot;. It is almost certain that ORF1p monomers trimerize while being synthesized on adjacent ribosomes (e.g., Bertolini et al.- 2021; Science 371: 57).

However, no data thus far has identified specific inter-trimer coiled-coil interactions that would drive polymerization. Newton et al. suggest that interactions between residues 47-53 and 132-152 are important for phase separation in vitro; these interactions may be affected by a decrease in coiled coil opening as a result of stammer deletion. Interactions between trimers are necessary for condensate formation, and therefore the observation of ORF1p puncta formation in cells (as in Figure 1F) would support the importance of inter-trimer interactions.

The K3/K4 and R261 variants don't form puncta and do not promote transposition, yet phase separate at a similar concentration in vitro. The stammer mutants phase separate less efficiently in vitro, yet form puncta and promote transposition.

To me, it suggests that the puncta observed in cells might not be formed through phase separation. Other mechanisms of puncta formation should be explored.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the simple process of phase separation we observe in vitro does not directly correlate with the behavior of the assemblies observed in cells. We also use the term condensation, not phase separation to describe the assembly of the cellular puncta. As you point out, the R261A mutant was a clear example that the formation of in vitro protein droplets in our assay (which was modeled to be more physiologic using relatively low protein concentrations and adding RNA) was not directly predictive of cellular assembly. For this reason, we analyzed the physical properties of the in vitro ORF1p droplets more closely and noted that the inverse capillary velocity of the in vitro condensed phases of the WT and mutant ORF1 proteins had varied responses to the addition of RNA (Figure 4E). The WT and StammerAEA ORF1 proteins, which both condense in cells, had a stark increase in inverse capillary velocity in response to low amounts of RNA (10,000:1 RNA) while K3A/K4A and R261A had no response and a gradual response, respectively. This pattern indicated to us that the physical properties of the in vitro ORF1p condensed phases, rather than the extent to which they formed droplets, correlate with the ability of ORF1p mutants to undergo assembly in cells. We agree that this discrepancy between in vitro and cellular assembly suggests that ORF1p assembly does not occur solely through an equilibrium demixing process like phase separation and likely involves a kinetic, possibly cotranslational, component that is difficult to model in vitro. This idea will be clarified and included in the Discussion section.</p><p>This comment is addressed in part with the revised Figure 4E and Figure 4 Supp 5, in which lower concentrations of ORF1 protein in vitro yielded punctate condensates that resemble those seen in cells expressing our L1 construct.

If authors have access to a microscope that can perform FRAP measurements, I would strongly suggest such an assay, where the individual cytoplasmic and nuclear ORF1p puncta can be examined for their material properties as a function of time (compare 6 hours post-induction and 72 hours post-induction).”</p></disp-quote><p>The cytoplasmic puncta are highly mobile at the 100-ms-timescale, and therefore it would be difficult to track their fluorescence recovery; however, it may be possible to get a small fraction of puncta that remain stationary enough to adequately assess for FRAP. Nuclear puncta might be possible to FRAP due to their lower effective diffusion, but they are barely above the defraction limit, making FRAP extremely difficult. Furthermore, they may not exhibit FRAP due to the markedly lower concentration of ORF1p in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm (as opposed to not exhibiting FRAP due to truly low protein exchange with the surrounding solution). Based on our <italic>cis</italic>-preference experiments, however, we would predict that the cytoplasmic ORF1p puncta would be unlikely to exhibit FRAP, since if they were rapidly exchanging protein, the puncta would start out single-colored but would eventually equilibrate to dual-colored due to stochastic incorporation of ORF1 proteins with either tag. Hence, our model is that protein-RNA condensation plays a role in assembly of L1 RNPs but that the RNPs do not remain liquid-like following assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>“2. Based on the fluorescent images, can the authors estimate what percent of the ORF1p protein is actually present in distinct condensates and how much is diffuse in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm? How does the outside (diffuse) concentration change upon increased expression or ORF1p? Is there any evidence of a saturation concentration?”</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the fluorescence intensities of ORF1 puncta at 6 and 24 hours of dox induction and found that there was only a slight increase in puncta intensity with the significantly increased protein expression (Figure 1, Supp 1B). However, there certainly are cells with almost undetectable diffuse ORF1p signal and a few ORF1 puncta as well as higher-expressing cells that have many puncta but high concentrations of diffuse ORF1p, which argues against a clear saturation concentration. Estimating the fraction of ORF1 protein in condensates vs diffuse would be difficult given the lack of robust and unbiased method for segmenting the dynamic ORF1 puncta against moderate-to-high levels of diffuse ORF1p fluorescence. Since we are not arguing that the assemblies in cells are forming via equilibrium phase separation, we do not feel that this complex fluorescence microscopy analysis would yield highly informative results, as we would predict that there is not a clear saturation concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“3. Does the ORF1-Halo and ORF1-mNG2 colocalization change at longer time-points where larger condensates are observed?”</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed the two species of ORF1p at longer time-points. While this would be a relatively simple experiment, we do not believe that the result would be informative since the shorter induction generates puncta that are similar to those seen by immunofluorescence of endogenous ORF1 foci in embryonal carcinoma cell lines, while the longer induction forms more stress-granule-like assemblies. Interpretation of experiments with longer induction times are also complicated by cells undergoing cell division, which is likely when L1 RNPs interact with chromatin and enter the nucleus; since the details of nuclear entry and RNP-chromatin interactions are not known, we do not have a clear expectation for how that process would affect colocalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“4. The authors often refer to the &quot;the total area of condensed phase&quot;. This parameter is not very useful, as it highly depends on the experimental condition. Instead, authors should determine the apparent saturation concentration for each studied mutant in the presence and absence of RNA at a relevant RNA concentration. This requires increasing the resolution at the protein concentration axis and an unbiased analysis pipeline.”</p></disp-quote><p>While this is a fair point, we do not believe that performing droplet assays with high protein concentration resolution with and without RNA across all five ORF1p variants would be an efficient use of revision time; we have clear evidence that the propensity of the ORF1p variants to form droplets does not prefectly correlate with cellular assembly and retrotranspition. Rather, the physical properties of the droplets predict <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. Therefore, determining saturation concentrations for each variant is not of great interest. We feel that it is more important to focus on revision experiments pertaining to the behavior of the cellular assemblies and the physical properties of the in vitro droplets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“5. It is shown that decreasing ORF1p protein concentration at a fixed salt concentration decreased the total condensed phase area but increased the protein partition coefficient. The DNA/RNA binding mutant R261A does not show this trend. Moreover, it is the only mutant that shows a change in the phase diagram upon the addition of RNA. One explanation is that there are nucleic acid contaminants present in the protein prep. In fact, the R261A mutant seems to also have a lower 260 nm peak relative to 280nm peak at the chromatogram. That the enrichment of the ORF-1p protein changes with increasing concentration strongly suggests that we are already looking at a multi-component system here, where the contaminant would be a second component. The authors do include an extra step in the purification protocol to reduce nucleic acid contamination. However, they could also run an ion-exchange chromatography to improve the purity. Alternatively, they could test if adding benzonase, RNAse or DNAse changes the phase diagram of the ORF1p alone.”</p></disp-quote><p>As you mention, we were cognizant of the possibility of nucleic acid contaminants from our protein preps interfering with our protein-RNA condensation experiments and attempted to maximize their removal with an extended RNase and benzonase treatment. In fact, we used far more extensive nuclease treatments than previous studies (see methods). We were reassured that the carryover nucleic acid was likely not interfering with our experiments when we observed stark changes in the droplet fusion behaviors of WT ORF1p condensates even with the lowest concentration of RNA (10,000:1 RNA; Figure 2E). The data shown in Figure 4, Supp 3A exemplifies the behavior of all of the mutants over a greater range of RNA concentrations; notably WT and R261A are both less sensitive to higher concentrations of RNA than the other mutants (in that neither undergo a transition to more fibrillar structures at 1,000:1 RNA), while K3A/K4A, which appears to have the highest nucleic acid carryover, is among the most sensitive to higher concentrations of RNA.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When preparing your revisions, please address the following points in addition to your revision plan:</p><p>The narrative strongly claims that ORF1p undergoes &quot;LLPS&quot;. This is a high bar to cross. What is the evidence to insist that the coexisting phases are in fact liquids? We presume you want to imply liquid to mean simple, Newtonian fluids. At a minimum, the prefix of &quot;LL&quot; must be dropped. &quot;PS&quot; is fine. However, the analysis focuses on RNA molecules influencing the material properties. You make a case for conversion to solids (an equilibrium phenomenon) but they also hint at a dynamical arrest behavior. Condensates are viscoelastic materials. The phase behavior is best described as a coupling of associative and segregative transitions. This is not the same as simple LLPS. And because of the complications of associative transitions, dynamical arrest of phase separation is a reality, especially with RNA molecules. The narrative unfortunately glosses over complexities in favor of a simple presentation, which becomes misleading. We agree that the in vitro reconstitutions are indeed incomplete. We would also offer that we do not know if arrested states are or can be processed by ATP dependent RNA binding proteins, i.e., helicases. The mutational work is interesting, but for now the material properties of the condensates are unresolved. Further, we do not know what material states are functionally relevant in cells. One should be careful with the term &quot;LLPS&quot; as soon as one sees a round object in diffraction limited microscopy. The internal organization of molecules will most certainly be inhomogeneous.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that the process underlying ORF1p condensation is not simple LLPS and have updated the manuscript throughout to be more rigorous with our language. These edits are extensive, but some major examples to highlight are found on lines 96-114, 168-171, and 633-643 of the updated manuscript. Additional biochemical characterization was performed at nanomolar protein concentrations to help bridge the gap between our cellular findings and <italic>in vitro</italic> condensation results (Figure 4E, Figure 4 Supp 5; lines 577-598). Additional analysis of the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments was performed and included to better support our interpretations of the roles of ORF1 mutations on condensate properties (Figure 2 Supp 2, Figure 3 Supp 2 and 3, Figure 4 Supp 3). RNA FISH against our L1 reporter RNA was performed with concurrent HaloTag labeling to confirm the presence of <italic>cis</italic> RNA in intracellular ORF1 puncta, with updated, more robust spot detection and quantitation methods used to detect ORF1p-RNA colocalization and assess for <italic>cis</italic> preference in ORF1p puncta (Figure 1F-G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
