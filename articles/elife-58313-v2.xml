Within the Z-line, actin and titin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres are cross-linked by α-actinin, which also binds to a number of other Z-line proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frank and Frey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knöll et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the Z-line is important for efficient force production and transmission of force both between sarcomeres and laterally from the Z-line to adjacent myofibrils, the sarcolemma, and the extracellular matrix. In addition to providing structural stability and maintaining the structural integrity of muscle during contraction, the Z-line plays an essential role in mechanotransduction by translating biomechanical stress into biochemical signals, important for the maintenance of muscle homeostasis and adaptation to altered mechanical load. In response to biomechanical stress, such as pressure or volume overload, the heart undergoes compensatory cardiac hypertrophy, allowing the heart to maintain its function in conditions of increased workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diwan and Dorn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kehat and Molkentin, 2010</xref>). However, sustained stress ultimately leads to maladaptive remodeling and transition to heart failure. Z-line proteins play important roles in the adaptation to increased biomechanical stress and mutations in many Z-line-associated proteins have been linked to cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frank and Frey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knöll et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Myopalladin (MYPN) is a 145 kDa striated muscle-specific sarcomeric protein belonging to a small family of actin-associated immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing proteins in the Z-line, comprising MYPN, palladin (PALLD), and myotilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otey et al., 2005</xref>). MYPN contains five Ig domains and is present in both the nucleus and the sarcomere, where it has a dual localization in the Z-line and the I-band. MYPN binds to various Z-line proteins in the heart, including α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), nebulette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), and the PDZ-LIM family members Cypher/ZASP, CLP36, ALP, and RIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Nandelstadh et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, it interacts with the transcriptional cofactor cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP/Ankrd1), which shuttles between the nucleus and the I-band, where it is linked to the titin N2A region, potentially implicating it in mechano-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). CARP is strongly induced under various conditions of stress (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ling et al., 2017</xref>) and has been reported to negatively regulate the expression of cardiac genes, such as <italic>Nppa</italic>, <italic>Myl2</italic>, and <italic>Tnnc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeyaseelan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, we recently demonstrated that MYPN, like its other family members, binds to filamentous actin (F-actin), preventing actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it binds to myocardin-related transcription factor A and B (MRTF-A and MRTF-B), which shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus in response to alterations in actin dynamics and act as cofactors for serum response factor (SRF), controlling its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The essential role of MYPN for normal cardiac function is supported by the identification of an increasing number of heterozygous mutations in the <italic>MYPN</italic> gene associated with various types of human cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagnall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duboscq-Bidot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>). The human phenotype could be partially recapitulated in animal models, including transgenic mice for the p.Y20C variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>), which has been correlated with DCM and HCM, as well as heterozygous knockin mice for the p.Q529X nonsense mutation associated with RCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>). However, the underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood and the functional role of MYPN in the heart has remained elusive. To provide further insights into the role of MYPN in the heart, we studied the cardiac phenotype of MYPN knockout (MKO) mice in which we recently characterized the skeletal muscle phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, we found that MKO mice develop mild cardiac dilation and progressive systolic dysfunction as well as show a maladaptive response to mechanical pressure overload by transaortic constriction (TAC), developing severe cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction, associated with increased fetal gene expression, more convoluted intercalated discs (ICDs), and altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Furthermore, in biochemical studies, we identified a novel direct interaction between MYPN and titin in the Z-line.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MYPN C-terminal region binds to the titin Ig domains Z4-Z5 in the Z-line</title><p>In a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using titin Ig domains Z4-Z5 in the titin Z-line region as a bait, we identified MYPN as an interaction partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with the longest clones starting at amino acid 814 (Acc. NM_032578.3). We subsequently narrowed down the interaction site to the MYPN C-terminal region from residue 935 to 1320, containing its three C-terminal Ig domains. The corresponding region in its homologue PALLD (Res. 794–1123; Acc. NM_001166108) likewise bound to titin. To confirm the interactions, we performed a microscale thermophoresis binding (MST) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seidel et al., 2013</xref>). Initially, NT-647-labeled titin Ig domain Z4-Z5 peptide was titrated with increasing concentrations of the MYPN C-terminal fragment as well as the homologous fragment of PALLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, due to protein aggregation at higher concentrations, it was not possible to exceed MYPN and PALLD concentrations of 20 and 30 μM, respectively, at which full binding saturation had not yet been completely reached. For that reason, the equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) could not be unequivocally determined, but were estimated to 7.2 ± 2.6 μM for MYPN and 6.1 ± 0.8 μM for PALLD. This experimental limitation was circumvented by generation of NT-647-labeled MYPN at dilutions in the lower nanomolar range and titration with increasing concentrations of the more stable titin Ig domain Z4-Z5 fragment. Under this experimental condition, full binding saturation was achieved and the K<sub>d</sub> was estimated to 2.8 ± 0.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This revealed that the C-terminal region of MYPN as well as the homologous PALLD region bind to the titin Ig domains Z4-Z5 with apparent affinities in the low micromolar range, comparable to other Z-line scaffold complexes (e.g. the interaction between titin Z-repeats and ACTN2), which have K<sub>d</sub> values between 100 nM and 4 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joseph et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Myopalladin (MYPN) directly binds to titin in the Z-line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showing binding of the C-terminal region of MYPN and its homologue palladin (PALLD) to the titin Ig domains Z4-Z5 (titin Ig Z4-Z5) in the Z-line.

Both WT and MKO mice showed increased left ventricular wall and septum thickness after TAC. However, while, as expected, WT mice developed compensatory concentric hypertrophy, MKO mice developed eccentric hypertrophy as indicated by a significantly reduced relative wall thickness, characterized by left ventricular dilation as well as reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction starting already from 1 week after TAC. Cardiac output was not affected, likely due to compensatory left ventricular dilation in MKO mice. As expected, the heart weight to body weight ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) was increased in both WT and MKO mice 4 weeks after TAC. However, due to reduced body weight of MKO mice, the heart weight to body weight ratio was significantly higher in MKO mice compared to WT mice, although the heart weight was similar in WT and MKO mice. Histological analyses performed 4 weeks after TAC showed severe left ventricular dilation of MKO mice, often associated with left atrial enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Additionally, increased interstitial and perivascular fibrosis was observed in MKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref><italic>, middle</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Measurements of CMC size on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-stained sections showed increased CMC size in both WT and MKO mice 4 weeks after TAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C, D</xref>). However, the CMC size was significantly smaller in MKO mice compared to WT mice both in SHAM- and TAC-operated mice, consistent with the results from the analysis of isolated CMCs from 4-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

At the ultrastructural level, MKO mice showed normal sarcomere organization, but a slightly increased ICD fold amplitude. This was associated with decreased myofibrillar isometric tension generation and increased resting tension at longer sarcomere lengths, while force kinetics and calcium sensitivity were unaffected. As MYPN is unlikely to affect the cross-bridge unitary force, the reduction in force generating capacity is likely due to structural reasons. Since the passive mechanical properties of myofibrils are mostly titin-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franssen and González Miqueo, 2016</xref>), we determined titin isoform expression and phosphorylation of known sites affecting stiffness, but did not find evidence of alterations in titin that could explain the increased stiffness.

In contrast, WT control mice exhibited compensatory cardiac hypertrophy without a major increase in the left ventricular internal dimension.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that MYPN indirectly binds to the titin N2A region in the I-band through its interaction with CARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). In the present study, we discovered that MYPN as well as PALLD directly bind to the titin Ig domains Z4-Z5 at the Z-line. Titin is the largest known protein and stretches from the Z-line to the M-band, acting as a molecular spring responsible for passive force in striated muscle and for keeping the thick filament centered during contraction (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauveau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Linke and Hamdani, 2014</xref>). Titin is essential for sarcomere assembly and organization and plays an important role in mechanosensing and force transmission at the Z-line. The direct as well as indirect binding of MYPN to titin, its dual localization in the sarcomere and the nucleus, and the maladaptive response of MKO mice to biomechanical stress point to a possible role of MYPN in mechano-dependent signaling. However, the function of MYPN in the nucleus is unknown and the exact mechanism by which MYPN would transmit biomechanical stress to the nucleus remains to be discovered. Although ultrastructural studies and immunostainings showed normal sarcomere structure, another, more likely, possibility is that MYPN plays mainly a structural role and that its absence weakens the Z-line, where it binds to α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), nebulette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bang et al., 2001</xref>), titin, and PDZ-LIM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Nandelstadh et al., 2009</xref>). In support of this, we recently found progressive Z-line widening with age and eccentric contraction-induced Z-line abnormalities after downhill running in MKO skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>), demonstrating the important role of MYPN for the maintenance of Z-line integrity in skeletal muscle during aging and exercise.</p><p>In our recent study of the skeletal muscle phenotype of MKO mice, we found that MKO mice have a reduced myofiber cross-sectional area in skeletal muscle and consequently show decreased isometric force and power output as a result of reduced SRF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>). The SRF pathway is regulated by actin dynamics as its activation is dependent on the nuclear translocation of its cofactor MRTF-A, which is sequestered in the cytosol through binding to globular actin and released upon actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olson and Nordheim, 2010</xref>). We demonstrated that MYPN binds and bundles F-actin as well as interacts with MRTF-A, thereby affecting actin dynamics and consequently the SRF pathway. In contrast to skeletal muscle, the SRF pathway does not appear to be affected in MKO heart as there was no downregulation of known SRF target genes, such as <italic>Nppa</italic>, <italic>Nppb</italic>, <italic>Acta1</italic>, <italic>Actc1</italic>, <italic>Myh6</italic>, <italic>Myh7</italic>, and <italic>Ankrd1</italic> (reported in the Harmonizome database; under ‘ENCODE Transcription Factor Targets’; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/gene_set/">https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/gene_set/</ext-link>). In fact, after TAC, <italic>Nppa</italic>, <italic>Nppb</italic>, <italic>Actc1</italic>, <italic>Myh7</italic>, and <italic>Ankrd1</italic>, which are markers of biomechanical stress, were significantly more upregulated in MKO mice compared to WT mice, consistent with the maladaptive response of MKO mice to TAC. Thus, the pathological response of MKO mice to TAC does not appear to be directly related to alterations in the SRF pathway.</p><p>Western blot analyses for the expression of MYPN-interacting proteins and activation of cardiac signaling pathways showed no differences between WT and MKO mice. However, analysis for ICD proteins showed increased SORBS2 protein levels in MKO mice both under basal conditions and after TAC as well as upregulation of desmoplakin in MKO mice 4 days after TAC. SORBS2 is an adaptor protein located at the adherens junction of the ICD and the Z-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ding et al., 2020</xref>), where it interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, including F-actin, α-actinin, and PALLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rönty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanger et al., 2010</xref>). SORBS2 has been reported to be upregulated in patients with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vigil-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>). Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated overexpression in mouse heart resulted in microtubule densification, T-tubule disorganization, defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, and cardiac systolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude and prolonged TTP and time to decay of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient were observed in isolated CMCs from SORBS2 overexpressing mice, similar to what we observed in MKO mice, suggesting that the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in MKO mice may be at least partly explained by the upregulation of SORBS2. Since both SORBS2 and MYPN are tightly associated with the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible that the upregulation of SORBS2 in MKO mice is related to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton due to the absence of MYPN. Furthermore, increased expression of ICD proteins and higher ICD fold amplitude are commonly associated with the pathology of DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ortega et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perriard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), so the upregulation of SORBS2 and desmoplakin may be related to the DCM phenotype of MKO mice.</p><p>Analysis of proteins involved in calcium homeostasis showed increased protein levels of CASQ2 28 days after TAC in both WT and MKO mice, while CASQ2 levels were reduced in MKO mice compared to WT mice 4 days after TAC. CASQ2 RNA levels were not significantly altered after TAC, suggesting that CASQ2 is regulated at the posttranslational level. Otherwise, there were no changes in the expression or phosphorylation of other calcium-related proteins. CASQ2 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein located in the lumen of the SR, where it acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer and an inhibitory modulator of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by regulation of RyR2 to prevent premature spontaneous SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during conditions of high SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chopra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knollmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2007</xref>). CASQ2 is a known interaction partner of CARP, although CARP has not been detected in the SR, but it was suggested that CASQ2 is present in the cytoplasm at low levels, allowing for the interaction to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Torrado et al., 2005</xref>). MYPN may thus be indirectly linked to CASQ2 through CARP. However, we consider it most likely that the downregulation of CASQ2 in MKO mice at the early stage after TAC is a secondary effect of the alterations due to MYPN ablation and SORBS2 upregulation. A reduction of CASQ2 levels in CMCs has been reported to result in reduced twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and duration as a result of decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> SR content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terentyev et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude and duration were reduced, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency and velocity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release were unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terentyev et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, CASQ2 deficiency or reduction in mouse had only minor effects on SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and contractile function under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chopra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knollmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2007</xref>). However, while diastolic SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak (Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency) was unaltered at basal levels, isoproterenol stimulation caused increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, making CASQ2-deficient mice more susceptible to stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Differences between acute (CMCs) and chronic CASQ2 reduction (knockout mice) may explain the different consequences of CASQ2 modulation in vitro and in vivo. The reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude and width as well as increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark TTP in CMCs from MKO mice 7 days after TAC are consistent with the published observations in CMCs with reduced CASQ2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terentyev et al., 2003</xref>), and may thus be explained by the reduced CASQ2 levels in MKO mice 4 days after TAC. On the other hand, the alterations under basal conditions, including prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient TTP and time to decay as well as increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark time to decay to levels comparable to those of WT mice after TAC are likely unrelated to CASQ2 as CASQ2 levels were unaltered under basal conditions. The same applies for the velocity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR, which was reduced both under basal conditions and after TAC. These changes may instead be related to the upregulation of SORBS2 as discussed above. Delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and reuptake are typical signs of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roe et al., 2015</xref>) and have been linked to slowed Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark kinetics due to reorganization of RyR2 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolstad et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, as these alterations happen before the manifestation of cardiac dysfunction in MKO mice, altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling likely contributes to the development of DCM in MKO mice.</p><p>Human heterozygous <italic>MYPN</italic> gene mutations have been associated with HCM, DCM, and RCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagnall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duboscq-Bidot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>) and their effect in vivo has been studied in two animal models: transgenic mice overexpressing the MYPN-Y20C variant (allele frequency of 9.34E-4; GnomAD v.2.2.1) linked to DCM and HCM in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>), and knockin mice carrying the MYPN-Q526X nonsense mutation, equivalent to the human MYPN-Q529X mutation associated with RCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huby et al., 2014</xref>). MYPN-Y20C transgenic mice developed HCM and severely disrupted ICDs, associated with impaired binding of MYPN to CARP, reduced CARP protein levels, and failure of MYPN-Y20C to translocate to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Purevjav et al., 2012</xref>). However, since MYPN-Y20C was overexpressed at high levels, the physiological significance of these findings is unclear. Heterozygous MYPN-Q529X knockin mice expressed a truncated 65 kDa peptide in the nucleus and developed RCM, characterized by diastolic dysfunction and interstitial and perivascular fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huby et al., 2014</xref>). This was associated with decreased protein levels of CARP as well as reduced phosphorylation levels of Erk1/2, Smad2, and Akt, while protein levels of nebulette, desmin, and MLP/Csrp3 were increased. In contrast, homozygous MYPN-Q526X knockin mice had barely detectable MYPN-Q526X levels as a result of nonsense-mediated mRNA instability and showed no discernable cardiac alterations, although the mice were not studied under conditions of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huby et al., 2014</xref>).

Since MKO mice show a relatively mild form of slowly progressive DCM under basal conditions and MYPN-Q526X knockin mice were only studied until 12 weeks of age, it is likely that the phenotype was missed and that homozygous MYPN-Q526X knockin mice, like MKO mice, would develop cardiac systolic dysfunction with age or in response to stress.</p><p>Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in MYPN have recently been identified in patients with nemaline myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyatake et al., 2017</xref>), cap myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lornage et al., 2017</xref>), and congenital myopathy with hanging big toe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merlini et al., 2019</xref>), some of which had mild cardiac involvement. Although no patient developed DCM, this is consistent with the relatively weak cardiac phenotype of MKO mice under basal conditions. The maladaptive response of MKO mice to pressure overload suggests that these patients may be more prone to develop cardiac disease in response to cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, etc. Thus, our results highlight the importance of periodic monitoring of heart function in these patients and the need to reduce cardiovascular risk factors by encouraging healthy life style choices and timely therapeutic management.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>MYPN, PALLD, and TTN cDNAs were isolated by PCR using available constructs or a human cDNA library as a template and cloned into pGADT7 AD (Takara Bio), pGBKT7 DNA-BD (Takara Bio), pET-3d (Merck Life Science), and pETM-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dümmler et al., 2005</xref>) vectors as well as a modified pLexA vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stenmark et al., 1995</xref>) using digestion cloning or the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests an essential role of myopalladin, which is a striated muscle-specific sarcomeric protein belonging to a small family of actin-associated Ig domain-containing proteins in the Z-line. Autosomal dominant mutations in MYPN are associated with various types of human cardiomyopathies suggesting a role in cardiac function yet the underlying mechanisms of how MYPN triggers maladaptation in the heart are unknown. The manuscript by Filomena and co-authors describes a novel interaction between titin and myopalladin in the Z-disc, and an interesting maladaptive response to cardiac pressure overload in myopalladin knockout (MKO) mice. The cardiac phenotypes of the MKO mice under basal and stress (pressure overload) conditions suggest that humans with loss-of-function myopalladin mutations may be prone to stress-induced cardiac disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. This manuscript would be strengthened by specific and mechanistic insight as to how MYPN triggers aberrant calcium cycling that appears to be secondary to worsening pathology associated with pressure overload.</p><p>2. Immunoblots (Figure 6) use both tubulin and GAPDH as loading controls and yet both of these differ significantly following TAC. Clearly, the loading controls are changing but it's not clear if this is a gel loading problem or an actual change in the levels of those proteins. Please reanalyse the Westerns in light of the loading controls. This is likely to significantly alter many of your current findings but there needs to be an adjustment made for protein loading.</p><p>3. The authors consistently suggest that CASQ2 is &quot;downregulated&quot; which is incorrect. The data show that in KO mice with TAC at 4W, CASQ2 is not statistically altered relative to the WT control. In fact, there is an upward trend. It may not be increased as much as the WT TAC, but it should not be considered downregulated. The response of CASQ2 to TAC is blunted but not downregulated. Please adjust the paper accordingly, which may change when data is reanalysed using the loading controls.</p><p>4. Pg. 6, lines 117-118: The micrograph in Figure 2C does not include good representations of (or any) intercalated discs, so it is impossible to evaluate the authors' statement that intercalated discs are not altered in the MKO.</p><p>5. In a cardiomyocyte, calcium levels probably never rise to a level that produces maximum force output and peak calcium concentration is only present for a fraction of the contractile cycle. Thus, the majority of the contraction takes place at submaximal calcium concentrations and inclusion of tension data for the MKO at submaximal calcium concentrations would be more informative. Is calcium sensitivity or cooperativity altered in the MKO mice?</p><p>6. The sample sizes (3-4) for the immunoblots to determine titin phosphorylation (Figure 3D) and LV of MKO mice following TAC (Figure 6B) are too low to be confident differences will be detected given the variability evident in some of the blots. Please increase N values or justify the small sample size.</p><p>7. Please re-evaluate the statistical analysis of the western blots in Figure 6B. Analysis of the source data provided for pAkt-Thr308/Akt-TAC 4D and CASQ2-TAC 4W indicates that WT and MKO are not significantly different by 2-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc test when all groups were considered or Student's t-test when just WT and MKO were compared.</p><p>8. Please elaborate in the Discussion on the significance of altered Akt phosphorylation in the MKO mice following TAC.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Myopalladin knockout mice develop cardiac dilation and show a maladaptive response to mechanical pressure overload&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated overexpression of SORBS2 in mouse heart has been shown cause microtubule densification, T-tubule disorganization, and defective Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, (Li et al., EBioMedicine 53, 102695, 2020), including reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude and prolonged time to peak and time to decay of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in isolated cardiomyocytes. Thus, the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in MKO mice may be at least partly explained by the upregulation of SORBS2. SORBS2 is a scaffolding protein located in the intercalated disc and the Z-line, where it interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, including F-actin, α-actinin and PALLD (Ronty et al., Exp Cell Res. 310, 88-98, 2005; Sanger et al., Cytoskeleton 67, 808-823, 2010). Thus, the upregulation of SORBS2 in MKO mice may be related to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton due to the absence of MYPN. The downregulation of CASQ2 is likely to be a secondary effect of the alterations due to MYPN ablation and SORBS2 upregulation and can explain the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude and width as well as increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark time to peak observed in MKO mice following 7 days of TAC. These considerations have been included in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Immunoblots (Figure 6) use both tubulin and GAPDH as loading controls and yet both of these differ significantly following TAC. Clearly, the loading controls are changing but it's not clear if this is a gel loading problem or an actual change in the levels of those proteins. Please reanalyse the Westerns in light of the loading controls. This is likely to significantly alter many of your current findings but there needs to be an adjustment made for protein loading.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the “SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis” section of the “Materials and methods” section in the manuscript, we did not normalize to GAPDH or tubulin since they were not constant after TAC as the reviewer correctly pointed out. Instead the normalization was performed based on total protein content as determined on UV-activated TGX Stain-Free gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). As described (Gilda and Gomes, Analytical Biochemistry 440, 186-188, 2013; Taylor et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 55, 217-226, 2013; Rivero-Gutiérrez et al., Analytical Biochemistry 467, 1-3, 2014), normalization to total protein content by stain-free staining is a superior method compared to normalization to housekeeping genes, which are not always constant as is the case for tubulin and GAPDH after TAC. The UV-activated TGX Stain-Free gels that were used for the Western blots for GAPDH and tubulin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. As it is evident, the GAPDH and tubulin stainings do not correctly reflect total loaded protein. In particular for the second gel, Western blot analysis using an antibody against pCAMKII, which was not modulated, better reflected total loaded protein than tubulin. To avoid confusion, we have removed GADPH and tubulin from Figure 6K and instead included actin, which does not change after TAC. Also, vinculin, which is a commonly used loading control, is constant before and after TAC.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58313-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors consistently suggest that CASQ2 is &quot;downregulated&quot; which is incorrect. The data show that in KO mice with TAC at 4W, CASQ2 is not statistically altered relative to the WT control. In fact, there is an upward trend. It may not be increased as much as the WT TAC, but it should not be considered downregulated. The response of CASQ2 to TAC is blunted but not downregulated. Please adjust the paper accordingly, which may change when data is reanalysed using the loading controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We repeated the CASQ blots with more replicates and found that CASQ2 is increased in both WT and MKO mice 4 weeks after TAC, while CASQ2 is significantly reduced in MKO mice compared to WT mice 4 days after TAC. Due to a 3- to 4-fold upregulation of CASQ2 4 weeks after TAC, this difference is not significant by 2-way ANOVA, but highly significant by Student’s t-test (p = 0.0017). Since CASQ2 is not significantly upregulated in WT mice 4 days after TAC, we have continued to use “downregulated” throughout the manuscript when referring to the 4-day time point.</p><p>The text has been modified accordingly.</p><p>“Western blot analyses for proteins involved in calcium handling revealed increased CASQ2 levels 4 weeks after TAC both in WT and MKO mice, but significantly reduced CASQ2 levels in MKO mice compared to WT mice 4 days after TAC (∼2.5-fold, p = 0.0017; Student’s t-test) (Figure 6K, N). Due to a 3- to 4-fold upregulation of CASQ2 4 weeks after TAC, the difference in CASQ2 expression between MKO and WT mice 4 days after TAC was not statistically significant by 2-way ANOVA (Figure 6N). At the transcript level, Casq2 was downregulated in WT mice 4 days after TAC, but not 4 weeks after TAC, while it was unchanged in MKO mice (Figure 6J).

We found no obvious changes in the intercalated disc in MKO mice either under basal conditions or 4 weeks after TAC.

SORBS2 was also significantly upregulated in MKO mice under basal conditions by Student’s t-test (∼1.6-fold, p = 0.0078), but as SORBS2 was nearly 4-fold induced after TAC in MKO mice the difference was not statistically significant by 2-way ANOVA. The SORBS2 interaction site in PALLD is located in a proline-rich region, not present in MYPN (Ronty et al., 2005). Correspondently, MYPN did not bind to SORBS2 in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In a cardiomyocyte, calcium levels probably never rise to a level that produces maximum force output and peak calcium concentration is only present for a fraction of the contractile cycle.

Is calcium sensitivity or cooperativity altered in the MKO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Results from calcium jump experiments at submaximal activation have now been included in Figure 3M.

We then tested several different pAkt-308 antibodies, but were unable to get a signal at the correct size in the heart with any of the antibodies. From the vendors, we were told that the pAkt-308 is more difficult to detect than pAkt-473, so it is likely that the expression is simply not high enough for detection in the heart. For this reason, we decided to exclude the Western blot for pAkt-308. Since pAkt was not altered we also didn’t include the Western blots for the downstream targets GSK3β and 4E-BP1, also because their phosphorylation levels were highly variability when we repeated the Western blots with additional samples, making it difficult to obtain conclusive results. Instead, we performed additional Western blots for components of the desmosome, adherens junction, and gap junction of the intercalated disc, which revealed upregulation of SORBS2 in MKO mice both under basal conditions and after TAC as well as upregulation of desmoplakin in MKO mice 4 days after TAC (Figure 6K, O, P).

As suggested, we have now measured intercalated disc (ICD) fold amplitude under basal conditions and following TAC. The details are described in the revised Materials and methods section. To our surprise, this revealed a ∼27% increase in ICD fold amplitude in MKO mice under basal conditions (see Figure 2I). Furthermore, after TAC MKO mice showed a ∼70% increase in ICD fold amplitude compared to WT mice, while no significant increase in ICD fold amplitude was observed in WT mice after TAC (see Figure 5G). According to this finding, we have modified the discussion, where we mention that increased ICD fold amplitude is frequently associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, we have modified the abstract and the schematic illustration of the phenotype of MKO mice in Figure 8.

The statistical analysis should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>To solve this issue, we involved a bioinformatician, Dr. Simone Serio, who performed a statistical review of the complete manuscript and has been included among the authors. We first determined whether ANOVA assumptions were met using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality within each group in the various analyses. In addition, we tested if residuals were normally distributed, because in some cases sample groups in the same experiment were significantly different from normality, while others were not. The equality of variance across groups was verified using Bartlett’s test, while the heteroscedasticity of residuals was determined using Spearman's rank correlation test. In cases where one or more of these tests failed, data were log-transformed to meet ANOVA assumptions. For the statistical analysis of echocardiographic parameters in WT and MKO mice (the between-subjects factor) before and after TAC (the within-subjects factor) in Figure 4A-H, a linear mixed model (LMM) was used.</p><p>We previously analyzed the SORBS2 and CASQ2 densitometry data by two-way ANOVA, but our statistical analysis showed that the ANOVA assumptions had been violated. Log-transformation of the data solved this issue after which two-way ANOVA was performed.

The isolated Student’s t-tests in the text have been removed and the figures have been modified with the corrected statistical analyses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
