Local convergence of such patterned activity as synaptic clusters on dendrites could help single neurons harness the potential of dendritic nonlinearities to decode neural activity patterns. We combined theory and simulations to assess the likelihood of whether projections from neural ensembles could converge onto synaptic clusters even in networks with random connectivity. Using rat hippocampal and cortical network statistics, we show that clustered convergence of axons from three to four different co-active ensembles is likely even in randomly connected networks, leading to representation of arbitrary input combinations in at least 10 target neurons in a 100,000 population. In the presence of larger ensembles, spatiotemporally ordered convergence of three to five axons from temporally ordered ensembles is also likely. These active clusters result in higher neuronal activation in the presence of strong dendritic nonlinearities and low background activity. We mathematically and computationally demonstrate a tight interplay between network connectivity, spatiotemporal scales of subcellular electrical and chemical mechanisms, dendritic nonlinearities, and uncorrelated background activity. We suggest that dendritic clustered and sequence computation is pervasive, but its expression as somatic selectivity requires confluence of physiology, background activity, and connectomics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic clusters</kwd><kwd>dendritic sequences</kwd><kwd>dendritic computation</kwd><kwd>noise</kwd><kwd>neural ensembles</kwd><kwd>dendritic nonlinearities</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005879</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somashekar</surname><given-names>Bhanu Priya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DAE Project Indentification Number- RTI4006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhalla</surname><given-names>Upinder Singh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In feedforward networks with random connectivity, connection motifs underlying the detection of short clusters and activity sequences are likely to converge on a subset of postsynaptic neurons purely by chance.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural activity patterns in the form of sequential activity or co-active ensembles reflect the structure of environmental and internal events across time, stimuli, and representations. For example, sequential auditory activity may signify predators, mates, or distress calls. How can combinations of active ensembles at an input layer be discriminated by downstream neurons?</p><p>Dendrites offer a repertoire of nonlinearities that could aid neurons in achieving such computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). Several of these mechanisms can be triggered by the local convergence of inputs onto dendritic segments. For example, clustered inputs may trigger dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasparini and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gasparini et al., 2004</xref>). They could trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>) and other biochemical signaling cascades. Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>spikes have been shown to enhance the mixing of sensory (whisker touch) and motor (whisker angle) features in the pyramidal neurons of layer 5 vibrissal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>). If local convergence of interesting inputs is a prerequisite for engaging such dendritic nonlinearities, a key question that remains is whether networks require specialized wiring rules to discriminate ensemble activity patterns, or whether such localized connectivity is likely to arise even with purely random connectivity.</p><p>There is considerable evidence for clustered synaptic activity in several brain regions, including the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gökçe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adoff et al., 2021</xref>), and motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study done in macaques showed that synaptic inputs on dendrites are spatially clustered by stimulus features such as orientation and color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ju et al., 2020</xref>). In the hippocampus, it has been shown that place cells receive more temporally co-active, clustered excitatory inputs within the place field of the soma than outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adoff et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the length scale of these clustered inputs is ~10 μm, similar to the scale of operation of local calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) on the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O’Hare et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Many salient events are ordered in time, giving rise to convergent inputs which are not just co-active, but ordered sequentially in space and time on the dendrite. This form of dendritic computation was predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rall, 1964</xref>. Branco and colleagues have shown that pyramidal neurons can discriminate spatiotemporal input patterns within 100 μm dendritic zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branco et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla, 2017</xref>, employed reaction-diffusion models of signaling molecules to show the emergence of sequence selectivity in small dendritic zones. It is therefore valuable to analyze the statistical constraints on connectivity and input activity that can lead to synaptic clustering and dendritic sequence discrimination.</p><p>Seminal analytical work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>, showed that dendrites can increase the memory capacity of neurons by ~23-fold by combining subsets of synaptic inputs nonlinearly. There has also been an attempt to estimate the likelihood of organization of clustered inputs using combinatorial approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scheuss, 2018</xref>). In the current study, we consider multiple different dimensions, including connection probability, ensemble activity, spatiotemporal scales, dendritic nonlinearities, and the role of uncorrelated noise to explore the conditions under which grouped and sequential dendritic computation may emerge from random connectivity. We show that convergent connectivity of features to three to five synapses are statistically likely to occur on short dendritic segments in feedforward networks of ~100,000 neurons with random connectivity. Further, these clusters may perform combinatorial input selection and sequence recognition at the dendritic level. These result in somatic selectivity under conditions of low network noise, high co-activity in upstream neurons, and strong dendritic nonlinearities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined the mapping of network functional groupings, such as ensembles of co-active neurons onto small, &lt;100 μm zones of synapses on neuronal dendrites. We derived approximate equations for convergence probabilities for a randomly connected feedforward network, examined the effect of noise, and then supported these estimates using connectivity-based simulations. Next, we tested the effect of noise on dendritic mechanisms for sequence selectivity using electrical and chemical models. Finally, we combined these constraints to examine the likely sequence lengths that may emerge in random networks.</p><p>We framed our analysis as a two-layer feedforward network in which the input layer is organized into several ensembles within which cells are co-active in the course of representing a stimulus or other neural processing (colored dots in the presynaptic population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). In addition to neurons representing ensemble activity, the input layer also contained neurons that represented background activity/noise, whose activity was uncorrelated with the stimulus (gray dots in the presynaptic population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The ‘output’ or ‘postsynaptic’ layer was where we looked for convergence of inputs. We examined the probability of projections from specific ensembles onto small local dendritic zones on a target neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, and C</xref>). Within this framework, we considered two cases: first, that projections are grouped within the target zone without any spatiotemporal order (<italic>grouped</italic> input). Second, that these projections are spatially ordered in the same sequence as the activity of successive ensembles (<italic>sequential</italic> input) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dendritic convergence of inputs from neural ensembles as groups and sequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ensemble activity for grouped (left) and sequential (right) activity patterns.

(<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of projection patterns of grouped (left) and sequential (right) connectivity patterns. There is no spatial organization of the grouped inputs, other than their convergence to a small target zone on the dendrite. Sequential inputs also converge to a small target zone, but connect to it in a manner such that the temporal ordering gets mapped spatially. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic of pre- and postsynaptic populations. The postsynaptic population receives connections from the presynaptic population through random connectivity. Colored dots in the presynaptic population represent ensembles, whereas gray dots represent neurons that are not part of ensembles, but may participate in background activity. Unfilled/filled dots in the presynaptic population represent neurons that are inactive/active respectively, within the temporal window of interest. The red dots in the postsynaptic population represent neurons that receive grouped/sequential connections from ensembles on their dendrites in addition to regular ensemble and background inputs, while gray dots represent those that do not receive such organized connections. Filled red dots represent neurons that receive all synaptic inputs constituting a group/sequence. Unfilled red dots are anatomically connected to a group/sequence, but some of their presynaptic neurons may be inactive in the considered time window. Filled gray dots are neurons that receive groups/sequences from background inputs either purely or in combination with some ensemble inputs, whereas unfilled gray dots represent neurons that do not receive grouped/sequential inputs. The population activity shown using filled neurons represents neurons that are active within the duration of a single occurrence of grouped/sequential activity.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100664-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The dendrite may engage different postsynaptic mechanisms at different spatiotemporal scales to mediate computation and plasticity among these inputs. We looked at three such classes of mechanisms: <italic>electrical</italic>, <italic>chemical,</italic> and <italic>calcium-induced calcium release (CICR</italic>). Electrical mechanisms operate at a spatial scale of 50–100 μm and work on a faster timescale of &lt;50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandalise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasparini and Magee, 2006</xref>). Chemical mechanisms work over behavioral timescales of a few seconds and ~10 μm range since they are limited by the diffusion of proteins within the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla, 2017</xref>). CICR is a mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from external sources triggers the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores thus amplifying cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This process typically operates on a length scale of ~10 μm and a timescale of ~100–1000 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou and Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>). It is mediated by the inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors present on the endoplasmic reticulum. The length scales of CICR and chemical computation for grouped inputs are consistent with what are typically referred to as ‘synaptic clusters’ in the field.</p><p>For our study we chose a total of six representative circuit configurations, considering hippocampal and cortical connectivity and firing statistics for each of the three above-mentioned dendritic integration mechanisms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We used these broad categories as representatives to explore possible regimes for grouped and sequence computation in feedforward networks with random connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Example network configurations and parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">p, Probability of connectivity</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">T<sub>pre</sub>, #neurons in the local network</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">R, Background input rate (Hz)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">D, Time window for each input (s), also corresponds to the timescale of ensemble activity</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Z, Zone length (for groups) (µm)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">S, Spacing between inputs (for sequences) (µm)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Δ,Delta,Available window for convergence of input (for sequences) (µm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hippo-chem</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.05</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">400,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.01</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hippo-CICR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.05</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">400,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.01</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hippo-elec</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.05</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">400,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.004</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortex-chem</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortex-CICR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortex-elec</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.004</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Grouped convergence of inputs</title><p>Clustered input is capable of eliciting stronger responses than the same inputs arriving in a dispersed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schiller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasparini and Magee, 2006</xref>).

The simulations checked for the occurrence of such groups on each neuron in the postsynaptic population simulated through random connectivity. The simulation estimates matched the analytic expressions.</p><p>To interpret these relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) we stipulate that pattern discrimination via dendritic grouped computation requires that at least one neuron in the downstream population receives convergent connections from all the M ensembles. Hence, if P<sub>cFMG</sub>&lt;1/T<sub>post</sub>, where T<sub>post</sub> = the total number of neurons in the postsynaptic population, such projections are unlikely to happen anywhere in the network. Conversely, if P<sub>cFMG</sub>~1, then all the neurons in the postsynaptic population receive similar grouped inputs, leading to very high redundancy in representation. A sparse population code would be ideal for this scenario with a few neurons receiving such convergent grouped inputs from each pattern of ensemble activity. With ensembles of 100 neurons in the presynaptic population, we find that in a downstream population of 100,000 neurons, fully mixed groups of three to four inputs are likely to occur in four out of the six network configurations we tested (hippo-elec, cortex-chem, cortex-CICR, cortex-elec) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since P<sub>aFMG</sub> is exponentially related to M, the probability of groups with greater number of inputs drops steeply as the number of ensembles increases. Large fully mixed groups of up to seven inputs are likely only in the cortex-electrical configuration which has higher connection probability and longer zone length. Thus, grouped convergence of three to four inputs from a specific neural activity pattern seems likely as well as potentially non-redundant, in most network configurations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>End-effects limit convergence zones for highly branched neurons</title><p>Neurons exhibit considerable diversity with respect to their morphologies.

Thus, almost all groups in Purkinje neurons would run into a branch point or terminal. For the case of electrical groups, this estimate would be scaled by a factor of 5 if we consider a zone length of 50 µm. However, it is important to note that these are very conservative estimates, as for clusters of four to five inputs, the number of synapses available within a zone are far greater (~100 synapses within 50 µm).</p><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Random connectivity supports stimulus-driven groups that mix information from different ensembles to varying extents</title><p>Since ensembles typically consist of more than one neuron which show correlated activity, this could lead to neurons receiving different combinations of ensemble inputs.

We chose R in the range of random background activity, ~0.1 Hz for CA3 pyramidal neurons and ~1 Hz for the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For chemical inputs we require strong, Ca-influx triggering bursts, which are likely to be rare.

Noise groups are more probable in the cortical configurations than hippocampal configurations owing to the higher rate of background activity.

A comparison of the probability of active stimulus-driven groups to the probability of any groups shows that the hippo-elec configuration is the best suited for grouped computation as it has the best ‘signal-to-noise’ ratio.

As the ensembles get larger, gap-fills become major contributors of false-positive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Gap-fills could play a dual role. Under low noise conditions, such as in the hippo-elec configuration, gap-fills could support sequence completion in the presence of partial input.

Low noise conditions seem more suitable to the computation as gap-fills and noise sequences are less likely.

In the next sections we examined this question in two steps. First, using chemical and electrical models, we tested the effect of ectopic inputs arriving on or nearby an ongoing sequence.

Ectopic inputs both within and outside the zone degraded selectivity. Selectivity was most strongly disrupted by ectopic inputs arriving at the distal end. Due to the high input impedance at the distal end, ectopic inputs arriving there were not just amplifying the inward sequence response, but were boosting responses to scrambled patterns as well.

Since our previous simulations indeed showed that ectopic inputs can affect sequence selectivity, we wanted to assess how selective neurons are for sequential activity occurring on a short segment of dendrite, in the midst of all the other activity that they receive, particularly in a network scenario. In the context of a randomly connected feedforward network, can neurons receiving <italic>perfect sequential connectivity from stimulus-driven neurons</italic> (PSCSD neurons) be distinguished from other neurons based on their selectivity for sequential inputs?

The abstract formulation made the analysis scalable for a network context. At each location on the dendrite, the local increase in activation was a function of two things: the baseline activation contributed by an input arriving at that location and the activation buildup due to sequential inputs (Methods). The sequential contribution was scaled nonlinearly using an exponent and passed through a shifted sigmoid that bounded the maximum local activation attained within a time step. Hence, sequential inputs that follow the S to S+Δ spacing rule resulted in large local activations.

This was because the total activation of background activity and other non-sequential inputs over the entire dendritic tree overwhelmed the small signal elicited by the occurrence of a sequence. Specifically, each neuron receives ~160 inputs from background activity over the duration of the sequence. In the presence of ensemble activity, it receives an additional ~200 inputs scattered over the dendritic arbor. Hence, a sequence of four inputs has a relatively small effect on this high baseline, even when it is scaled by strong nonlinearities at the local dendritic zone encompassing all the inputs in the sequence. We postulated that this problem can be alleviated when the neurons are in a balanced state, where the excitation is precisely balanced with inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia et al., 2019</xref>). A previous model for sequence selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla, 2017</xref>) included inhibition. To nullify the effect of background activity as a proxy for the EI balanced state, we subtracted the trial-averaged activation under conditions of background activity from the trial-averaged activation value seen when ensembles are stimulated in addition to the background activity. This improved the selectivity to the range 0.13–0.22 (mean = 0.17, std = 0.02).</p><p>As a comparison, we ran the same simulation for the cortex-CICR configuration with 4× denser connectivity and 10× higher background activity.

The goal of this was threefold: To show how these nonlinear operations emerge in a mechanistically detailed model, to show that they can coexist, and to show that they are separated in timescales. We implemented a Y-branched neuron model with additional electrical compartments for the dendritic spines (Methods). This model was closely based on a published detailed chemical-electrical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla, 2017</xref>). We stimulated this model with synaptic input corresponding to the three kinds of spatiotemporal patterns described in figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> (sequential synaptic activity triggering electrical sequence selectivity), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> (spatially grouped synaptic stimuli leading to local Ca4_CaM activation), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> (sequential bursts of synaptic activity triggering chemical sequence selectivity). We found that each of these mechanisms show nonlinear selectivity with respect to both synaptic spacing and synaptic weights. Further, these forms of selectivity coexist in the composite model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>), separated by the timescales of the stimulus patterns (~100 ms, ~1 s, and ~10 s, respectively). Thus, mixed signaling in active nonlinear dendrites yields selectivity of the same form as we explored in simpler individual models.

We used our analysis to obtain insights into this circuit. In this calculation, an input ensemble consists of mitral cells receiving input from a single class of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Each glomerulus is innervated by the apical tuft by ~70 mitral/tufted cells, of which about 20 are mitral cells which project to piriform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagayama et al., 2014</xref>). Since each ORN class projects to two glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>), ~40 mitral cells are co-activated upon activation of a specific receptor class, thus forming a structurally and functionally well-defined ensemble.

However, convergence over the CICR/chemical length scales of 10 μm is less probable (P<sub>cFMG</sub>~3.31*10<sup>–7</sup>, P<sub>cSDG</sub>~3.51*10<sup>–6</sup> for group size of 4). κ is considered to be L/Z for these calculations. Sequential convergence over spacing windows of 10 μm is even less likely (P<sub>cPOSS</sub>~4.19*10<sup>–8</sup>). Hence, PC neurons are likely to receive grouped projections from three to four different pairs of glomeruli (representing a single odor) onto individual dendritic branches even with random connectivity.

Nonlinear mixed selectivity, wherein a neuron’s activity is not a simple weighted linear combination of the different stimuli, has the potential to expand the dimensionality of neural representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>). Such high-dimensional representations are particularly helpful in tasks involving the mixing of multiple stimuli/variables because they enable simple downstream linear readout mechanisms to decode patterns.</p><p>How do neurons achieve mixed selectivity? A possible avenue is through dendritic nonlinearities. For example, work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>, in the vibrissal cortex has shown that mixed selectivity can arise from active dendritic integration in the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which show joint representation for sensorimotor variables. This is particularly useful in the context of adaptive sensing. Our study explores this possibility of whether dendritic computation could act as a mechanism for neurons to achieve mixed selectivity. We show that redundancy in input representation in the form of large presynaptic ensembles yields postsynaptic neurons showing different kinds of selectivity: including pure selectivity, partially mixed and fully mixed selectivity. In fact, it is far more likely to find neurons showing partially mixed selectivity than neurons showing pure/fully mixed selectivity. While such partial mixing makes it difficult to decode the occurrence of full patterns, they may still act as building blocks for neurons further downstream to aid in the decoding process.</p><p>We show that under conditions of low noise, random connectivity coupled with strong dendritic nonlinearities provides an excellent substrate for neurons to mix different sources of information. Stimulus-driven groups of three to five inputs are likely with ensembles of 100 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) in four of the six network configurations tested. This mixing occurs over short segments of dendrites, enabling each neuron to potentially mix multiple different combinations of three to five inputs. Since partially mixed groups are more likely than fully mixed groups, decoding the identity of patterns would require further processing based on the population response of all such neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effective pattern representation through dendritic computation needs more than structural and functional connectivity</title><p>A key prediction of our study is that structural and even functional connectivity are necessary but not sufficient conditions to achieve postsynaptic computation in clusters and sequences. Several additional factors influence the effective selectivity for clustered/sequential computation. Our analysis of the hippocampal and cortical configurations occurring over three spatiotemporal scales (electrical, CICR, and chemical) indicates that background activity plays a pivotal role in determining the ability of the network to extract useful information from activity patterns. Hence, we found that the hippocampal configurations are better suited for grouped as well as sequential computations, as compared to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis sets boundary conditions on likely postsynaptic mechanisms for dendritic cluster computations. Specifically, chemical computations occurring over timescales of several seconds are vulnerable to background inputs whose likelihood of hitting a synapse scales with the duration of the computation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). This effect is even more pronounced in the cortex due to its higher background activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). Hence, we posit that chemical timescales are less useful for ongoing activity-driven computation leading to changes in cell firing, and rather more useful from the context of plasticity. Chemical processes occurring over seconds to minutes can modulate synaptic weights locally within dendritic clusters, strengthening grouped inputs through cooperative plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, our analysis showed that electrical mechanisms worked well for grouped computations, but they were quite sensitive to ectopic inputs in the case of sequences. Further, some studies suggest that three to five inputs may be insufficient to trigger dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gasparini et al., 2004</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goetz et al., 2021</xref>, argue that a few very strong synapses can also trigger them. CICR operating on the timescales of ~100–1000 ms, on the other hand, could be a potential mechanism that could influence both computation and plasticity. Higher level of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> affects activity at the soma through dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>) and enhances dendrite-soma correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O’Hare et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to trigger downstream mechanisms that can modulate plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mateos-Aparicio, 2020</xref>). Hence, CICR is a promising candidate that could boost the impact of dendritic computations in a network context.</p><p>Sequence selectivity required low background activity and strong nonlinearities to amplify sequential inputs over other kinds of inputs at the dendritic level. Chemical mechanisms showed stronger selectivity than electrical mechanisms, and they were less prone to ectopic inputs arriving outside the zone of the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). However, despite using strong nonlinearities at the dendritic zone, neurons receiving perfect sequential connectivity (PSCSD) showed weak selectivity at the somatic level when we accounted for inputs arriving across the entire dendritic arbor. The sheer number of background or non-sequential ensemble inputs impinging on the dendritic arbor led to elevated baseline activation. This problem could be alleviated through precise EI balance. If the neurons exist in the state of precise EI balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia et al., 2019</xref>), inhibition could cancel out the effect of background activity thus amplifying the contribution of sequential inputs to the neuron’s activation.</p><p>Thus, strong nonlinearities, timescales of a few 100 ms, and low noise regimes are best suited for both grouped and sequence computations. Precise EI balance in the background inputs improves the conversion of dendritic sequence selectivity to somatic sequence selectivity.</p><p>Overall, our study provides a general framework for assessing when dendritic grouped or sequence computation can discriminate between different patterns of ensemble activations in a randomly connected feedforward network. Our approach may need further detailing to account for area-specific features of connectivity, synaptic weights, neuronal morphologies, dendritic branching patterns, and network architectures. Conversely, deviations from our theory may suggest where to look for additional factors that determine connectivity and neuronal selectivity. Our analysis touches lightly on the effects of inhibition and plasticity, though these too may contribute strongly to the outcome of clustered input. While connectivity is a necessary substrate for clustered dendritic computations, we show that factors such as background activity, length, and timescales of postsynaptic mechanisms, and dendritic nonlinearities can play a key role in enabling the network to tap into such computations. In addition, our analysis can guide the design of biologically inspired networks of neurons with dendrites for solving a variety of interesting problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chavlis and Poirazi, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asabuki and Fukai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asabuki et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The derivations for the equations have been included in the main text and in Appendix 1.

Here, p is the connection probability between the two layers. In each run connectivity is sampled for 4000 neurons. Hence, the connectivity to the dendrite was represented as a matrix of 4000 neurons × 20,000 inputs. As simulating connectivity and examining groups/sequences for the whole postsynaptic population in a serial manner was computationally time-consuming, we parallelized the process by breaking down the simulation into 100 runs consisting of 4000 postsynaptic neurons per run. This does not affect the results since the connectivity to each neuron is sampled independently, and the presynaptic activity was kept the same across different runs by initializing the same seed for generating it. However, since we wanted neurons with different connectivity, the seed for generating connectivity was changed in each run. Hence, we sampled connectivity for a total of 400,000 postsynaptic neurons in all simulations except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where we sampled 1,000,000 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generating presynaptic activity</title><p>The first N*M neurons in the presynaptic population represented the activity of M ensembles consisting of N neurons each.

However, it was simulated over MAX_M (=9) time steps which was the maximum sequence length we considered. Hence, the presynaptic activity for sequences was represented as a matrix of ones, minus ones, and zeros of dimensions T<sub>pre</sub> × 9, where ones represented ensemble activity, minus ones represented background activity, and zeros represented no activity. In stimulus trials, at any given time step, only one ensemble was considered to be active. Neurons belonging to inactive ensembles in a particular time step were considered to participate in background activity in that time step. Although the presynaptic activity was simulated for a total of MAX_M time steps, while counting the number of sequences for a sequence of length M, only the activity from the first M time steps was used, as that was the length of the sequence we were interested in. Connectivity was simulated between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons as described earlier.</p><p>Using this setup, we looked for the occurrence of different kinds of sequences.

In addition, we restricted the analysis to ectopics occurring within the zone of the sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Effect of ectopic inputs on electrical sequences</title><p>We chose the model published on ModelDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://modeldb.science/140828">https://modeldb.science/140828</ext-link>) for examining the effect of ectopic inputs on the selectivity of electrical sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branco et al., 2010</xref>). The base code from ModelDB was modified and run using the NEURON Simulator. The original channel kinetics parameters post the fix to NMDA_Mg_T initialization, and the dendrite used for testing were retained as is from the ModelDB GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ModelDBRepository/140828">https://github.com/ModelDBRepository/140828</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse, 2020</xref>). We removed the timing jitter between the inputs and positioned the inputs slightly closer (~11%) to avoid end-effects. We tested out the effects of ectopics using the passive version of the model.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, a sequence of five inputs was delivered as an inward, outward, and scrambled sequence and the voltage response at the soma was measured. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, inputs were delivered sequentially and using a number of different scrambled orderings. The voltage response at the soma was measured in each case. Selectivity was calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 6</xref>, wherein A represented the peak excitatory postsynaptic potentials in this case. This exercise was repeated for different time intervals between successive inputs and for different sequence lengths to obtain the selectivity vs input velocity curves.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref> the base code was slightly modified to accommodate an ectopic input in addition to the different sequential/scrambled patterns that were being delivered. First, an ectopic input was added at different locations arriving at different times relative to the zone of the regular patterns, and selectivity is estimated at each position. The reference curve shows selectivity in the absence of the ectopic input.</p><p>This exercise was repeated for sequences of three to nine inputs with a subset of spatiotemporal combinations of the ectopic input. We sampled a combination of three locations (start, middle, and end) relative to the zone of the regular inputs, and three time points (start, middle, and end) for the ectopic input. For sequences of ≥ 6 inputs, 121 pattern combinations of the regular inputs were sampled since sampling all permutations of the sequence was computationally expensive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Integrated multiscale model</title><p>We integrated each of the illustrated forms of spatial and temporal pattern selectivity into a single multiscale model that incorporated both electrical and chemical signaling. The model mechanisms and parameters were identical to those used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla, 2017</xref>, with a few small changes. First, this was a reduced geometry neuron with a Y-shaped dendritic structure, on which one arm of the Y was ornamented with 80 dendritic spines spaced at 2 µm. Second, the diffusion constant for CaM and its calcium-bound forms were set to 20 µm<sup>2</sup>/s. Third, the K_DR levels at the soma were up from 250 to 360 S/m<sup>2</sup>. Fourth, the resting potential was lowered from –60 to –70 mV.</p><p>In brief, chemical signaling was present in the spines and dendrites, and these were coupled by diffusion. Chemical signaling and electrical signaling were also coupled, such that calcium influx through NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels led to signaling outcomes, and kinase activity led to channel phosphorylation which altered dendritic excitability. The model included six voltage-gated ion channels (Na, K_DR, K_A, K_Ca, K_AHP, L-type Ca) and three ligand-gated ion channels (AMPAR, NMDAR, and GABAR). AMPAR and NMDAR were located on the spines only, and GABAR was located on the dendritic branches at 16 locations on each branch. Each of the 32 GABA receptors received Poisson random synaptic input at a background rate of 1.0 Hz. The detailed list of parameters have been provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f and g</xref>.</p><p>In order to run the simulations for a wide range of stimulus patterns, we implemented a wrapper script around the model named allNonlin7.py. This one script was used to perform all the simulations on the integrated model using the command line options specified in the *.bat files in the GitHub repository. Output from allNonlin7.py was saved as an hdf5 file and processed for visualization using readBackHdf7.py and analyzeNonlin6.py.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Simulation, analysis and visualization of - Figures 1,2,3,4,5,6,7</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Simulation and analysis - Figures 5, 8; and visualization of Figure 8</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Model parameters and equations.</title><p>(a) Molecular species used in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM model.

But this requires the right synapses to be located in the right places. This paper aims to address the question of whether such synaptic arrangements could arise by chance (i.e. without special rules for axon guidance or structural plasticity), and could therefore be exploited even in randomly connected networks. This is important, particularly for the dendrites and biological computation communities, where there is a pressing need to integrate decades of work at the single-neuron level with contemporary ideas about network function.</p><p>Using an abstract model where ensembles of neurons project randomly to a postsynaptic population, back-of-envelope calculations are presented that predict the probability of finding clustered synapses and spatiotemporal sequences. Using data-constrained parameters, the authors conclude that clustering and sequences are indeed likely to occur by chance (for large enough ensembles), but require strong dendritic nonlinearities and low background noise to be useful.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The back-of-envelope reasoning presented can provide fast and valuable intuition. The authors have also made the effort to connect the model parameters with measured values. Even an approximate understanding of cluster probability can direct theory and experiments towards promising directions, or away from lost causes.</p><p>- I found the general approach to be refreshingly transparent and objective. Assumptions are stated clearly about the model and statistics of different circuits. Along with some positive results, many of the computed cluster probabilities are vanishingly small, and noise is found to be quite detrimental in several cases. This is important to know, and I was happy to see the authors take a balanced look at conditions that help/hinder clustering, rather than just focus on a particular regime that works.</p><p>- This paper is also a timely reminder that synaptic clusters and sequences can exist on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The authors present results pertaining to the standard `electrical' regime (~50-100 µm, &lt;50 ms), as well as two modes of chemical signaling (~10 µm, 100-1000 ms). The senior author is indeed an authority on the latter, and the simulations in Figure 5, extending those from Bhalla (2017), are unique in this area. In my view, the role of chemical signaling in neural computation is understudied theoretically, but research will be increasingly important as experimental technologies continue to develop.</p><p>(Editors' note: the paper has been through two rounds of revisions and the authors are encouraged to finalise this as the Version of Record.

They now address some of my concerns. Specifically, they show the contribution of end-effects on spreading the inputs between dendrites. This analysis reveals greater applicability of their findings to cortical cells, with long, unbranching dendrites than other neuronal types, such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.</p><p>They now explain better the interactions between calcium and voltage signals, which I believe improve the take-away message of their manuscript. They modified and added new figures that helped to provide more information about their simulations.</p><p>However, some of my points remain valid. Figure 6 shows depolarization of ~5mV from -75. This weak depolarization would not effectively recruit nonlinear activation of NMDARs. In their paper, Branco and Hausser (2010) showed depolarizations of ~10-15mV.</p><p>More importantly, the signature of NMDAR activation is the prolonged plateau potential and activation at more depolarized resting membrane potentials (their Figure 4). Thus, despite including NMDARs in the simulation, the authors do not model functional recruitment of these channels. Their simulation is thus equivalent to AMPA only drive, which can indeed summate somewhat nonlinearly.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, we used short sequences of 5 inputs, since the convergence of longer sequences is extremely unlikely in the network configurations we have examined. This resulted in smaller EPSP amplitudes of ~5mV (Figure 6 - Supplement 2A, B). Longer sequences containing 9 inputs resulted in larger somatic depolarizations of ~10mV (Figure 6 - Supplement 2E, F). Although we had modified the (Branco, Clark, and Häusser 2010) model to remove the jitter in the timing of arrival of inputs and made slight modifications to the location of stimulus delivery on the dendrite, we saw similar amplitudes when we tested a 9-length sequence using (Branco, Clark, and Häusser 2010)’s published code (Figure 6 - Supplement 2I, J). In all the cases we tested (5 input sequence, 9 input sequence, 9 input sequence with (Branco, Clark, and Häusser 2010) code repository), removal of NMDA synapses lowered both the somatic EPSPs (Figure 6 - Supplement 2C,D,G,H,K,L) as well as the selectivity (measured as the difference between the EPSPs generated for inward and outward stimulus delivery) (Figure 6 Supplement 2M,N,O). Further, monitoring the voltage along the dendrite for a sequence of 5 inputs showed dendritic EPSPs in the range of 20-45 mV (Figure 6 - Supplement 2P, Q), which came down notably (10-25mV) when NMDA synapses were abolished (Figure 6 - Supplement 2R, S). Thus, even sequences containing as few as 5 inputs were capable of engaging the NMDA-mediated nonlinearity to show sequence selectivity, although the selectivity was not as strong as in the case of 9 inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Figure 8, what does the scale in A represent? I assume it is voltage, but there are no units. Figure 8, C, E, G, these are unconventional units for synaptic weights, usually, these are given in nS / per input.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected these. The scalebar in 8A represents membrane potential in mV. The units of 8C,E,G are now in nS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>If synaptic input is functionally clustered on dendrites, nonlinear integration could increase the computational power of neural networks.

This is important, particularly for the dendrites and biological computation communities, where there is a pressing need to integrate decades of work at the single-neuron level with contemporary ideas about network function.</p><p>Using an abstract model where ensembles of neurons project randomly to a postsynaptic population, back-of-envelope calculations are presented that predict the probability of finding clustered synapses and spatiotemporal sequences. Using data-constrained parameters, the authors conclude that clustering and sequences are indeed likely to occur by chance (for large enough ensembles), but require strong dendritic nonlinearities and low background noise to be useful.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The back-of-envelope reasoning presented can provide fast and valuable intuition. The authors have also made the effort to connect the model parameters with measured values. Even an approximate understanding of cluster probability can direct theory and experiments towards promising directions, or away from lost causes.</p><p>(2) I found the general approach to be refreshingly transparent and objective. Assumptions are stated clearly about the model and statistics of different circuits. Along with some positive results, many of the computed cluster probabilities are vanishingly small, and noise is found to be quite detrimental in several cases. This is important to know, and I was happy to see the authors take a balanced look at conditions that help/hinder clustering, rather than to just focus on a particular regime that works.</p><p>(3) This paper is also a timely reminder that synaptic clusters and sequences can exist on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The authors present results pertaining to the standard `electrical' regime (~50-100 µm, &lt;50 ms), as well as two modes of chemical signaling (~10 µm, 100-1000 ms). The senior author is indeed an authority on the latter, and the simulations in Figure 5, extending those from Bhalla (2017), are unique in this area. In my view, the role of chemical signaling in neural computation is understudied theoretically, but research will be increasingly important as experimental technologies continue to develop.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The paper is mostly let down by the presentation. In the current form, some patience is needed to grasp the main questions and results, and it is hard to keep track of the many abbreviations and definitions. A paper like this can be impactful, but the writing needs to be crisp, and the logic of the derivation accessible to non-experts. See, for instance, Stepanyants, Hof &amp; Chklovskii (2002) for a relevant example.</p><p>It would be good to see a restructure that communicates the main points clearly and concisely, perhaps leaving other observations to an optional appendix. For the interested but time-pressed reader, I recommend starting with the last paragraph of the introduction, working through the main derivation on page 7, and writing out the full expression with key parameters exposed. Next, look at Table 1 and Figure 2J to see where different circuits and mechanisms fit in this scheme. Beyond this, the sequence derivation on page 15 and biophysical simulations in Figures 5 and 6 are also highlights.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers' suggestions. We have tightened the flow of the introduction. We understand that the abbreviations and definitions are challenging and have therefore provided intuitions and summaries of the equations discussed in the main text.</p><p>Clusters calculations</p><p>Our approach is to ask how likely it is that a given set of inputs lands on a short segment of dendrite, and then scale it up to all segments on the entire dendritic length of the cell.</p><p>Thus, the probability of occurrence of groups that receive connections from each of the M ensembles (PcFMG) is a function of the connection probability (p) between the two layers, the number of neurons in an ensemble (N), the relative zone-length with respect to the total dendritic arbor (Z/L) and the number of ensembles (M).</p><p>Sequence calculations</p><p>Here we estimate the likelihood of the first ensemble input arriving anywhere on the dendrite, and ask how likely it is that succeeding inputs of the sequence would arrive within a set spacing.</p><p>Thus, the probability of occurrence of sequences that receive sequential connections (PcPOSS) from each of the M ensembles is a function of the connection probability (p) between the two layers, the number of neurons in an ensemble (N), the relative window size with respect to the total dendritic arbor (Δ/L) and the number of ensembles (M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I wonder if the authors are being overly conservative at times. The result highlighted in the abstract is that 10/100000 postsynaptic neurons are expected to exhibit synaptic clustering. This seems like a very small number, especially if circuits are to rely on such a mechanism. However, this figure assumes the convergence of 3-5 distinct ensembles. Convergence of inputs from just 2 ense mbles would be much more prevalent, but still advantageous computationally. There has been excitement in the field about experiments showing the clustering of synapses encoding even a single feature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that short clusters of two inputs would be far more likely. We focused our analysis on clusters with three of more ensembles because of the following reasons:</p><p>(1) The signal to noise in these clusters was very poor as the likelihood of noise clusters is high.</p><p>(2) It is difficult to trigger nonlinearities with very few synaptic inputs.</p><p>(3) At the ensemble sizes we considered (100 for clusters, 1000 for sequences), clusters arising from just two ensembles would result in high probability of occurrence on all neurons in a network (~50% in cortex, see p_CMFG in figures below.). These dense neural representations make it difficult for downstream networks to decode (Foldiak 2003).</p><p>However, in the presence of ensembles containing fewer neurons or when the connection probability between the layers is low, short clusters can result in sparse representations (Figure 2 - Supplement 2). Arguments 1 and 2 hold for short sequences as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The analysis supporting the claim that strong nonlinearities are needed for cluster/sequence detection is unconvincing. In the analysis, different synapse distributions on a single long dendrite are convolved with a sigmoid function and then the sum is taken to reflect the somatic response. In reality, dendritic nonlinearities influence the soma in a complex and dynamic manner. It may be that the abstract approach the authors use captures some of this, but it needs to be validated with simulations to be trusted (in line with previous work, e.g. Poirazi, Brannon &amp; Mel, (2003)).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that multiple factors might affect the influence of nonlinearities on the soma. The key goal of our study was to understand the role played by random connectivity in giving rise to clustered computation. Since simulating a wide range of connectivity and activity patterns in a detailed biophysical model was computationally expensive, we analyzed the exemplar detailed models for nonlinearity separately (Figures 5, 6, and new figure 8), and then used our abstract models as a proxy for understanding population dynamics. A complete analysis of the role played by morphology, channel kinetics and the effect of branching requires an in-depth study of its own, and some of these questions have already been tackled by (Poirazi, Brannon, and Mel 2003; Branco, Clark, and Häusser 2010; Bhalla 2017). However, in the revision, we have implemented a single model which incorporates the range of ion-channel, synaptic and biochemical signaling nonlinearities which we discuss in the paper (Figure 8, and Figure 8 Supplement 1, 2,3). We use this to demonstrate all three forms of sequence and grouped computation we use in the study, where the only difference is in the stimulus pattern and the separation of time-scales inherent in the stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is unclear whether some of the conclusions would hold in the presence of learning. In the signal-to-noise analysis, all synaptic strengths are assumed equal. But if synapses involved in salient clusters or sequences were potentiated, presumably detection would become easier? Similarly, if presynaptic tuning and/or timing were reorganized through learning, the conditions for synaptic arrangements to be useful could be relaxed. Answering these questions is beyond the scope of the study, but there is a caveat there nonetheless.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. If synapses receiving connectivity from ensembles had stronger weights, this would make detection easier. Dendritic spikes arising from clustered inputs have been implicated in local cooperative plasticity (Golding, Staff, and Spruston 2002; Losonczy, Makara, and Magee 2008). Further, plasticity related proteins synthesized at a synapse undergoing L-LTP can diffuse to neighboring weakly co-active synapses, and thereby mediate cooperative plasticity (Harvey et al. 2008; Govindarajan, Kelleher, and Tonegawa 2006; Govindarajan et al. 2011). Thus if clusters of synapses were likely to be co-active, they could further engage these local plasticity mechanisms which could potentiate them while not potentiating synapses that are activated by background activity. This would depend on the activity correlation between synapses receiving ensemble inputs within a cluster vs those activated by background activity. We have mentioned some of these ideas in a published opinion paper (Pulikkottil, Somashekar, and Bhalla 2021). In the current study, we wanted to understand whether even in the absence of specialized connection rules, interesting computations could still emerge. Thus, we focused on asking whether clustered or sequential convergence could arise even in a purely randomly connected network, with the most basic set of assumptions. We agree that an analysis of how selectivity evolves with learning would be an interesting topic for further work.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Bhalla, Upinder S. 2017. “Synaptic Input Sequence Discrimination on Behavioral Timescales Mediated by Reaction-Diffusion Chemistry in Dendrites.” Edited by Frances K Skinner. <italic>eLife</italic> 6 (April):e25827. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25827">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25827</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Branco, Tiago, Beverley A.
