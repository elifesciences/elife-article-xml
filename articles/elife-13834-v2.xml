Withdrawal is essential for development and has been a morphogenetic puzzle. Here, we use new fluorescent transgenic lines in the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> to show that the EE tissues dynamically form a basal-basal epithelial bilayer, contradicting the previous hypothesis of EE intercalation. We find that the EE tissues repeatedly detach and reattach throughout development and have distinct roles. Quantitative live imaging analyses show that the amnion initiates EE rupture in a specialized anterior-ventral cap. RNAi phenotypes demonstrate that the serosa contracts autonomously. Thus, apposition in a bilayer enables the amnion as 'initiator' to coordinate with the serosa as 'driver' to achieve withdrawal. This EE strategy may reflect evolutionary changes within the holometabolous insects and serves as a model to study interactions between developing epithelia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13834.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13834.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13834.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Early in development a protective fluid-filled sac forms around an embryo. In humans, this sac bursts during birth, but the sac surrounding insect embryos ruptures long before these animals begin to emerge from their eggs. This early rupture is important for insects to develop normally: if an insect embryo’s sac remains intact too long, the animal’s back will not close properly.</p><p>The sac that surrounds insect embryos has two layers: an inner layer called the amnion, and a tough outer layer called the serosa. However, it has been difficult to study what happens to the amnion as the insect embryo develops because it is hard to distinguish it from the serosa. Now, Hilbrant et al. have used genetically engineered red flour beetles in which the cells of the amnion produce a fluorescent protein that can be viewed under a microscope. This allowed the amnion to be observed in living specimens during beetle embryo development, and revealed that the amnion attaches and detaches from the serosa more than once as the embryo develops. Furthermore, the amnion and serosa remain as distinct tissues as they withdraw from the embryo.</p><p>Hilbrant et al. also found that the cells in part of the amnion near the head of the beetle embryo have a special shape before the sac ruptures. This region of the amnion breaks apart first, and the serosa breaks open a few minutes afterwards. Once the two layers have broken, they pull back from the embryo like a pillowcase being turned inside out as it is removed from a pillow. In normal beetles, this process is quite rapid and squeezes the embryo’s abdomen. But in beetles genetically manipulated to lack a serosa the process is slower because the amnion is not strong enough by itself to squeeze the embryo.</p><p>Overall, the experiments show that the amnion starts the rupture of the red flour beetle embryo’s protective sac and the serosa drives the process of the sac being peeled back. Further research will now investigate the mechanics behind the two tissues’ roles and whether the amnion and serosa display similar behaviors in other related insect species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13834.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13834.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>extraembryonic development</kwd><kwd>insects</kwd><kwd>RNA interference (RNAi)</kwd><kwd>fluorescent live imaging</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether Program, PA 2044/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panfilio</surname><given-names>Kristen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Late morphogenesis of the insect extraembryonic epithelia involves transient formation of a basal-basal bilayer to coordinate the functional contributions of two discrete tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryogenesis requires dynamic interaction between tissues to create changing three-dimensional configurations, culminating in the completion of the body. In parallel to the amniote vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvin and Oyen, 2007</xref>), the insects have evolved extraembryonic (EE) tissues that arise in early embryogenesis to envelop the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panfilio, 2008</xref>). These are the amnion and the serosa, which are both simple, squamous epithelia. Like its vertebrate namesake, in most insect species the amnion encloses a fluid-filled cavity around the embryo. As the outermost cellular layer, the serosa provides mechanical and physiological protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farnesi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rezende et al., 2008</xref>). This protective configuration is not permanent, though, and a major reorganization of the EE tissues is essential for embryos to correctly close their backs in late development.</p><p>Reorganization involves whole tissue eversion, contraction, and final apoptosis of both EE tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panfilio et al., 2013</xref>). For these events, perhaps the nearest morphogenetic equivalent in the model system <italic>Drosophila</italic> is eversion of the wing imaginal disc during metamorphosis, where the squamous peripodial epithelium also exhibits these behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldaz et al., 2010</xref>). However, research on <italic>Drosophila</italic> cannot address the morphogenesis of the two EE epithelia directly, due to the secondarily derived nature of its single EE tissue, the amnioserosa, which does not surround the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rafiqi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Insect EE withdrawal – the active process whereby the EE tissues withdraw from the embryo and leave it uncovered – has been addressed at the level of gross morphology in classical descriptions for many species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panfilio, 2008</xref>). However, a major open question has been the organization and role of the amnion. This is primarily because it is difficult to visualize in its native topography with respect to other tissues. A lack of amnion-specific molecular markers (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>) and the histological similarity and proximity of the serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>) have been particular challenges.</p><p>Here, we present the first clear determination of the relative topography and role of the amnion in late development in a holometabolous insect, the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. We characterize an enhancer trap line that labels the amnion and use this in conjunction with recently characterized serosal lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>) to morphogenetically dissect which tissue is responsible for which aspects of EE tissue withdrawal. The topographical arrangement of the tissues differs strikingly from what was previously known in hemimetabolous insects and what had previously been hypothesized for <italic>Tribolium</italic>. To better appreciate the implications of this arrangement for morphogenesis, we situate these observations in the larger context of EE development at preceding and following stages. This global, mesoscopic approach to evaluating tissue interactions significantly improves our understanding the entire withdrawal process, including the first detailed examination of EE rupture in any insect. Furthermore, we provide evidence that while the serosa strongly drives the contraction and folding of the tissues, the amnion initiates EE rupture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The amnion and serosa form a bilayer during late development</title><p>To augment the toolkit for tissue-specific visualization in <italic>Tribolium</italic>, we identified and characterized an enhancer trap line with amniotic EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al. (2014)</xref> for mapping technique, original staging definitions, acquisition parameters, and analysis method. HC079 was mapped to a gene-poor, intergenic region on chromosome 3. EGFP signal is first detected in the amnion during germband retraction, becoming increasingly bright throughout the tissue up to the time of serosal rupture, which heralds the onset of withdrawal morphogenesis. Relative EGFP signal quantification is plotted as the mean ± standard deviation during a 48-hr time-lapse recording, with corresponding values for landmark developmental stages (GBE, germband extension; GBR, germband retraction; SR, serosal rupture; MT, muscle twitches). Note that 'serosal rupture' is the staging term but in fact refers to first discernible rupture of both EE tissues at the beginning of withdrawal morphogenesis. Landmark stage values are also based on nGFP embryos that were recorded in parallel for calibration (combined n = 7–23 embryos per stage). Vertical red lines indicate the mean SR age. In <bold>A</bold>, relative EGFP signal is the mean grey value (n = 10), shown for minimum age (from a four-hr egg collection) relative to serosal rupture. In <bold>B</bold>, signal is the integrated density of the posterior and anterior egg halves (0–50% <italic>vs</italic>. 50–100% egg length) for embryos recorded in both lateral and ventral aspect (n = 5), with standard deviation shown on only one side of each plot for clarity. Here, the x-axis shows minimum absolute age in hours after egg lay (hours AEL). Vertical black lines and asterisks indicate the first time points at which the anterior and posterior EGFP values differ significantly (*: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.01 for paired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests). Although this difference in part reflects the relative area of visible amnion in lateral aspect (greater anteriorly), the trend still holds when only embryos in ventral aspect are considered (uniform relative amnion surface area).

Initially the two EE tissues are physically separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Handel et al., 2005</xref>), but they progressively come together during early germband retraction until the only clearly discernible amniotic region is a rim of tissue at the embryo’s dorsal margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-A2</xref>). Previous histological studies in <italic>Tribolium</italic> and other holometabolous insects concluded that the region of overlap throughout the ventral half of the egg comprised a single EE cell layer, the EE tissues having intercalated or otherwise 'fused' (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kobayashi and Ando, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patten, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, this structure was interpreted as only serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panfilio et al., 2013</xref>), as the underlying amniotic region undergoes apoptosis in a hemimetabolous insect, the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</xref>). In fact, we find that both tissues persist as apposed and very thin but distinct squamous epithelial layers that are evident in both sectioned and whole mount material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Apposition occurs over the entire surface area of the amnion except its dorsal rim, such that the serosa and amnion form an extensive epithelial bilayer. Several hours after the completion of germband retraction, the EE membranes rupture and withdraw from the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the amnion-serosa bilayer is maintained throughout withdrawal morphogenesis, with all major folds and minor bends involving both EE tissue sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The new amnion EGFP line thus sheds light on EE tissue structure during withdrawal: rather than a single, pseudostratified tissue, each EE tissue persists as a monolayer, representing a novel EE tissue organization compared to what is known for other species. Given that the amnion persists as a discrete tissue throughout withdrawal morphogenesis, we then investigated its role in this process, starting with its structure at the onset of rupture.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13834.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The amnion and serosa form a bilayer during the germband retraction stage.</title><p>Images are lateral (<bold>A–C</bold>,<bold>E</bold>) or ventral-lateral (<bold>D</bold>), with anterior left and dorsal up. (<bold>A</bold>) During germband retraction, the amnion progressively comes together with the serosa, shown sagittally at an intermediate stage when the tissues are apposed anteriorly (<bold>A1</bold>) but still separate posteriorly (<bold>A2</bold>). Fuchsin preparation causes embryo shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wigand et al., 1998</xref>), amplifying apparent amniotic cavity volume, but without altering tissue topography, which is consistent across dozens of stage-matched specimens. (<bold>B–D</bold>) Before rupture, the ventral EE tissue under the eggshell (autofluorescent vitelline membrane) is comprised of distinct serosal (outer) and amniotic (inner) layers. In sagittal sections (<bold>B,C</bold>), tissue-specific EGFP labels continuous tissue sheets, while nuclei (DAPI stain) of the apposed EE tissue remain EGFP-negative and in a separate layer (inset schematic).

'Overview' images show lateral, ventral, and ventral-lateral views of maximum intensity projections (<bold>A1</bold>,<bold>B1</bold>,<bold>C1</bold>, respectively) with anterior left and the region of interest around the head appendages indicated by the blue boxed region (due to the curvature of the egg, only the regions actually visible in high-magnification projections of thinner z-stacks are indicated). 'Merge' images (<bold>A2</bold>,<bold>B2</bold>,<bold>C2</bold>) show maximum intensity projections of the indicated region, labeled for F-Actin (red, phalloidin), nuclei (blue, DAPI), and the specified EE tissue (green, EGFP). Note that embryonic-specific signal (F-Actin and DAPI signal for small cells not in contact with the tissue at the egg surface) was manually deleted from deeper optical sections with the freehand selection tool in ImageJ before rendering the projected images shown here. 'Schematic' images (<bold>A3</bold>,<bold>B3</bold>,<bold>C3</bold>) show cell and nuclear outlines. Cell outlines were determined by EGFP signal (for <bold>A3</bold>,<bold>B3</bold>,<bold>C3</bold>) and F-Actin signal (for <bold>C3</bold>, for serosal outlines only). Nuclear outlines were determined by EGFP signal or DAPI (for all EGFP-negative nuclei only). Serosal cells are shown in cyan or blue; amniotic nuclei and cells are shown in orange or white. Dashed outlines highlight individual serosal (red) and amniotic (orange) cells, which are also labeled by arrows of the same color in the single-channel micrographs for EGFP (<bold>A4</bold>,<bold>B4</bold>,<bold>C4</bold>) and F-Actin (<bold>A5</bold>,<bold>B5</bold>,<bold>C5</bold>). Strong F-Actin signal correlates with serosal cell shape (compare <bold>A4</bold>,<bold>A5</bold> and <bold>B4</bold>,<bold>B5</bold>), such that F-Actin signal can be used to infer serosal cell shape even when that tissue is not labeled with EGFP (<bold>C3</bold>,<bold>C5</bold>). Furthermore, the F-Actin-inferred serosal cell outlines correspond to EGFP-negative nuclei in the amnion enhancer trap line (<bold>C3</bold>). Note that in order to preserve anterior-ventral EE tissue structure and topography, the specimens presented here (<bold>A–C</bold>) are still within the vitelline membrane. After fixation, embryos were cut in half (transversely) with a razor blade to allow the phalloidin and DAPI staining reagents to penetrate into the sample. (The EGFP is the endogenous signal.) (<bold>D–E</bold>). For over a day prior to rupture, no cell mixing or change in cell number occurs in either the serosa (<bold>D</bold>) or the amnion (<bold>E</bold>). Selected stills from time-lapse movies are shown at the times indicated relative to rupture (at 30°C, z-stacks acquired every 2 min), in anterior aspect and oriented with the ventral region uppermost, with light sheet illumination coming from above. Individual nuclei were tracked hourly (uniquely colored tracks), showing the static nature of serosal cells until the time of rupture, while amniotic nuclei move much more within the cells and the amniotic tissue itself shifts slightly anterior-dorsally. The initial opening at the time of rupture is indicated with an asterisk (<bold>D4</bold>,<bold>E4</bold>). Axes were determined based on weak embryonic signal (<bold>D5</bold>,<bold>E5</bold>; the withdrawing edge of the amnion is still visible in <bold>E5</bold>). Images shown here are maximum intensity projections with gamma corrections 0.5 (serosa) and 0.7 (amnion) as well as brightness correction to accommodate for changes in signal intensity of these lines during development (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>).

Since dorsal head structures are not visible in the anterior-ventral movies shown here, the approximate equivalent duration is through the time when the maxillae are cleared (Mx): the interval from 9:00 to 20:20 in the amnion (11:20 duration) and from 20:00 to 27:20 in the serosa (7:20 duration).

Of particular note are the brighter, rounder amniotic cells in an anterior-ventral cap, in which rupture occurs. During withdrawal, the amnion everts (turns inside out), such that the surface that had faced inward toward the embryo is flipped outward to face the vitelline membrane: this is particularly apparent from 35 to 49 min after rupture as the ruptured tissue edge folds over.

Remarkably, definitive rupture initiates not only by intercellular separation but in some cases by intracellular hole formation (<italic>e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1-D2</xref>: red cell). Among recordings with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, we followed intracellular opening in three specimens. In the example shown here, thin cytoplasmic remnants of the affected cell that were distant from the nucleus and main cell body could be tracked initially, but these may fragment as the opening enlarges to the circumference of the egg. However, the nuclei (and main cell body) of cells at the site of rupture can be followed during withdrawal and appear to contribute to the persistent edge of the tissue (also in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). These cellular contortions do not occur in the serosa, where cells at the site of rupture separate from their neighbors by spatial translation without substantial deviation from regular, polygonal cell shapes with centrally positioned nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E1-E2</xref>). Meanwhile, at no time prior to or during rupture did we observe cell loss in the amnion (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). There is also no discernible change in apical area or EGFP brightness of amniotic cells directly involved in rupture compared to cells elsewhere in the amniotic cap, such that the onset of rupture appears very abrupt. Thus, rupture in <italic>Tribolium</italic> within a specialized competence zone of the amnion is fundamentally different to the strategy in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>. In the latter species, gradual apoptosis of the amnion at the rupture site begins over a day (16% development) before rupture occurs but is in itself insufficient as a proximate trigger, which remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The EE tissues rupture at different rates</title><p>In addition to cell shape changes, we also quantified the rate of EE tissue rupture. We find that rupture initiation in <italic>Tribolium</italic> – defined as the short interval of initial opening of the EE membranes – is significantly longer in the amnion than in the serosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-G</xref>, [p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test; see Materials and methods for details of the landmarks that delimit this interval). This is also true even when slight differences in developmental rate between genetic backgrounds are considered (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result, supported by the distinct morphological appearance of the amnion at the site of rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggests that the amnion initiates rupture. The serosa then ruptures after a slight delay of a few minutes. Indeed, the difference in initiation duration corresponds morphologically to only a slight opening of the amnion, generally no larger than the area of the anterior-ventral cap region (82%, <italic>n </italic>= 28, data set from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), before the serosa would also perceptibly rupture and then catch up with the amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the amniotic rupture competence zone may differ from the rest of the tissue in the nature of its attachment to the serosa (also based on tracking data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), given that the edges of the two tissues then retain apposition throughout subsequent withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: arrow). Before evaluating the progression of withdrawal in detail (below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we then completed our assessment of EE rupture by analyzing how preceding events in early development restrict the source of upstream signals to determine the site of rupture.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-13834-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13834.012</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Extraembryonic rupture filmed at high temporal resolution.</title><p>Embryos are shown in anterior-ventral aspect with anterior left, and labeled with EGFP from a heterozygote cross of enhancer trap lines labeling the amnion (line HC079) or serosa (line G12424) with selected embryonic domains in the head, segments, and legs (line G04609, 'heart').

At the blastoderm stage, the amnion and serosa initially share a lateral tissue boundary within the plane of the blastoderm epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). As the EE tissues envelop the embryo, they maintain that boundary until they separate into discrete membranes at the serosal window closure stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Handel et al., 2000</xref>). As the EE tissues separate, serosal cells rapidly acquire fixed positions under the vitelline membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>), while internally the embryo and amnion are not so tethered. Indeed, we find that over half of all embryos examined (59%, <italic>n </italic>= 69) rotate longitudinally during early germband extension relative to the serosa: up to 90º about the anterior-posterior axis, with a tendency to rest laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). More generally, rotation occurs irrespective of whether the embryo’s long axis is orthogonal (this study) or parallel (data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strobl and Stelzer, 2014</xref>) to gravity, suggesting an inherent anisotropy of the early egg. However, there is no counterpart rotation in later development (<italic>n </italic>= 118), including for 15 embryos filmed continuously and which exhibited typical frequencies of early rotation. In other words, 9 of 15 embryos rotated longitudinally such that the site of serosal window closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: boxed region) did not correspond to the site of later EE tissue rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>: starburst).

Embryos laying on their dorsal or ventral surface ('poles') were more likely (69%) to rotate 90°, while embryos in lateral aspect (85%) tended to only rotate 45°. While overall there was no bias in direction of rotation, embryos initially laying on their right sides tended to rotate anticlockwise (70%) while embryos on their left sides rotated clockwise (78%). Direction of rotation was from the perspective of the embryo’s posterior (<italic>i.e.</italic>, clockwise is right, anticlockwise is left). These directional biases are applicable across the full range from ventral-lateral through dorsal-lateral, such that rotation tended to result in more strictly lateral final orientations (64%).

Rather than the serosa causing regionalization in the amnion, it may well be the other way around. We previously observed a subtle morphological change in serosal cells over the yolk compared to those over the amnion, and this change only arises during germband retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>), which correlates with the time of EE tissue apposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, the region of amniotic specialization for rupture may be autonomous (<italic>e.g.</italic>, corresponding to where it ultimately closed at the serosal window stage) or induced by signals from the underlying embryo, but is unlikely to be determined by the serosa.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Serosal contractility drives withdrawal morphogenesis and demonstrates bilayer adhesion</title><p>Once the EE tissues have ruptured anterior-ventrally, they pull back from the embryo as an everting sack that folds up to a dorsal-medial position, similar to a pillowcase being turned inside out as it is peeled off of a pillow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The serosa appears to be the driving force for withdrawal. We had previously observed that the serosa facilitates the final stages of withdrawal during dorsal closure, making the process more robust and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panfilio et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we find that this is true throughout these morphogenetic movements, and furthermore that this is an inherent property of this tissue.</p><p>Firstly, we again use the serosa-less situation after <italic>Tc-zen1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> to assess the serosa’s normal contribution. Wild type withdrawal is rapid, with visible squeezing of the embryo’s abdomen as the posterior EE tissue edge pulls back and clears the posterior pole. In tracking the edge of the EE tissues during withdrawal, the squeezing is manifest in the degree to which the tissue pulls away from the eggshell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: bracketed track segment represents 1 min at 21°C). This is due to serosa-specific enrichment in apical F-actin as the cells undergo a drastic shape change to become pseudocolumnar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F′</xref>). Indeed, wild type specimens occasionally exhibited a transient extra fold in the posterior EE tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,C′</xref>: double-headed arrow). This likely reflects a degree of stochasticity in tissue relaxation after snapping over the abdomen, similar to kinetic descriptions in other species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patten, 1884</xref>). Both the histological and kinetic situations are altered in the absence of the serosa. In <italic>Tc-zen1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> embryos the amnion does withdraw dorsally, but over a much longer time scale and without sufficient force to squeeze the abdomen away from the eggshell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: entire track represents 3.9 hr at 21°C). The slow progression is in part due to the tissue ruffling into folds rather than everting via apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: red bracket corresponds to the red track segment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with a lack of apical constriction, the amnion alone shows no significant F-actin enrichment or increase in cell height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We then used RNAi against <italic>Tc-zen2</italic>, the functionally diverged paralogue of <italic>Tc-zen1</italic>, as a second approach to functionally test the serosa’s role, as strong RNAi knockdown of <italic>Tc-zen2</italic> completely blocks EE rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). In the absence of rupture, the embryo remains confined within the amniotic cavity at the time when dorsal closure is initiated by the epidermal flanks. With nowhere else to go, the flanks grow along the inner surface of the intact amnion until they meet at the ventral midline, resulting in a ventral closure of the body over the legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panfilio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sander, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Truckenbrodt, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). This manipulation allowed us to examine the serosa’s inherent morphogenetic properties without rupture as a trigger event. We find that the <italic>Tc-zen2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>serosa still contracts strongly even in the absence of rupture. Although the amniotic cavity remains unopened and there are no free EE tissue edges, the serosa contracts until it tears ectopically, withdrawing ventrally over the amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>: shown mid contraction, when the serosa only occupies a small surface area over the egg). We infer that the serosa remains attached throughout the bilayer region and pulls on the underlying amnion, which would account for the displacement of the embryo’s head away from the anterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>: note yolk anterior to the head). This phenotype and the autonomous nature of serosal contractility in <italic>Tribolium</italic> are conserved compared to <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panfilio, 2009</xref>). As this contrasts with the differences between these species in amnion structure and behavior, discussed above, it appears that there is a degree of modularity or independence in how the two epithelia have evolved. This is an unexpected conclusion, given the need for tight coordination between these tissues in any one species.</p><p>Inter-tissue coordination is further demonstrated in weaker <italic>Tc-zen2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in which rupture does occur but withdrawal morphogenesis is defective. Ectopic tearing of the <italic>Tc-zen2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> EE tissue produces a constrictive EE 'belt' around the embryo. Whether visualized for the serosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) or amnion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), the nature of embryonic constriction is consistent with the intact portions of the tissues maintaining adhesion throughout the region of apposition and therefore contracting together. Thus, we propose a model in which correct rupture of the amnion is required for directed EE tissue withdrawal, while the serosa autonomously provides the motive force to achieve this. Adhesion of the EE tissues throughout the region of apposition provides the means to couple these two functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The EE bilayer resolves into two dorsal organs during dorsal closure</title><p>In many insects, the dorsal organ is a transient, hollow structure formed by the serosa as it sinks into the yolk and degenerates at the end of its life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panfilio, 2008</xref>). Importantly, it has previously been described as comprising only serosal tissue. The amnion is restricted to attachment to the serosa at its lateral edges in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enslee and Riddiford, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tojo and Machida, 1997</xref>). Alternatively, it was regarded as fully enveloping the serosa as a smooth outer layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rempel and Church, 1971</xref>), if a distinct amnion was recognized (see first Results and discussion subsection). The persistent bilayered structure of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> EE tissues, however, results in both a serosal dorsal organ and a nested, amniotic dorsal organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In light of these observations, re-analysis of late serosa-less <italic>Tc-zen1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> embryos indicates that the previously observed region of anterior-medial amniotic F-actin enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panfilio et al., 2013</xref>) corresponds to the amniotic dorsal organ, demonstrating that this structure also forms in the absence of a serosa. Thus, at the end of the EE tissues’ lifetimes, they once again function as independent structures, involving separation of the bilayer as the tissues degenerate separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Altogether, the tissue reorganizations for insect EE withdrawal have complex implications for inter-epithelial attachment, balancing a requirement for tissue continuity over the yolk and coordinated withdrawal with enabling the amnion and the serosa to follow their own morphogenetic programs. It was previously known that the <italic>Tribolium</italic> EE tissues arise from the same blastodermal cell sheet before enclosing the embryo and detaching from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Handel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>). After those early stages, the structure and arrangement of the amnion had been obscure. Here, we have characterized a new genetic resource in the form of the HC079 enhancer trap line that literally illuminates this enigmatic tissue for the first time. Following its early detachment from the serosa, the amnion often rotates relative to the serosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) before reattaching to form the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Then, given that the EE tissues withdraw from the embryo as a single unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the re-establishment of their independence during final degeneration at the dorsal organ stage is striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The mechanical requirements of these morphogenetic events imply a precisely regulated and dynamic mode of epithelial attachment. The apposed surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>) present a basal-basal interface where they presumably interact via the basement membrane, which is known to influence both cell adhesion and shape changes at tissue folds during embryogenesis in many animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daley and Yamada, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the bilayer structure and its rupture in <italic>Tribolium</italic> have intriguing parallels with vulval development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where two apposed epithelial sheets must also be opened. In the roundworm, the uterine and ventral epidermal layers are juxtaposed but separated by their respective basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morrissey et al., 2014</xref>). This barrier is breached when the specialized anchor cell of the inner uterine tissue initiates a sequence of extracellular remodeling events to connect the two layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagedorn and Sherwood, 2011</xref>). It will be interesting to see whether similar approaches to local basement membrane removal and gap widening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>) also occur during insect EE rupture, a rapid event that occurs nearly an order of magnitude more quickly than anchor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagedorn and Sherwood, 2011</xref>). Also, in contrast to a system of invasive cell behavior in which cell cycle regulation and the balance of mitosis among neighboring cells contribute to basement membrane breach and widening, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015</xref>), the insect EE tissues enter the endocycle and mature to a polyploid state before rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Panfilio et al., 2013</xref>). The withdrawing EE tissues of <italic>Tribolium</italic> thus provide a new system for investigating restructuring of the basement membrane and the cellular-extracellular matrix in simple epithelia.</p><p>Our working model for how the amnion and serosa cooperate to achieve withdrawal also generates several testable hypotheses regarding the nature of their morphogenetic interactions. For example, we observe a difference in rupture initiation between the amnion and serosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) that we interpret as a delay before the serosa ruptures and then catches up relative to the amnion. Curiously, serosal cells seem to flatten (lose peripheral EGFP signal) prior to rupture (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E1-E2</xref>), and partial dissociation of some serosal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E2</xref>: blue cells) is observed during rupture, although epithelial integrity is maintained during withdrawal. Might this represent a more brittle approach to rupture in which the serosa effectively shatters, compared to the flexibility of opening amniotic cells? In future work, it will be important to elucidate how cells in the amnion and serosa differ in their mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koehl, 1990</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> it was recently shown that non-muscle myosin II plays a nuanced role in tuning the mechanical properties of the peripodial epithelium so that it can rupture and withdraw from the wing imaginal disc columnar tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldaz et al., 2013</xref>). The future development of comparable genetic tools in <italic>Tribolium</italic> will permit the direct testing of our model.</p><p>Taking a step back from rupture itself, it will also be important to uncover the upstream genetic determinants for this event. For example, <italic>Tc-zen2</italic> not only promotes rupture but is also expressed in the anterior amnion in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>), which approximately prefigures the region in which we later detect the morphologically distinct amniotic cap cells. However, this transcription factor is also expressed throughout the serosa, and we find that its knockdown impairs both EE tissues without specifically affecting amnion anterior-ventral differentiation (data not shown), indicating that other regulators control cap formation. Identifying the molecular cues for amniotic regionalization and the proximate triggers for rupture itself will further clarify the amnion’s role.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bilayered EE arrangement in <italic>Tribolium</italic> is thus far unique among insects and resolves a long-standing ambiguity regarding amnion structure and function. While limited data are available for holometabolous insects with complete EE tissues, hemimetabolous insects have been more extensively studied and have a different arrangement. Hemimetabolous EE withdrawal, known as katatrepsis, involves the embryo being pulled out of the yolk by the EE tissues. The requirements for katatrepsis restrict amnion-serosa connection to a distinct border region with lateral-lateral cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panfilio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</xref>), but katatrepsis was lost at the base of the holometabolous insect radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panfilio, 2008</xref>). The longitudinal rotation of the young <italic>Tribolium</italic> germband embryo and amnion is akin to the more extensive movements of these tissues within the yolk in hemimetabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cobben, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rakshpal, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wheeler, 1889</xref>). In contrast, the basal rather than lateral nature of reattachment in <italic>Tribolium</italic> represents a qualitatively different physical environment for the amnion during degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horn et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this topographical change, we observe that whereas the morphogenetic properties of the serosa are conserved between <italic>Tribolium</italic> and the hemimetabolous bug <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, the structure and mode of preparation for rupture in the amnion in these species are decidedly different. Further taxonomic sampling will reveal whether <italic>Tribolium</italic> represents the norm or one of multiple possible EE configurations within the Holometabola. Loss of katatrepsis in this insect lineage may have relaxed constraints on extraembryonic developmental strategies and permitted a degree of independence in the evolution of the insect amnion and serosa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Tribolium</italic> stocks and RNAi</title><p>Analyses were performed in the San Bernardino wild type strain, EFA-nuclear-GFP (nGFP) line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>), and selected GEKU screen enhancer trap lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trauner et al., 2009</xref>): G12424 ('serosa') and G04609 ('heart': cardioblasts and segmental domains), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koelzer et al., 2014</xref>); and HC079 ('amnion', characterized in this study, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor) and two new reviewers, one of whom, David Matus, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. As you will see below, Reviewer 1 is very positive and thinks the manuscript is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> with some relatively minor revisions. Reviewer 2 thought the manuscript was more appropriate for a specialized journal. On balance, I find the paper potentially acceptable for publication pending the minor revisions suggested by the reviewers. Please see the comments below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Hilbrant et al. provide the first live-cell imaging study to understand how insect extraembryonic (EE) tissues (amnion and serosa) rupture and withdraw during the embryogenesis of the holometabolous beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Novel insights are gained through the use of two different GFP transgenic lines, labeling the amnion and serosa, independently. As a previous reviewer has suggested, having a dual labeled (green/red) line would of course greatly aid their studies, but I understand as a non-canonical model system that the creation of this transgenic line is beyond the scope of this study, and the authors have done their due diligence using the two independent strains to the best of their ability, using a combination of structured illumination and light sheet imaging to resolve these morphogenetic events for the first time in live embryos. Thus, methodologically this represents a significant advance for their field. In terms of insights made in understanding the process at a cell biological level, the authors find striking differences between cell movements during rupturing in the two tissues, in timing, localization of the initial rupturing event, cell morphologies during rupturing, and coordination of the event itself. I am particularly intrigued by the stochastic nature of the event in the amnion, as the authors reported multiple cases of intracellular openings, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1-D2</xref>. This was not observed in the serosa. Additionally, the serosa differs in its morphogenetic behavior, as rupture initiation seems more random. The authors use knockdown of two <italic>zen</italic> paralogs to demonstrate the functional importance of the serosa, as depletion of <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> by RNAi results in loss of enriched apical F-actin and a slowing of amnion dorsal withdrawal.</p><p>In their Conclusion, the authors hypothesize that regulation of adhesion to the basement membrane may be critical to these morphogenetic movements, although currently they lack the tools to visualize the basement membrane. I think it will be critical to be able to visualize the basement membrane and functionally examine adhesion mechanisms in both epithelia going forward, but do not think those experiments fall within the scope of the current manuscript either.</p><p>I was not involved in the initial review of this manuscript, but appreciated the authors' response to the reviewers' criticism. In my opinion the authors have addressed the previous reviewers’ concerns adequately, especially through newly acquired data with light-sheet imaging. Particularly, the new data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are compelling, and open up a fascinating new area of study (inter vs. intracellular rupturing in epithelia during morphogenesis). I am unaware of any other system where one might be able to examine this with live-cell imaging approaches, and think the inclusion of these data and the discussion in this version of the manuscript should make the paper of interest to a broader audience beyond the insect evo-devo and morphogenesis community, though I have a few recommendations of other papers that might be worth mentioning in the Discussion (see below). In summary, I have no substantive concerns about the manuscript in its current form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic> </p><p>1) Could you add &quot;transgenic&quot; into the Abstract here: &quot;Here we use new fluorescent transgenic lines in the beetle…&quot;.</p><p>2) I am not sure if <italic>eLife</italic> has rules concerning figure referencing, but I found it somewhat confusing that figures were referenced out of order throughout the manuscript (for first time they were mentioned). I understand that figure layout often fits together in specific ways, but it would have made it easier to go through the manuscript if the figures were referenced in order whenever possible.</p><p>3) During <italic>C. elegans</italic> uterine-vulval attachment there are two basement membranes that are apposed to one another that initially slide back and forth. Following anchor cell invasion, the basement membranes become fused, through the secretion of the extracellular matrix molecule hemicentin (see Morrissey et al. Dev Cell 2014).</p><p>4) It might be worth discussing Srivastava et al. PNAS 2007 (for Drosophila) and any of the work by Guojun Sheng's group (e.g., Nakaya et al. NCB 2008, Nakaya et al. JCB 2013) and several specific papers from the Sherwood group (Ihara et al. NCB 2010; Matus et al Nat Comm. 2014), rather than citing the review of Hagedorn and Sherwood 2011, as other systems that have looked at hole formation and basement membrane remodeling in vivo (it's a very small literature!).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hilbrant et al. report on the rupture and withdrawal of the amnion and serosa in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. They use advanced microscopy techniques and generate new tissue markers, which is no small achievement in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. The imaging is generally of high quality. However, the study is largely descriptive (albeit very carefully descriptive and examined to the level of individual cell morphologies) and, in my opinion, some kind of mechanical or cell biological interventions would be required to fully test their hypotheses and produce a body of work suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Additionally, the absence of two-color imaging (and I appreciate that this is highly difficult with the current <italic>Tribolium</italic> technologies) makes it difficult to be 100% certain of some of the relationships reported between the amnion and serosa and how they evolve temporally. The work does provide important insights into <italic>Tribolium</italic> development, but it seems more appropriate for a specialty development journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Minor Comments):</italic> </p><p>The statement, “However, we find that [<italic>Tc-zen2</italic>] knockdown impairs both EE tissues without specifically affecting amnion anterior-ventral differentiation, indicating that other regulators control cap formation. In future work, identifying the molecular cues for amniotic regionalization and the proximal triggers for rupture itself will further clarify the amnion’s role” is more appropriate for the Conclusion, and is distracting in the context of a Results section.</p><p>Some subdivision of the larger Results sections would be nice. For example, there are seven paragraphs in the &quot;The amnion initiates EE withdrawal&quot; subsection. Many different ideas and interpretations are reported here, and having subheadings to describe each of these would make the writing more user-friendly to the casual reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13834.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</p><p> <italic>1) Could you add &quot;transgenic&quot; into the Abstract here: &quot;Here we use new fluorescent transgenic lines in the beetle…&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We have added the term and agree with the reviewer that this improves precision.</p><p> <italic>2) I am not sure if eLife has rules concerning figure referencing, but I found it somewhat confusing that figures were referenced out of order throughout the manuscript (for first time they were mentioned).
