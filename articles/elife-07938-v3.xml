We demonstrate that RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) at residue R578, leading to its degradation via ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase (CNOT4). Overexpression of PRMT1 in acute megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines blocks megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by downregulation of RBM15 protein level. Restoring RBM15 protein level rescues megakaryocyte terminal differentiation blocked by PRMT1 overexpression. At the molecular level, RBM15 binds to pre-messenger RNA intronic regions of genes important for megakaryopoiesis such as GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1 and c-MPL. Furthermore, preferential binding of RBM15 to specific intronic regions recruits the splicing factor SF3B1 to the same sites for alternative splicing. Therefore, PRMT1 regulates alternative RNA splicing via reducing RBM15 protein concentration. Targeting PRMT1 may be a curative therapy to restore megakaryocyte differentiation for acute megakaryocytic leukemia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07938.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07938.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07938.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The many different cell types in an adult animal all develop from a single fertilized egg. The development of cells into more specialized cell types is called ‘differentiation’. Proteins and other molecules from both inside and outside of the cells regulate the differentiation process.</p><p>RNA is a molecule that is similar to DNA, and performs several important roles inside cells. Perhaps most importantly, RNA molecules act as messengers and carry genetic instructions during gene expression. RBM15 is an RNA-binding protein that is found throughout nature, and is involved in a number of developmental processes. Previous research has linked the incorrect control of RBM15 with an increased risk of certain cancers, including megakaryocytic leukemia. However, it is not clear what role RNA-binding proteins such as RBM15 play during differentiation.</p><p>Now, Zhang, Tran, Su et al. have investigated the role of RBM15 during the development of large cells found in human bone marrow (called megakaryocytes). First, the experiments demonstrated that an enzyme called PRMT1 modifies RBM15. This enzyme adds a chemical mark called a methyl group at a specific site (an arginine amino acid) on the RNA-binding protein. Next, Zhang, Tran, Su et al. showed that the addition of this methyl group earmarks RBM15 for destruction. This means that an increase in PRMT1 levels reduces the amount of RBM15 in cells, while decreases in PRMT1 have the opposite effect.</p><p>Further experiments showed that RBM15 normally processes the RNA messengers that carry the genetic instructions needed for the differentiation of bone marrow cells. An excess of PRMT1 enzyme leads to a lack of this RNA-binding protein. This in turn interferes with the differentiation process, and can contribute to the development of cancers such as megakaryocytic leukemia. Future work will therefore explore whether targeting PRMT1 with drugs could represent an effective treatment for these kinds of cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07938.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07938.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PRMT1</kwd><kwd>CNOT4</kwd><kwd>RBM15</kwd><kwd>arginine methylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>RNA metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008333</institution-id><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xinyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81270570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yanyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibiting PRMT1 enzymatic activity promotes megakaryocyte terminal differentiation via RBM15-mediated RNA metabolism, which is dysregulated in hematological malignancies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA binding proteins control post-transcriptional processing such as alternative RNA splicing, polyadenylation and protein translation, which is a prevalent part of gene regulation in normal cell differentiation and in cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Klerk and Hoen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>). Arginine methylation of RNA binding proteins by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) regulates RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sinha et al., 2010</xref>), subcellular localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nichols et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tradewell et al., 2012</xref>) as well as the binding affinity to RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rho et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of arginine methylation in regulating protein stability remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that an RNA binding protein, RBM15, is methylated by PRMT1, which triggers its ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase CNOT4.</p><p>RBM15 belongs to the split ends (spen) family of proteins. Spen proteins are evolutionally conserved RNA binding proteins, which are involved in transcriptional regulation of Notch, Wnt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen and Rebay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oswald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rebay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Recently SPEN and RBM15 have been shown to be essential for Xist-mediated X chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minajigi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moindrot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monfort et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that <italic>spen</italic> is required for cell-fate decision during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolodziej et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>FPA,</italic> the <italic>RBM15</italic> homolog in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> controls flowering via regulating alternative polyadenylation of antisense RNAs at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hornyik et al., 2010</xref>). RBM15 is essential for the development of multiple tissues in mouse knockout models, in particular, for the maintenance of the homeostasis of long-term hematopoietic stem cells and for megakaryocyte (MK) and B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raffel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, RBM15 is involved in the chromosome translocation t(1;22), which produces the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mercher et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Spen proteins consist of two domains: an RNA binding domain and a Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal (SPOC) domain. Previously, spen proteins such as RBM15 and SHARP have been shown to use the SPOC domains to recruit histone deacetylases for transcriptional regulation of Notch pathway and steroid receptor-dependent transcriptional regulation, and recruit mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes to promoters for histone H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariyoshi and Schwabe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Skalnik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oswald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, RBM15 is also involved in RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Uranishi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zolotukhin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zolotukhin et al., 2009</xref>). RBM15 resides mainly within nuclear RNA splicing speckles by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horiuchi et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that RBM15 is involved in RNA splicing. However, how spen proteins control cell differentiation is not described at molecular level.</p><p>In this report, we linked cellular differentiation to RBM15-regulated RNA metabolism using MK differentiation as a model. We demonstrated that RBM15 binds to specific introns of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) of genes such as <italic>RUNX1, GATA1</italic> and <italic>TPOR</italic> (aka <italic>c-MPL</italic> or <italic>MPL</italic>), which play critical roles in MK differentiation, and to 3’UTRs of genes involved in RNA splicing and metabolic regulation. Reducing RBM15 protein concentration by PRMT1-mediated methylation favors the production of the alternatively spliced isoforms: RUNX1a, GATA1s and c-MPL-exon9-, a truncated c-MPL isoform. We also found that RBM15 promotes MK maturation in human primary cells. Therefore, PRMT1-RBM15 pathway fine-tunes cell differentiation via controlling the RBM15 protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RBM15 is methylated by PRMT1</title><p>In AMKL, MK differentiation is blocked. Gene expression data from AMKL patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourquin et al., 2006</xref>) shows a higher PRMT1 expression level than other types of acute myeloid leukemia.

Given that the V2 contains additional amino acids in the N terminal region relative to V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), it is striking that the PRMT1 V2 is primarily responsible for the dimethylation of RBM15 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In vitro methylation assays showed that the RBM15 peptide was dimethylated as efficiently as the histone H4 peptide without monomethylated peptides detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>).

Only the WT RBM15 protein but not the R578K mutant was effectively dimethylated by PRMT1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results together with in vivo methylation data collectively argue that mono-methylated RBM15 is a transient intermediate in vivo.</p><p>To confirm that PRMT1 is responsible for in vivo methylation, we made MEG-01 stable cell lines expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNA against PRMT1.

When the leukemia cells were treated with DB75 (a PRMT1 inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yan et al., 2014</xref>), RBM15 methylation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Therefore, we concluded that PRMT1 enzymatic activity is responsible for the methylation of RBM15 at R578. RBM15 might be methylated by other PRMTs and at other sites since some methylation signals, especially the monomethylation signals, are present despite PRMT1 knock-down or inhibition and in the R578K mutant.

When MEG-01 cells were treated with DB75, CNOT4 knockdown did not further stabilize the RBM15 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results confirm that methylation is required for the subsequent degradation of the RBM15 protein. We used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology to knockout one allele of CNOT4 gene in 293T cells. We also found that removal of one allele of CNOT4 stabilized the endogenous RBM15 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B&amp;C</xref>).</p><p>We then purified the RBM15 and CNOT4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to do in vitro ubiquitylaton assay. The methylated RBM15 protein (Flag-tagged) by PRMT1 was more efficiently ubiquitylated by CNOT4 than the purified RBM15 R578 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> compare lane 5 to lane 3). Taken together, we demonstrated that the RBM15 protein stability is negatively regulated by PRMT1-mediated methylation at R578, and CNOT4 is an E3 ligase responsible for degrading the methylated RBM15. To understand further whether the methylation site on RBM15 is sufficient to bind to CNOT4 complex, we synthesized two RBM15 peptides covering the arginine methylation sites to pull-down CNOT4 from cell extract. The di-methylated peptide bound specifically to the CNOT4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which is agreeable with the coimmunprecipitation data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> showing that CNOT4 only interacted with WT RBM15 proteins. This result implies that either CNOT4 or subunits in the CNOT4 complex directly interacts with RBM15 via the methylation mark.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PRMT1 V2 inhibits MK maturation via a methylation-ubiquitylation switch on RBM15</title><p>PRMT1 RNA levels were measured in isolated mouse long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSC), progenitor cells and terminally differentiated lineages. PRMT1 expression level was the lowest in LT-HSC and higher especially in myeloid progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Megakaryocyte-–erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) cells expressed the highest level of PRMT1. We also checked the expression of PRMT1 and RBM15 in human cells with HemaExplorer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagger et al., 2013</xref>). The expression profiles of PRMT1 and RBM15 in different lineages are shared between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). The mRNA level of RBM15 does not change as dramatically as that of PRMT1 among different lineages, which implies that post-transcriptional modification such as arginine methylation of RBM15 might contribute to the regulation of RBM15 protein levels.</p><p>To understand the biological functions of PRMT1 in MK differentiation, we used phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to stimulate MEG-01 cells into mature MK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ogura et al., 1988</xref>). Upon PMA stimulation, we observed upregulation of the RBM15 protein within 12 hr and simultaneous down-regulation of the PRMT1 V2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> left and middle panels). During the incubation period, neither the RBM15 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel) nor the total PRMT1 protein level (mainly V1 isoform) changed more than 1.5-folds, nevertheless we found that RBM15 protein level was significantly increased. The methyl-RBM15 level reduced coinciding with the decrease of the isoform V2 protein (detected by V2-specific antibody). Thus we conclude the isoform V2 –mediated methylation is one mechanism for upregulating RBM15 protein level, although we cannot rule out other possibilities such as enhanced protein translation. To assess RBM15 effects on MK differentiation, we ectopically expressed the WT and the R578K mutant proteins in MEG-01 cells by retroviruses. After stimulation with PMA for 7 days, more CD41<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) as well as higher levels of polyploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) were detected.

Compared with the control, DB75-treated cells produced a higher percentage of CD61<sup>+</sup>CD42<sup>+</sup> mature MK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Conversely, ectopic expression of PRMT1 V2 in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells promoted the generation of single positive CD61<sup>+</sup> MK progenitor cells but blocked MK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Overexpression of RBM15 or RBM15 R578K rescued MK differentiation in CD34+ cells expressing PRMT1 V2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Mass spectrometry analysis showed that RBM15 was associated with ASH2 and WTAP, two known RBM15-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horiuchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Skalnik, 2012</xref>) as well as proteins involved in RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), which is consistent with prior findings that RBM15 resides in nuclear splicing speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horiuchi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that RBM15 might regulate alternative splicing. We performed RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) under stringent wash conditions with an RBM15 antibody recognizing the N-terminal region, followed by real-time polychromase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect genes known to be important for MK differentiation. We detected the bindings of RUNX1, GATA1 and c-MPL mRNAs with RBM15, while we did not detect that of control GAPDH mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Then we took an unbiased approach to identify global RBM15 target genes using RIP-seq. We have identified 1297 genes to which RBM15 binds directly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Fifty-five percent of RBM15 binding sites are in intronic regions and 41% are in 3’UTR regions, with the remainder in 5’UTRs and CDS elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis showed RBM15 regulates genes involved in differentiation and signal transduction via binding to intronic regions, whereas genes involved in RNA splicing and metabolic pathways were regulated via binding to 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C&amp;D</xref>). We found that overexpression of PRMT1 V1 and V2 isoforms as well as reducing the expression level of RBM15 enhanced mitochondria biogenesis in MEG-01 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which implies that PRMT1-RBM15 axis regulates metabolism.

Conversely, overexpression of RBM15 reversed the ratio of GATA1fl/GATA1s in favor of GATA1fl. The RBM15 R578K protein, which is more stable, altered the ratio more than the WT RBM15. Furthermore, overexpression of V2 in MEG-01 cells reduced the ratio of GATA1fl to GATA1s, similar to the effect of RBM15 knockdown. When we used inducible cell lines to knockdown PRMT1, we observed a higher ratio of GATA1fl/GATA1s-like in cells overexpressing RBM15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To further probe the importance of PRMT1 enzymatic activity in alternative splicing, we used PRMT1 inhibitor DB75 to treat MEG-01 cells, CMK cells and CMY cells, which all derived from AMKL leukemia patients. All three AMKL cell lines had higher GATA1fl/GATA1s ratio when treated with DB75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both isoforms of GATA1 can support MK differentiation, but only GATA1s supports unrestricted proliferation due to losing the interaction with E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, fine-tuning the ratio between two different GATA1 isoforms regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of MK progenitors.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07938.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Methylation of RBM15 controls alternative splicing of genes (<italic>RUNX1, GATA1</italic> and <italic>c-MPL</italic>) important for MK differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alternative splicing of RUNX1, GATA1, c-MPL in MEG-01 cells and MEG-01-derived stable cell lines overexpressing RBM15 and PRMT1 V2 or knocking down RBM15 and PRMT1 V2.

RBM15 bound to RUNX1 pre-mRNA in intronic regions and in 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The MISO program found that RUNX1 is alternatively spliced by skipping exon 6, which generates RUNX1-Exon 6<sup>-</sup> protein.

Given that RBM15 binds to the 3’UTR in exon 8 as well as to intronic regions flanking exon 7a, we investigated whether knockdown of RBM15 causes alternative 3’UTR usage to generate RUNX1a, which uses exon7a’ 3’UTR. In RBM15 knock-down MEG-01 cells, the ratio between RUNX1a and RUNX1b,c switched in favor of RUNX1a. RUNX1a, which lacks the transactivation domain, acts as a dominant negative regulator to antagonize the function of RUNX1b,c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ran et al., 2013a</xref>). Increasing the amount of RUNX1a may interfere with the differentiation into mature MKs. Consistent with RBM15 knockdown data, we showed that overexpression of RBM15 as well as knockdown of PRMT1 tilted the isoform balance toward RUNX1b,c. In agreement with the PRMT1 knockdown data, overexpression of PRMT1 V2 switched the ratio in favor of RUNX1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> middle panel).</p><p>The thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR, aka. c-MPL) is upregulated during MK differentiation. <italic>c-MPL</italic> has at least four described isoforms in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using reported primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2000</xref>) to amplify cDNA from MEG-01 cells, we found an additional band on the PAGE gel, which was identified as an undescribed isoform lacking exon 9 (c-MPL-exon9-–) through sequencing. The c-MPL-exon9– mRNA was predicted to yield a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus we designed specific primer spanning the junction between exon 8 and 10 to detect c-MPL-exon9– mRNA. We also used a pair of primers, the forward primer spanning exon 8 and 9 and the reverse primer annealing to exon 9, to detect the full-length MPL (i.e. c-MPL-exon 9+). The c-MPL-exon9-–/c-MPL-exon9+ ratio was higher in favor of c-MPL-exon9- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom panel) when RBM15 protein level is reduced. Furthermore, when RBM15 or RBM15 R578K was overexpressed, the ratio was down in favor of c-MPL-exon9+. Given that c-MPL exon9+ is required for MK differentiation, the data further support for the positive role of RBM15 at MK maturation. All other isoforms with part of exon 9 or with both exon 9 and 10 missing were spliced in the same way by RBM15-PRMT1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, RBM15 enhances the inclusion of exons to produce full-length functional c-MPL like in RUNX1’s case.

Furthermore, we confirmed the interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody for Flag-tagged RBM15 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and with anti-RBM15 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To further confirm that PRMT1 enzymatic activity is important for alternative RNA splicing, we inhibited PRMT1 activity with DB75 or shPRMT1. The interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 was subject to methylation regulation. One simple explanation is that RBM15 might recruit more SF3B1 because of more RBM15 and SF3B1 proteins available. It is also possible that methylation might be directly involved in RBM15 and SF3B1 interaction. Given that co-immunoprecipitation assays cannot distinguish the direct and indirect protein-–protein interaction in a protein complex, interaction of RBM15 with SF3B1 only implies that RBM15 recruits the 3’RNA splicing complex. Since SF3B1 is often mutated in leukemia cells, we sequenced the <italic>SF3B1</italic> gene in MEG-01 cells and confirmed that <italic>SF3B1</italic> was not mutated in this cell line.

We validated the RIP-seq data by real-time PCR with primer sets covering the GATA1 intron 1. Analysis of immunoprecipitated RNA associated with SF3B1 indicated that SF3B1 also preferentially bound to the same region that RBM15 bound to. Furthermore, with RBM15 knockdown, less SF3B1 was associated with GATA1 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). On the other hand, GAPDH has similar level of SF3B1 binding to introns regardless of RBM15 expression level. Thus, RBM15 is responsible for recruiting SF3B1 to pre-mRNA molecules. In this case, RBM15 facilitates the inclusion of GATA1 exon 2. For c-MPL pre-mRNA, RBM15 preferentially bound to the intron 8 and 10 of the pre-mRNA molecules with two distinct peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> left), while SF3B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> right) did bind to regions between the two RBM15 bound peaks at higher level than other regions.

In this case, RBM15 functions as a splicing enhancer for inclusion of exons 9 and 10. In aggregate, these data show that RBM15 is responsible for recruiting SF3B1 containing branch point recognition complex to introns, and methylation controls the RBM15 dosage thereby controlling alternative RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report here that PRMT1 V2 dimethylates RBM15 within the sequence (LYRDRDR(me2)DLY). Although the most common sequence for arginine methylation is arginine flanked by glycines, PRMT1 has been previously reported to methylate arginines in PGC1-α and in RUNX1 flanked by other amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teyssier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Recent proteomics work further proves that the methylation motif can be very diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Since we can still detect a low level of mono-methylation signal after R578K mutation, we believe that the mono-methylation signals come from additional arginines methylated by PRMT1 or other arginine methyltransferases. Protein mono-methylation sites, in general, are redundant and prevalent and are catalyzed by multiple protein arginine methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dhar et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, these potential sites are not involved in methylation-mediated ubiquitylation. Another surprising result is that the V2 isoform, which contains additional amino acids on the N-terminus, primarily dimethylates RBM15 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Data from PMA-treated MEG-01 cells argue that the V2 isoform is more relevant to MK maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although it has been demonstrated that V1 and V2 have different substrate specificities in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulet et al., 2007</xref>), RBM15 is the first V2-specific substrate identified. Of note, the V2 isoform only comprises less than 5% of total PRMT1 level, but V2 is mainly responsible for oncogenic activities in colon and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papadokostopoulou et al., 2009</xref>). We cannot completely exclude a role for V1 in RBM15 methylation due to the inability to knockdown V1 specifically. Because developing inhibitors specific for PRMT1 V2 isoform will potentially alleviate off-target effects, which remain a major impediment for developing anti-PRMT1 inhibitors, our data offers new clues on how to achieve V2-specific inhibition. RBM15 is involved in chromosome translocation t(1;22), which produces the fusion product RBM15-MKL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mercher et al., 2001</xref>). Whether the fusion protein, which retains R578, is methylated by PRMT1 is still an unanswered question.</p><p>It was previously reported that methylation of a transcriptional coactivator p/CIP by PRMT4 or CARM1 leads to its degradation, however the mechanism was incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naeem et al., 2007</xref>). Here we report that PRMT1 methylation triggers protein degradation via ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase CNOT4. CNOT4 is loosely associated with the other subunits of CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lau et al., 2009</xref>).

Given that RBM15 interacts with histone methyltransferases complexes to maintain histone H3K4 methylation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Skalnik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>), our data provide new insights into a potential crosstalk between methyltransferases and demethylases.</p><p>Recently, the E3 ligase WWP2 has been shown to recognize the methylated lysine in SOX2 through its HECT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Given that CNOT4 is within a large CCR4-NOT complex with nine subunits, we have not determined which domain in CNOT4 or other subunits of CCR4-NOT complex recognizes the methylated RBM15. The peptide pull-down experiments strongly support that methylated region on RBM15 is sufficient for binding to CNOT4. Since we found that the RING domain on CNOT4 alone was not sufficient for binding to methylated RBM15 (data not shown), it is possible that more than one region on CNOT4 or other subunits in CCR4-NOT complex might interact with RBM15.</p><p>In order to investigate the biological significance of PRMT1-mediated methylation of RBM15, we analyzed the role of PRMT1-RBM15 axis in hematopoiesis. Normal MK differentiation can be divided into two phases: from hematopoietic stem cells to MK progenitor cells and from MK progenitor cells into mature polyploidy MK cells. Genes such as ARHGEF1 (ARHGEF1,2 are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) play opposite roles at different phases of MK differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). The number of MEP progenitor cells increases, while the polypoidy of mature MKs decreases in <italic>Rbm15</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niu et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, RBM15 knockdown in human primary cells like Rbm15 knockdown in mice produces low percentage of mature MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). PRMT1 promotes the production of MEP cells, but PRMT1 has to be turned off to generate mature, polyploid CD41<sup>+</sup>/CD61<sup>+</sup>CD42<sup>+</sup> MK cells. Because both PRMT1 and RBM15 are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, PRMT1-–RBM15 might regulate differentiation in the same fashion in other tissues such as cardiac tissue, spleen and placenta where RBM15 has been shown to be essential for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raffel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>According to the Oncomine database (www.oncomine.com), PRMT1 is highly expressed in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia (AML and ALL) as well as in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>). PRMT1 accounts for 4% gene mutations, amplifications and deletions in solid tumors (see www.cbioportal.org) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2013</xref>).

A PRMT1-mediated MK block may therefore be contributory to AMKL leukemogenesis.

This type of regulation is very important for HSCs to respond quickly to ever-changing environmental clues.</p><p>RBM15 by binding to introns flanking the alternatively spliced exons enhances the inclusion of the exons to produce full length c-MPL mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In the case of GATA1, RBM15 binds to intron 1 to recruit SF3B1 to the same location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As a result, RBM15 enhances the inclusion of exon 2 to generate the GATA1fl mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). RBM15 facilitates the production of more full-length RUNX1b,c by skipping the exon that encodes RUNX1a. Knockdown RBM15 also facilitate the generation of RUNX1-exon6-<sup>–</sup>. Based on our proteomic data, RBM15 binds to RNA binding proteins that are involved in RNA surveillance, transport and degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Consistently, we also detected association of RBM15 with matured mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, RBM15 associates with transcriptional elongation factors such as Tho2 and CTR9 besides its role in transcription initiation by positively regulating histone H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that RBM15 participates in regulating the whole lifecycle of a messenger RNA. This is reminiscent of the functions of CCR4-NOT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller and Reese, 2012</xref>). RBM15 has been shown to be a part of RBM20-mediated RNA splicing network in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maatz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raffel et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, RBM15 is involved in the development of other tissues in addition to hematopoiesis. Further experiments to define the specificity and affinity of RBM15 binding sequences will help us to understand the mechanisms of alternative splicing mediated by RBM15.</p><p>Apart from binding to introns, RBM15 binds to 3’UTR of metabolic enzymes, splicing factors as well as a few long noncoding RNA molecules and microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Given that splicing factors can be involved in alternative RNA polyadenylation and RNA export, it is not surprising that RBM15 binds to 3’UTRs for alternative RNA polyadenylation, export as well as for RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castelo-Branco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kyburz et al., 2006</xref>). Analysis by the MISO program indicates that RBM15 regulates alternative RNA splicing of genes such as HK1 by binding to 3’UTR. In the future, deeper sequencing of RNA samples and performing high-resolution PAR-CLIP assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>) with RBM15 antibodies will further define the RBM15-mediated RNA metabolism.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrated a new role for PRMT1 in regulating RNA metabolism. Given that both RBM15 and PRMT1 are evolutionarily conserved proteins from plants to mammals, our studies on the PRMT1-–RBM15 pathway offer mechanistic insights into how <italic>RBM15</italic> may regulate cell fate decision in multi-cellular organisms at post-transcriptional levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Using BPPM technology to profile PRMT1 methylated proteins</title><p>To reveal proteome-wide substrates of protein methyltransferases such as PRMT1 in the context of complex cellular components, we took advantage of the emerging BPPM technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang and Luo, 2013</xref>). In BPPM, designated methyltransferases are engineered to process sulfonium-alkyl SAM analogues as alternative cofactors and thus transfer the distinct sulfonium alkyl handles to substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Because the alkyl handles contain a terminal-alkyne for the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (the click reaction), we can then couple the chemical moiety with a biotin-containing azide probe for amenable target enrichment and characterization. With the previously-identified Y39F-M48G PRMT1 mutant and the matched 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl SAM (Pob-SAM) as BPPM reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), RBM15 in the context of Meg-01 cells was readily labeled by the enzyme-–cofactor pair, modified by a biotin-containing azide probe, and enriched by streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As the negative control, the label efficiency dropped significantly in the absence of the Y39F-M48G PRMT1 variant. The tagged proteins were subsequently purified with streptavidin beads for mass spectrometry analysis. RBM15 was identified among the methylated proteins. We verified the mass spectrometry data with direct WB with RBM15 antibody against biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To further map the RBM15 methylation sites, Flag-tagged RBM15 protein was purified from transient transfected 293T cells for tandem mass spectrometry analysis. A mono-methylation site was found at R578, which lies between the RNA-binding domain and the SPOC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The human RBM15 cDNA in pCDNA3 vector was kindly provided by Dr. Barbara Felber (NIH).

And are the observed changes in splicing sufficient to modulate aspects of cell differentiation? While it is possible that RBM15 coordinates multiple events, each contributing to differentiation, previous work in cancer cells has shown that modulation of specific, prominent alternative splicing events by 2'-O-methyl-phosphothiate antisense oligonucleotides can influence cellular phenotypes in a background of multiple transcriptome changes (Bechara Mol Cell 2013; Maimon et al Cell Reports 2014).</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the overall quality of dimethyl-R WB is not good enough, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C, F, G</xref>.

Given that RBM15-mediated splicing regulation controls the three key transcription factors RUNX1, TAL1 and GATA1 for megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation, our data provides compelling evidence that RBM15-mediated splicing regulates differentiation. We agree that additional experiments would be required to determine the precise contribution of RBM15-dependent events relative to other drivers of MK differentiation. Similarly, to identify precisely which RBM15-regulated alternative splicing event(s) is specifically implicated in MK differentiation is an important question, but not a trivial one, and we feel that addressing this would be beyond the scope of the current study. We have toned down our statements and conclusions regarding this aspect of our results. Our data support that RBM15 contributes to but is not solely sufficient for MK development.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The role of PRMT1 in regulating RBM15 levels is very convincing. The conclusion that RBM15 functions by recruiting SF3B1 is less convincing. Of multiple general splicing factors found to interact with RBM15, what is the rationale for focusing on RBM15 and not for example U2AF? Is the loss of SF3B1 binding following knockdown of RBM15 specific to SF3B1? If other general splicing factors were analyzed similarly would the results be the same or different? Were the coimmunoprecipitations used to detect the RBM15-SF3B1 interaction performed in the presence of RNAse used to rule out RNA bridging effects?</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for pointing out the role of PRMT1 in regulating RBM15 levels very convincing. The immunofluorescent staining data from Horiuchi et al., 2013, as well as from our unpublished immunofluorescent staining data demonstrated that RBM15 colocalizes with splicing speckles, which implies that RBM15 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing or at least in some step along the mRNA maturation pathway. By clustering proteins found in mass spectrometry analysis, we showed that a large proportion of RBM15-associated proteins are involved in many steps of RNA processing. Given that RBM15 binds to intronic regions, we focused on SF3B1 which is a core general splicing factor interacting with introns. In addition, SF3B1 is often mutated in myeloid dysplasia syndrome a pre-leukemic disease often associated with defects in MK development. Moreover, since SF3B1 is a component of the U2 snRNP, which itself depends on previous recruitment of U2AF to the polypyrimidine stretch/3’AG region in order to stably interact with the branch point, we reasoned that assessing SF3B1 binding should serve as a surrogate measure of constitutive splicing factor interactions with 3’ splice sites. That being said, U2AF is mutated in hematological malignancies as well. Intriguingly mutations in U2AF and SF3B1 are often mutually exclusive from each other in hematological malignancies (Patnaik et al., 2013). Both U2AFand SF3B1 are within the A complex, but RBM15 might bind to U2AF in the E complex before interacting with the A complex. Further biochemistry experiments with a splicing minigene reporter and in vitro splicing assays would be required to dissect the precise molecular mechanism by which RBM15 regulates splicing, which we are definitely planning to pursue with our collaborators, but which we feel, falls beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>We would like to point out that we did mention in the Methods section (subheading “Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblot analysis”) that we included RNase A for the co-immunoprecipitation assays. So the interaction between SF3B1 and RBM15 is a protein-protein interaction, not mediated via an RNA moiety, although we cannot exclude at this point the possibility that the interaction might be mediated via other protein subunits in the U2 snRNP.</p><p><italic>2) The authors propose that RBM15 affects megakaryocytic development by regulating splicing of specific pre-mRNAs such as MPL1 and GATA1. As a control, can the authors show that knockdown of MPL1 and GATA1 leads to a similar cellular phenotype as knockdown of RBM15.</italic></p><p>We did not knockdown MPL and GATA1 in our assays. However we cite compelling evidences from literature including using mouse knockout models showing that <italic>RUNX1, MPL, TAL1</italic> and <italic>GATA1</italic> are essential genes for megakaryocyte differentiation (Lacombe et al., 2013; Pimkin et al., 2014). We knocked down RUNX1 in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and we did observe the defects in megakaryocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Given that <italic>RBM15</italic> controls the alternative splicing of these essential genes for megakaryocyte differentiation including <italic>TAL1</italic> as we have now shown by RNA-seq analysis in the revised manuscript, it would be very challenging to correct one gene’s alternative splicing to restore the megakaryocyte differentiation defects caused by RBM15 knockdown. It was previously reported (Xiao et. al. 2014) by our collaborator Dr. Raffel that overexpression of MPL alone fails to rescue the MK differentiation of RBM15 knock-out cells, so we envisage that it might be the joint contribution of more than one RBM15 target that regulates this process.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07938.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown RUNX1 in CD34<sup>+</sup> cord blood cells block megakaryocyte differentiation.</title><p>Two shRNA against RUNX1 were expressed by retroviruses.

The interactions of RBFOX2 or PABPC4 with the RBM15-bound RNA elements are pure predictions of bioinformatics analysis. We have shown that PABPC4 interacts with RBM15 in mass spectrometry analysis. Whether RBFOX2 interacts with RBM15 protein is not known. We will need to validate the interactions with co-immunoprecipitation assays and gene knockdown assays. So in the revised manuscript, we deleted the predicted motifs for RBFOX2 and PABPC4. We agree with the reviewers that finding the overlapping targets determined by RIP-seq and by RNA-seq upon RBM15 knockdown is very interesting and needed to understand the roles of RBM15 in RNA metabolism. We have now included this analysis in the revised manuscript, leaving out the more speculative data and discussion regarding RBFOX2 and PABPC4.</p><p><italic>4) While the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are consistent with the possibility that RBM15/PRMT1 control differentiation by modulating alternative splicing of target genes like GATA1, RUNX1 and/or c-MPL, these data do not formally demonstrate that this is the case. It is clear that knock down or overexpression of RBM15 can regulate alternative splicing of these genes, but are the actual changes in RBM15 protein levels expression observed during differentiation sufficient to explain the observed changes in splicing? And are the observed changes in splicing sufficient to modulate aspects of cell differentiation? While it is possible that RBM15 coordinates multiple events, each contributing to differentiation, previous work in cancer cells has shown that modulation of specific, prominent alternative splicing events by 2'-O-methyl-phosphothiate antisense oligonucleotides can influence cellular phenotypes in a background of multiple transcriptome changes (Bechara Mol Cell 2013; Maimon et al Cell Reports 2014).</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we showed that during megakaryocyte differentiation of primary CD34<sup>+</sup> cells alternative splicing changes in the same fashion as directly manipulating RBM15 dosages in leukemia cells. When we treated the primary cells with PRMT1 inhibitors, we observed that the splicing patterns change like that in RBM15 overexpression.</p><p>Our data showed that multiple splicing events regulated by RBM15 collectively stimulate MK differentiation. It is hard to conclude that splicing regulation is sufficient for MK differentiation, since RBM15 also participates in regulations of RNA export, and as well in epigenetic regulation such as binding to Xist RNA, controlling histone H3K4 trimethylation (our unpublished data). One of our co-author Dr. Glen Raffel has tried and failed to rescue MK differentiation using the RBM15 knockout cells by overexpressing MPL gene. The results were presented in the blood paper (Xiao et al., 2014). Given that multiple transcription factors genes essential for megakaryocyte differentiation such as <italic>GATA1, RUNX1, TAL1, GFIB</italic> and <italic>FLI1</italic> are affected and knockout of any one of these transcription factors will lead to MK differentiation defect, correcting splicing of one transcription factor may not be enough. Using oligonucleotides to correct RNA splicing defects has been used successfully for muscle diseases, and would be a very interesting and an important experiment to do with therapeutic potentials in acute megakaryocytic leukemia with chromosome translocation t(1;22) which produces RBM15-MKl1 fusion. To give definitive answer to this question needs to do more screening to narrow down which gene can rescue MK differentiation by cDNA overexpression first before designing oligos to correct splicing.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the overall quality of dimethyl-R WB is not good enough, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C, F</xref>, G.

So knocking down any one of these transcription factors such as RUNX1 blocks megakaryocyte differentiation as we showed to the reviewers. On the other hand, overexpressing any of these transcription factors individually may not rescue MK differentiation due to stoichiometric changes of transcription factors binding to a given promoter.</p><p>Dr. Lausen’s group has demonstrated that forced expression of RUNX1 did promote MK differentiation (Kuvardina et al., 2015). From our own data, we know that RUNX1 directly activates the transcription of RBM15 gene. Here in panel A, we knocked down RUNX1 by two different shRNAs in HEL cells. We detected the expression levels of RUNX1 and RBM15 were decreased in the RUNX1 knockdown cells by real time PCR assays. Furthermore, we detected that RUNX1 binds to RBM15 promoter specifically in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), as controls RUNX1 did not bind to RBM15 promoter in HEL cells with RUNX1 knock down. These results were consistent with RUNX1 and RUNX1-ETO ChIP-seq data in literature (GSE24674, GSE42075, GSE46044, GSE43834). Thus, RUNX1-mediated rescue of MK differentiation in RBM15 knockdown cells is not due to the correction of RBM15-mediated RNA splicing but rather due to the activation of RBM15 gene expression by RUNX1. Increased expression of RBM15 by RUNX1-mediated transcriptional activation will further correct the alternative splicing of genes like GATA1 and TAL1 etc.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07938.032</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07938.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07938.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07938-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) Data demonstrating the specific effects of RBM15 on SF3B1 recruitment are not provided.
