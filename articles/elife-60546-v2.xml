recognize certain odors to avoid predators, seek food, and find mates. Innate odor preference is thought to be genetically hardwired. Here we report that acquisition of innate odor recognition requires spontaneous neural activity and is influenced by sensory experience during early postnatal development. Genetic silencing of mouse olfactory sensory neurons during the critical period has little impact on odor sensitivity, discrimination, and recognition later in life. However, it abolishes innate odor preference and alters the patterns of activation in brain centers. Exposure to innately recognized odors during the critical period abolishes the associated valence in adulthood in an odor-specific manner. The changes are associated with broadened projection of olfactory sensory neurons and expression of axon guidance molecules. Thus, a delicate balance of neural activity is needed during the critical period in establishing innate odor preference and convergent axon input is required to encode innate odor valence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innate odor preference</kwd><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd><kwd>experiential activity</kwd><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>OSN projection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC008003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC014701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC016696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A delicate balance of neural activity is required during critical period in establishing innate odor preference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Behavioral characteristics are often described as either acquired or innate. While most environmental stimuli do not carry obvious ethological values, animals can develop characteristic responses through associative learning and assign valence to individual stimuli. Animals also react innately to some stimuli with instinctive responses that are thought to be pre-programmed in the neural circuits. These stereotypic responses likely have evolved to deal with stimuli in the animalâs immediate environment that carry information about the inherent values of the signals. Odor-based predator avoidance, food seeking, pheromone-induced territorial aggression, and mating are examples of such innate responses. The exhibition of stereotypical responses to these stimuli often has an onset associated with developmental stages and does not require any prior experience. In most sensory systems, circuit modification by sensory experience underlies behavioral adaptation. In the mammalian brain, circuit connections are sensitive to sensory deprivation during early postnatal development in a time window defined as the critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubel and Wiesel, 1970</xref>). Learning further modifies circuit connections to allow flexible assignment of valence to specific sensory stimuli. Circuit motifs such as divergent paths and opposing components allow adaptive changes that are thought to mediate these flexible assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tye, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, innate behaviors are defined by stereotypical responses to the stimuli without prior experiences or associative learning, suggesting that neural circuits processing the inherent valence of stimuli are genetically hardwired to channel sensory information directly to the motor or endocrine output.</p><p>The olfactory system mediates both learned and innate responses to odor stimuli. A repertoire ofÂ ~1000 functional odorant receptors (ORs), 15 TAARs, and a family of MS4A receptors detect volatile odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pacifico et al., 2012</xref>). Olfactory sensory neuronsÂ (OSNs) expressing the same OR converge their axons into a few glomeruli stereotypically positioned in the olfactory bulb forming a topographic map to encode odor quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axel, 2005</xref>). Odors activate disparate sets of glomeruli and the patterns are transformed by the mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb before the information is passed to the olfactory cortices. The patterns of activity in the cortical areas can be learned through association with other stimuli. Mice are also intrinsically attracted by food odors and conspecific urine but avoid odors from decomposing flesh or predators. The dorsal area of the olfactory bulb is shown to be required for innate responses to aversive odors; other studies have shown that a few ORs are both sufficient and necessary to trigger innate responses to specific odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">PÃ©rez-GÃ³mez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, recent studies have indicated that innately recognized odors are encoded by more flexible ensemble activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is not known whether neural circuits that underlie innate responses are influenced by sensory experience or subject to changes of neural activity during development. In postnatal development of the olfactory system, OSNs fire spontaneous action potentials originating from ligand-independent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). The receptor activities drive specific temporal patterns of action potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakashima et al., 2019</xref>). Spontaneous activity influences the development of the olfactory glomerular map during the critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai and Barnea, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), which persists into adulthood. Interestingly, the critical period in development coincides with a form of learning in young animals. Early olfactory experiences are critical for filial learning and attachment to the maternal odor environment in ewes and rodents, nest recognition in songbirds, and kin recognition in fish and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caspers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerlach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofer et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polan and Hofer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Porter et al., 1978</xref>). Notably, exposure-based learning during early infancy via olfactory imprinting differs from odor learning in adulthood. Pairing odor with an unconditioned painful stimulus produces attachment in pups instead of aversion as found in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sullivan et al., 2000</xref>). Given the importance of the critical period in shaping olfactory experience, we wonder whether changes caused by levels of spontaneous activity or odor experience have any impact on innate odor-evoked behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spontaneous activity of the OSNs is required for innate odor recognition</title><p>In previous studies, we developed a genetic approach to silence spontaneous activity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aâi</xref>).

We performed electrophysiological recordings from the DOX-treated mice (referred to as the Kir2.1-off mice) in adulthood. OSNs expressing various ORs exhibit various firing patterns. Random sampling from a heterogeneous population of OSNs would not provide a precise measure of spontaneous firing. We, therefore, used cell-attached patch clamp to record spontaneous activity from the dendritic knobs of sensory neurons expressing the <italic>Olfr160</italic> (<italic>M72)</italic> gene in the <italic>Olfr160-IRES-tauGFP</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feinstein and Mombaerts, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bâi</xref>). Neurons in Kir2.1-off mice displayed similar inter-spike intervals and spontaneous firing rates compared to those in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bâiiâiv</xref>). We next conducted electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings to measure the field potential of odor-evoked responses. We found that there was no discernible difference in the amplitude and time course of odor-evoked responses between control and Kir2.1-off mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, DOX treatment restored neural activity in the OSNs of Kir2.1-off animals.</p><p>We next tested innate odor preference in the Kir2.1-off mice using the PROBES system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). This assay exploited the animalâs natural tendency to investigate a stimulus. We measured the duration of odor source investigation and compared it to the no odor period. The level of investigation indicated odor preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). Control mice exhibited increased frequency and duration in sniffing the odor port during the presentation of peanut butterÂ (PB) odor or mouse urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The increase in investigation sustained into the second and third presentations. In contrast, when odors aversive to the animals were presented the first time, control mice approached the odor port at a level similar to that of air control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, at the second presentation, we observed a marked reduction in the investigation of the odor port. It was likely that the investigative behavior during the first odor presentation was driven by two conflicting drives: risk assessment (approaching) and avoidance. To have a consistent measurement of odor preference we combined the changes at the first and second odor epochs into a single index to measure the innate behavioral preference (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>From this assay it was clear that odors of PB and mouse urine elicited strong attraction when compared with monomolecular odors that were generally considered neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, the Kir2.1-off mice did not exhibit attraction to food and conspecific urine odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>). The level of investigation of the odor port was comparable to those of the neutral odors and did not sustain after the first presentation. Control mice also showed a much lower preference towards odors considered as aversive, including coyote urine (CU), 2-phenylethylamine (PEA), 2-methylbutyric acid (2-MBA), and isoamylamine (IAMM). The Kir2.1-off mice, on the contrary, continued to investigate the aversive odors at a level similar to that for the neutral odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EÂ andÂ F</xref>). These results indicated that silencing OSNs during early postnatal development impaired the ability of the mice to recognize the valence of the ethologically relevant odors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Exposure during critical period alters innate odor recognition</title><p>The loss of innate odor preference following neuronal silencing during postnatal development was surprising. It suggested that the neural circuits processing innate valence were plastic during development. We hypothesized that this developmental plasticity would allow the early olfactory experience to influence odor-evoked innate responses later in life. We chose PEA as an aversive odor to test this hypothesis since it specifically activated the TAAR4 receptor, which is necessary for PEA-induced aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We put an odor tube in the cages where the pups were raised during the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The concentration of PEA in the cage was comparable with that used for behavioral tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Following another 7 weeks without exposure, we examined the animalsâ response to PEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test whether the influence of PEA was restricted to a specific time window, we exposed another group of animals to PEA between postnatal days 24 and 38, followed by testing at 9 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine the odor specificity of this change in responses, we also tested behavioral response to IAMM, which elicited innate aversion but was not exposed to the animals during these periods.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Early postnatal exposure to odors alters innate odor recognition in adulthood.</title><p>(<bold>AÂ andÂ B</bold>) Schematic illustration of the experimental paradigms.

These mice, however, still exhibited aversive response to IAMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The timing of PEA exposure also had a profound impact on odor aversion in adults. In contrast to the early postnatally exposed mice, animals that had late exposure to PEA exhibited aversion to both PEA and IAMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>). Thus, the effect we have observed for the P0âP14 animals was not due to odor adaptation from persistent exposure but reflected a profound change in how PEA was perceived.</p><p>How does early PEA exposure change valence? One possibility is that the innate association between odor identity and valence is perturbed. This would be similar to the results observed in the neuronal silencing experiments. Another possibility is that through exposure, the aversive odor also acquires positive valence, as suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sullivan et al., 2000</xref>). In the latter scenario, pre-exposure to an attractive odor will not alter the positive valence. We, therefore, tested the perinatal exposure to attractive odors. We used TMA, which has been characterized as attractive in past studies, and PB odor. In both cases, perinatal exposure extinguished innate attraction in the adults for the odor exposed, but not the un-exposed odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EÂ andÂ F</xref>). Taken together, these results showed that odor exposure disrupted odor association with valence rather than counterbalancing it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural activities influence axon projection pattern of TAAR4 expressing neurons</title><p>How does temporary suppression of action potentials, or the exposure to aversive odor during early postnatal development abolish innate odor preference? Odor valence could be conveyed by specific parts of the olfactory bulb. For example, the dorsal bulb was shown to be required for conveying aversive information of aversive odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, a highly specific link between the ORs, a set of mitral/tufted cells, and their downstream targets could be established through genetically specified hardwiring regardless of the spatial locations where the receptor neurons project. In previous studies, we have shown that suppression of neural activity during early development caused the olfactory axons expressing the same receptor to innervate multiple glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). We also found that the OSNs projected to the same dorsalâventral and anteriorâposterior position of the olfactory bulb where wild-type axons innervated, suggesting that the general topology of OSN innervation remained intact and the OR gene expression was maintained. However, it was not known whether the broadened projection patterns also applied to receptor neurons that transmit identity information of innately recognized odors.</p><p>We, therefore, examined whether the OSNs detecting an aversive odor maintain their projection specificity.

To examine whether the loss of aversion was due to compromised detection of these odors, we tested the detection of PEA in Kir2.1-off and PEA-exposed animals.

Specifically, we aimed to test the animalsâ innate ability to discriminate odors without prior exposure. To achieve this goal, we adopted the cross habituation assay using PROBES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). This assay exploited the animalâs natural tendency toward habituation following repeated exposures to the same stimulus carrying no apparent value and novelty seeking behavior when a new stimulus was presented after habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We measured the duration of odor source investigation and normalized the values to that during the control (no odor) period to derive normalized port investigation (NPI) values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>) (also see Materials and methods). These NPI values allowed us to compare among animals with varied individual behavior readout. We then used ÎNPI, the difference between NPI values for the novel and habituated odors, to measure discrimination between the odors. For eight pairs of mono-molecular odorants tested, the Kir2.1-off mice could discriminate them all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The scores for the Kir2.1-off mice were higher than those of the controls for some odors but not the others. None of the differences was statistically significant. Thus, the Kir2.1-off mice were not deficient in discriminating odors under naÃ¯ve conditions. We also tested discrimination between PEA and a neutral odor, eugenol, in the Kir2.1-off and PEA exposed mice. In both experiments, the animals were able to discriminate between the two odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1EÂ andÂ F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested the ability of odor discrimination and associative learning in Kir2.1-off mice with the reinforced two-choice assay. In this assay, water-restricted mice learned to distinguish a pair of odors and associate them with the spatial location of water ports in order to receive water reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>). The assay not only required the animals to discriminate odors, but also assigned valence to the odors. Both control and Kir2.1-off mice achievedÂ ~90% success rate after training to discriminate a pair of mono-molecular odors, AA, and heptanal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and between a pair of complex odors, lemon and maple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In tests using lower concentrations of odors, we observed a similar decline in accuracy between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EÂ andÂ F</xref>). These results indicated that the Kir2.1-off mice not only could discriminate odors, but also could recognize individual odors and associate them with the correct water ports.

In one scenario, mitral/tufted cell dendrites are connected to OSNs in the same glomerulus regardless of the ORs they express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aâii</xref>).

We used antibodies against GFP to label <italic>Olfr160</italic> (<italic>M72</italic>) expressing axons and stained against olfactory marker protein (OMP) or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) to label the glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keller and Margolis, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Terkelsen et al., 1989</xref>). In control mice, glomeruli innervated by the M72 axons were filled with GFP expressing fibers and exhibited near complete signal overlap between GFP and OMP, or GFP and NCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâiÂ andÂ ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A-iÂ andÂ ii</xref>). In Kir2.1-off mice, many glomeruli receiving M72 fibers contained regions that were OMP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâiiiÂ and iv</xref>) or NCAM+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AiiiÂ and iv</xref>) but GFPâ, indicating that the glomeruli containing the M72 axons were innervated by axons expressing other receptors. Quantitative analysis revealed that glomeruli exhibited varied levels of innervation by the GFP-labeled axons for M72-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bâv</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) even though the glomerular size remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bâvi</xref>).</p><p>If the mitral cell dendrites were to match the axons, their projection pattern must be compartmentalized as well. To compare the level of compartmentalization, we analyzed glomerular occupancy by OSN axons and by mitral cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CÂ andÂ D</xref>). To distinguish the two patterns, we applied a series of spatial filters of increasing sizes to tile the glomeruli and quantified the number of filters containing fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CÂ andÂ D</xref>). As filter size increased, glomerular occupancy increased and eventually reached 100% when the filter reached the size of the glomerulus. This rate of increase was fast for projections that distributed widely, but slow for those concentrated in small areas. This analysis showed that the axons from Kir2.1-off mice were compartmentalized. At filter size of 6 pixels, these axons occupiedÂ ~40% of the glomeruli compared to 100% in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâiiiÂ andÂ iv</xref>). The dendrites of the mitral cells, in contrast, did not project to more than one glomerulus. Within the glomerulus, they projected broadly into all parts of the glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) in both wild-type and Kir2.1-off mice. They showed identical distribution and the same rates of increase with filter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-iiiÂ andÂ iv</xref>). The mismatch between the axon and dendritic projection patterns indicated that in the Kir2.1-off mice, OSNs expressing a particular OR were connected with different mitral cells and vice versa. Individual mitral cells were likely to receive input from multiple receptor types. Because odor identities are encoded by the population response of mitral/tufted cells, a change in the connection between the OSNs and the mitral cells, therefore, would alter the identity of the odors intrinsically embedded by a genetic program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transcriptomic changes in response to silencing and activation</title><p>The observation that silencing OSNs and persistent odor exposure altered axon projection raised the question as to what the mechanism was in driving these changes.

Odor information is processed by multiple pathways in the brain. Whereas the anterior olfactory nucleus and the piriform cortex are involved in channeling odor information regardless of their valence, other brain areas were associated with odor valence. Positive valence is generally associated with the medial amygdaloid nucleus (postdorsal area; MePD and posteroventral area; MePV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>).

The discovery that the circuit for innate odor perception is malleable shows that circuits processing innate responses are not fully hardwired in the mammalian brain. They are subject to influence by both spontaneous and experiential activities. Importantly, this plasticity is only observed in the early postnatal period when the olfactory map is still developing and when projection patterns are susceptible to different perturbations but retain their capacity to recover when perturbations are removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai and Barnea, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). These findings show that as a general principle, neural activities regulate the development of sensory circuits in the mammalian nervous system.</p><p>Neural activities have a broad impact on the establishment of the neural circuits. The role played by neural activities in shaping the olfactory circuits appears different from that of other sensory systems. Visual input, for instance, is required for the segregation of ocular-specific input in the lateral geniculate and in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shatz and Stryker, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>). Dark rearing delays the binocular segregation, as well as the closure of the critical period in the visual cortex. In contrast, spontaneous activities, not odor exposure per se, are required for the convergence of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). Past studies have shown that pairing an odor with an aversive unconditioned stimulus can lead to enlarged glomeruli corresponding to the cognate receptor, enhanced transmitter release at the OSN termini, and heightened sensitivity to odor stimulation in the interneuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattarai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dias and Ressler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kass and McGann, 2017</xref>). Early exposure of odorants can also lead to increased expression of OR genes and enlarged olfactory glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Todrank et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we further show that persistent stimulation by an innately aversive odor can lead to broadened axon projection and alter the innate valence of the odor.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms that specify connections between the OSNs and the mitral/tufted cells are not fully understood. A set of guidance molecules have been proposed to drive the sorting and convergence of axons expressing the same OR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaneko-Goto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takeuchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takeuchi and Sakano, 2014</xref>). The expression of these molecules is activityÂ dependent, relying on ligand-independent activation of the ORs, as well as specific firing patterns of OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakashima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, a broad survey of transcriptomic changes in Kir2.1 mice revealed that suppression of the spontaneous activity of the neurons alters the expression of specific guidance and cell adhesion molecules in the OSNs. The data is consistent with previous reports of expression level changes associated with neural activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakashima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Odor exposure primarily activates a small set of neurons expressing the cognate receptors. Activation of these neurons may change guidance molecules in these neurons, leading to altered axon projection. On the other hand, prolonged exposure may also lead to habituation and reduced activities. In our experiments, PEA exposure does not induce a broad change in gene expression associated with axon guidance as the Kir2.1 expression does. Nonetheless, it affects the expression of a small subset of genes that are also downregulated in the Kir2.1 mice. Although it is not clear how PEA exposure influences the expression of these genes at a similar level as Kir2.1, the changes are specific to only to these few genes. It will be interesting to investigate the mechanism by which the changes occur. Notably, <italic>Contactin4</italic> and <italic>Clstn2</italic> genes are downregulated by both silencing of the OSNs and PEA exposure. Although <italic>Clstn2</italic> has been implicated in axon guidance, its role in the olfactory system is not known. Our data indicate that it may serve as a potential regulator of olfactory axon guidance. Our transcriptome analysis provides support for a mechanism in which silencing neurons, or selectively activating some neurons, changes the expression of guidance molecules by overriding the activity patterns dictated by ligand-independent activities of ORs, thereby affecting projection patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Glomerular convergence, odor sensitivity, and discrimination</title><p>A previous study reported olfactory defects when examining mice with ectopic expression of Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lorenzon et al., 2015</xref>). The observations were likely caused by the continuous expression of Kir2.1 channel in OSNs, which not only suppressed the spontaneous activities of the neurons but also reduced odor-evoked responses. In our study, by contrast, the Kir2.1-off mice were fed with DOX after the critical period to restore neural activities. These experiments were not complicated by the effect of suppressed neuronal responses.</p><p>In the Kir2.1-off mice, the olfactory map was imprinted from the early developmental stage. The axon projection patterns were permanently altered from single receptor type convergence into a pattern with individual glomerulus receiving innervation from multiple receptor type axons. These mice provided a unique opportunity to test the contribution of the single receptor type convergence on odor sensitivity, discrimination, and association. In wild-type mice, errors in the convergence of axons expressing the same OR into their perspective glomeruli are rarely observed. In both wild-type and in mice with genetic manipulations to alter axon projection patterns, ectopic glomeruli can be pruned during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai and Barnea, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zou et al., 2004</xref>). A robust mechanism that maintains the convergent projection pattern has likely been selected during evolution to serve important functions, including odor recognition and discrimination. It is therefore surprising to find that Kir2.1-off mice do not have major defects in odor detection, discrimination, and association. The single receptor type convergence does not appear to be required for these functions. In light of its role in innate odor perception (see below), we reason that one function of the convergent olfactory map is to provide consistency in odor perception among individuals. Alternatively, the convergent map may offer an advantage in fine odor discrimination that is not captured by our current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gronowitz et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Plasticity in innate odor perception</title><p>Adaptive changes in innate odor perception are likely shaped by evolution to accommodate specific living environments. Amines are commonly found in urine, but different species excrete different types. PEA is enriched in carnivore urine and is avoided by rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrero et al., 2011</xref>). Rats also avoid TMA but mice do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The divergent response in the rodent species has been proposed to be associated with the divergent biosynthesis pathway. Mouse urine containsÂ &gt;1000 ÃÂ the concentration of TMA than rat. Whereas evolution may have led to divergent neuronal connections that contribute to the differential response, it is also possible that the exposure to TMA after birth eliminates aversion in mice. The change in valence is bi-directional as exposure to TMA at a higher concentration eliminates TMA attraction in the exposed mice.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated adaptive responses to semiochemicals in the vomeronasal organ and in the main olfactory system through sexually dimorphic and activity-dependent alteration of responsive cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).

Our study reveals that the altered response to PEA is associated with divergence of the axon projection of the TAAR4 expressing OSNs. Although this is a decrease in TAAR4 expression following PEA exposure, the change is not significant enough to change detection and discrimination of PEA in the adults.</p><p>Our results show that perturbing the convergent pattern through either transient silencing or activation of the OSNs is associated with altered innate behavioral responses to both attractive and aversive odors. Because Kir2.1 mediated neuronal silencing affects not only the OSNs, but also the vomeronasal neurons. This raises the possibility that the loss of attraction to urine could be attributed to the loss of pheromone sensing as a teaching signal. While this remains a possibility, it does not explain the loss of innate responses to food or predator odors.</p><p>The divergent projection of OSNs does not affect the single glomerular projection of the primary dendrites of the mitral/tufted cells. This result reaffirms the previous observations that OSN axons and mitral cell dendrites develop independently and are highly stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mizrahi and Katz, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, it extends the previous studies by showing that it is unlikely to be a strict molecular identity code that matches OSN axons with mitral cell dendrites as the two show different compartmentalization patterns in the glomeruli. This observation is consistent with a recent study showing that mitral cell dendrites mostly project to the spatially proximal glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishizumi et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that glomerular convergence is critical for innate coding of odor identity. It is likely that specific sets of glomeruli and the mitral/tufted cells innervating these glomeruli carry information about the identities of innately recognized odors. This stereotyped connection provides a substrate for the alteration of innate preference by altering the projection patterns of OSN axons.</p><p>Notably, although OSN axons project to multiple glomeruli in the Kir2.1-off as well as in odor-exposed mice, they maintain their general dorsalâventral and anteriorâposterior position in the bulb. For odors activating receptor neurons that innervate the dorsal area of the glomeruli, this broad spatial target is not sufficient to assign negative valence to the odors and generate aversive responses, even though the dorsal bulb is shown to be required to convey negative valence information for odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Glomerular convergence and innate valence</title><p>How is valence information encoded for innately recognized odors? Our data show that altered innate responses are associated with changes in the convergence pattern of axons of OSNs in an odorant specific manner. Although the association may not be causal, the evidence strongly suggests that the divergent projection is a common mechanism that alters altered innate odor recognition. Broad changes in the convergent pattern by suppression of spontaneous activity impact all odors we examined. On the other hand, divergent of TAAR4 axons is related to neutralized perception of PEA, but not other odors. It is likely that the activation of a specific set of glomeruli activates the mitral/tufted cells that are connected with brain centers that control appetitive or aversive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Perturbation of the projection pattern of OSN axons disrupts this association. Our experiments demonstrate that the mitral cells maintain the connection with individual glomeruli without discriminating the different types of axons. One possibility is that the mitral cells maintain specific connections with downstream behavioral centers in such a way that divergent innervation of glomeruli activates additional mitral/tufted cell populations, leading to the activation of brain centers that drive opposing behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This antagonism may lead to the loss of innate preference associated with specific odors.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Models of encoding innate valence of odors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type connections model. The activation of specific glomeruli leads to the activation of specific sets of mitral/tufted cells that connect to behavioral centers. Color indicates different associated valence. For simplicity, only single glomeruli for each valence is depicted. Odor identities are abstracted as single nodes. (<bold>B</bold>) Altered axon innervation model.

The change in activity pattern of the mitral/tufted cells is not the result of direct relay from the glomerular activation but the result of intercell interactions within the olfactory bulb. This change results in the recoding of odor identities (gray nodes) by the mitral cells, leading to the appetitive or aversive responses to be abolished.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60546-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>An alternative, but not mutually exclusive scenario is that the change in OSN projection patterns leads to the recoding of odor identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Odor identities are represented by population responses of the mitral/tufted cells. The patterns of activation are not strictly determined by the direct relay from activated glomeruli but by the result of interactions among cells within the neuronal network. Innately recognized odors are represented by specific sets of neurons whose connections to the valence centers are strongly biased toward one appetitive or aversive pathway. This association, while genetically specified, is flexible and can also be modified. Developmental perturbations could alter the way odor identities are represented by activating a different set of neurons in the olfactory pathway. An altered representation would eliminate the biased activation of brain centers driving appetitive or aversive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In some case, it may also create new valence association. This model is consistent with emerging evidence that suggests innate preference is context dependent and has strong interactions among olfactory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saraiva et al., 2016</xref>). It is also consistent with evidence that ethologically relevant odors are encoded similarly as ordinary odors in cortical structures thought to encode innate preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is possible, even likely, that neuronal connections in the brain areas associated with odor identity and valence are influenced by spontaneous neuronal activity and odor experience. For example, the innervation of additional glomeruli may create association of an odor with brain areas to assign new valence. These changes may occur independently of the changes in the olfactory bulb. Our current study does not address these possibilities but provides a basis for further investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Each animal was tested with a total of two odors in two separate experiments with at least 1 week between tests. After being habituated to the testing environment for half an hour, the animals were put into a 20 Ã 20 cm chamber for behavioral experiments. The chamber had a nose cone on one of the side wall 5 cm above the base plate. Odors were delivered through the nose cone by the olfactometer. A vacuum tube connected on the opposite wall of the nose cone provided an air flow to remove residual odors after odor delivery. Pure odorants were diluted into mineral oils at 1:1000 (v/v) in most cases. 10 ml/min air flow carried the saturated odor out from the odor vial and was further diluted into a 90 ml/min carrier air to make the final dilution to 10<sup>â4</sup> (v/v).

Rabbit or rat anti-NCAM (1:400), chicken anti-GFP (1:400), goat anti-OMP (1:400), rabbit anti-MOR28 (1:500), rabbit anti-Phospho-S6 (1:1000), and guinea pig anti-TAAR4 (1:500) antibodies in PBST were used to stain the section overnight at 4Â°C or room temperature. Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Donkey anti-Rabbit 488, Goat anti-Guinea Pig Alexa Fluor 488, andÂ Goat anti-Guinea Pig Alexa Fluor 568) were diluted to 1:1000 in PBST for staining overnight. TOTO-3 or DAPI was used for nuclear staining.</p><p>Mitral cell dendritic tuft labeling was performed by iontophoresis method (Stimulus isolator A360, World Precision Instrument. 2.5 Î¼A, 2 Hz, 5â10 min) of biotinylated dextran amines (BDA, 3000 MW, Life Technology) into the dorsal and median of mitral cell layers in olfactory bulb. Animals were perfused with 1Ã PBS with 4% PFA 12 hr after labeling. The olfactory bulb was dissected and post-fixed with 4% PFA at 4Â°C overnight, and then sectioned at 50 Âµm thickness with vibratome (Leica VT 1000 s). The sections were then stained with 2 Âµg/ml streptavidin Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate and DAPI.</p><p>All images were taken on a Zeiss LSM510, LSM700, or Zeiss 510 LIVE confocal system. For co-localization analysis, an image stack was scanned using multi-track method and a maximal projection of the stack was obtained. Co-localization coefficient was calculated as the percentage of GFP positive pixels over the NCAM positive pixels within a glomerulus. For mitral cell labeling, Z-stack confocal images were obtained for dendrite tracing. For interneuron staining, cells in the glomeruli layer with positive staining were counted using ImageJ. Glomeruli numbers were calculated by DAPI staining.</p><p>Glomerulus occupancy were calculated using a custom-written script in ImageJ. Images were Z projected using maximum projection method in ImageJ and a hard threshold was applied to obtain binary images. After the glomerulus is circumscribed, a series of spatial filters with increasing pixel sizes (1â20 pixels) were applied to tile the glomeruli. Each filter containing a positive signal is considered to be occupied. Glomerular occupancy was quantified by computing the percentage of filters with a signal in the circumscribed glomerulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 mapping of odor-evoked activity</title><p>For pS6 staining, animals were single housed and habituated in home cages for 7 days with a glass vial covered with a plastic cover, which was punched with seven holes for odor evaporation and avoiding physical contact to chemicals. For habituation, a small piece of cotton nestlet soaked with 500 Âµl mineral oil was put inside the vial. Vials were changed every day at 1Â hr after light cycle. On day 8, new glass vial with cotton nestlet soaked with 500 Âµl PEA, 2-MBA at 1:10<sup>3</sup> dilution in mineral oil, or freshly collected male or female urine was added in the home cages. One hour after odor stimulation, mice were sacrificed and intracardiac perfused with 4% PFA. The mouse brains were dissected and then post-fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C.</p><p>The phospho-S6 immunochemistry histology was performed based on the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knight et al., 2012</xref>) with some modifications. The entire brain was cut into 50 Âµm thick serial sections using a Leica vibratome (VT1000S). Rabbit anti-phospho-S6 antibody (1:1000 dilution) and the 3 p peptide (25 nM, synthesized by United Peptide and has the sequence biotin-QIAKRRRLpSpSLRApSTSKSESSQK, where pS is phosphoserine) in 1Ã PBST were used at 4Â°C overnight. Tiled images were acquired using Olympus VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope, or PE Ultraview spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer) which were stitched together using the Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Different brain nuclei were identified based on the brain atlas (The Mouse Brain Stereotaxic Coordinates, third/fourth edition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paxinos and Franklin, 2013</xref>). The pS6 immuno-positive neurons were counted using ImageJ. For quantification the two sides of the brain were treated independently and the following numbers of sections were used: anterior hypothalamic area, anterior part (AHA), four sections at â0.85Â toÂ â1.05 mm from Bregma; medial amygdaloid nucleus (postdorsal area; MePD and posteroventral area; MePV) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (ventrolateral area; VMHvl), fiveÂ sections between â1.35Â andÂ â1.60 mm from Bregma; hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) in the 2-MBA case, four sections between â1.80Â andÂ â2.00 mm from Bregma; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), threeÂ sections between 0.10Â andÂ 0.25 mm from Bregma; anterior cortical amygdaloid area (ACo), fourÂ sections at â1.00Â toÂ â1.20 mm from Bregma; posterolateral cortical amygdaloid area (PLCo), fiveÂ sections at â1.35Â toÂ â1.60 mm from Bregma; paraventricular thalamic nucleus, anterior part (PVA), fourÂ sections at â0.25Â toÂ â0.45 mm from Bregma; piriform cortex (Pir), fiveÂ sections at â1.35Â toÂ â1.60 mm from Bregma; basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, anterior part (BLA), five sections at â1.10Â toÂ â1.35 mm from Bregma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Odor exposure</title><p>For early odor exposure experiments, odorants are either soaked in a cotton nestlet (1 ml 1:100 PEA in mineral oil, or 85 mM TMA in water) or in solid form (1Â g PB) placed in a glass vial inside the home cage. A single hole punched in the lid allows odor to diffuse. The odor vial was changed daily with fresh prepared odors. For the P0â14, the home cage contains both mother and pups. After the odor stimulation period, the animals were raised regularly without the odor vials till 9 weeks for behavior and histology experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measuring odor concentration in home cage</title><p>Odor concentrations in home cage were measured by miniPID (200B, Aurora Scientific Inc). A glass vial containing 1 ml 1:100 v/v PEA was placed in the center of a clean cage. A baseline was collected from another clean cage without odor vial. Then the inlet of the miniPID was placed at various distances from the odor vial opening. Signals from the miniPID were digitized by MiniDigi-1B (Molecular Devices) at 1 kHz and low pass filtered (10 Hz) in pCLAMP10.3 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bulk RNA sequencing</title><p>Kir2.1 pups and their littermates, and CD-1 pups treated from birth and the control pups were sacrificed at postnatal day 5. Whole olfactory epithelia were removed from individual samples and deposited directly into TRIzol solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA miniprep plus (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Sequencing libraries for the Kir2.1 experiment were generated with Illumina's mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit (Cat#RS-930â1001), using standard poly-A tail selection protocols, and were sequenced as 40 bp single-end unstranded reads on Illumina's C4D679 platform. Sequencing libraries for PEA-treated samples were generated using Illumina's TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Cat#RS-122-2301and Cat#RS-122â2302), which utilizes RiboZero Gold rRNA Removal. The libraries were subsequently sequenced as 150 bp single-end stranded reads on Illumina's NextSeq 500 platform. FASTQ files were generated using bcl2fastq v2.18. FastQC v0.11.7 was implemented to generate reports for each sample to ensure sequencing quality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Selective-alignment and transcript quantification</title><p>With Salmon v1.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) we performed a selective alignment of the raw FASTQ reads to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> transcriptome (GRCm38, ENSEMBL Release 100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2020</xref>). To minimize the potential for reads of genomic origin mapping spuriously to the transcriptome we included the whole reference genome as an alignment decoy for the creation of the Salmon index. We concatenated the whole genome and transcriptome FASTA reference files into a single file, âgentrome.faâ, and input this into the command, âsalmon index --<monospace>kmerLen</monospace> 31 --<monospace>transcripts gentrome.fa</monospace> --<monospace>decoys decoys.txt</monospace> --<monospace>index salmon_index</monospace>â, where the k-mer length was 31, âdecoys.txtâ was a one column list containing the identifiers for each chromosome or scaffold in the reference genome, and âsalmon_indexâ was the directory name for the output index. Estimates of transcript-level expression were generated for each sample FASTQ by calling âsalmon quant --<monospace>index salmon_index -libType SR</monospace> --<monospace>unmatedReads sample.fq</monospace> --<monospace>seqBias</monospace> --<monospace>gcBias</monospace>â. Here âSRâ indicated a reverse-stranded single-end read library, and the options âseqBiasâ and âgcBiasâ employed algorithms to correct for sequence-specific and GC biases, respectively. The output transcript-level count-estimates were subsequently grouped and summed on their ENSEMBL parent-gene identifiers for downstream gene-level analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Differential expression</title><p>Salmon count estimates were imported into R v4.0.3 with tximport v1.18.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soneson et al., 2016</xref>). The PEA and Kir2.1 dataÂ sets were analyzed separately for differential gene expression with DESeq2 v1.30.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The âDESeqâ function takes as input the raw gene counts, a data table of the sample IDs and independent variables, and the experimental design formula; it then normalizes the raw gene counts to account for variation in read-depth between samples, calculates gene-wise dispersion estimates, and finally implements a Wald test for the significance of each coefficient in the negative binomial generalized linear model. Tests for differential gene expression were performed with an assigned significance threshold of FDRÂ â¤Â 0.05. Estimates of log<sub>2</sub> fold-change were shrunk using the <italic>apeglm</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).

This is a novel concept, and an interesting topic, as the neural basis underlying innate odor responses in the mouse remains poorly investigated. The manuscript in its current form presents a lot of data, albeit mostly correlational. It seems that either increasing or decreasing sensory neuron activity can perturb innate responses- these findings suggest that a delicate activity balance is important, yet underlying mechanisms are not clear. In general data related to behavior and sensory neuron projections (Figures 1-4) are more compelling than cFos data and arguments for mitral cell connectivity (Figures 5-8). Overall, there are some novel findings that will be interesting to the field, but mechanistic uncertainty remains.</p><p>1. I am surprised that critical period odor exposure broadens connectivity patterns to multiple glomeruli. This seems counterintuitive, as activity-dependent refinement is thought to promote target selectivity. How could this be occurring mechanistically?</p><p>2. On a related note, mice are presumably supplied with the TAAR5 agonist (trimethylamine) in their rearing cage from parental odors. This should cause normal spreading of TAAR5 glomeruli in wt mice- from prior publications though (for example Johnson, Barnea 2012), there do not seem to be more TAAR5 glomeruli than TAAR4 glomeruli, but maybe this should be re-examined with existing antibodies. How general is this phenomenon of odor-evoked connectivity broadening- does it extend to odorant receptors too?</p><p>3. There is substantial evidence that attraction to volatile urinary cues and to food odors is learned rather than innate. Perhaps loss of volatile pheromone attraction is due to loss of attraction to the UCS darcin â if darcin is no longer attractive, then it cannot serve as a positive-valence teaching signal to entrain volatile odor attraction. In this model, Kir2.1 manipulations would really be having their effect on darcin-activated vomeronasal circuits, which are not investigated or at least discussed.</p><p>4. As a side note, the model put forward could very well explain how 'innate responses' vary across species. For example, mice do not avoid the urinary odor/TAAR5 agonist trimethylamine while rats do. Since trimethylamine is abundant in mouse urine, perhaps early exposure helps override what would otherwise be a developmentally induced aversion. Likewise, carnivore odors such as PEA likely evoke different reactions in mice than in the carnivore species that produce them, and similar mechanisms could be at play to help ensure species-appropriate responses. It may be interesting to discuss further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Qiu et al. examined the consequences of suppressing neuronal activity (via OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2.1 mice) during the development of the olfactory epithelium on innate odor preferences. They found that suppressing neuronal activity abolished such preferences. Additionally, exposure to an aversive odorant during development abolished innate aversive in adults. Both manipulations led to altered glomerular targeting without affecting responses and behaviors neutral odorants. These manipulations also affected the number of cells in downstream brain regions that were activated by innate odors. Combined, this manuscript contains interesting findings about the plasticity of innate odor responses, extends the author's prior work on critical periods for glomerular targeting, and provides new data on the functional consequences of manipulating olfactory system activity during early developing. I find the observation that early manipulations seem to specifically abolish innately valenced responses to odors to be incredibly important- it seems like an experiment someone should have done long ago, and this will be an significant contribution to the literature. This experiment opens up a lot of future work and will potentially cause real rethinking in the field. On the other hand, the main weaknesses here are mechanistic â there isn't a clear story that emerges either about how valence is established, or about how the specific manipulations abolish innate odor valence.</p><p>1. The link between the two experiments used throughout this manuscript (suppressing activity in OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2.1 mice and early exposure to PEA) is conceptually unclear. In the former, the authors suppressed neuronal activity early in development, whereas in the latter activity is presumably increased via the daily exposure. However, both manipulations resulted in the same behavioral phenotype (the lack of avoidance in adults) as well as similar deficits in glomerular targeting. Although the authors provide models of how the changes in OB wiring could lead to the observed results, further discussion of how these changes emerge (e.g. alterations in axon guidance molecules) and how these opposing manipulations could lead to the same anatomical and behavioral phenotypes is warranted.</p><p>2. How does innate attraction work given these results? Meaning â the old Sullivan paper suggests that early odor exposure assigns appetitive valence to even &quot;aversive&quot; odors. But the PEA experiment doesn't explain to me how positive valence is assigned, it just tells me how to break valence assignment. What is going on there with respect to these findings? In an ideal world, to strengthen these findings the authors should repeat the PEA experiments with appetitive odorants and show that they observe the same effects; this will also show that the results from the TAAR system generalize to other ORs.</p><p>3. The results of the early PEA exposure experiments are intriguing, but further work is necessary to interpret the conclusions from these experiments. First, the authors use a concentration of 1:100 when exposure to Î¼M concentrations (10,000 times less than what was used here) has been shown to suppress Taar4 transcript levels (Dewan 2018). Furthermore, the behavioral results in Figure 2 currently phenocopy the loss of activity in the Kir2.1 animals and the effects in TAAR4-KO animals (Dewan 2013), so it would be good to verify that the manipulations in the odor exposure experiments are indeed elevating activity levels. Therefore, the authors should monitor in more detail the physiological consequences of their early exposure paradigm (e.g. using the methods described in Figure 1B-C) and specifically assess that the high concentrations of odorants used are not reducing the OR levels in TAAR4-expressing neurons or altering the function of these neurons.</p><p>4. As the authors noted, it is surprising that surprising that the Kir2.1-off mice do not have major defects in odor detection, discrimination and association. Does this apply to the innate odorants (which can generally be reassigned meaning through reward): is detection and or discrimination impaired for any the innate odorants? Likewise, is the detection of PEA impaired after the early exposure paradigm?</p><p>5. It would be helpful if the authors could discuss their findings in the context of prior work studying the consequences of odor exposures on olfactory system plasticity and OB glomeruli. As an example, other odor exposure paradigms have resulted in increases in glomerular volume, changes in OSN numbers, or changes in OSN neurotransmitter release, among other effects (see e.g. Kass 2013, Bhattarai 2020, Jones 2008, Todrank 2010, Cadiou 2014, Ibarra-Soria 2017, Xu 2016). The results described in this manuscript differ from some of these; therefore, a more comprehensive discussion of prior work could be useful to contextualize and contrast the findings in this manuscript. There is also prior work on OSN-M/C targeting (e.g. Inoue 2018) and M/C dendritic stability (e.g. Mizrahi and Katz 2003).</p><p>6. The introduction seeks to define differences between innate and learned behaviors, and map this onto predicted differences between circuits; many of the statements that end up being made are both overly didactic and highly debatable. To take just a single example on page 4 â &quot;circuits that underlie innate responses are thought to be insensitive to sensory experiences.&quot; Obviously both worm chemoattraction and fly courtship are innate, hardwired and deeply plastic in response to sensory experience. The first three paragraphs have this quality (e.g., innate behaviors are not the same as fixed action patterns, it is not at all required that circuits that support innate behaviors be insulated from other types of information, what about retinal waves, etc). My advice is pretty simple â just say that we think of behaviors as innate because in adult animals we observe these behaviors and animals execute them without apparent prior experience or training. What this paper does is to go back and ask whether these innate behaviors actually depend upon early experience or neural activity; if so, that has implications for possible circuit mechanisms. Simple will clarify here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The work by Qiu et al. describes experiments using transgenic mice in which spiking is selectively downregulated in OMP-expressing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during the pre-weaning period. The authors find that innate attractive and aversive behavioral responses are lacking in these mice in adulthood. They also show that tonic presentation of an innately aversive odorant during the early postnatal period causes the loss of aversion to that odorant later in life. Both sets of behavioral results appear to correlate with changes in glomerular convergence and the activation of downstream brain regions associated with olfactory valence.</p><p>The strength of this work is that it supports a critical role for early olfactory experience in future assignment of odor valence. Though many of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown/unexplored, this represents a compelling set of data and an important topic in the field. There are some notable limitations to these experiments that, if addressed in text or with inclusion of additional data or analysis, would improve confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>1) In the Discussion (pp 23-24), the authors state: &quot;Our results demonstrate the importance of single glomerulus axon convergence in providing a substrate for innate odor recognition.&quot; This is implying a causative role for the glomerular convergence in the observed changes in valence. This is too strong. These events are correlated, but it does not necessarily follow that the lack of glomerular convergence causes loss of innate valence (while supporting odorant discrimination).</p><p>2) The results in Figure 4 are used to support the claim that DOX+ mice are still able to perform odor discrimination in adulthood. However, these experiments are all on neutral odors even though the central conclusion of the manuscript relates to odors with innate valence. It would improve this core conclusion if the manuscript included data on olfactory discrimination using odors with innate valence. For example, it would be useful to know whether DOX+ adult mice can discriminate PEA (which no longer causes innate aversion for these mice) from neutral or attractive odors.</p><p>3) The experiments present an interesting dichotomy: selectively silencing all OMP+ OSNs or constitutively activating OSNs that sense PEA both result in a loss of innate valence in adulthood. This suggests that the pattern of early postnatal activity in OSNs influences the animal's capacity to express an innate behavioral response to odorants later in life. This is exciting, but begs the question: does chronic postnatal exposure to an innately attractive odor (e.g. peanut oil) result in the same effect? If so, this might provide support for a unified mechanism of valence disruption (e.g. Figure 8). If not, this would still be interesting and would add depth to the study. At a minimum this should be discussed.</p><p>4) The analysis of spiking following DOX treatment in OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2 mice seems to indicate a subtle, but potentially important change in the pattern of DOX+ OSN spiking towards burst-like firing. The ISI distribution appears to be skewed towards lower ISIs, but the analysis related to Figure 1B (a Student's t-test) indicates a lack of statistical significance. A Student's t-test does not seem to be an appropriate test for these non-normally distributed data. Also, there remain fairly meager data related to the transition from near-silence of OSNs in the DOX- case to the DOX+ post-weaning conditions. If this period involves transitions from near-silence to widespread bursting in all OMP+ neurons prior to a mildly bursty adult steady-state, this would seem to be important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60546.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers thought the basic observations of Figures 1/2 to be interesting, that innate aversion responses require the proper level of activity during an early olfactory critical period.

In our study, persistent odor exposure during early development alters the projection of neurons expressing the cognate receptor for the odor, but not others. This is likely due to increased neural activity in these cells, which can also alter their axon targeting. To understand whether the two manipulations share a common mechanism, we performed transcriptome analysis of the olfactory epithelium at postnatal day 5 for control, Kir2.1, and PEA exposed pups. As expected, suppressing neural activity by Kir2.1 expression caused a broad change in the transcriptome associated with neurite growth, synapse formation, ion channels, and intracellular vesicles. Several known molecules involved in olfactory axon guidance were differentially regulated. This was consistent with the observed change in axon projection for all OSN types examined. On the other hand, PEA treatment also caused transcriptome change but there was no GO term standing out. We did observe, however, that a small subset of differentially expressed genes were shared by the two datasets. It included two molecules involved in axons guidance, Calsyntenin 2 and Contactin 4. These new results provide an explanation of how opposite manipulations of neural activity may lead to similar changes in the axon projection pattern. We also have attempted to perform antibody staining to address whether the changes are specific for the TAAR-expressing glomeruli in the PEA-exposed animals. However, the problem with antibodies have prevented us to get this result. We have expanded discussion of potential mechanism by which neural activities drive aberrant glomerular targeting.</p><p>Per recommendation, we also conducted experiment using attractive odors, including the urinary compound TMA, and food odor (peanut butter). In both cases, early postnatal exposure diminished innate preference in an odor-specific manner. Thus, the observation is a general one applying to odors of either valence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript puts forward the interesting idea that olfactory sensory neuron activity during a critical period modulates innate behavioral responses to certain odors, such as attractive food odors/pheromones and aversive predator odors.

Besides examples in the visual and auditory systems, naris occlusion has been shown to delay the pruning of ectopic projections in the olfactory system. Our data with Kir2.1-off mice is consistent with these studies. On the other hand, exposure to a single odorant does not increase sensory-triggered activity across all OSNs, but selectively activates the OSNs expressing the cognate receptors. Only these neurons project to additional glomeruli. This is analogous to an expanded representation of stimuli that are over-represented in the environment, such as the expanded representation of fingers in violin or piano players. We have included the discussion to clarify how OSN axon projection is influenced by neural activities.</p><p>The mechanism that drives the divergent projection is multifold and is an active area of research in our lab. For this study, we have now included transcriptome data, which shows that both silencing and odor exposure have led to dysregulated expression of axon guidance molecules. This provides an explanation as to how the divergent projection takes place. The new data is presented in the new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

According to Li et al., 2013, trimethylamine (TMA) is at a relatively low concentration in female urine (~0.25mM) but high in male urine (~5mM). As the pups mostly grow up with the dams, they are likely exposed to the lower concentration. We have performed experiments to expose the pups to TMA (presented at 85 mM in vial, corresponding to ~5mM in cage). The early exposure abolishes TMA preference in adults. Whether there is an increase in TAAR5 glomeruli in response to TMA is an interesting question. The number of glomeruli innervated by a single type of OSNs varies between the ORs and between animals (Zapiec and Mombaerts, PNAS 2015). In the case of TAAR5, because the animals develop in an environment constantly exposing to TMA, it is not known what the number of glomeruli âshouldâ be in an odor-free environment. We have attempted to examine whether there is a difference in the number of glomeruli between TMA exposed and control animals by antibody staining of the TAAR5 glomeruli. Unfortunately, multiple attempts including using new batches of antibodies and using different protocols were to no avail. It is likely that the antibodies have expired.</p><p>Although we cannot verify a change of the TAAR5 glomeruli in response to TMA exposure, we have verified this observation with other receptors. In a separate study, we have found that in mice exposed to acetophenone, a ligand for the M71 and M72 receptors, OSNs expressing these two receptors also project to multiple glomeruli. Thus, this observation is common to all the receptors we have examined. As this new data is an integral part of another manuscript, in which we show that the Wnt receptor Fzd1 is required to remodel the ectopic projections, we wonât present this result in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It is possible that silencing the neurons during early development disrupts pheromone perception, which in turn disrupts the association of urinary odor with positive valence. In this case, the loss of attractiveness of urine could be secondary to perturbation of pheromone sensing. We now have discussed this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As a side note, the model put forward could very well explain how 'innate responses' vary across species. For example, mice do not avoid the urinary odor/TAAR5 agonist trimethylamine while rats do. Since trimethylamine is abundant in mouse urine, perhaps early exposure helps override what would otherwise be a developmentally induced aversion. Likewise, carnivore odors such as PEA likely evoke different reactions in mice than in the carnivore species that produce them, and similar mechanisms could be at play to help ensure species-appropriate responses. It may be interesting to discuss further.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. The species difference may arise from evolutionary advantages for the detection of species-specific cues. We have included the discussion on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Qiu et al. examined the consequences of suppressing neuronal activity (via OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2.1 mice) during the development of the olfactory epithelium on innate odor preferences. They found that suppressing neuronal activity abolished such preferences. Additionally, exposure to an aversive odorant during development abolished innate aversive in adults. Both manipulations led to altered glomerular targeting without affecting responses and behaviors neutral odorants. These manipulations also affected the number of cells in downstream brain regions that were activated by innate odors. Combined, this manuscript contains interesting findings about the plasticity of innate odor responses, extends the author's prior work on critical periods for glomerular targeting, and provides new data on the functional consequences of manipulating olfactory system activity during early developing. I find the observation that early manipulations seem to specifically abolish innately valenced responses to odors to be incredibly important â it seems like an experiment someone should have done long ago, and this will be an significant contribution to the literature. This experiment opens up a lot of future work and will potentially cause real rethinking in the field. On the other hand, the main weaknesses here are mechanistic â there isn't a clear story that emerges either about how valence is established, or about how the specific manipulations abolish innate odor valence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the encouraging assessment. It has been thought that innate valence is genetically hardwired and is communicated through labeled lines. In a related study (in press at Current Biology), we show that valence information is unlikely transmitted through labeled lines, but through population codes at various processing stages. These results are in line with the study by Illui and Datta showing that the innately recognized odors are not overly represented in the posterolateral cortical amygdala, the âvalence centerâ. Nevertheless, the innate nature of odor valence association suggests that some genetic component must be involved. The current study shows that its establishment requires spontaneous neural activity and can be altered by sensory experience. These results suggest that the connectivity establishing innate valence is more complex than labeled lines. We are actively engaged in pursuing this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The link between the two experiments used throughout this manuscript (suppressing activity in OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2.1 mice and early exposure to PEA) is conceptually unclear. In the former, the authors suppressed neuronal activity early in development, whereas in the latter activity is presumably increased via the daily exposure. However, both manipulations resulted in the same behavioral phenotype (the lack of avoidance in adults) as well as similar deficits in glomerular targeting. Although the authors provide models of how the changes in OB wiring could lead to the observed results, further discussion of how these changes emerge (e.g. alterations in axon guidance molecules) and how these opposing manipulations could lead to the same anatomical and behavioral phenotypes is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>To understand whether the two manipulations share a common mechanism, we performed transcriptome analysis of the olfactory epithelium at postnatal day 5 for control, Kir2.1, and PEA exposed pups. As expected, suppressing neural activity by Kir2.1 expression caused a broad change in the transcriptome associated with neurite growth, synapse formation, ion channels, and intracellular vesicles. Several known molecules involved in olfactory axon guidance were differentially regulated. This was consistent with the observed change in axon projection for all OSN types examined. On the other hand, PEA treatment also caused transcriptome change but there was no GO term standing out. We did observe, however, that a small subset of differentially expressed genes shared by the two datasets. It included two molecules involved in axon guidance, Calsyntenin 2 and Contactin 4. These new results provide an explanation of how opposite manipulations of neural activity may lead to similar changes in axon projection pattern. The data are presented in the new Figure 6. Although we wished to address this question at a finer detail, by examining the changes specifically at the TAAR4 and TAAR5 glomeruli, we were unsuccessful because the antibodies stopped working. These results also raise new questions as to how these transcriptomic changes are induced by neural activity, which we intend to study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How does innate attraction work given these results? Meaning â the old Sullivan paper suggests that early odor exposure assigns appetitive valence to even &quot;aversive&quot; odors. But the PEA experiment doesn't explain to me how positive valence is assigned, it just tells me how to break valence assignment. What is going on there with respect to these findings? In an ideal world, to strengthen these findings the authors should repeat the PEA experiments with appetitive odorants and show that they observe the same effects; this will also show that the results from the TAAR system generalize to other ORs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question and the excellent suggestion. PEA exposure may have changed valence (measured as approach behavior) by one of two mechanisms. One is that the innate association between odor identity and valence is perturbed. This would be similar to the results observed in the neuronal silencing experiments. Another possibility is that through exposure, the aversive odor also acquires positive valence, as suggested by the Sullivan study. In the latter scenario, pre-exposure to an attractive odor wonât break the positive valence. We have tested perinatal exposure to attractive odors. As suggested by Reviewer 1, we have used TMA, which has been characterized as attractive in past studies. In our hand, TMA is less attractive than the compound odors from mouse urine or peanut butter. We also have tested exposure using peanut butter odor. In both cases, perinatal exposure extinguished innate attraction in the adults for the odor exposed, but not the un-exposed odor. This result shows that odor exposure breaks the valence association rather than counterbalance it. The data are presented in the updated Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The results of the early PEA exposure experiments are intriguing, but further work is necessary to interpret the conclusions from these experiments. First, the authors use a concentration of 1:100 when exposure to Î¼M concentrations (10,000 times less than what was used here) has been shown to suppress Taar4 transcript levels (Dewan 2018). Furthermore, the behavioral results in Figure 2 currently phenocopy the loss of activity in the Kir2.1 animals and the effects in TAAR4-KO animals (Dewan 2013), so it would be good to verify that the manipulations in the odor exposure experiments are indeed elevating activity levels. Therefore, the authors should monitor in more detail the physiological consequences of their early exposure paradigm (e.g. using the methods described in Figure 1B-C) and specifically assess that the high concentrations of odorants used are not reducing the OR levels in TAAR4-expressing neurons or altering the function of these neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and apologize for not making clear the rationale of using a high concentration for the odor exposure experiment. Dewan et al. (2013) showed that PEA elicited aversion from 0.005% to100% dilutions. In our study, the concentration for odor exposure was adjusted to how the animals access the odors. For the behavioral test in adults, the animals actively poke the odor port to smell the odor. PEA was tested at 1E-4 dilution, at the lower end of the Dewan et al. study. For early postnatal exposure, the pups were not mobile, and they would not have access to the odor source in the center of the home cage sealed in a lid with small holes. To reach a similar concentration at the pup, a higher concentration in the vial is warranted. We have measured the distribution of odor concentration as a function of distance to the odor vial. At the steady state, the concentration of PEA at 5cm from the source is about 5% of that in the vial (1E-2 dilution). Thus, the pups are estimated to be exposed to PEA at a concentration equivalent to 5E-4 dilution. This measurement is now included in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>We are not able to record directly from the TAAR4 expressing cells because we do not have the GFP-tagged TAAR4 mouse line. Our attempt to stain TAAR4 receptor in the exposed animals was hampered by the problem with the antibodies. From the transcriptomic analyses, we find that TAAR4 expression was consistently reduced in PEA treated animals, even though the change is not considered statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparison. This result is consistent with the Dewan et al. 2018 data and indicated that PEA did activate the TAAR4-expressing neurons. This data is presented in Figure 6G and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As the authors noted, it is surprising that surprising that the Kir2.1-off mice do not have major defects in odor detection, discrimination and association. Does this apply to the innate odorants (which can generally be reassigned meaning through reward): is detection and or discrimination impaired for any the innate odorants? Likewise, is the detection of PEA impaired after the early exposure paradigm?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed experiments to examine the detection threshold of PEA in Kir-off and PEA-exposed mice. We also have examined cross habituation between PEA and eugenol. The results indicate that there is no difference in PEA detection and discrimination. The data are presented in the updated Figure 4âfigure supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It would be helpful if the authors could discuss their findings in the context of prior work studying the consequences of odor exposures on olfactory system plasticity and OB glomeruli. As an example, other odor exposure paradigms have resulted in increases in glomerular volume, changes in OSN numbers, or changes in OSN neurotransmitter release, among other effects (see e.g. Kass 2013, Bhattarai 2020, Jones 2008, Todrank 2010, Cadiou 2014, Ibarra-Soria 2017, Xu 2016). The results described in this manuscript differ from some of these; therefore, a more comprehensive discussion of prior work could be useful to contextualize and contrast the findings in this manuscript. There is also prior work on OSN-M/C targeting (e.g. Inoue 2018) and M/C dendritic stability (e.g. Mizrahi and Katz 2003).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have revised the Discussion with a more contextualized discussion on the two topics. Additional citations have been included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The introduction seeks to define differences between innate and learned behaviors, and map this onto predicted differences between circuits; many of the statements that end up being made are both overly didactic and highly debatable. To take just a single example on page 4 â &quot;circuits that underlie innate responses are thought to be insensitive to sensory experiences.&quot; Obviously both worm chemoattraction and fly courtship are innate, hardwired and deeply plastic in response to sensory experience. The first three paragraphs have this quality (e.g., innate behaviors are not the same as fixed action patterns, it is not at all required that circuits that support innate behaviors be insulated from other types of information, what about retinal waves, etc). My advice is pretty simple â just say that we think of behaviors as innate because in adult animals we observe these behaviors and animals execute them without apparent prior experience or training. What this paper does is to go back and ask whether these innate behaviors actually depend upon early experience or neural activity; if so, that has implications for possible circuit mechanisms. Simple will clarify here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have revised the Introduction to make it more succinct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The work by Qiu et al. describes experiments using transgenic mice in which spiking is selectively downregulated in OMP-expressing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during the pre-weaning period. The authors find that innate attractive and aversive behavioral responses are lacking in these mice in adulthood. They also show that tonic presentation of an innately aversive odorant during the early postnatal period causes the loss of aversion to that odorant later in life. Both sets of behavioral results appear to correlate with changes in glomerular convergence and the activation of downstream brain regions associated with olfactory valence.</p><p>The strength of this work is that it supports a critical role for early olfactory experience in future assignment of odor valence. Though many of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown/unexplored, this represents a compelling set of data and an important topic in the field. There are some notable limitations to these experiments that, if addressed in text or with inclusion of additional data or analysis, would improve confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>1) In the Discussion (pp 23-24), the authors state: &quot;Our results demonstrate the importance of single glomerulus axon convergence in providing a substrate for innate odor recognition.&quot; This is implying a causative role for the glomerular convergence in the observed changes in valence. This is too strong. These events are correlated, but it does not necessarily follow that the lack of glomerular convergence causes loss of innate valence (while supporting odorant discrimination).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion to provide more nuanced conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results in Figure 4 are used to support the claim that DOX+ mice are still able to perform odor discrimination in adulthood. However, these experiments are all on neutral odors even though the central conclusion of the manuscript relates to odors with innate valence. It would improve this core conclusion if the manuscript included data on olfactory discrimination using odors with innate valence. For example, it would be useful to know whether DOX+ adult mice can discriminate PEA (which no longer causes innate aversion for these mice) from neutral or attractive odors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed experiments to examine the detection threshold of PEA and used cross habituation to examine odor discrimination in Kir-off and PEA-exposed mice. The results indicate that there is no difference in PEA detection and discrimination. The data are presented in the updated Figure 4âfigure supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The experiments present an interesting dichotomy: selectively silencing all OMP+ OSNs or constitutively activating OSNs that sense PEA both result in a loss of innate valence in adulthood. This suggests that the pattern of early postnatal activity in OSNs influences the animal's capacity to express an innate behavioral response to odorants later in life. This is exciting, but begs the question: does chronic postnatal exposure to an innately attractive odor (e.g. peanut oil) result in the same effect? If so, this might provide support for a unified mechanism of valence disruption (e.g. Figure 8). If not, this would still be interesting and would add depth to the study. At a minimum this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have conducted experiments for attractive odors, including the urinary compound TMA, and food odor (peanut butter). Early postnatal exposure in both cases diminished innate preference in an odor-specific manner, indicating that this is a general phenomenon. The data is presented in the updated Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The analysis of spiking following DOX treatment in OMP-tTA x tetO-Kir2 mice seems to indicate a subtle, but potentially important change in the pattern of DOX+ OSN spiking towards burst-like firing. The ISI distribution appears to be skewed towards lower ISIs, but the analysis related to Figure 1B (a Student's t-test) indicates a lack of statistical significance. A Student's t-test does not seem to be an appropriate test for these non-normally distributed data. Also, there remain fairly meager data related to the transition from near-silence of OSNs in the DOX- case to the DOX+ post-weaning conditions. If this period involves transitions from near-silence to widespread bursting in all OMP+ neurons prior to a mildly bursty adult steady-state, this would seem to be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. Kir2.1 expression severely dampens spontaneous firing and odor evoked responses. Both may have an impact on odor-guided behaviors and brain activation. Therefore, the recording experiments were primarily designed to ensure that in the Kir2.1-off mice the neurons were able to fire action potentials and respond to odor stimulation. Neurons expressing different odorant receptors have different patterns of spontaneous activity. Although we wish to know whether all OMP+ neurons have been restored to their characteristic firing patterns, the heterogeneity of the OSN neurons makes it impractical to use electrophysiology to monitor the spiking activities. That is why we focused on the M71-GFP neurons to record spiking activities. Since our behavioral and brain activation studies were conducted at the adult stage, we only analyzed the response at this stage.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the ISIs does not follow normal distribution. Theoretically they are thought to follow a Poisson process, but the data suggest that they follow a lognormal distribution. We have updated our plot and performed ANOVA on the mean log (ISI) values, which shows that the two distribution as not different (<italic>p</italic>=0.45).</p></body></sub-article></article>
