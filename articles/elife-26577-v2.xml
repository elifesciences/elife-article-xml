An important subset of membrane proteins have globular, cofactor-containing extracytoplasmic domains requiring the dual action of the co-translational Sec and post-translational Tat pathways for integration. Here, we identify further unexplored families of membrane proteins that are dual Sec-Tat-targeted. We establish that a predicted heme-molybdenum cofactor-containing protein, and a complex polyferredoxin, each require the concerted action of two translocases for their assembly. We determine that the mechanism of handover from Sec to Tat pathway requires the relatively low hydrophobicity of the Tat-dependent transmembrane domain. This, coupled with the presence of C-terminal positive charges, results in abortive insertion of this transmembrane domain by the Sec pathway and its subsequent release at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Together, our data points to a simple unifying mechanism governing the assembly of dual targeted membrane proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26577.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26577.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>Sec pathway</kwd><kwd>Tat pathway</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>None</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L000768/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babot</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchanan</surname><given-names>Grant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K500896/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tooke</surname><given-names>Fiona J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004561/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandra</surname><given-names>Govind</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bioinformatics and experimental approaches identify families of membrane proteins requiring the co-ordinated action of the Sec pathway and Tat pathways for their integration and define features of the polypeptides that mediate interaction with these pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane proteins represent 20–30% of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wallin and von Heijne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>) and they fulfil a wide variety of critical functions in the cell including respiration, photosynthesis, and ion transport, allowing this membrane to act as a tightly controlled barrier between the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment. Cytoplasmic integral membrane proteins adopt α-helical topologies, and in bacteria are inserted via the action of at least one of three protein translocation machineries - the Sec machinery, the YidC insertase and the Tat pathway (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collinson et al., 2015</xref>] for a recent review).</p><p>The SecYEG translocon is the major route by which multi-spanning membrane proteins are integrated into the membrane. The insertion of transmembrane domains of polytopic proteins occurs co-translationally following targeting of the translating ribosome to the Sec machinery through the action of signal recognition particle (SRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ulbrandt et al., 1997</xref>). YidC is positioned close to the lateral gate of SecY and interacts with nascent transmembrane domains to facilitate their integration into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Urbanus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sachelaru et al., 2015</xref>). YidC can also act independently of the Sec system to integrate small (usually mono- or bitopic) membrane proteins directly into the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalbey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samuelson et al., 2000</xref>). The final topology adopted by a polytopic membrane protein depends upon a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors including the hydrophobicity of membrane-spanning regions, the number and location of positively-charged amino acids and the composition of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">White and von Heijne, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cymer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogdanov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Tat system is a post-translational protein transport pathway that operates independently of the Sec and YidC machineries to transport folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kudva et al., 2013</xref>). Proteins are targeted to the Tat machinery by N-terminal signal sequences containing a highly conserved pair of arginine residues that are usually critical for efficient recognition of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanley et al., 2000</xref>). A subset of Tat substrate proteins contain non-covalently bound prosthetic groups such as metal-sulphur clusters or nucleotide-based cofactors, many of which play important roles in respiratory and photosynthetic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmer and Berks, 2012</xref>). Some Tat substrates are also integral membrane proteins. In bacteria Tat-dependent integral membrane proteins generally fall into two classes – those that are N-terminally anchored in the bilayer by a non-cleaved signal sequence, such as the Rieske iron-sulfur proteins for example of <italic>Paracoccus</italic> or <italic>Legionella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Buck et al., 2007</xref>) or the TtrA subunit of <italic>Salmonella</italic> tetrathionate reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">James et al., 2013</xref>) and those that have a single transmembrane helix at their C-termini such as the small subunits of hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jormakka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatzixanthis et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that the Rieske proteins of actinobacteria are highly unusual Tat substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopkins et al., 2014</xref>). Rieske proteins are essential membrane-bound components of cytochrome <italic>bc<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complexes that coordinate an iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster involved in electron transfer from quinones to cytochromes <italic>c<sub>1</sub></italic>/<italic>f</italic> (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baniulis et al., 2008</xref>]). The actinobacterial proteins have three transmembrane domains (TMDs) preceding the Rieske FeS domain, unlike most other Rieske proteins which contain only one TMD. Inspection of actinobacterial Rieske sequences indicates the presence of a predicted twin-arginine motif between TMDs 2 and 3, suggesting the possibility that the concerted action of more than one translocase may be required for correct assembly. Indeed it was shown that the first two TMDs of the <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> Rieske protein, Sco2149, are inserted by the Sec machinery, probably in a co-translational manner, whereas the insertion of TMD3 is dependent on the Tat pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>), providing the first example of these two machineries operating together to assemble a single protein.</p><p>These findings raise a number of pertinent questions about the mechanisms by which these translocases are co-ordinated to ensure that the Sec system does not integrate TMD3 but releases the polypeptide to allow folding of the globular domain, and the subsequent recognition of a membrane-tethered substrate by the Tat pathway. It also raises the question whether actinobacterial Rieske proteins represent an oddity of nature, or whether there are further examples of dual Sec/Tat-targeted membrane proteins to be discovered. Here we have addressed both of these major aspects and show that in addition to Rieske there are at least two further conserved families of dual targeted membrane proteins across bacteria and archaea that each have 5 TMDs. A further family of proteins related to the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> Tat substrate YkuE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monteferrante et al., 2012</xref>) and predicted to have 4TMDs was also identified. A detailed dissection of the features of the transmembrane regions of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Rieske reveals that the relatively low hydrophobicity of TMD3 coupled with the location of positively charged amino acid residues orchestrate the release of the polypeptide by the Sec pathway. Importantly, we demonstrate that these features are also present across all identified families of these dual-targeted membrane proteins indicating that there is unifying mechanism for their biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fusion proteins for the analysis of Sco2149 membrane assembly</title><p>Previous work has shown that the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Rieske protein, Sco2149, has three transmembrane domains that require the combined action of two distinct protein translocases, Sec and Tat, for complete assembly into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopkins et al., 2014</xref>). However the mechanism by which these two translocases are coordinated is unknown, although TMD and globular domain swapping experiments indicated that the information required to coordinate this process does not reside within the first two TMDs or the cofactor binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To assess the mechanism of TMD insertion we used constructs where the cofactor-containing FeS domain was genetically removed from Sco2149 and replaced with the mature region of two different reporter proteins – that of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Tat substrate AmiA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ize et al., 2003</xref>) to report on interaction of Sco2149 with the Tat pathway, or of the Sec substrate β-lactamase (Bla, which is compatible for export with either the Sec or Tat pathways depending on the nature of the targeting sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2002</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The export of AmiA from both of these constructs was absolutely dependent on the Tat pathway as no growth on SDS was conferred in the <italic>tat</italic><sup>-</sup> strain (MCDSSAC △<italic>tat</italic>). Previously it has been reported that a twin lysine substitution of the twin arginine motif of Sco2149 was sufficient to prevent Tat-dependent export of AmiA when produced at lower levels from the pSU18 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>). However, when expressed from the pSU-PROM vector, a low level of export by the Tat pathway could still be observed for the Sco2149-AmiA construct harbouring this substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It has been noted previously that Tat-dependent export of some very sensitive plasmid-borne reporter proteins can be detected following twin lysine substitution of the twin arginines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ize et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kreutzenbeck et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that twin lysines can still trigger Tat-dependent export but with a greatly reduced efficiency. However, less conservative substitutions of the twin arginine motif to twin alanine or to alanine-aspartate were not permissive for Tat transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The membrane insertion of Sco2149 was further investigated using the Bla fusion construct. When exported to the periplasmic side of the membrane Bla confers resistance to ampicillin, which can be assessed in a quantitative manner using M.I.C.Evaluator test strips. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the basal M.I.C. for ampicillin was evaluated at 2.5 and 1.4 µg/ml, respectively, for the <italic>tat<sup>+</sup></italic> (MC4100) and <italic>tat<sup>-</sup></italic> (DADE) strains harbouring the empty vector.

It has been reported that the introduction of negative charges into the n-region of a Sec signal peptide blocks Sec-dependent translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inouye et al., 1982</xref>), and therefore substituting the twin arginines to alanine-aspartate would be expected to prevent translocation through both the Sec and Tat pathways.

We therefore undertook a programme of mutagenesis on the Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla construct, focusing firstly on the cytoplasmic loop region between TMD2 and TMD3 as this has a number of highly conserved features across actinobacterial Rieske proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In particular the loop has a highly conserved length (43 amino acids between the predicted end of TM2 and the twin arginine motif), a region of predicted α-helical structure, and a number of positions where positively or negatively charged residues are conserved, including an almost invariant glutamic acid (E127 in Sco2149) and arginine-histidine pairing (R133, H134 in Sco2149).</p><p>Initial site-directed replacement of amino acids in the loop region were undertaken and the level of resistance to ampicillin mediated by the variant Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla fusion protein in a <italic>tat</italic><sup>-</sup> background was scored.

We therefore made further substitutions, for example progressively deleting clusters of negatively charged amino acids or changing them to positively charged lysines. None of these deletions or substitutions had any detectable effect on Sec translocation of the Bla fusion, even when all of the acidic residues were substituted for lysine.

This suggested that there may be some feature of the loop region between residues 153 and 157 influencing interaction with the Sec pathway. To explore this further we made a series of additional one amino acid truncations to give Δ118–153, Δ118–154, Δ118–155 and Δ118–156 and Δ118–157 constructs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> indicates that as soon as the truncation extended to amino acid 155, Sec translocation was substantially reduced (but protein production and/or stability was not, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Inspection of the sequence indicates that amino acid 155 is a lysine. Positively charged amino acids are important topology determinants in membrane proteins, and are enriched in the cytoplasmic regions of membrane proteins, the so-called ‘positive inside rule’ due to the energetic cost of translocating them across the membrane against the protonmotive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heijne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1990</xref>).

However, one of the 35 residue truncations (Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Δ123–157-AmiA) and the 40 residue truncation (Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Δ118–157-AmiA) supported no growth on SDS-containing media (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that there is a minimum loop length requirement of approximately eight amino acids between TMD2 and the twin arginine motif is required for Tat recognition of a tethered signal peptide.</p><p>Taken together we conclude that, with the exception of the twin arginine motif, none of the conserved features of cytoplasmic loop are strictly necessary for interaction of Sco2149 with the Tat pathway or to mediate release from Sec.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Specific physical properties of TMD3 drive its release from Sec</title><p>Hydrophobicity is the driving force for the insertion of a helix into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">White and von Heijne, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hessa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Heijne, 1997</xref>).

These charges are not required for the interaction with the Tat pathway but reduce the efficiency of interaction with Sec and have therefore been described ‘Sec-avoidance’ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bogsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cristóbal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaudeck et al., 2001</xref>). A positive charge is generally also found close to the C-terminal end of TMD3 of actinobacterial Rieske proteins (R185 in the case of Sco2149; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Substitution of R185 for alanine in the Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla fusion conferred an 8-fold increase in M.I.C for ampicillin, and therefore R185 also appears to act as a Sec-avoidance motif in this context. Interestingly, closer inspection of actinobacterial Rieske proteins indicates that there are a number of further non-conserved positive charges located within the C-terminal vicinity of TMD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> underlined residues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> orange residues) which are not found in other Rieske proteins that only contain a single TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since our original Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla fusion (where the Bla sequence is fused immediately after R185) lacks most of these additional charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we made an additional Bla fusion where the Sco2149 sequence in the fusion protein was extended to aa205, incorporating an additional four positively charged residues. It can be seen that inclusion of this additional positively charged stretch almost completely abolished transport via Sec, as the clearance zone around the M.I.C. strip was of similar size to that of the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We did, however, note that for unknown reasons there was a variable level of breakthrough growth within the zone of clearing for strain DADE producing the extended Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla fusion. We therefore constructed similar Bla fusions after TMD3 of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Rieske protein, QcrA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> indicates that there is some Sec-dependent export of the Bla fusion when it is fused close to the C-terminal end (‘short fusion’) but that this was almost abolished when the sequence was extended to introduce the positively charged stretch (‘long fusion’). Taken together, we conclude that a combination of low hydrophobicity of TMD3 coupled with the presence of several C-terminal positive charges promotes release of actinobacterial Rieske proteins from the Sec machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bioinformatic analysis identifies further families of membrane proteins potentially dependent on both Sec and Tat pathways</title><p>We next asked whether actinobacterial Rieske proteins were the only protein family that required both Sec and Tat pathways for their integration. To this end, all proteins from prokaryotic genomes available in Genbank were analysed by both TATFind 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rose et al., 2002</xref>) and TMHMM 2.0c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>) programs, initially to identify proteins with a similar N-in topology as actinobacterial Rieske proteins. For each protein, both outputs were combined to identify the position of twin arginine motif, and the number of transmembrane helices present N-terminal and C-terminal to it. The final output from this search was sorted to give those proteins that had a predicted even number of TMDs prior to the twin-arginine motif and that had a predicted single TMD immediately following the twin-arginine motif (available as a supplementary online file at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/tracy_palmer/docs/CombinedTATFindTMHMMoutput.docx">http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/tracy_palmer/docs/CombinedTATFindTMHMMoutput.docx</ext-link>). We subsequently manually searched this list to identify any proteins with a predicted C-terminal cofactor-binding domain.</p><p>From the output we identified a further actinobacterial Rieske homologue from <italic>Kitasatospora setae</italic> (KSE_30950) that is predicted to have five TMDs, with the twin arginine motif adjacent to TMD5. We also identified two further families of predicted metalloproteins that shared features of dual-inserted proteins (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Sco3746, also from <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> is predicted to have five TMDs, with a predicted molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) binding domain at the C-terminus and conserved histidine residues in TMDs 2, 3 and 4 that are predicted to co-ordinate two heme <italic>b</italic> moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The twin arginine motif, which is conserved across homologous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), directly precedes TMD5. Homologues of Sco3746 were identified across the actinobacteria, as well as in firmicutes, chloroflexi and euryarchaeota, and each carries a twin arginine motif directly preceding TMD5 (Examples from each phyla are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Protein Q1NSB0 from the delta proteobacterium <italic>MLMS-1</italic> is also predicted to have five TMDs and to contain seven 4Fe-4S clusters, three at the cytoplasmic side and four at the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Labelling of TMD2-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) was complicated by the observation that the iron-sulfur cluster binding regions were variably called as TMDs by some prediction programs. Again the conserved twin arginine motif directly precedes TMD5 and homologues of this protein are encoded in many prokaryotic genomes including those from the chloroflexi, nitrospirae and euryarchaeota phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26577.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Further families of Tat-dependent polytopic membrane proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a polytopic predicted molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) binding protein (Sco3746, left) a polytopic polyferredoxin (PFD, centre) and a polytopic metallophosphoesterase of the YkuE family (right) identified bioinformatically as candidate dual-inserted membrane poteins.

The Sco3746<sub>TMD</sub>-MBP fusion is naturally devoid of cysteine residues. Guided by topology prediction programs we made three Cys substitutions (G14C, A137C and A219C) that are predicted to reside at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and two (G84C and G171C) that are located in predicted extracellular loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

This marginally hydrophobic TMD is, however, still likely to be integrated by the Sec pathway. Many individual TMD in multi-spanning membrane proteins have an unfavourable free energy of membrane insertion and are unable to stably integrate by themselves, requiring TMD sequence-extrinsic features for membrane insertion. It is, however, usual for the first and last TMD to be more hydrophobic as they lack these sequence-extrinsic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Virkki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elofsson and von Heijne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White and von Heijne, 2008b</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a previous study we identified the actinobacterial Rieske FeS protein as the first protein known to be targeted to the plasma membrane by the dual action of the Sec and Tat translocases. The mechanism by which translocation is coordinated between the two pathways was not known, although a length- and sequence-conserved loop region between Sec-dependent TMD2 and Tat-dependent TMD3 was implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2012</xref>). Intensive investigation into the principles governing the correct biogenesis and topology of membrane proteins has revealed that the relative hydrophobicity of a TMD along with the location of positively charged amino acids are key features that govern the insertion and orientation of transmembrane segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heijne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hessa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ojemalm et al., 2013</xref>). Here we show that that these principles are exploited by nature to regulate translocation of Rieske by the Sec pathway and allow its hand-off to Tat prior to insertion of the final TMD. None of the features of the highly conserved loop region, other than the presence of one or more positively charged amino acids that serve as topology signals, plays any discernible role in co-ordinating the Sec and Tat pathways and may therefore be required for cofactor insertion or interaction with other components of the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex.</p><p>A bioinformatic analysis of prokaryotic genome sequences identified three further families of polytopic membrane proteins that share the predicted features of Sec-Tat dual-targeting. Two of these have five TMDs, with the fifth TMD immediately preceded by a consensus Tat recognition motif. A representative member of each of the 5TMD family was shown to be membrane inserted through the action of two translocases, with the Tat system recognising the final TMD. Importantly, the low hydrophobicity of the final TMD coupled with C-terminal positive charges, identified through our analysis of the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Rieske protein as being critical for Sec-release, are conserved across these further protein families, and were confirmed experimentally to govern release of this final TMD from Sec. Thus a common mechanism is at play to orchestrate the integration of dual Sec-Tat targeted membrane proteins.</p><p>A model for how such proteins are assembled is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, using the actinobacterial Rieske protein as an example. According to the model, the Sec-dependent helices are inserted co-translationally. The positively-charged twin-arginines N-terminal to the final TMD imposes an N-in, C-out orientation on this helix. However, the C-terminal positive charges prevent the full insertion of this TMD because the relatively low hydrophobicity is insufficient to drive translocation of the C-terminal positively charged region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wahlberg and Spiess, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goder and Spiess, 2003</xref>). This is experimentally supported by our findings that substitution of a single leucine residue into TMD3 of the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Rieske-Bla fusion is sufficient to greatly increase its Sec-dependent insertion despite the presence of two positive charges at the C-terminal end. Accordingly, it is likely that this final TMD is released by the Sec pathway as a re-entrant loop. It is formally possible that instead of polypeptide release by Sec there is direct handoff of the partially-synthesized protein to the Tat receptor complex, where its full maturation, including cofactor insertion, could potentially occur. Such a model would require interaction between the Sec and Tat machineries. However, it should be noted that the Sec and Tat pathways of <italic>E. coli</italic> are able to co-operatively integrate dual-targeted protein families even though the organism itself does not encode such proteins, suggesting that a direct Sec-Tat interaction is unlikely to be an essential feature of this process. Ultimately, following folding of the cofactor-containing domain, the Tat machinery mediates translocation of the folded domain across the membrane, releasing the Tat-dependent TMD into the bilayer.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26577.029</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model for actinobacterial Rieske protein assembly.</title><p>1. TMDs 1 and 2 are inserted into the membrane cotranslationally by the Sec machinery (blue box). The Sec machinery interacts with TMD3 in an N-in, C-out orientation. 2. The positive charges at the C-terminal end of TMD3 force an orientational preference on the helix and it is not inserted by the Sec machinery. 3. The hydrophobic segment of TMD3 is released from the Sec machinery as a re-entrant loop. As there are no further TMDs within the Riekse sequence the Sec machinery releases the polypeptide. 4 and 5.

Removal of these charges results in signal sequences that can mediate efficient transport by the Sec machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bogsch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cristóbal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaudeck et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, signal peptides that direct proteins to the Tat machinery are known to be less hydrophobic than Sec signal peptides and if the hydrophobicity of a Tat signal peptide is increased it can also mediate efficient transport by the Sec pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cristóbal et al., 1999</xref>).

This raises the possibility that rather than being an exception, Sec interaction with Tat signal peptides is much more frequent, and that following abortive attempts at Sec-translocation, membrane-associated twin-arginine signal peptides are common substrates of the Tat pathway. In this context it should be noted that both thylakoid and <italic>E. coli</italic> Tat substrates interact with the membrane before subsequent interaction with Tat machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musser and Theg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Cline, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shanmugham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bageshwar et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our work has shown that dual targeted Sec-Tat dependent membrane proteins are dispersed across two domains including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and euryarchaea, indicating that the biogenesis of dual-targeted membrane proteins is a common feature of prokaryotes. It is interesting to note that distant homologues of both the predicted heme-Moco binding protein, Sco3746, and the <italic>MLMS-1</italic> polyferredoxin are widely found as separate polypeptides. For example <italic>E. coli</italic> MsrP/MsrQ (formerly YedY/YedZ encoded by <italic>yedYZ</italic>) are, respectively, a Sec-dependent polytopic heme <italic>b</italic> protein and Tat-targeted soluble MoCo-containing periplasmic protein that together use electrons from the respiratory chain to catalyse the repair of proteins containing methionine sulfoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brokx et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gennaris et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise <italic>MLMS-1</italic> polyferredoxin is a fusion of NapH, a Sec-dependent polytopic protein with four TMD that co-ordinates [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, with NapG, a Tat-dependent periplasmic protein that is predicted to co-ordinate four [4Fe-4S] at the periplasmic side of the membrane. Collectively NapGH form a quinol dehydrogenase complex that in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Wolinella succinogenes</italic> is involved in nitrate respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brondijk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kern and Simon, 2008</xref>). The close relationship of such proteins and their corresponding genes raises the possibility that dual-targeted proteins arose during the course of evolution from separate polypeptides but adjacent genes. Alternatively, the ancestral proteins may have been single, dual-targeted polypeptides that subsequently separated in some organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmid construction and growth conditions</title><p>All strains used in this study are derived from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

Labeling was then performed for 1 hr at room temperature on intact or lysed cells using 5 mM methoxypolyethylene glycol maleimide (MAL-PEG) at room temperature for 1 hr in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. A control without addition of labeling reagent was systematically included. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and the whole cell samples were then lysed by sonication. All samples were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 <italic>g</italic>, 4°C to remove non-broken cells and the resulting supernatant ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C to pellet the membranes. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 60 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 10% (v/v) glycerol for analysis by SDS PAGE and western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Proteins were separated by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (7.5%, 10%, 12% or 15% polyacrylamide, as indicated) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane either with semi-dry (TransBlot SD SemiDry Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad) or dry transfer (iBlot2, Life technologies). Proteins were detected with primary antibodies raised against either Sco2149 (a monoclonal Sco2149 peptide antibody generated by GenScript against the N-Terminal epitope CLPPHEPRVQDVDER), Bla (monoclonal antibody, Abcam ab12251), MBP (monoclonal antibody, NEB E8032L), BamA (polyclonal antibody, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lehr et al., 2010</xref>]). Bands were revealed with chemiluminescence (Clarity Western ECL Blotting Substrate, Biorad) after incubation with secondary antibody coupled to HRP (anti-mouse IgG or Anti-Rabbit IgG, Biorad). Light-emitting bands were visualised with a CCCD camera (GeneGNOME XRQ Syngene). ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) was used for densitometry analysis. The density of Sco2149-associated signals were normalised against the BamA-associated signals which was used as a loading control. The results were expressed as percentage of the normalised signal obtained for the unmodified Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-AmiA or Sco2149<sub>TMD</sub>-Bla fusion proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bioinformatic analysis</title><p>A Perl script was used to run all proteins from all completed prokaryotic genomes available in Genbank at the time of analysis through the TATFind program (version 1.4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rose et al., 2002</xref>]) and the TMHMM program (version 2.0c; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>]). Conditions were included in the script to state that there should be an even number of TMD before the twin arginines, the number of TMD after the twin arginines should be exactly one, and the total probability of N-in should be greater than 0.9. The output of this, sorted into number of TMD prior to the twin arginines, can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/tracy_palmer/docs/CombinedTATFindTMHMMoutput.docx">http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/groups/tracy_palmer/docs/CombinedTATFindTMHMMoutput.docx</ext-link>. Subsequently the script was updated to state that that there should be an odd number of TMD (one, three, five or seven) before the twin arginines, the number of TMD after the twin arginines should be exactly one, and the total probability of N-in should be less than 0.5.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Reid Gilmore (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Steven M Theg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Tooke et al. examines the mechanism of integration of an interesting class of bacterial membrane proteins. These proteins contain multiple TMDs at their amino terminus that are integrated by the SEC pathway and a cofactor binding domain at the C-terminus which is translocated across the plasma membrane by the TAT pathway. The Palmer lab described the initial member of the protein class (SCO2149) in previous publications, but had not determined how the substrate was released from the SEC complex prior to integration by the TAT complex. The current manuscript does a very nice job of defining sequence features of the final TM span, and flanking regions that allow release of the protein from the SEC complex. Secondly, bioinformatic analysis led to the identification of two additional families of dual SEC/Tat substrates. Analysis of representative members of these two protein families revealed that the same features (twin arginine motif, low hydrophobicity of the final TM span, basic residues at the start of the C-terminal lumenal domain) block transport of the terminal TM span by the SEC complex and allow handoff to the TAT complex. The experimental work in this manuscript is of high quality, and the results are presented in a careful and clear manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The text describing the bioinformatics search for additional dual Sec/Tat targeted proteins stated that the protein had to have an even number of TMDs that preceding a final TM span that is preceded by the twin arginine-targeting motif. Please explain why potential dual targeted proteins have to have the N-terminus located on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (i.e., total TMDs = 3,5, etc.). To our knowledge there is no restriction on SEC pathway integration that mandates localization of the N-terminus in the cytosol. Do the authors mean that all examples of potential dual targeted proteins that they detected (TMD&gt;1, RR motif preceding a final TMD) had an uneven number of predicted TM span (3 in Sco2159 family, 5 in Sco3746 and PFD families)?</p><p>2) The TAT assays in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> are not quantitative. We fully appreciate that colony dilution assays are not readily quantified. Could the authors provide additional information about the relative growth of the large deletion series that is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>? Specifically, the table indicates that the Δ118-153 mutant grows on plates that contain SDS, while a Δ118-154 mutant does not. Does the Δ118-153 mutant show an intermediate growth rate similar to the Sco2149TMD RRKK-Ami mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1 —figure supplement 2</xref>) or is it indistinguishable from the wild type construct? Perhaps the authors could add a supplemental figure showing plates of several of the large deletion constructs if the mutants like Δ118-153 do have an intermediate growth rate.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> the authors wash crude membrane fragments in 4 M urea to determine whether the MBP-substituted Sco7346 and PFD were integrated into the membrane. This may well be sufficient for this determination, but it is unusual. Membrane integration of proteins is more usually assessed as resistance to carbonate or NaOH extraction. The authors don't explain the use of urea instead of these more established techniques, nor do they include controls to show that urea was doing what they expected. Can they say a little more about why they chose this technique?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> the authors report the values of ΔGapp for TM5 of different MoCo-binding proteins. When the value for TM5 is positive, they predicted that it goes in via the Tat pathway. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> also reports positive values for ΔGapp for TM4 for four of the six proteins examined. Why are these helices (TM4) still integrated by the Sec pathway?</p><p>5) The authors repeatedly state that the hydrophobicity and flanking charges of a helix determine or mediate its release from the Sec machinery. This might be correct, but they don't directly test whether the protein exits the SEC complex before interaction with the Tat machinery. They see that a protein crosses from the Sec pathway to the Tat pathway at specific points in the targeting mechanism, but their wording (and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) implies that the protein is released from the Sec translocon and goes out into the membrane on its own, and encounters the Tat translocon independently. This bias ignores the possibility of a direct handoff from the Sec translocon to the Tat translocon. As this point was not addressed specifically, we would have preferred a wording that was less explicit and included both possibilities.</p><p>6) In terms of how basic residues after a signal sequence can impact protein export by the SEC pathway, the authors should consider citing the following papers: (a) an arginine added immediately after the signal peptide of the Sec-dependent β-lactamase has been shown to abolish export of β-lactamase (Summers et al., 1989, JBC 264, 20082), which is relevant because β-lactamase was used as a reporter protein in the current manuscript and (b) other studies have shown that a positive charge added after a Sec-dependent signal prevents export by the Sec translocase (Li et al., 1988, PNAS 85, 7685; Zhu et al., 1989, JBC 264, 11833; Andersson and von Heijne, 1991, PNAS 88, 9751).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26577.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The text describing the bioinformatics search for additional dual Sec/Tat targeted proteins stated that the protein had to have an even number of TMDs that preceding a final TM span that is preceded by the twin arginine-targeting motif.

We have now also included the carbonate data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (now re-numbered as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We used urea because it is reported to be a commonly-used procedure to remove peripheral membrane proteins (e.g. Ohlendiek 2004. Methods Mol Biol244:283-293). We have also used it previously, for example to assess the integration of a Tat-dependent lipoprotein where it behaved similarly to carbonate extraction (Parthasarathy <italic>et al.</italic> 2016, J Biol Chem 291:7774–7785). In terms of controls for the urea experiment, we have good antibodies to two <italic>E. coli</italic> membrane proteins, TatA and TatC, but unfortunately as we are using a Δ<italic>tatABC</italic> strain to show that the Tat pathway is not involved in the stability of these proteins we could not use either of these. We hope that the inclusion of the carbonate extraction data is sufficient to satisfy the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p> <italic>4) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> the authors report the values of ΔGapp for TM5 of different MoCo-binding proteins.

However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> also reports positive values for ΔGapp for TM4 for four of the six proteins examined. Why are these helices (TM4) still integrated by the Sec pathway?</italic> </p><p>It has been reported that 20-30% of the transmembrane helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins have an unfavourable free energy of membrane insertion (Elofsson and von Heijne, 2007, White and von Heijne,2008). These marginally hydrophobic TMs are unable to stably integrate into the membrane by themselves, they require TM sequence-extrinsic features for membrane insertion. This can include positive charges in the cytosolic flanking loops or helix-helix interactions. It is usual for the first and the final TM to be more hydrophobic as they lack these sequence-extrinsic features. Therefore, TM4 in comparison to TM5 should have some of these sequence-extrinsic features, like the positive charges located in the cytosolic loop between TM4 and TM5, to drive integration of this TM by the Sec machinery. We have now added this information as a footnote to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors repeatedly state that the hydrophobicity and flanking charges of a helix determine or mediate its release from the Sec machinery. This might be correct, but they don't directly test whether the protein exits the SEC complex before interaction with the Tat machinery. They see that a protein crosses from the Sec pathway to the Tat pathway at specific points in the targeting mechanism, but their wording (and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) implies that the protein is released from the Sec translocon and goes out into the membrane on its own, and encounters the Tat translocon independently. This bias ignores the possibility of a direct handoff from the Sec translocon to the Tat translocon. As this point was not addressed specifically, we would have preferred a wording that was less explicit and included both possibilities.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments here and agree that from our work we cannot rule out a direct handoff. We have now explicitly mentioned this in the Discussion. However the native proteins contain cofactors – these must be inserted into the fully synthesized protein and the domain must fold. This means that it would have to be released by the Sec translocon in order for this to happen. It is formally possible that cofactor insertion and folding could occur while the protein has been handed off to the Tat receptor complex, although there is no evidence to support this. We would also argue that we are investigating this process in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which encodes no dual-targeted protein families of its own. It would be hard to believe that any protein interfaces involved in a Sec-Tat interaction would be conserved in an organism that lacks native substrates of this process. We have updated our model (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) to explicitly include the cofactor insertion/folding steps.</p><p> <italic>6) In terms of how basic residues after a signal sequence can impact protein export by the SEC pathway, the authors should consider citing the following papers: (a) an arginine added immediately after the signal peptide of the Sec-dependent β-lactamase has been shown to abolish export of β-lactamase (Summers et al., 1989, JBC 264, 20082), which is relevant because β-lactamase was used as a reporter protein in the current manuscript and (b) other studies have shown that a positive charge added after a Sec-dependent signal prevents export by the Sec translocase (Li, Beckwith and Inouye, 1988; Zhu and Dalbey., 1989, Andersson and von Heijne, 1991).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these omissions.
