Currently, the best-characterized examples of catch bonds are between single protein-ligand pairs. The essential AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) mechanoenzyme Mdn1 drives at least two separate steps in ribosome biogenesis, using its MIDAS domain to extract the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-containing proteins Rsa4 and Ytm1 from ribosomal precursors. However, it must subsequently release these assembly factors to reinitiate the enzymatic cycle. The mechanism underlying the switching of the MIDAS-UBL interaction between strongly and weakly bound states is unknown. Here, we use optical tweezers to investigate the force dependence of MIDAS-UBL binding. Parallel experiments with Rsa4 and Ytm1 show that forces up to ~4 pN, matching the magnitude of force produced by AAA proteins similar to Mdn1, enhance the MIDAS domain binding lifetime up to 10-fold, and higher forces accelerate dissociation. Together, our studies indicate that Mdn1’s MIDAS domain can form catch bonds with more than one UBL substrate, and provide insights into how mechanoregulation may contribute to the Mdn1 enzymatic cycle during ribosome biogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>catch bond</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM130234-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapoor</surname><given-names>Tarun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM109824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Brian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM103314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Brian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HG010510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K00CA223018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mickolajczyk</surname><given-names>Keith J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The MIDAS domain of Mdn1, an ATP-driven mechanoenzyme involved in ribosome biogenesis, forms catch bonds with two different ubiquitin-like domain-containing ribosomal assembly factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of protein-ligand interactions is an essential organizational principle in cell biology, and is achieved through various means, including post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) and substrate exchange (e.g. GTP hydrolysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts et al., 1994</xref>). More recently, mechanoregulation – or changes in protein-ligand interactions in response to applied mechanical forces – has garnered interest as another organizing principle. While most protein-ligand interactions are known to become weaker when external forces are applied along the bond axis, referred to as slip bonds, a few special cases have been identified where force increases bond lifetimes, referred to as catch bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokurenko et al., 2008</xref>). Catch bonds are hypothesized to be a widely used regulatory mechanism in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokurenko et al., 2008</xref>), but force spectroscopy investigations to date have largely focused on cell adhesion and cytoskeleton proteins. Moreover, most known examples of catch bonds are for one protein interacting with one specific substrate.</p><p>Ribosome biogenesis is a complex, multi-step process involving hundreds of trans-acting protein and RNA factors, including ATP-driven mechanoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frazier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>). One essential mechanoenzyme is Mdn1, a member of the AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) superfamily. Mdn1 is a large (&gt;500 kDa) multi-domain enzyme; at its N-terminus are six AAA domains, which fold into a pseudohexameric ring, followed by a linker including both a structured (~1800 amino acids) and a likely non-structured (~517 amino acids) region, and finally a C-terminal (290 amino acid) MIDAS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garbarino and Gibbons, 2002</xref>). Mdn1 binds and extracts the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-containing assembly factors Ytm1 and Rsa4, which are embedded in pre-60S (large) ribosomal precursors at different stages of maturation, via its MIDAS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>). Recent structural work revealed that the MIDAS domain docks onto the AAA ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosnowski et al., 2018</xref>) in the context of pre-60S binding, and forms a tripartite connection in which it is also bound to Rsa4 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kater et al., 2020</xref>). However, we do not understand how the MIDAS-UBL binding, which must be strong for assembly factor removal, switches to a more weakly bound state, such that the UBL proteins can be subsequently released.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Solution measurements of MIDAS-Rsa4 interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain diagrams (drawn to scale) of full-length Mdn1 (top), and the SNAP-tagged MIDAS constructs (bottom).

In solution, this integrin domain has a weak (~1 mM) affinity for its ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shimaoka et al., 2001</xref>). Remarkably, this affinity can be enhanced by about an order of magnitude by applied force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astrof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimaoka et al., 2003</xref>). Although a UBL domain is structurally distant from extracellular integrin ligands, it is possible that Mdn1 may similarly use mechanoregulation for its function. Consistent with this idea, Brownian dynamics simulations have shown that docking of the MIDAS domain onto the AAA ring stretches the unstructured portion of the linker such that 1–2 pN of tension is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mickolajczyk et al., 2020</xref>). This tension would be transmitted along the MIDAS-UBL bond axis, and its magnitude may even be enhanced by ATP-dependent motions propagated from the AAA ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>). However, no studies to date have tested the hypothesis that the Mdn1 MIDAS domain can form catch bonds with its substrates.</p><p>In the current work, we investigate the mechanoregulation of the interaction between Mdn1’s MIDAS domain and two UBL domain-containing assembly factors. Using bulk assays, we find that MIDAS-Rsa4 and -Ytm1 affinity is weak (≥7 μM). Using an optical tweezers ‘force jump’ assay, we find that the Mdn1 MIDAS domain forms a catch bond with both Rsa4 and Ytm1, with bond lifetimes extending ~10-fold at ~4 pN tension. These measurements show that mechanical forces are sufficient for modulating Mdn1 substrate binding, and suggest that catch bonds play a key role in regulating Mdn1-driven steps in ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Solution measurements of MIDAS-Rsa4 binding</title><p>To investigate the regulation of Mdn1 binding to its UBL domain-containing pre-ribosomal substrate Rsa4, we first sought to characterize binding in vitro. The Mdn1 MIDAS domain (amino acids 4381–4717) with an N-terminal SNAP tag was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mickolajczyk et al., 2020</xref>). Both wild-type MIDAS domain (MIDAS-WT) and MIDAS domain harboring a point mutation known to diminish UBL domain binding (MIDAS-Y4666R) were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). Full-length Rsa4 with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Rsa4-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was expressed in insect cells and purified using affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography (see Materials and methods). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Rsa4-GFP was confirmed to be a monomer of the correct molecular weight both by native mass spectrometry (nMS) (to within 20 Da; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and by mass photometry (to within 2 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Binding of the Mdn1 MIDAS domain to Rsa4-GFP was first assessed by size exclusion chromatography coelution assays. Rsa4-GFP (40 μM prior to injection) by itself eluted as a single peak at ~14.5 mL, as measured by GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, black; uncropped gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). MIDAS-WT alone and MIDAS-Y4666R alone (60 μM prior to injection) did not produce a fluorescence signal, but were each seen to elute at ~14.3 mL by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, gray). Mixing Rsa4 with MIDAS-WT before injection led to a shift in the fluorescence profile toward a higher molecular weight, with an overlapping elution profile consistent with binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, blue). Mixing Rsa4 with MIDAS-Y6664R before injection did not lead to a shift in the fluorescence profile or to apparent coelution by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, red), suggesting that the coelution with MIDAS-WT is due to specific binding.</p><p>We next sought to determine the affinity of the Mdn1 MIDAS domain for Rsa4-GFP using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Titrating MIDAS-WT against Rsa4-GFP (50 nM) produced changes in the normalized fluorescence signal upon heating (|ΔF<sub>Norm</sub>|) that could be fitted to a binding isotherm with K<sub>D</sub> = 6.9 ± 2.0 μM (fit ±95% confidence intervals, CI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Titrating MIDAS-Y4666R led to smaller |ΔF<sub>Norm</sub>| values that could not be fitted, consistent with weaker binding. Together, these results show that while the Mdn1 MIDAS domain can bind to Rsa4 in solution, the binding affinity is weak (~7 μM).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-molecule measurements of MIDAS-Rsa4 binding under applied load</title><p>To investigate the force dependence of the MIDAS-UBL domain interaction, we developed a single-molecule optical tweezers ‘force jump’ assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this assay, two double-stranded (dsDNA) handles are attached to two polystyrene beads – one held in a micropipette by suction and the other held by an optical trap – and connected using a single-stranded (ssDNA) bridge. SNAP-tagged MIDAS and GFP nanobody proteins are covalently bound to ssDNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which are then annealed to the bridge strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rsa4-GFP in solution can bind to the GFP nanobody on the bridge construct. With the tethered assembly in place, the optical trap, in constant force mode, can be rapidly switched (i.e. force jumped) between a low and a high constant force. At the high force, MIDAS and Rsa4-GFP are physically separated and cannot bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> state 1). At the low force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> state 2) the bridge strand is relaxed and MIDAS and Rsa4 come into close enough proximity to bind. Should the proteins bind while at the low force, an intermediate position can be read out when the system is jumped to high force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> state 3). This intermediate position informs on the lifetime of the MIDAS-Rsa4 interaction. The distance traveled between the intermediate and final high-force position (Δx) should depend on the length of the single-stranded region of annealed bridge construct. We thus performed our assays with two bridge constructs of different lengths (55 and 70 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For both bridge constructs, we ensured that only a single ‘tether’ was drawn between each pair of beads by examining the shape of the force-extension curve and matching it to a known hairpin standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule assay for measuring the MIDAS-Rsa4 interaction under load.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-molecule optical tweezers ‘force jump’ assay design.

Rsa4-GFP, free in solution, can bind to the GFP nanobody.

When MIDAS and Rsa4-GFP are bound, we model the system as two nonlinear springs in parallel. The top (loading) spring consists of the 12 nt sections of the oligonucleotides bound to SNAP-GFP nanobody and SNAP-MIDAS that do not anneal to the bridge DNA, as well as the relatively rigid folded proteins, which we model as inextensible (constant length L<sub>prot</sub>) at 8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). The bottom spring is the non-complementary ssDNA region of the bridge DNA (55 or 70 nt). Since the proteins are on the top spring, the bottom spring begins pre-stretched relative to the top spring by L<sub>prot</sub>. In this configuration, the total force applied by the optical trap (F<sub>Tot</sub>) is partitioned over the two springs (F<sub>Load</sub> and F<sub>Bridge</sub>). When MIDAS and Rsa4-GFP dissociate from one another, the entirety of F<sub>Tot</sub> is put onto the bridge DNA, leading to further stretching (Δx). We modeled the nonlinear springs in the system using the worm-like chain equation, a model for the elasticity of DNA (see Materials and methods). An overlay of experimental measurements of Δx with output of the mechanical circuit model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>.

Tension is relieved upon release from the pre-60S, disengaging the catch bond and thus promoting MIDAS-UBL dissociation (right side).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata1"><label>Figure 4—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for size exclusion chromatography, microscale thermophoresis (MST), and force jump assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and its supplements.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-73534-fig4-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata2"><label>Figure 4—source data 2.</label><caption><title>All raw TIFF files for SDS-PAGE gels corresponding to size exclusion chromatography coelution assays.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-73534-fig4-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73534-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Preparation of recombinant Ytm1-GFP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE gels (Coomassie staining) of final purified Ytm1-GFP.

The critical force where binding lifetime is maximized was 3.3 pN, versus 4.2 pN for Rsa4-GFP. Overall, these results show that the Mdn1 MIDAS domain forms a catch bond with two different UBL domain-containing proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current work, we investigate the regulation of binding between the Mdn1 MIDAS domain and the UBL domain-containing ribosome assembly factors Rsa4 and Ytm1. We show that the Mdn1 MIDAS domain has weak affinity for Rsa4 and Ytm1 in solution (≥7 μM). Using a single-molecule optical tweezers force jump assay developed for this study, we show that Mdn1 MIDAS forms a catch bond with both Rsa4 and Ytm1, with bond lifetimes increasing by an order of magnitude under applied tension up to ~4 pN, and decreasing back to baseline between ~4 and 10 pN. Together, our findings provide insights into how forces may directly regulate Mdn1-driven steps in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm during ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose a model where the Mdn1 MIDAS-UBL catch bond plays a key role in assembly factor processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Mdn1 binds the pre-60S particle and establishes a tripartite interaction between its AAA ring, its MIDAS domain, and the UBL domain of the assembly factor substrate that it must extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosnowski et al., 2018</xref>). In this MIDAS-docked state, Mdn1’s unstructured linker, which acts as an entropic spring, is stretched; computational modeling of MIDAS docking estimates that 1–2 pN of tension is built up and propagated along the MIDAS-UBL bond axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mickolajczyk et al., 2020</xref>). A catch bond mechanism helps to explain how this tension promotes, rather than disfavors, MIDAS-UBL binding; 1–2 pN is below the ~3.3–4.2 pN peak of the MIDAS-UBL catch bond, but one possibility is that additional tension is generated by Mdn1’s ATPase activity. The MIDAS domain remains bound to the UBL domain until the assembly factor dissociates from the pre-60S particle. Subsequently, the MIDAS domain undocks from the AAA ring, relieving tension across the bond with the UBL domain, deactivating the catch bond and facilitating assembly factor release. Ytm1 and Rsa4 removal occur at separate stages of pre-60S maturation, in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that our model holds for both these scenarios. We also note that free copies of Ytm1 and Rsa4 are present in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>); the Mdn1 catch bond thus also prevents Mdn1-Rsa4/Ytm1 binding while off the pre-60S, which would compete away usable copies of each protein. Currently, the kinetics of Mdn1-driven steps in ribosome assembly are not well established. Future work is thus necessary to place the ~1 s bond lifetimes measured here within the multi-step enzymatic process of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>It is interesting to note that Mdn1 processes UBL domain-containing proteins. The UBL domains of Rsa4 and Ytm1 have low sequence similarity (43.0% in <italic>S. pombe</italic>), but a high level of structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Romes et al., 2016</xref>). There are numerous (&gt;10 in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, &gt;60 in humans) other UBL domain-containing proteins with similar folds to Ytm1/Rsa4-UBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Goldberg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmann-Petersen and Gordon, 2004</xref>). Moreover, UBL domains can be covalently conjugated to other proteins by a cascade of UBL-specific enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schulman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Streich and Lima, 2014</xref>). In addition, Mdn1 in mammalian cells has been shown to be targeted to SUMOylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raman et al., 2016</xref>), where SUMO and UBL domains also share structural similarity. While no Mdn1 MIDAS-binding partners other than Rsa4 and Ytm1 have been confirmed to date, it is noteworthy that Mdn1 was recently implicated to also have a role in heterochromatic RNA clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shipkovenska et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that Mdn1 may also process UBL or SUMO domain-containing proteins other than Rsa4 and Ytm1 in the cell. Based on the close similarity of the Rsa4 and Ytm1 catch bonds measured, we predict that the Mdn1 MIDAS domain would also form catch bonds with these putative substrates.</p><p>The Mdn1 MIDAS domain bears structural homology to the integrin MIDAS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garbarino and Gibbons, 2002</xref>). Integrin has also been shown to form catch bonds, albeit with a fragment of its substrate (containing the RGD consensus sequence) rather than with two different full-length, folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astrof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puklin-Faucher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimaoka et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the critical force at which bond lifetime is maximized is ~10–30 pN for integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong et al., 2009</xref>), a force-range relevant for meso-scale cell adhesions, in contrast to ~4 pN for Mdn1 MIDAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>), matching the forces that dynein, a AAA protein with high sequence similarity to Mdn1, is capable of producing (4.3 pN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore suggest that MIDAS domains can be tuned to form catch bonds at forces ranging from the single motor to the multi-motor regime, as needed for specific cellular contexts. Toward this end, numerous AAA motor proteins including CbbQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sutter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>), Vwa8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2017</xref>), magnesium chelatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fodje et al., 2001</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>), as well as other proteins with known mechanical activation such as von Willebrand factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruggeri and Ware, 1993</xref>), either contain or couple their activities with MIDAS domains. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanoregulation of these MIDAS domains binding to their substrates.</p><p>The force jump assay developed for this study builds off of similar, previously reported force spectroscopy methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kilchherr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kostrz et al., 2019</xref>), with the benefit of being applicable to a wide range of bimolecular interactions (so long as the molecules can be conjugated to a DNA oligonucleotide or fused to GFP). The use of the bridge strand of DNA in our force jump assay enables the same single molecules to be measured more than once, and has the additional advantage of acting as a ‘force divider’, enabling smaller forces to be applied to the proteins of interest while holding a larger force of the dsDNA handles (thus holding them taut and maximizing spatial resolution). An associated drawback, however, is that applied forces on the proteins must be indirectly quantified using a mechanical circuit model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similar to other experimental geometries used to measure catch bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Guilford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), our force jump assay applies force at a very high rate (~20,000 pN/s), which may influence protein-protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, we note that we use the same assay for all proteins in this study, and that the shortest binding durations we measure (20 ms) are &gt;100-fold longer than the estimated rise time of the force jump. In future studies, the molecular configuration used here for the force jump assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) can be reused for slower force ramp experiments to assess the force loading rate dependence of protein-protein binding durations.</p><p>Catch bonds are an example of how mechanical forces can directly regulate essential protein-ligand interactions. As opposed to other forms of regulation, such as phosphorylation, mechanoregulation is nearly instantaneous, and reversible without the need for accessory enzymes. Examples of known catch bonds range from cell adhesion through FimH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>), selectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>), and vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), to outside-in signaling through integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong et al., 2009</xref>) and notch-jagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luca et al., 2017</xref>), to motor proteins including dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunwar et al., 2011</xref>) and myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Guilford, 2006</xref>), and even to kinetochore attachments during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>). Our data uncovers catch bonds between proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and, in contrast to these known examples, between a protein and more than one substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The SNAP-MIDAS construct, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mickolajczyk et al., 2020</xref>), was generated by subcloning Mdn1 aa4381-4717 into pSNAP-tag(T7)–2 (NEB N9181S) downstream of the SNAP tag.

The reverse primers for the 5’ and 3’ overhang handles contain a biotin at their respective 5’ ends for bead attachment.

A benzylguanine (BG) group was covalently attached to the amino-oligonucleotides using BG-GLA-NHS (New England BioLabs S9151S) under manufacturer-suggested reaction conditions, and subsequently purified using Micro Bio-Spin P-6 gel columns (Bio-Rad 7326221). The BG-oligos were then conjugated to SNAP-proteins by mixing at a 2:1 molar ratio in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3% w/v glycerol, 1 mM DTT) incubating in the dark at 4°C overnight. Excess oligonucleotides and unreacted SNAP proteins were removed by purification on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva 28990944) in storage buffer. Fractions with oligo-protein conjugates were identified via SDS-PAGE, pooled, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to use.</p><p>To prepare for experiments, the 5’ overhang dsDNA handle and bridge strands were first annealed by mixing 50 nM of 5’ overhang handles with 12.5 nM of bridge ssDNA in storage buffer, incubating at 65°C for 1 min, then cooling to 4°C at 0.1°C/s. This annealed product was then mixed with oligo-SNAP-nanobody and oligo-SNAP-MIDAS (final 2 nM, 10 nM, 10 nM, respectively) in optical tweezers assay buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 80 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.002% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT) and incubated on ice for 30 min. This reaction was then diluted 5-fold into optical tweezers assay buffer containing 0.08% w/v streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (2.1 μm diameter, Spherotech) and incubated on ice for at least 15 min. This mixture was diluted 1000-fold in optical tweezers assay buffer at the time of use. Separately, 5 nM 3’ overhand handles were mixed with 0.08% w/v streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (2.1 μm diameter, Spherotech) in optical tweezers assay buffer, and incubated on ice for at least 15 min. This mixture was also diluted 1000-fold in optical tweezers assay buffer at the time of use.</p><p>To form a tether, a bead conjugated to the 5’ overhang handle complex was immobilized on a pipette via suction and brought into close proximity to a second bead conjugated to 3’ overhang handles held in an optical trap. Upon hybridization of the 3’ overhang handle with the 5’ overhang handle complex, a ‘tether’ was formed. For both the 55 and 70 nt bridge constructs, we ensured that only a single tether was drawn between each pair of beads by measuring the force-extension curve (in the range of 4–20 pN) and matching it to a well-characterized hairpin construct held between identical dsDNA handles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mickolajczyk et al., 2021</xref>). This hairpin standard was chosen because it can be mechanically unwound at ~20 pN, thus making it easy to identify if a single tether is drawn (if more than one tether is drawn, &gt;20 pN is needed to observe hairpin unwinding). The force-extension curves are dominated by the dsDNA handles in the 4–20 pN regime. Thus, for the 55 and 70 nt bridge constructs, instances with multiple tethers (i.e. multiple connected sets of dsDNA handles) produced force-extension curves that significantly deviated from (i.e. could not be superimposed onto) that of the hairpin standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optical tweezers force jump assay</title><p>The force jump assay developed for this study is related to the ReaLiSM and junctured-DNA-tweezers approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kostrz et al., 2019</xref>), as well as other conceptually similar approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kilchherr et al., 2016</xref>). All single-molecule measurements were made using an optical tweezers instrument (‘MiniTweezers’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). Optical tweezers assay buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 80 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.002% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT) was used for all experiments. At the start of each experiment, a tether was formed in the sample chamber and its force-extension behavior was obtained by moving the optically trapped bead at a speed of 70 nm/s away from the second bead held in the pipette. Rsa4-GFP or Ytm1-GFP were injected using a shunt line to a final of 20 nM before each tether was pulled. The experiment was run by using constant force mode and switching between 0.5 pN low force and 4–12 pN high force. All force levels were held for at least 5 s (empirically determined to be long enough to include all events). Force feedback was temporarily turned off at the low force to prevent large position fluctuations. Data was collected at 200 Hz (instrument response time ~5–10 ms). Data was collected on individual molecules for 15 min or less. In some cases, data collection on a given molecule was prematurely terminated due to instrument drift out of focus or inadvertent mechanical separation of the bridge DNA from the handles while being held at the high-force level. All experiments were run at 23°C ± 1 °C.</p><p>Single-molecule data were analyzed in MATLAB (Natick, MA). High-force positional plateaus were investigated using a two-state hidden Markov model, which was modified from existing code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mickolajczyk et al., 2015</xref>). The data were centered at 0 by subtracting the mean of the first five data points from the whole vector, and the effective standard deviation was determined by building a distribution of 10-data point boxcar standard deviations (eSD), and finding the median. The intermediate (proteins bound) and final (proteins unbound) positions on the high-force plateau were treated as Gaussian emitters, with centers 0 and +4 eSD units, and standard deviations one eSD unit. A transition matrix was constructed to only allow transitions from the zero-position state to the higher position state. The emission matrix, transition matrix, and experimental data were used as input to the Viterbi algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Viterbi, 1967</xref>), which returned the most likely sequence of hidden states. If a state change was detected, then the bond lifetime was calculated as the duration preceding the state change, and Δx was calculated as the difference in means between an equal number of data points (corresponding to the binding duration) before and after the state change. In some cases, there was drift in the data, which could lead to a larger position change than the Δx jump over time. In these cases, the high-force plateau was truncated to the area just around the Δx jump. Events were only accepted if they were at least four data points long. Every event was manually inspected, and only events that were clearly an instantaneous change in motion (rather than drift) were retained for further analysis. Pooled values of bond lifetime data were fitted to a single-exponential:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mechanical circuit model</title><p>All spring elements in the mechanical circuit model were modeled using the worm-like chain model:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where L<sub>c</sub> is the contour length and L<sub>p</sub> is the persistence length.

The authors show that while the affinity between the MIDAS domain and Rsa1 and Ytm1 is only weak ({greater than or equal to} 7 μM) in solution, it increases significantly under an applied load. Using the developed assay, the authors show that the bond between MIDAS and Rsa1/Ytm1 can be best explained by a catch-slip bond behavior. The authors suggest that the catch bonding between MIDAS and UBL domains plays a key role in the Mdn1-mediated ribosomal biogenesis.

To address this concern, we redesigned the experiment and established a control with a completely different ‘linking’ strategy. Briefly, we generated Rsa4 with a C-terminal SNAP tag (hereafter Rsa4-SNAP) instead of Rsa4-GFP. Rsa4SNAP was covalently attached to a DNA oligonucleotide (similarly to how SNAP-GFP nanobody was), and then annealed to the bridge DNA strand in the force jump assay (thus bypassing the need for GFP/ GFP nanobody). We measured the force-dependent bond lifetime of Rsa4-SNAP with SNAP-MIDAS across the same force range as Rsa4GFP with SNAP-MIDAS. Gratifyingly, we found that the fit for the Rsa4-GFP dataset could be overlaid on the Rsa4-SNAP dataset and hits each datapoint within error. We believe that this control experiment shows that GFP-GFP nanobody connection is not a significant contributing factor to the observed force-dependent bond lifetime measurements in this paper. These new data are including in supplements to Figure 3 (Figure 3 figure supplement 5 and 6).</p><p>The specific changes we made to the text are:</p><p>p. 7</p><p>“As an additional control, we repeated the force jump experiments using Rsa4 with a C-terminal SNAP tag (Rsa4-SNAP), which was directly conjugated to a ssDNA oligonucleotide. Datasets generated with Rsa4-GFP and Rsa4-SNAP were in good agreement with each other (Figure 3 figure supplements 5-6), indicating that the GFP-GFP nanobody connection did not influence bond lifetime measurements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The model for how force regulates MIDAS binding is very elegant, but I do not fully understand the description in the discussion.

Our previously-published biochemical assays showed that MIDAS binding to the Mdn1 AAA ring occurred more readily as a bimolecular interaction (two domains prepared separately) than as an intramolecular interaction. We coupled this with Brownian Dynamics modeling to show that, indeed, there is an entropic cost to stretching out the unstructured linker in order to reach docking site (we approximate 1-2 pN of tension). This then set up a paradox – if intramolecular docking of the MIDAS domain is entropically disfavored, then how come the docked complex (on the pre-ribosome surface) is so stable? We speculate that the catch bond we characterize in the current work may, at least in part, resolve this paradox – tension along the unstructured linker would actually promote, rather than disfavor, MIDAS-UBL binding. We have also updated the diagram in Figure 4G in order to help explain our model in more detail.</p><p>With respect to the kinetics of removal, very little is currently known. However, we do know that when Mdn1 activity is inhibited using the small molecule Rbin-1, that ribosome biogenesis stalls altogether and pre-60S species build up in the nucleolus (Kawashima et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2015). Hence, the kinetics of ribosome assembly in the absence of Mdn1 must be very slow. We have revised the text to make it clearer that more work is needed in order to understand the kinetics and enzymology of Mdn1-driven steps in ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Specific changes to the text: p. 9</p><p>“Based on our findings, we propose a model where the Mdn1 MIDAS-UBL catch bond plays a key role in assembly factor processing (Figure 4G). Mdn1 binds the pre-60S particle and establishes a tripartite interaction between its AAA ring, its MIDAS domain, and the UBL domain of the assembly factor substrate that it must extract (Chen et al., 2018; Kater et al., 2020; Sosnowski et al., 2018). In this MIDAS-docked state, Mdn1’s unstructured linker, which acts as an entropic spring, is stretched; computational modeling of MIDAS docking estimates that 1-2 pN of tension is built up and propagated along the MIDAS-UBL bond axis (Mickolajczyk et al., 2020). A catch bond mechanism helps to explain how this tension promotes, rather than disfavors, MIDAS-UBL binding. 1-2 pN is below the ~3.3-4.2 pN peak of the MIDAS-UBL catch bond, but one possibility is that additional tension is generated by Mdn1’s ATPase activity. The MIDAS domain remains bound to the UBL domain until the assembly factor dissociates from the pre-60S particle. Subsequently, the MIDAS domain undocks from the AAA ring, relieving tension across the bond with the UBL domain, deactivating the catch bond and facilitating assembly factor release. Ytm1 and Rsa4 removal occur at separate stages of pre-60S maturation, in the nucleolus and nucleus, respectively (Bassler et al., 2010; Kressler et al., 2012). We propose that our model holds for both these scenarios. We also note that free copies of Ytm1 and Rsa4 are present in the nucleolus and nucleus (Kressler et al., 2012); the Mdn1 catch bond thus also prevents Mdn1-Rsa4/Ytm1 binding while off the pre-60S, which would compete away usable copies of each protein. Currently, the kinetics of Mdn1-driven steps in ribosome assembly are not well-established. Future work is thus necessary to place the ~1 second bond lifetimes measured here within the multi-step enzymatic process of ribosome biogenesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the catch bond character of the interaction studied here is compellingly demonstrated, the fits of a single-exponential model to the measured survival probabilities (Figure 3 and S3) does not look great. There seems to be some systematic deviation, but that is difficult to evaluate because the authors do not show the residuals. The authors should show the residuals for all fits and demonstrate that the quality of the fit does not improve when a different model is used. If in fact a different model provides a significantly better fit, the interpretation of how the molecular interaction is disrupted might change.</p><p>Also Reviewer 3</p><p>1. Page 6: The authors write that the measured lifetime distributions could be fitted to a single exponential distribution, suggesting that the kinetics are best described by the unbinding from a single bound state. Judged from the data shown in Figure 3 A, B and C, there is a systematic deviation from a single exponential (a distinct shoulder is visible in the 1-2 second time range). The author should discuss this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and in response we have (1) collected a larger data set, (2) included a new supplemental figure (Figure 3 figure supplement 1) comparing single versus double exponential fitting (adding a second exponential reduces the RMSE of the fit by &lt;10%), and (3) Added plots of residuals (as well as QQ plots to show exponential fit quality) for every data set in the paper (see Figure 3 figure supplements 2, 3, and 6 as well as Figure 4 figure supplements 4 and 5). While plotting survival probability on a semilog Y axis has the advantage of enabling easy distinguishment between single exponentials (which look linear) and biexponentials (which look like two connected lines with different slopes), there is the drawback that the final 10% of measurements take up half the Y-axis (and thus noise looks more severe on the bottom 10% than it does on the top 90%). Increasing the number of measurements is the solution to this issue that we have favored. Overall, we believe our larger data set and our new series of figure supplements showing residuals help strengthen our observation that a single exponential is sufficient to fit the lifetime distributions.</p><p>Specific changes to the text (other than the new figures and their legends, as listed above):</p><p>p. 5</p><p>“The distribution (n=57 events from 14 molecules) of bond lifetimes could be fitted to a single exponential (appears linear on a semi-log plot) as opposed to a higher-order exponential (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), consistent with the kinetics of exit from a single bound state (Guo and Guilford 2006).”</p><p>p. 6</p><p>“All measured distributions could be fitted to a single exponential (residuals and analysis in Figure 3—figure supplements 2-3), indicating that applied force influenced the kinetics of dissociation, not the number of states from which dissociation could occur (Huang et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I do not understand Figure 1D. How the force-extension curve shown in Figure 2D &quot;ensured that only a single &quot;tether&quot; was drawn between each pair of beads&quot; (Methods)? What is meant by Δ(Extension) on the x axis? The extension for the dsDNA handles used here (3 kb) should be much longer that the ~100 nm in Figure 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point, and in response we have revised the text and provide a more detailed explanation of Figure 1D. We define a tether as the entire construct (including both dsDNA handles and the bridge DNA) that connects the two beads. Experimentally, it is possible to inadvertently connect the two beads with multiple tethers rather than just one. Beads connected with more than one tether have a significantly different force-extension curve than beads connected by a single tether.</p><p>We use the hairpin construct as a standard because it is known to denature at ~20 pN applied force. For this construct, if multiple tethers connect the two beads, then &gt;&gt;20 pN of force is needed to observe hairpin denaturation. The portion of the force-extension curve in the &lt;20 pN range is dominated by the dsDNA handles (the same dsDNA handles are used for all experiments). The 55 nt and 70 nt bridge constructs also have force-extension curves that are dominated by the dsDNA handles (since the handles are much longer than the bridge). Thus, if the force-extension curve of the 55 or 70 nt bridge constructs overlapped with that of the hairpin construct in the &lt;20 pN range (specifically, we worked in the 4-20 pN range for simplicity), we concluded that a single tether connected to two beads. If we saw that the force-extension curve did not overlap with that of the hairpin construct in the 4-20 pN range, then we deemed it ineligible for measuring single-molecule bond lifetimes.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, the contour length of the DNA handles is much greater than the ~150 nm shown in Figure 2D. This is because we only measured in the range of 4-20 pN. We refer to the X-axis as ΔExtension rather than extension because it is not possible to experimentally find the true point of 0-nm extension (the two beads crash into each other). Instead, we measure the force-extension curve between 4-20 pN of force (ΔExtension=0 when F=4 pN). This annotation is consistent with our previous publications (Mickolajczyk et al., <italic>Biophysical Journal</italic>, 2021). We have revised the Figure 2D caption to define ΔExtension more explicitly.</p><p>Specific changes to the text:</p><p>p. 5</p><p>“For both bridge constructs, we ensured that only a single “tether” was drawn between each pair of beads by examining the shape of the force-extension curve and matching it to a known hairpin standard (Figure 2D, see Methods).”</p><p>Figure 2D caption</p><p>“(D) Example force-extension curves of the DNA handles connected by the 55 nt (red) and 70 nt (blue) bridge. Also shown is a hairpin (gray) which anneals to the dsDNA handles with a 20 nt region leftover; here the distinct unfolding/refolding pattern at loads above 20 pN enables identification of a single “tether” (two dsDNA handles connected by a bridge) between the two beads. Data generated on tethers whose force-extension curves did not overlap with that of the hairpin standard in the 4-20 pN (ΔExtension=0 when Force=4 pN) range were not used.”</p><p>Methods (p. 18)</p><p>“For both the 55 and 70 nt bridge constructs, we ensured that only a single tether was drawn between each pair of beads by measuring the force-extension curve (in the range of 4-20 pN) and matching it to a well-characterized hairpin construct held between identical dsDNA handles (Figure 2D) (Mickolajczyk et al., 2021). This hairpin standard was chosen because it can be mechanically unwound at ~20 pN, thus making it easy to identify if a single tether is drawn (if more than one tether is drawn, &gt;20 pN is needed to observe hairpin unwinding). The force-extension curves are dominated by the dsDNA handles in the 4-20 pN regime. Thus, for the 55 and 70 nt bridge constructs, instances with multiple tethers (i.e. multiple connected sets of dsDNA handles) produced force-extension curves that significantly deviated from (i.e. could not be superimposed onto) that of the hairpin standard.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The 95% confidence intervals for the rate parameters (k0_c and k0_s) are larger than the mean. I assume that the confidence intervals would be substantially more narrow when more events are analyzed, which may be helpful when trying to understand the function of the Mdn1 quantitatively/kinetically. The assay design should make it possible to detect many events per molecule. Is there any reason why the number of events are moderately low (typically not exceeding 30)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct – the large confidence intervals are partially due to the number of counted events. In response, we have collected a larger data set for this revision, focusing specifically on Rsa4-GFP with the 55 nt bridge construct. The fit to the catch-slip model has improved substantially as a result:</p><p>kc0 = 5.3 ± 2.6 s<sup>-1</sup>, xc = -2.0 ± 0.8 nm, ks0 = 0.01 ± 0.02 s<sup>-1</sup>, and xs = 4.1 ± 1.6 nm (fit ± 95% CI).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, our assay design allows up to collect multiple events per molecule. As shown in Figure 2, we typically collect ~1 event per minute. Ultimately, the data collection bandwidth is limited to how long we can collect on a single set of molecules, which we found to be on the timescale of minutes (≤15 minutes spent per molecule). In some cases, data collection on a given molecule was prematurely terminated due to instrument drift out of focus or inadvertent mechanical separation of the bridge DNA from the handles while being held at the “high force” level. Thus, we can increase the number of events by collecting from a larger number of molecules, but cannot easily reach events counts in the hundreds for the twenty experimental conditions (five high force levels, two bridge constructs, two UBL proteins) as well as control conditions. We have revised the text to make limitations on data collection clearer.</p><p>Specific changes to the text:</p><p>Figure 3 caption</p><p>“A.

The use of the bridge strand of DNA in our force jump assay enables the same single molecules to be measured more than once, and has the additional advantage of acting as a “force divider”, enabling smaller forces to be applied to the proteins of interest while holding a larger force of the dsDNA handles (thus holding them taut and maximizing spatial resolution). An associated drawback, however, is that applied forces on the proteins must be indirectly quantified using a mechanical circuit model (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Similar to other experimental geometries used to measure catch bonds (Guo and Guilford, 2006; Huang et al., 2017), our force jump assay applies force at a very high rate (~20,000 pN s<sup>-1</sup>), which may influence protein-protein binding (Rao et al., 2019). Nonetheless, we note that we use the same assay for all proteins in this study, and that the shortest binding durations we measure (20 ms) are &gt;100-fold longer than the estimated rise time of the force jump. In future studies, the molecular configuration used here for the force jump assay (Figure 2A) can be reused for slower force ramp experiments to assess the force loading rate dependence of protein-protein binding durations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
