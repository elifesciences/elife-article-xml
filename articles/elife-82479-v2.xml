The structure of a single P2X subunit has been compared to a dolphin, with two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) that form the ‘fluke’, and a large extracellular domain, comprising the ‘body’, left and right ‘flippers’, and a ‘head’ domain that reaches over one of three inter-subunit ATP binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawate et al., 2009</xref>). The intracellular N- and C-termini are short in most P2X subtypes and have only been resolved in the open state of the P2X3R and, more recently, in the open and closed states of the P2X7R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>). The pro-inflammatory P2X7 subtype is expressed in immune cells and considered an important drug target. In contrast to the other P2XR family members, it has a low ATP sensitivity, shows complete lack of desensitization, and contains a large intracellular C-terminus (240 amino acids [aa]), which mediates diverse downstream effects such as interleukin secretion, plasma membrane permeabilization, blebbing, phosphatidylserine flip, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>). The recently determined cryo-EM structures of the full-length rat P2X7R in the apo/closed and ATP-bound open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>) did not only elucidate details of P2X desensitization, but finally unveiled the structure of the large P2X7 C-terminus. Accordingly, intertwined β-strands from all three subunits form an open state-stabilizing ‘cap domain’, that was also found in the P2X3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). In the P2X7R, however, this ‘cap’ is stabilized by a highly palmitoylated membrane-associated ‘Cys-anchor’ domain, which prevents desensitization. The remaining residues 393–595 fold into a dense globular structure (the so-called ‘ballast domain’), which contains a novel guanosine nucleotide binding motif and a dinuclear zinc binding site. A stretch of 27–29 aa (S443-R471) was not resolved, and it is unclear if each ballast domain is formed by a single subunit or if a domain swap occurs between subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>). While these structures represent a milestone in P2X7 research, the transition dynamics between receptor states in a cellular environment as well as the molecular function of the ballast domain and how it is affected by ATP binding remain unclear. Likewise, the molecular mechanism of current facilitation, a P2X7-characteristic process that describes faster and/or increased current responses upon repeated ATP application, is not understood. In this study, we set out to determine conformational changes associated with P2X7-specific functions by voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF). This method allows simultaneous recording of current responses and associated molecular movements that are reported by an environment-sensitive fluorophore. We have previously used site-specific cysteine-substitution and the thiol-reactive fluorophore tetramethyl-rhodamine-maleimide (TMRM) to show a closing movement of the head domain during activation of the oocyte-expressed P2X1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lörinczi et al., 2012</xref>). However, this procedure is limited to extracellularly accessible residues. To investigate intracellular rearrangements, we therefore employed the fluorescent unnatural amino acid (fUAA) L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)–2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). This can be site-specifically incorporated into a protein by repurposing the <italic>amber</italic> stop codon (TAG) and introducing a corresponding suppressor tRNA (CUA anticodon) loaded with ANAP. A plasmid encoding an ANAP-specific bio-orthogonal suppressor tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>) has been obtained by co-evolution and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) and was successfully used to study voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andriani and Kubo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wulf and Pless, 2018</xref>). This stop-codon suppression can, however, lead to premature translational termination or aberrant stop-codon substitution (read-through) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klippenstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pless et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulsen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide an improved method for fUAA incorporation into <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte-expressed proteins and analyzed membrane surface expression and functionality for a total of 61 P2X7R mutants with ANAP substitutions in the extracellular head domain, the second transmembrane domain (TM2), and the intracellular N- and C-termini. Using VCF, we identified 19 positions in which ANAP reported ATP-induced localized rearrangements. To further expand the VCF toolbox, we demonstrate simultaneous recordings of fluorescence changes from ANAP in combination with other fluorophores. We conclude from our data that (i) current facilitation is intrinsic to the P2X7 protein and likely caused by a change in gating and (ii) the cytoplasmic ballast functions rather independently from the extracellular ligand binding domain and might require activation by additional ligands or protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Improved ANAP incorporation by cytosolic co-injection of mutated <italic>X. laevis</italic> eRF1 cRNA</title><p>To implement and optimize a protocol for incorporation of ANAP into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte-expressed protein, we initially used the P2X1R as it was already intensively studied in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lörinczi et al., 2012</xref>) and has functional similarity with the P2X3R, which at the beginning of this study, represented the only P2XR for which the intracellular termini were resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Using the original 2-step-injection protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>) and a simplified procedure where all components required for the expression of UAA-containing receptors are injected simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), we introduced ANAP into non-conserved positions within the N-terminally His-tagged P2X1R N- and C-termini (position 10 and 388, respectively, ANAP substitutions indicated by *) and compared the formation of full-length and truncated receptors in the plasma membrane by SDS-PAGE. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ANAP-containing P2X1Rs were efficiently expressed and virtually no read-through product was detected in the absence of ANAP. The new protocol resulted in less variable protein expression but also a reduced ratio of full-length and truncated His-P2X1 EGFP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The relative amount of full-length protein was neither increased by different forms of ANAP application nor by variation of injection protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Therefore, we tested if a mutated eukaryotic release factor (eRF1(E55D)), which was previously shown to favor UAA-incorporation over translational termination in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmied et al., 2014</xref>) could also be used in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system. Indeed, co-injection of either purified <italic>X. laevis</italic> eRF1(E55D) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or the respective <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized cRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) resulted in a more than threefold higher ratio of full-length and truncated receptor constructs compared to the 1-step injection method without eRF1(E55D) and a smaller standard deviation compared to the 2-step injection method (1-step+eRF1(E55D): 1.469±0.229; 1-step: 0.418±0.082; 2-step: 1.603±0.933; mean ± S.D.). The applicability of this approach was confirmed for the hα1 glycine receptor (GlyR) A52* mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soh et al., 2017</xref>). In conclusion, this optimized protocol led to more reproducible expression and increased formation of full-length ANAP-labeled receptors and was used in all following experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optimization of fluorescent unnatural amino acid (fUAA) incorporation into <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte-expressed P2X1 receptor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Molecular structure of L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)–2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) and schematic representation of the 2-step injection method for site-specific ANAP incorporation using the <italic>amber</italic> stop-codon (UAG) and a plasmid containing the orthogonal tRNA/tRNA-synthetase pair.

For E121* and Q128* fluorescence changes were only detected with filter set 2, albeit with minimal changes for E121*. Analysis of mutants P120*, E121*, and P123* with filter set 1 was only preliminary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) but showed the same trends as signals recorded with filter set 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Independently of the wavelength, fluorescence changes were always positive for P120* and G126* and negative for Y122*, P123*, and K127*. These consistent changes over the entire ANAP emission spectrum indicate de-/quenching of ANAP either by the ligand ATP and/or other aa residues (see insert table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, S124* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), R125*, and Q128* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) showed positive fluorescence changes in most spectral segments but negative changes for wavelengths &gt;500 nm.

To confirm that these fluorescence signals indeed tracked current facilitation, we analyzed the effects of three additional mutants that were expected to affect facilitation: (i) a single point mutation in the juxtamembrane region (S23N) that in human P2X7 was shown to eliminate current facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp and Evans, 2015</xref>), (ii) a Cys-Ala mutant (replacement of residues identified to be palmitoylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>] in the cysteine-rich region by alanine residues [Ser360, Cys362, Cys371, Cys373, Cys374, and Cys377]), and (iii) a ΔCys-mutant (deletion of the cysteine-rich intracellular region, S360-C377 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roger et al., 2010</xref>]). Contrary to findings in human P2X7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp and Evans, 2015</xref>), the S23N mutation did not eliminate current facilitation in rat P2X7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roger et al., 2010</xref>) and in contrast to the wt and most of the analyzed ANAP-containing mutants, current rise times of the ΔCys mutant were not significantly altered between first and second ATP applications, demonstrating that we can indeed identify current facilitation in our setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the strongly reduced functional expression of the Cys-Ala or ΔCys mutant with additional ANAP-incorporation sites prevented reliable analysis of current and fluorescence kinetics.</p><p>Remarkably, the K127* mutant showed a fluorescence change that was faster than the current increase already upon the first receptor activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes, stop codon suppression either by <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized UAA-aminoacylated tRNAs or by expression of co-evolved tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs has been established. Recently, the semisynthetic ligation of peptide fragments containing the modification using split intervening proteins (inteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarkar et al., 2021</xref>) has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galleano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khoo et al., 2020</xref>). While chemically aminoacylated tRNA cannot be reloaded after deacylation without a tRNA synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klippenstein et al., 2018</xref>), expression of co-evolved orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs requires an additional nuclear injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we combined both methods by simultaneously injecting a synthesized suppressor tRNA, cRNA encoding the tRNA synthetase, ANAP, and cRNA encoding the target protein into the cytoplasm. We further enhanced ANAP incorporation by co-injection of cRNA encoding mutated <italic>X. laevis</italic> eRF1, disfavoring premature translation termination. While mutated eRF1 could potentially interfere with correct translation of endogenous <italic>amber</italic>-terminated oocyte proteins, we observed no apparent impact on oocyte properties. The presented procedure also improved oocyte quality, expression efficiency, and reproducibility and facilitated optimization of injection ratios. While it does not require equipment for synthesis and purification of UAA-labeled tRNA and is easily applicable in a molecular biology lab, it still depends on a co-evolved tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. In combination with UAAs suitable for click chemistry, its flexibility and the choice of fluorophores or functional groups could be greatly expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we could successfully employ the optimized ANAP labeling strategy to explore conformational changes associated with P2X7R activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is P2X7 current facilitation an intrinsic receptor property?</title><p>Based on crystal and cryo-EM structures, a molecular mechanism of P2XR gating has been established: ATP-binding to its extracellular inter-subunit binding sites leads to a jaw-like tightening of the head and dorsal fin domains of neighboring subunits around the ATP molecule. This induces an upward movement of β strands in the lower part of the extracellular domain and associated pore opening. Upon prolonged and/or repeated activation, the P2X7R shows a characteristic increase in current amplitude and speed of channel opening, which is generally associated with a shift toward higher ATP sensitivity. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to this so-called current facilitation: modulation of receptor activity by cholesterol (via direct binding to TM domains or cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus [CRAC] motifs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murrell-Lagnado, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Virgilio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonnord et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karasawa et al., 2017</xref>), cooperative interactions between intracellular N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp and Evans, 2015</xref>), and calcium-dependent calmodulin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roger et al., 2008</xref>). The latter, however, appeared to be specific for rat P2X7 and was not found in the human isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roger et al., 2010</xref>). In monocyte-derived human macrophages, current facilitation as well as inflammasome activation, IL-1β release, blebbing, PS flip, and membrane permeabilization were inhibited by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and Cl<sup>-</sup> channel antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janks et al., 2019</xref>), and it was suggested that facilitation represents a downstream effect of P2X7-mediated PLA2 and Cl<sup>-</sup> channel activation. Single channel recordings of HEK293 cell-expressed rat P2X7Rs recently revealed an increased open probability as a result of ATP-evoked current facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunning et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we also observed a faster onset of current signal upon the second ATP application while changes in the amplitude were less obvious. Importantly, for most ANAP-containing P2X7R constructs studied here, fluorescence changes mirrored this behavior, strongly suggesting that it is a receptor-intrinsic property and does not involve currents from downstream-activated channels, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels or pannexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ousingsawat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riedel et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the K127* head domain mutant showed faster fluorescence than current changes even upon the first ATP application. Thus, ANAP in this position reports a movement or interaction that precedes channel opening and is most likely related to ligand binding. A similar result was observed for the TMRM-labeled F11*/S124C double mutant, where the onset of TMRM signal upon the first ATP application was faster than the current and ANAP fluorescence change (but coincided upon the second application). In contrast to TMRM, ANAP in position 124 showed fluorescence signals that paralleled current responses, suggesting that different fluorophores can report different processes, possibly due to differences in size and/or sensitivity to the environment. Supporting the idea that these fast fluorescence changes are related to ligand binding, they were only observed in mutants containing fluorophores near the ATP binding site. Fast ligand-induced fluorescence changes already in the non-facilitated P2X7 state imply that ligand binding is unaltered between the first and second activation and consequently, changes in channel gating account for the observed current facilitation.</p><p>Fluorescence signals recorded from ANAP in positions near the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pippel et al., 2017</xref>) could result from different simultaneously occurring effects during channel opening and evidence for both, a shift in ANAP emission toward longer wavelengths (position 340) and dequenching (positions 339 and 341) were observed. Interestingly, ANAP in position 340 revealed significant differences in the fluorescence amplitudes between the first and second ATP application. An intriguing explanation would be that it detects a slowly or non-reversible conformational change after the first ATP application, which could facilitate subsequent gating movements and thereby account for current facilitation. However, T340* was the only construct that did not show a faster current onset upon the second ATP application, possibly because ANAP substitution in this critical position already strongly facilitated gating, as indicated by the large ‘leak’ currents, likely reflecting partial constitutive ligand-independent opening.</p><p>Based on the above observations, we propose that the faster activation upon the second ATP application is an intrinsic property of the P2X7R. This conclusion is also in good agreement with the fact that the current facilitation but not downstream signaling events is seen in truncated P2X7 constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>). One possibility for a molecular mechanism would be a pre-tensioning of TM2-helices during the first receptor activation that eases channel opening upon a second activation. It is not known, but likely that the cryo-EM structure of the ATP-bound open P2X7R represents the facilitated state. If so, the open-state stabilizing cap domain might not be locked in place in the naïve state but could be formed during the first receptor activation and then stabilized via the cysteine-rich anchor domain. The cap domain may then support the upward transition of TM2 and thereby accelerate current responses. Dynamic cysteine palmitoylation and cholesterol interactions might modulate this process as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Virgilio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, initial receptor activation may change accessibility and/or affinity for a yet unknown allosteric ligand and thereby modulate P2X7 activation. All these suggested mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Is the ballast domain affected by ATP-binding/channel opening?</title><p>While the functionality of P2X7 as a cation channel is not impaired by lack of the intracellular C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klapperstück et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>), its deletion disrupts a number of P2X7-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>), which most likely depend on downstream signaling pathways. A major aim of this study was the identification of C-terminal domains involved in such signaling. Most of the intracellular positions in which ANAP reported relative protein rearrangements were, however, located upstream of the cap domain either within the N-terminus (A3, C5, W7, F11) or right after TM2 (T361). Despite clear surface expression and current responses of at least 12 constructs with ANAP in the cytoplasmic ballast domain, only two of these mutants (D423* and A564*) revealed detectable but small fluorescence changes upon ligand application, suggesting that ATP binding induces only limited structural rearrangement in this domain, and that it is largely uncoupled from the extracellularly initiated conformational changes. Interestingly D423*, which showed only sporadic changes, lies in a short sequence with homology to an α-actinin 2 binding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). Since P2X7 activation induces plasma membrane morphology changes, and interactions with cytoskeletal proteins have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>), an intriguing possibility would be that ANAP in position 423 reports interactions with cytoskeletal components. In A564*, ANAP is located near the GTP/GDP-binding site but showed much smaller signals than in positions near the ATP binding site, arguing against GTP/GDP (un-)binding, in agreement with the cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>). However, A564 is also surrounded by other proposed interaction sites, including an LPS binding sequence and a calcium-dependent CaM binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denlinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roger et al., 2008</xref>), which might account for the observed signals.</p><p>In summary, we improved ANAP incorporation into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte-expressed protein and performed an extensive VCF analysis of P2X7R mutants carrying ANAP in 61 positions throughout the receptor. We conclude from our data, that current facilitation is, at least partly, an intrinsic property of the P2X7R and involves an accelerated channel gating rather than ligand binding. In addition, we propose that ligand-induced extracellular and TM domain movements are not significantly translated to the cytosolic ballast domain and that intracellular ligands or interactors are required to ‘activate’ this domain. Protocols for simultaneous recording of ANAP with TMRM, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent R-GECO1.2, or mNeonGreen-labeled FRET partners are presented that might help to validate P2X7 downstream signaling events and analyze their molecular mechanisms and dynamics, once such interactors have been reliably determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</title><p><italic>X. laevis</italic> females were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI) and kept at the Core Facility Animal Models (CAM) of the Biomedical Center (BMC) of LMU Munich, Germany (Az:4.3.2–5682/LMU/BMC/CAM) in accordance with the EU Animal Welfare Act.

Bright blue-stained damaged oocytes were then discarded, and intact oocytes were homogenized with a 200 μl pipet tip in 10 µl homogenization buffer per oocyte (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.4 mM Pefabloc SC and 0.5% <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, [both Merck/Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany]). Membrane proteins were extracted by 10 min incubation on ice and separated from the debris by two centrifugation steps (10 min at 14,000 × g and 4°C). 100 µl of the protein extract were then supplemented with 400 µl of homogenization buffer containing 10 mM imidazole and added to 50 µl Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) preconditioned with washing buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer [pH 8.0] containing 0.08 mM Pefabloc, 0.1% <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, and 25 mM imidazole). After 1 hr incubation under inversion at 4°C in the dark, beads were washed three to four times with 500 µl washing buffer, and His-tagged protein was eluted (≥10 min at RT with occasional flipping to suspend the beads) with 2×50 µl elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5% <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside). 32 µl of the eluate were supplemented with 8 µl 5× lithium dodecyl sulfate (LiDS) sample buffer (5% [w/v] LiDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 40% [v/v] glycerol in 0.3 M Tris HCl [pH 6.8]), incubated at 95°C for 10 min, and separated by reducing SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. Fluorescence-labeled protein was visualized with a Typhoon trio fluorescence scanner (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL), and relative protein quantities were determined using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Lanes were selected as regions of interest and transformed into 1D profile plots. Band intensities were then quantified by integrating the area of each peak in the profile plot relative to the baseline of each lane. Data was visualized using GraphPad Prism software (Version 9.3.0, San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>VCF recordings</title><p>Recordings were performed in a custom-made measuring chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that is split into an upper and lower compartment, which are individually perfused and connected by a 0.75 mm hole on which the oocyte is placed. The lower compartment has a transparent bottom, and the chamber was mounted on an Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, Oberkochen, Germany) so that the oocyte was centered above the objective with the animal pole facing down to avoid increased background fluorescence by the lighter vegetal pole. Upper and lower compartments were separately perfused with recording solution and recording or agonist solution, respectively, using a gravity-based perfusion system and a membrane vacuum pump. Solutions in the lower compartment were switched by computer-controlled magnetic valves.</p><p>To avoid inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated downstream effects and to obtain reproducible current responses, recordings were performed in divalent-free buffer (90 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5) complemented with flufenamic acid and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (both 0.1 mM). For measurements with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffers, EGTA was omitted, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.2–0.5 mM) was added (in case of P2X7-R-GECO constructs, FRET measurements between ANAP and mNeonGreen and control measurements of ANAP-containing constructs to test for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific effects). If not otherwise noted, the agonist solution contained 300 μM ATP and was applied for 15 s in 195 s intervals. Intracellular electrode resistances were below 1.2 MΩ, and recordings were performed at room temperature at a holding potential of –30 mV to keep the current amplitudes reproducible. The solution exchange in the lower chamber is finished in about 1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lörinczi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To exclude mechanically induced fluorescence changes due to solution switching, all recording protocols started with sequential applications of ATP-free recording solutions from different tubes and magnetic valves. If required, solution speed and oocyte position were readjusted to ensure the absence of mechanical artifacts.</p><p>For fluorescence recordings, the microscope was equipped with two LEDs as excitation sources (UV-LED M365LP1 with 365 nm, green LED M565L3 with 565 nm, both Thorlabs GmbH, Bergkirchen, Germany). Since UV excitation in oocytes causes relatively high background fluorescence levels, detectors must feature a wide dynamic range, while maintaining a sufficiently high sensitivity in order to record small fluorescence changes. To this end, two cooled, high-sensitivity MPPC detectors (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) were used for simultaneous fluorescence detection at two different spectral segments. For optical filters and dichroic mirrors see Key resource table.</p><p>Single-channel fully programmable instrumentation amplifiers with Bessel low-pass filter characteristics (Alligator Technologies, Costa Mesa, CA) were used for signal scaling. To minimize photobleaching, LEDs were pulsed using self-developed high-speed LED drivers with sub-μs rise time. Pulse lengths were set in the ~20 μs range to allow for the fluorescence readout signal chain to settle. Fluorescence signal digitization was synchronized to the excitation pulses using an STM32F407 microcontroller (STMicroelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland). Its timer peripherals were re-triggered by each ADC conversion cycle in order to create an LED illumination pulse that starts shortly before the next ADC conversion cycle. Whenever two excitation wavelengths were used, excitation pulses were staggered in time with the longer wavelength excitation pulse signal being digitized first, preventing bleedthrough of background fluorescence excited by the shorter excitation wavelength to the longer-wavelength detection channel. A water-immersion objective with high numerical aperture and a large working distance (W N-Achroplan 63×/0,9 M27, Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to maximize the collection of emitted photons and to focus on the oocyte membrane.</p><p>Currents were measured with a Turbo Tec-05X amplifier and CellWorks E 5.5.1 software (both npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany) and were used for current and fluorescence recordings and valve control. Current signals were digitized at 400 Hz and downsampled in CellWorks to 200 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Dose-response analysis</title><p>To determine agonist dose-response curves, ATP was applied for 15 s in 195 s intervals. A reference concentration (ATP<sub>Ref</sub>) of 300 μM was applied until stable responses were obtained and was then alternately applied with ATP concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 3 mM (ATP<sub>Test</sub>). All responses were normalized to the response of ATP<sub>Ref</sub>, and EC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the four-parameter Hill equation: <italic>% Response = Bottom + (Top−Bottom)/(1+10^[(LogEC<sub>50</sub>−X)*n<sub>H</sub></italic>]) with <italic>Bottom</italic> and <italic>Top</italic> constrained to 0%, <italic>and</italic> maximum responses, respectively, <italic>X</italic> corresponding to the log of agonist concentration, and <italic>n<sub>H</sub></italic> corresponding to the Hill coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Fluorescence and current signals were analyzed and visualized using a Python-based script (for packages used, see Key resource table): Fluorescence signals were denoised using a fifth-order Bessel filter with a low-pass corner frequency of 4 Hz. Maximum amplitudes of ATP-evoked current and fluorescence responses from different receptor constructs were summarized, compared, and visualized using GraphPad Prism software (Version 9.3.0, San Diego, CA). The following inclusion criteria were applied for recordings:</p><p>(i) ATP application must evoke a current response &gt;0.1 μA, (ii) leak currents must be stable for the duration of the recording (at least two ATP applications), (iii) repeated ATP applications must elicit reproducible current responses (&gt;0.8 μA), (iv) fluorescence signals must be without mechanical artifacts and clearly distinguishable from fluorescence changes of wt expressing oocytes (see below). 2–3 days after injection, repeated application of 300 μM ATP to wt-expressing oocytes elicited reproducible currents (i.e. first and second current responses differed less than 10% and reached a plateau, at least during the second application), which were taken as a reference. Longer expression times resulted in irregular and irreproducible current responses and less stable oocytes. In case of mutated receptors, longer expression times were often needed to yield current responses comparable to wt P2X7.</p><p>We observed a gradual decrease in fluorescence signal for the duration of ligand application in control oocytes expressing wt receptors even in the absence of ANAP. To distinguish ANAP-specific fluorescence signals from these gradual changes, for signal analysis only fluorescence changes upon ATP application were considered that were either positive, or negative but additionally not linear. If fluorescence signals from mutant expressing oocytes were not distinguishable from fluorescence changes observed for wt expressing oocytes no fluorescence change was assumed (0% ΔF/F). Only signals that were recorded in at least three different oocytes were considered for analysis. Additionally, fluorescence changes that were recorded in less than 40% of analyzed oocytes expressing one specific receptor construct or that had averaged ΔF/F values &lt;0.3% were not considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were either represented as mean ± S.D., as box plots, or as mean ± S.E.M. with the number of recordings given in brackets, and statistical analysis was performed by either two-tailed unpaired Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test or two-tailed paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, as indicated.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gucan Dai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the effort needed to generate this impressive data set. Although there was enthusiasm for the overall approach and the reviewers agreed on the potential of the study, it was felt that additional mechanistic insight on facilitation and impact of intracellular factors would be required before the work would be of sufficient interest. Therefore we ask you to carefully address the following essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Examination of fluorescence changes in the ballast domain (e.g. A564*) in response to manipulation of at least one or two relevant cytoplasmic factors (e.g. GTP/GDP, Zn2+, palmitoylation (e.g. mutations) or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). This is crucial to provide mechanistic insight on the functional role of the ballast domain.</p><p>(2) Careful validation that the fluorescence changes from e.g. S124*, F11*, S127C do in fact track facilitation. This could be achieved by studying fluorescence signals of mutants that alter or eliminate facilitation (if those mutants exist) or by examining the effect of experimental manipulations of cytoplasmic factors on fluorescence (and current) facilitation (e.g. removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or similar). This is particularly interesting for the intracellular N-terminus, which cannot be labeled with cysteine-reactive fluorophores.</p><p>(3) A more thorough characterization of key mutants in terms of ATP sensitivity of current and fluorescence, facilitation and activation/deactivation kinetics. This is required for a more quantitive analysis and has the potential to yield additional insight on the mechanism of receptor activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would have expected the authors to functionally characterize the mutants on which they focus in the paper, for instance by measuring the ATP EC50, to have an idea of whether ANAP incorporation at the different sites perturbs receptor function.</p><p>When studying fluorescence changes at the level of the head domain (p7), the authors write that &quot;fluorescence and current changes started simultaneously and showed shorter rising times upon repeated ATP applications&quot;; &quot;K127* showed a fluorescence change that was faster than the current increase&quot; but no quantification of the fluorescence and current kinetics is given. It would be nice to have such quantification. It would be also nice to have a comparison of the fluorescence and current ATP dose-response curves for mutants showing sufficiently large fluorescence changes. This would further support the fact that ANAP at the level of the head domain tracks gating.</p><p>ANAP incorporation at TM2 positions seems to induce constitutive currents in P2X7Rs. Is there a channel blocker specific for P2X7Rs that would allow to give an estimation of constitutive activity of these mutants?</p><p>Page 9, it is written that &quot;the kinetics of F11* fluorescence correlated with current facilitation&quot;. As before, this statement solely relies on the qualitative observation of current and fluorescent traces. Quantitative measurements of fluorescence and current kinetics during the first and second application of ATP is necessary to substantiate that claim. Here again, a dose-response curve of current and fluorescence for ATP of P2X7-F11* would be a plus to determine the gating step(s) tracked by ANAP at this position.</p><p>Attributing the lack of ATP-induced fluorescence changes observed in mutants with ANAP incorporated in the ballast domain to a lack of functional coupling between the extracellular and the intracellular domains is a strong assumption. The issue with ANAP incorporation in the C-terminus is the membrane expression of truncated proteins that are functional. Since the authors showed that these truncated proteins exists, if they are functional, they contribute to the measured current. The proportion of ANAP-labeled proteins could thus be too low to yield fluorescence changes despite large currents. To study the contribution of truncated proteins, the authors should characterize these truncated proteins by expressing just the mRNA with the amber stop codon in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, investigate potential ATP-induced currents carried by these truncated receptors and measure ATP dose-response curves. Comparing ATP dose-response curves of ANAP-mutants to purely truncated proteins should allow estimating the contribution of truncated proteins to the general current.</p><p>It seems that calcium induces fluctuations of ANAP fluorescence. Does calcium have any direct effect on ANAP fluorescence?</p><p>It seems that fluorescence changes at some positions of the extracellular head domain and intracellular N-terminus track the process of facilitation. Tracking of this process is probably the most interesting finding of this paper, since the mechanism of facilitation is not known. In the paper, facilitation is measured as the increase of channel opening kinetics upon multiple applications of ATP. However, the first application of ATP clearly shows a small, fast component and a bigger, slow component (see, for instance, Figure 3F, 5C, 6A). Could it be that the first component reflects initial gating and the second one the slow facilitation process that occurs upon prolonged ATP application? Could the fast kinetics of K217* fluorescence match the fast component of current, indicating that K217* tracks the initial ATP opening step but not current facilitation? Similarly, on Figure 6 it looks like TMRM kinetics match first the fast current component, while F11* fluorescence matches the kinetics of current facilitation. Could the authors comment on it?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To strengthen the points of weakness above and to elevate the scientific merits of the paper, I have some comments which require attention.</p><p>(1A) I am curious to know the P2X7 structural differences by VCF between just before the 1st application and just before the 2nd application of ATP, to clarify the structural background of &quot;memory&quot; of ATP application.</p><p>(1B) Will there be any difference in (1A), in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, i.e. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via P2X7.</p><p>(2A) Facilitation of F change was detected e.g. in S124*, F11*, S127C. Possible mechanisms of facilitation are discussed including mediators such as GDP, cholesterol, palmitoylation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (Lines 335-342), However, there are no experimental results to support or deny them. It is desired to examine the effect of experimental manipulations of these factors on the F(and I) facilitation (e.g. removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>(2B) Line 273: &quot;the so-called current facilitation in P2X7 is due to a change in receptor gating rather than ligand binding&quot;, Line 366: &quot;Ligand binding is unaltered between the 1st and 2nd activation and consequently, changes in channel gating account for the observed current facilitation&quot;.

Although there was enthusiasm for the overall approach and the reviewers agreed on the potential of the study, it was felt that additional mechanistic insight on facilitation and impact of intracellular factors would be required before the work would be of sufficient interest. Therefore we ask you to carefully address the following essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Examination of fluorescence changes in the ballast domain (e.g. A564*) in response to manipulation of at least one or two relevant cytoplasmic factors (e.g. GTP/GDP, Zn2+, palmitoylation (e.g. mutations) or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). This is crucial to provide mechanistic insight on the functional role of the ballast domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more insight in the role of the ballast domain would be highly informative. However, the relevance of the cytoplasmic factors such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> and GTP has not been defined so far and no functional readouts for mutations in the GTP or Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are known, which hampers their investigation. At least in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, we expected mutations to be not tolerated (Gonnord et al., 2009), likely because of a structural function in receptor folding. Also, our set-up and experimental conditions do not allow a direct comparison of effects before and after intracellular modulation (e.g. by Zn<sup>2+</sup> or GDP/GTP).</p><p>We therefore concentrated on possible effects of (de-)palmitoylation and a previously described interaction with calmodulin and generated and analyzed the following three additional mutants:</p><p>(i) Cys-Ala P2X7 (replacement of six palmitoylated residues Ser360 and Cys362, 371, 373, 374, 377, McCarthy et al., 2019) in the cysteine-rich region by alanine residues,</p><p>(ii) DCys P2X7 (deletion of the cysteine-rich intracellular region (S360-C377)), and</p><p>(iii) DCaM P2X7 (disruption of a proposed calmodulin (CaM) binding site by three point mutations I541T, S552C, V559G Roger et al., 2010).</p><p>According to (McCarthy et al., 2019) and (Roger et al., 2010), DCys- and Cys-Ala mutants were expected to be not palmitoylated and to show no facilitation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we indeed did not see facilitation in the DCys mutant while expression of the Cys-Ala mutant was too low for analysis (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, compare also point 2). Expression of these mutants, was further reduced by the additional mutations for ANAP incorporation (F11*, S124*, K127*, D423*, or A564*), making a reliable detection of the corresponding fluorescence changes impossible.</p><p>The CaM-binding site in rat P2X7 was previously shown to affect current facilitation (Roger et al., 2010). Here, the DCaM mutant showed facilitation comparable to wt P2X7. Likewise, combination with ANAP in intracellular positions or the head domain (F11*, D423*, A564* and S124*, K127*, respectively) revealed similar fluorescence changes as observed for the single mutants with intact CaM binding sites. This argues against a major functional effect of the CaM binding site mutation on current kinetics or molecular movements in the oocyte-expressed receptor. These data are now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and mentioned in line 286ff.</p><p>As an additional approach to address a potential interaction of the P2X7 receptor with CaM, we performed FRET experiments with mNeonGreen-tagged CaM and ANAP-labeled P2X7 (ANAP introduced in A3, Q455, L523, or L527 and preliminary experiments with R125, T340, R364, E406, V517, L569, and Y595). However, these recordings revealed no differences to the negative control (wt P2X7 with co-injected ANAP and mNeonGreen-tagged CaM) and were therefore discontinued.</p><p>These additional data are now added as Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and referred to in the text (lines 343ff).</p><p>Although these experiments cannot exclude an interaction with CaM, they do not support an important role of CaM in the observed current facilitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Careful validation that the fluorescence changes from e.g. S124*, F11*, S127C do in fact track facilitation. This could be achieved by studying fluorescence signals of mutants that alter or eliminate facilitation (if those mutants exist) or by examining the effect of experimental manipulations of cytoplasmic factors on fluorescence (and current) facilitation (e.g. removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or similar). This is particularly interesting for the intracellular N-terminus, which cannot be labeled with cysteine-reactive fluorophores.</p></disp-quote><p>Deletion of the cysteine-rich region was previously shown to eliminate current facilitation (Roger et al., 2010). In agreement, current rise times (compare also point 3 below) of the first and second ATP applications to the DCys mutant were unaltered in our experiments. In contrast, current rise times clearly accelerated in the wt, S124*, and F11* mutations, demonstrating that we can indeed identify current facilitation in our set-up. However, the DCys and Cys-Ala mutants showed already decreased currents and their combination with sites for ANAP incorporation (F11*, S124*) resulted in further reduced functional expression, which prevented analysis of the corresponding fluorescence changes.</p><p>An S127C mutant was not prepared or mentioned in the text and we assume that the reviewer referred to K127*, which showed facilitation only for the current but not for the fluorescence. For DCys/K127*, robust fluorescence changes were only detected in one out of 12 oocytes. In this case, the fluorescence changes were virtually identical upon first and second ATP application, as expected.</p><p>As an alternative approach, we also combined the three ANAP-substituted mutants (S124*, K127*, F11*) with an S23N mutant that has been shown to alter the kinetics of receptor activation in human P2X7 (Allsopp and Evans, 2015). However, this mutation did not induce an effect on rat P2X7 kinetics.</p><p>The analyses confirming facilitation of current rise times in the S124*, F11* mutations and elimination of current facilitation by the DCys mutation are now included in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and in lines 190ff in the text.</p><p>Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was generally omitted in the presented VCF recordings since it interfered with ANAP fluorescence measurements (compare line 324 and material and methods, line 653ff). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer affected overall baseline fluorescence in VCF-experiments independent of the presence or absence of ANAP and additionally promoted receptor desensitization (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), making these conditions unsuitable for reliable detection and analysis of receptor responses.</p><p>We now added photometric data, demonstrating also a direct effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on ANAP fluorescence (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), albeit only at very high concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A more thorough characterization of key mutants in terms of ATP sensitivity of current and fluorescence, facilitation and activation/deactivation kinetics. This is required for a more quantitive analysis and has the potential to yield additional insight on the mechanism of receptor activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated ATP dose response curves for the current responses of wt P2X7 receptor, the key mutants F11*, S124*, K127*, D423*, A564*, and the TMRM-labeled F11*/S124C double mutant and show that their ATP sensitivities differed less than 3fold from that of the wt P2X7.</p><p>Unfortunately, dose response analysis of fluorescence responses could not be performed due to ANAP bleaching during the long recording protocol (about 15-40 min) and the high variability of background fluorescence, which made normalization of responses from different oocytes impossible.</p><p>For a quantitative analysis of current facilitation/activation kinetics, we determined the 10-50% rise times of current and fluorescent signal increases upon first and second ATP application for wt P2X7, the DCys mutant, the DCaM mutant, as well as mutants F11*, S124*, K127*, T340*, and the TMRM-labeled F11*/S124C double mutant. Kinetics of channel deactivation were not analyzed as they were strongly delayed, most likely due to turbulences in the measuring chamber that resulted in a slow wash-out of ATP.</p><p>These data are now provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and 3, and Table 2. For corresponding text see specific reviewer questions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would have expected the authors to functionally characterize the mutants on which they focus in the paper, for instance by measuring the ATP EC50, to have an idea of whether ANAP incorporation at the different sites perturbs receptor function.</p></disp-quote><p>ATP EC<sub>50</sub> values of current responses have now been added for the wt P2X7 receptor and key mutants F11*, S124*, K127*, D423*, A564* as well as the F11*/S124C double mutant.

It would be nice to have such quantification. It would be also nice to have a comparison of the fluorescence and current ATP dose-response curves for mutants showing sufficiently large fluorescence changes. This would further support the fact that ANAP at the level of the head domain tracks gating.</p></disp-quote><p>ATP dose response curves for currents have been added (see above). Generation of dose response curves for fluorescence was hampered by bleaching and varying background fluorescence of individual oocytes (see also above and Essential Revision, point 3).</p><p>Quantification of current and fluorescence kinetics for the key mutants F11*, S124*, K127* and the TMRM-labeled F11*/S124C double mutant has now been performed and the respective data have been included in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 (see also Essential Revision, point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ANAP incorporation at TM2 positions seems to induce constitutive currents in P2X7Rs. Is there a channel blocker specific for P2X7Rs that would allow to give an estimation of constitutive activity of these mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, there is no channel blocker of P2X7 available. However, the P2X7 antagonist A438079 (Allsopp et al., 2018) was able to decrease the leak currents of the T340* and L341* mutants. These data are now included as Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (referred to in line 223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9, it is written that &quot;the kinetics of F11* fluorescence correlated with current facilitation&quot;. As before, this statement solely relies on the qualitative observation of current and fluorescent traces. Quantitative measurements of fluorescence and current kinetics during the first and second application of ATP is necessary to substantiate that claim. Here again, a dose-response curve of current and fluorescence for ATP of P2X7-F11* would be a plus to determine the gating step(s) tracked by ANAP at this position.</p></disp-quote><p>These data have now been included (see above and Essential Revision, point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Attributing the lack of ATP-induced fluorescence changes observed in mutants with ANAP incorporated in the ballast domain to a lack of functional coupling between the extracellular and the intracellular domains is a strong assumption. The issue with ANAP incorporation in the C-terminus is the membrane expression of truncated proteins that are functional. Since the authors showed that these truncated proteins exists, if they are functional, they contribute to the measured current. The proportion of ANAP-labeled proteins could thus be too low to yield fluorescence changes despite large currents. To study the contribution of truncated proteins, the authors should characterize these truncated proteins by expressing just the mRNA with the amber stop codon in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, investigate potential ATP-induced currents carried by these truncated receptors and measure ATP dose-response curves. Comparing ATP dose-response curves of ANAP-mutants to purely truncated proteins should allow estimating the contribution of truncated proteins to the general current.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful suggestion, these control experiments have now been performed for the D423* or A564* mutants and revealed less than 5% of the respective control current responses (RNA co-injected with all essential components) if the respective RNAs were co-injected only with water.</p><p>Thus, these truncated subunits do not or very inefficiently form functional homotrimers and their contribution to the current can be largely excluded. However, they might form functional heterotrimers with ANAP-labeled full-length subunits and as such, could still contribute to the fluorescence signal. Nevertheless, the fact that the EC<sub>50</sub> values at the ANAP-labeled constructs were similar to those at the wt P2X7, argues against a major effect of the truncated subunits.</p><p>These data have now been included as Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that calcium induces fluctuations of ANAP fluorescence. Does calcium have any direct effect on ANAP fluorescence?</p></disp-quote><p>To test this possibility, we measured the emission spectra of ANAP-containing recording solution in the absence and presence of 10 μM, 100 μM, 1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM, or 1 M Ca<sup>2+</sup> and found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases ANAP fluorescence, but only at concentrations above 100 mM. We included these photometric data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>It needs to be considered, however, that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluctuations in VCF-measurements occurred also in the absence of ANAP (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that fluorescence changes at some positions of the extracellular head domain and intracellular N-terminus track the process of facilitation. Tracking of this process is probably the most interesting finding of this paper, since the mechanism of facilitation is not known. In the paper, facilitation is measured as the increase of channel opening kinetics upon multiple applications of ATP. However, the first application of ATP clearly shows a small, fast component and a bigger, slow component (see, for instance, Figure 3F, 5C, 6A). Could it be that the first component reflects initial gating and the second one the slow facilitation process that occurs upon prolonged ATP application? Could the fast kinetics of K217* fluorescence match the fast component of current, indicating that K217* tracks the initial ATP opening step but not current facilitation? Similarly, on Figure 6 it looks like TMRM kinetics match first the fast current component, while F11* fluorescence matches the kinetics of current facilitation. Could the authors comment on it?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, current changes appear to be biphasic and we cannot exclude that the fast current component from K127* and TMRM-labeled F11*/S124C P2X7 match initial fast gating that occurs before the onset of facilitation and is reported by ANAP in position 127 or TMRM in position 124. However, the initial fast current component increases substantially between first and second ATP-application. This is not mirrored by the fluorescence signals, which are virtually identical between first and second ATP-applications. Therefore, we think that the fluorescence for this mutant reports a different process. Also, taking into account the proximity of the fluorophores to the orthosteric binding-site we consider it more likely, that these mutants report a process related to ligand binding. Compare also new Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To strengthen the points of weakness above and to elevate the scientific merits of the paper, I have some comments which require attention.</p><p>(1A) I am curious to know the P2X7 structural differences by VCF between just before the 1st application and just before the 2nd application of ATP, to clarify the structural background of &quot;memory&quot; of ATP application.</p></disp-quote><p>Comparing the structures before first and second ATP application is very difficult with an indirect method like VCF, which provides mainly information about dynamic processes. Determination of different receptor states with this method would require clearly distinct fluorescence signals upon first and second activation, detailed structural information, and most likely numerous additional mutants to deduce and confirm specific conformational changes. Based on our observations, we generally suggest a potential transition into a pre-activated state (line 446) but do not want to elaborate on this to avoid overinterpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1B) Will there be any difference in (1A), in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, i.e. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via P2X7.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments in presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) were performed to test for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific effects (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) but revealed large unspecific signals (even in the absence of ANAP) in the spectral range of ANAP emission and thus hampered analysis. Recordings in 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> from oocytes expressing F11* and S124* did not reveal obvious changes in the pattern of ANAP fluorescence signals compared to measurements in divalent-free recording solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2A) Facilitation of F change was detected e.g. in S124*, F11*, S127C. Possible mechanisms of facilitation are discussed including mediators such as GDP, cholesterol, palmitoylation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (Lines 335-342), However, there are no experimental results to support or deny them. It is desired to examine the effect of experimental manipulations of these factors on the F(and I) facilitation (e.g. removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments to investigate effects of palmitoylation (using two mutants in which the palmitoylation sites were removed, Figure 3—figure supplement 3) and a CaM interaction using a mutant with mutated CaM-binding motif and investigating FRET between ANAP-labeled P2X7 and mNeonGreen-tagged CaM (Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3, respectively). These data confirmed that deletion of a cysteine-rich intracellular region eliminates current facilitation (Roger et al., 2010) and that some of our mutants indeed track facilitation. However, mutation of the CaM binding site and FRET experiments did not support an effect of calmodulin or were inconclusive. Please see Essential Revisions points 1and 2 for details.</p><p>We would also like to point out that the changes observed in our study are compatible with a facilitation process that is an intrinsic property of the channel and does not require intracellular factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2B) Line 273: &quot;the so-called current facilitation in P2X7 is due to a change in receptor gating rather than ligand binding&quot;, Line 366: &quot;Ligand binding is unaltered between the 1st and 2nd activation and consequently, changes in channel gating account for the observed current facilitation&quot;. I wonder if this is correct, as F facilitation is observed in S124* which is close to the ATP binding site (Figure 3F).</p></disp-quote><p>As described, the fluorescence changes can report both ligand interactions and protein movements as well as combinations of both. The specific effects depend not only on the orientation and position of the mutated residue but also the fluorophore used (e.g. different kinetics of TMRM and ANAP in position 124, compare also line 420ff). The fact that some mutants, like TMRM-labeled double mutant F11*/S124C and K127* detect fast processes (likely associated with direct ligand interactions or movements during ligand binding), does not exclude the possibility that fluorophores in neighboring positions (like ANAP-labeled S124*) detect relative domain movements within the receptor (likely resulting from a quenching/dequenching by aromatic residues or changes in the polarity of the environment) that contribute to the opening mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2C) F facilitation was detected not in S124C-TMRM (Figure 6A), not in K127* (Figure 3F), but in S124* (Figure 3F).

Therefore, the immediate environment can be completely different for S124* and K127* and ANAP can even report different changes in neighbouring positions.
