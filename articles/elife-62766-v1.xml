Current evidence indicates that the activities of ensembles of hippocampal neurons represent distinct memory elements as well as the relationships between those elements. In mammals, the hippocampus is comprised of four principal components: the dentate gyrus (DG), and the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields. The most prominent circuit for hippocampal information flow is a trisynaptic loop in which (i) stellate cells in the entorhinal cortex send axons to synapse onto dentate granule cells (DGCs; the major class of excitatory output neurons in the DG), (ii) DGCs send their axons, the mossy fibers (MFs), to synapse onto CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites, (iii) CA3 pyramidal cells send their axons, the Schaeffer collaterals, to synapse onto CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites, and (iv) CA1 pyramidal cells send axons to synapse onto pyramidal cells in the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siegelbaum and Kandel, 2013</xref>). Additional projections from the entorhinal cortex synapse directly onto hippocampal pyramidal cells.</p><p>The function of the DG has been an object of investigation and speculation for more than 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>). Among its many proposed functions, a role for the DG in pattern separation is broadly supported by data from both rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berron et al., 2016</xref>). These data are consistent with a model in which the DG improves memory discriminations by enhancing the distinction between similar inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Dijk and Fenton, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Research on DG function has been hampered by the DG‚Äôs large size and relative inaccessibility within the brain. These characteristics preclude its surgical ablation without substantial collateral damage. While viral gene transfer and optogenetic methods permit controlled activation or inactivation of subregions of the DG, it is impractical with current viral injection and fiber optic technologies to manipulate the entire DG bilaterally. One partial solution to this challenge is selective pharmacologic ablation of DGCs by local injections of the microtubule depolymerizing drug colchicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldschmidt and Steward, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walsh et al., 1986</xref>). For reasons that are unclear, DGCs are more sensitive to colchicine than are the other major classes of hippocampal neurons. However, the activation of microglia secondary to DGC death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldschmidt and Steward, 1982</xref>), and the likelihood of sublethal physiologic effects of colchicine on other classes of neurons makes this method less than optimal (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xavier and Costa, 2009</xref>). Similarly, X-irradiation of the neonatal forebrain reduces DGC number and impairs performance in spatial tasks, but the interpretation of these experiments is complicated by radiation effects on other brain regions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xavier and Costa, 2009</xref>). A more recent approach takes advantage of the relative selectivity of a <italic>Proopiomelanocortin</italic> (<italic>Pomc</italic>)-<italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mouse line for DGCs, thereby providing genetic access to these cells with <italic>Cre-Lox</italic> technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haws et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present work describes a new mouse model that can be used to explore the role of the DG in general ‚Äì and DGCs in particular ‚Äì in hippocampal function. Our point of departure was the observation that DG development is severely impaired in mouse embryos that are missing the gene coding for LEF1, a transcription factor that dimerizes with beta-catenin to mediate the transcriptional response to canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Genderen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galceran et al., 2000</xref>). A similar, but milder, phenotype was reported for a knockout in the gene coding for LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP)6, one of two highly homologous co-receptors for canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>). As these mutants do not survive beyond birth (<italic>Lrp6</italic> KO) or weaning (<italic>Lef1</italic> KO), they are not useful for assessing the behavioral consequences of the reduction in DGCs.</p><p>Here we describe the developmental and behavioral consequences of reduced canonical Wnt signaling in cortical neuroglial progenitors following <italic>Gfap-Cre</italic>-mediated inactivation of a conditional allele of the <italic>Wls</italic> gene, which codes for the Wnt chaperone protein Wntless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">B√§nziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>). The resulting mice survive to adulthood and are healthy, but they lack¬†~90% of DGCs, including nearly all DGCs in the dorsal hippocampus. Other cell types within the hippocampus appear to be largely unaltered as determined by single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), immunostaining, and morphometric analyses of CA3 pyramidal cells. Behavioral testing shows that the mutant mice have a modest performance decrement in cognitive tasks involving spatial learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Highly selective neuroanatomic defects in adult <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup></italic>;<italic>Gfap-Cre</italic> mice</title><p>By comparing littermate <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> (phenotypically WT control) and <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> (mutant) mice, we observe that eliminating <italic>Wls</italic> in a subset of neural progenitors with <italic>Gfap-Cre</italic> has no effect on viability but is associated with (i) a¬†~¬†25% reduction in body size and weight at early post-weaning ages that decreases to a¬†~¬†5% reduction by six weeks of age and (ii) male infertility.

To assess the spatiotemporal pattern of beta-catenin signaling, we took advantage of the observation that in some tissues, such as CNS endothelial cells, expression of the beta-catenin partner LEF1 (also known as LEF/TCF), is induced by beta-catenin signaling as part of a presumptive positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

The resulting Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clusters correspond to all of the major cell types in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).

All other neuronal cell types show increased cell numbers in the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> data set, with the greatest increases seen for (1) inhibitory neurons, which comprise 9% of the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> nuclei and 15.5% of the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> nuclei, and (2) excitatory neurons other than the CA1, CA2, CA3 pyramidal cells, which comprise 8% of the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> nuclei and 21% of the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> nuclei. Part of the increase in the abundance of non-DGCs in the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> sample arises from the reduction in the abundance of DGCs, an effect that should produce a 1.3-fold increase in relative abundance for all non-DGCs. Abundance changes differing from 1.3-fold might arise, at least in part, from variation between experiments in the yield of different classes of nuclei. More interesting is the possibility that, reduced beta-catenin signaling in the developing <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> hippocampus either directly or indirectly increases the numbers of inhibitory neurons and non-pyramidal excitatory neurons. As an example of an indirect mechanism, the production or survival of these neurons might be enhanced by a reduction in DGCs. Whatever the mechanism(s) responsible for the greater numbers of inhibitory neurons and non-pyramidal excitatory neurons in the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> hippocampus, the snRNAseq data indicate that their intrinsic transcriptional programs are very similar in mutant and control hippocampi.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Anatomic and transcriptome diversity among granule cells</title><p>DGC nuclei in the control and mutant snRNAseq data sets differ not only in abundance, but also in their locations within the DGC cluster in the UMAP plot, with <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> nuclei mainly occupying the lower part of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This pattern suggests that the upper and lower parts of the DGC cluster correspond, respectively, to the dorsal (i.e. anterior) hippocampus and the ventral (i.e. posterior) hippocampus. To explore this observation in greater detail, new UMAP plots were generated for <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> and <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> datasets using only DGC nuclei, and the patterns and abundances of individual transcripts were plotted, together with the percentage of DGC cells expressing each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Combining the information from the ISH and UMAP patterns shows that, within the UMAP DGC cluster in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, an extended arc of cells residing on the lower right side of the cluster corresponds to the ventral hippocampus and the remainder of the DGC cluster corresponds to the dorsal hippocampus.</p><p>To look for additional gene expression patterns within the DGC cells cluster, we used the Monocle 3 ‚Äòfind_gene_modules‚Äô algorithm. By visual inspection, at least six distinct expression modules are present within the DGC cluster, with module one largely overlapping with the ventral DG. Two of these modules (modules 7 and 11) define mutually exclusive sub-domains within the DGC cluster that are orthogonal in UMAP space to the dorsal/ventral sub-domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). As inspection of the ISH data in the Allen Brain Atlas did not reveal large-scale patterns within the DG for transcripts enriched in modules 7 or 11, the anatomic and functional correlates of this subdivision remain to be determined.</p><p>The quantification of snRNAseq read counts per expressing cell for the six dorsal-enriched and the six ventral-enriched transcripts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref> indicates that, despite their reduced numbers, the DGCs that remain in the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> hippocampus express ventral and dorsal markers at very nearly the same levels as their counterparts in the <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> hippocampus.

During the hidden platform test for spatial learning, mice were placed in the MWM for six trials per day over three days. On the fourth day, they were given 60 s to locate the hidden platform. There was a significant decrease in latency in successive trials, indicating that mice of both genotypes could learn the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; F(11.22, 460)=13.21, p&lt;0.0001). However, compared to control mice, <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice displayed a longer latency to locate the hidden platform, suggestive of slower learning (F(1,41)=28.63, p&lt;0.001). In the probe trial, one day after hidden platform training, <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice also displayed a significantly longer latency to locate the platform compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, t(41) = 3.41, p&lt;0.01) and a reduced path efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 3B</xref>; t(41) = 3.27, p&lt;0.01). <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> and <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice spent a similar percent of time during the probe trial in the quadrant of the MWM in which the platform was located, indicating that mice of both genotypes had learned the general platform location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; t(37) = 0.99, p&gt;0.05).</p><p>To determine if there was a difference in cognitive flexibility between <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> and <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice, a reversal test was conducted in which each mouse was given eight trials to learn a new location for the escape platform.

The equivalence between mutant and control mice in the time spent in the quadrant with the hidden platform suggests that the spatial learning deficit in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice could be due, at least in part, to a defect in learning the location of the escape platform at high spatial resolution.</p><p>In sum, <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice showed modestly impaired performance on all aspects of the MWM task: pretraining with a visible platform, training with a hidden platform, and reversal training with a hidden platform, consistent with an underlying performance deficit in the ability to escape from the water maze.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Phenotype of the <italic>Wntless Gfap-Cre</italic> conditional mutant in an active avoidance task: initial assessment</title><p>As a second and independent measure of complex spatial learning and memory, <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> and <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice were tested in a six-day protocol to evaluate open field exploration and active place avoidance learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cimadevilla et al., 2001</xref>). This protocol is especially sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction, as it requires the mouse to selectively use stationary room-based information to avoid a shock zone and ignore rotating arena-based information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kub√≠k and Fenton, 2005</xref>). Mice were individually tested in a circular arena that was either stationary or rotating at one r.p.m. Within the arena, a foot shock was programmed within a fixed 60¬∞ sector, and this shock zone was either relocated to a new fixed location or deactivated for different tests. To provide novel visual cues, the apparatus was moved between rooms. As shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the protocol consisted of (i) exploration in a stationary arena with no foot shock on day 1 (OF1 and OF2), (ii) initial training in a rotating arena on day 2, in which one pretrial with the shock turned off (PRE) was followed by three trials with the shock turned on (iT1-iT3), (iii) retention/conflict trials on day three in which a retention trial (RET) was followed by two trials with the shock zone relocated 180¬∞ (CO1 and CO2), (iv) two extinction trials on day four in which the shock zone was turned off (EX1 and EX2), and (v) four trials within a novel environment (a different apparatus in a different location, indicated in the schematic by a gray surround) on day six in which one pretrial with the shock turned off (nPRE) was followed by three trails with the shock turned on (nT1-nT3). Automated video-tracking software was used to track each mouse, and then compute the following values for the 60¬∞ shock zone: number of entrances, time to first entrance, and maximum avoidance time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the tracks of a representative mouse from each genotype during a subset of the trials. Throughout <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the 60¬∞ shock zone is colored red if the shock is turned on and black if the shock is turned off.</p><p>On day 1, mice from both genotypes explored the stationary open field similarly during the two trials (OF1 and OF2), with reduced exploration during the second trial. The distance walked (average¬†=¬†13.9 m) characterized the open field behavior, and showed no effect of genotype (F(1,26) = 1.03, p=0.32) and no genotype x trial interaction (F(1,52.9)¬†=¬†0.65, p=0.4), but a significant effect of trial (F(1,52.8)¬†=¬†32.27, p=10<sup>‚àí7</sup>).</p><p>Pretraining on the rotating arena (PRE) is effectively a second open field test, and, during this test, the mutant mice walked less than the controls (F(1,25) = 10.6, p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), thereby reducing the number of entrances into the 60¬∞ sector in the absence of any conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, left panel). This difference prompted us to examine locomotion across the entire 6 day protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), since any difference in locomotion could contribute to a difference in active avoidance. This analysis showed that path length did not differ significantly between the genotypes across initial training when the mice avoided a shock (F(1,35.1)¬†=¬†0.005, p=0.9) (iT1-iT3), although it decreased with training (F(2,33.2)¬†=¬†15.64, iT1¬†&gt;iT2=iT3; p=10<sup>‚àí5</sup>; interaction: F(2,33.2)¬†=¬†0.66, p=0.5). Path length also did not significantly differ between genotypes on the retention test (F(1,26.4)¬†=¬†0.55. p=0.5) (RET). When the shock zone was relocated to the opposite side of the arena in the two conflict trials (CO1 and CO2), the mutant mice walked¬†~20% more than the controls (genotype: F(1,27) = 8.88. p=0.006; trials: F(1,27) = 9.57, p=0.005; interaction F(1,27) = 0.38, p=0.5), but this difference disappeared when the shock was turned off during the extinction trials (genotype: F(1,27.9)¬†=¬†0.26, p=0.6; trials: F(1,27.4)¬†=¬†0.51. p=0.5; interaction F1,27.4¬†=¬†0.35. p=0.6) (EX1, EX2). When exploring the novel environment with shock off (nPRE), the mutant mice walked¬†~25% less than the controls (F(1,23.3)¬†=¬†4.37, p=0.048), but the difference was not observed once training in the new environment began (genotype: F(1,29.1)¬†=¬†0.01, p=0.9; trial F(2,31.2)¬†=¬†10.40, p=0.0003; interaction F(2,31.2)¬†=¬†0.37, p=0.7) (nT1-nT3). These analyses show that, in some tasks, locomotion differed by as much as¬†~25% between mutant and control mice, but it did not appear to vary in a systematic manner.

Quantification of CA3 pyramidal cell morphology and synaptic density/structure by Golgi staining showed only a modest reduction in the density of complex synapses in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice.

Whether or to what extent the loss of the corpus callosum or the modest changes in the abundances of non-DGC neurons in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice might contribute to the observed learning and memory defects is currently an open question. As discussed more fully below, the dorsal hippocampus has been implicated in spatial, as opposed to olfactory, information processing, and, therefore, the nearly complete absence of DGCs in the dorsal hippocampus in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice makes this model especially well-suited for studying the contributions made by DGCs to spatial tasks.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Canonical Wnt signaling and the development of the dentate gyrus</title><p>The <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> DG phenotype represents one point along a continuum of hippocampal defects resulting from reduced canonical Wnt signaling in the cortical hem, which is the source of both Wnt ligands and DGC progenitors.

The high concentration of LEF1 in the cortical hem is consistent with a role for canonical Wnt signaling in driving proliferation among DGC progenitors. In addition to this role, canonical Wnt signaling may also have an instructive role in cell specification in the developing cortex, with a gradient of Wnt signaling generating a series of distinct neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Machon et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular and regional diversity among dentate granule cells</title><p>Our snRNAseq analysis has revealed DGC transcriptome diversity along at least two distinct dimensions, one of which corresponds to the dorsal/ventral axis of the hippocampus.

Although visual inspection of Allen Brain Atlas ISH patterns does not reveal large-scale anatomic correlates for DGC transcriptome diversity other than the dorsal/ventral pattern, local DGC heterogeneity is suggested by the functional heterogeneity of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells along the transverse and radial dimensions, which includes differences in the distribution of DGC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>).

The modest changes in the number and type of CA3 pyramidal cell synapses suggest that the near absence of mossy fiber input is, at least partially, compensated by an increase in inputs from other neurons, potentially from entorhinal cortex. These features are reminiscent of other examples of robust developmental trajectories in the context of early perturbations in CNS structure or activity. For example, in the classic monocular deprivation experiments of Hubel and Wiesel, inputs to primary visual cortex from the normal eye (via the lateral geniculate nucleus) expanded to compensate for the reduced input from the sutured eye when the perturbation occurs in early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeVay et al., 1980</xref>). Histologic analyses of primary visual cortex showed that the cellularity and total synapse density were largely unchanged in those regions of visual cortex that normally would have received equal binocular inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shatz and Stryker, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silver and Stryker, 1999</xref>). However, in other contexts, developmental perturbations lead to uncompensated changes, such as the increased cell death among dorsal root ganglion neurons that follow the surgical removal of target tissues, such as a limb, during embryonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamburger, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The developmental hypoplasia of DGCs in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice offers an alternative to existing models of DGC ablation in the mature CNS. In contrast to early developmental perturbations, the loss of mature CNS neurons is generally accompanied by reactive gliosis and by perturbations in the structure, function, and/or viability of synaptically-linked neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2020</xref>).

It would be interesting to determine if increasing the contextual richness of the cognitive tasks would reveal an even greater effect of DGC input.

The tissue was analyzed using Neurolucida on a Zeiss Axio Imager1 with an automated stage and a 100x oil objective (Numerical Aperture 1.2). The hippocampus was delineated by visual inspection of the cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Strien et al., 2009</xref>). Cells were chosen for reconstruction in area CA3b (the sharpest curve of the hippocampus). A neuron was classified for reconstruction if it possessed CA3 pyramidal cell morphology, if it had one apical dendrite and at least one basal dendrite available for tracing, and if it was located in area CA3b. Neurons were excluded if their position was in close proximity to an astrocyte or if the density of Golgi-impregnated cells in its immediate proximity was too high. Spines were either classified as thorny excrescences (complex) or as ‚Äòother‚Äô (simple) spines based on spine shapes as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorra and Harris, 2000</xref>. Using criteria from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzales et al., 2001</xref>, a cluster of thorny excrescences along the dendrite was classified as a complex spine, rather than classifying each individual protrusion. Once a complex spine was identified, the maximum extent of the part of the dendrite that is covered by the spine was measured using the ‚Äòspherical spine tool‚Äô in Neurolucida (MBF BioScience). The diameter of the spine-tool was adjusted until it covered the maximum length that the complex spine extended along the dendrite. This variable is referred to as spine length.

The variables extracted and used for further analysis were from the ‚ÄòNeuron Summary‚Äô and ‚ÄòSpine Detail‚Äô analysis option of the Branched Structure Analysis. More specifically, the length of dendrites for both apical and basal dendrites, the different spine types (simple and complex), and the number of spines per dendrite type was extracted from the ‚ÄòNeuron Summary‚Äô analysis, while the ‚ÄòSpine diameter‚Äô of all individual spines was extracted from the ‚ÄòSpine detail‚Äô analysis. This ‚ÄòSpine diameter‚Äô refers to the spine length described above. Spine density was calculated for individual dendrites by dividing the total number of spines on a dendrite by the length of that dendrite. Spine coverage on the total dendritic length represents the summed spine length divided by the summed length of all the dendrites. The final dataset was exported to MATLAB¬†for further analysis, which included the creation of boxplots using the boxplot function and a Wilcoxon Rank Sum non-parametric hypothesis test using the ranksum function (MATLAB, 2019). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum was chosen based on inspection of plots of the data fitted to a normal distribution (normplot function, MATLAB, 2019) that indicated that every dataset had some, if not all variables violating the assumption of normally distributed data needed to conduct a student t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Stereology</title><p>To compare the presence of thorny excrescences (complex spines) along the dorsoventral extent of hippocampal area CA3 in <italic>Wls<sup>fl/+</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> vs. <italic>Wls<sup>fl/-</sup>;Gfap-Cre</italic> mice, a stereological investigation was conducted.

All delineations were confirmed by an experienced researcher (M.W.) prior to starting the stereological counting. In view of the known distribution of the mossy fiber projection in stratum lucidum as well as in stratum pyramidale, dendritic branches were sampled in both layers.

On the training day, the mouse was placed in the shock box and given a 2-min habituation, after which a 20 s white noise tone (80 db, 2000 Hz) was delivered. Twenty seconds following the termination of the tone, a scrambled 2-s 0.5 mA shock was delivered. The tone-shock pairing was repeated three additional times. On the test day, the mouse was placed in the shock box for 3 min to measure freezing in response to context.

The maze consisted of a circular stainless-steel tank 4 m in diameter filled with room temperature water made opaque with white tempera paint for the training, probe, and reversal trials. During the pretraining phase, a 10 cm platform was placed 1 cm below clear water in the center of a 2-m diameter stainless-steel cylinder in the MWM. For each mouse, the test protocol was as follows. The mouse was placed inside the perimeter of the cylinder and given 60 s to escape onto the visible platform throughout six trials in one day. During the hidden platform training phase, a 10 cm platform was placed in a fixed location in the maze, with the top of the platform hidden beneath 1 cm of water. The mouse was placed in the maze around the perimeter in one of four start positions in a semi-random fashion throughout six trials each day for three consecutive days. The mouse was allowed to search for the platform for 60 s, and, after finding the platform, to remain there for 15 s. Escape latency was recorded for each trial. 24 hr following the hidden platform training phase, the mouse was tested in one 60 s probe trial. Latency to cross into the platform area, number of crossings in the platform area, and time spent in the platform quadrant were measured using Anymaze tracking software (Stoelting). During the reversal phase, the hidden platform was placed in the MWM in a different quadrant from that used during the training phase. As in the training phase, the mouse was placed in the maze around the perimeter in one of four start positions in a semi-random fashion throughout six trials each day for two consecutive days. The mouse was allowed to search for the platform for 60 s and, after finding the platform, to remain there for 15 s. Escape latency was recorded for each trial. Path efficiency to the target was by calculating (i) the length of a straight line from the location where the mouse was placed in the tub to the platform, (ii) the distance that the mouse swam from its starting location to the first time it arrived at the platform (‚Äòarrival‚Äô being defined as the center of the mouse‚Äôs body crossing an 8 cm diameter circle centered on the platform), and (iii) the fraction consisting of the first value divided by the second value, giving a number between 0 and 1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Place avoidance training</title><p>The place avoidance apparatus and testing protocol are based on those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cimadevilla et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kub√≠k and Fenton, 2005</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Apparatus</title><p>¬†The apparatus was placed in the vivarium 2 m from the rack that housed the mouse cages.

A clear plastic cylindrical wall inscribed a circular space on the floor to contain the mouse. While in the test arena, the mouse could see multiple landmarks in the room including shelves, desks, and a pair of poles supporting a curtain rod on which white plastic curtains hung to visually separate the apparatus from the experimenter and rack of cages. An overhead digital video camera was connected to a computer running video- tracking software (Tracker; Bio-Signal Group) to determine the position of the mouse at 33 millisecond intervals. The software could trigger a mild foot shock that was scrambled across the five electric poles of the grid floor. Two test arenas were used.

The shock was repeated every 1.5 s until the mouse left the shock zone. The track of the mouse was stored and automatically analyzed offline with TrackAnalysis software (Bio-Signal Group). The total distance walked on the arena surface was computed to evaluate locomotor activity. To evaluate learning, each entrance into the shock zone was recorded as an error. The latency to first enter the shock zone was determined to evaluate between-session place avoidance memory, and the maximum time between entrances to the shock zone was computed to evaluate within-session place avoidance memory.

Using a conditional Wntless (Wls) knockout mouse crossed with Gfap-Cre line, the authors effectively deleted Wls expression in a subset of cortical progenitors. Their anatomical, bulk and sn-RNAseq analysis showed that although most of the cell types in the hippocampus are not affected, neurogenesis of DGCs is largely reduced. Perhaps the most remarkable findings are among the cognitive tests in these mutants - despite an almost complete elimination of DGCs, these mice exhibit only modest behavioral defects. The trace fear conditioning and Barnes maze learning are both normal, while the Morris water maze and active avoidance learning are mildly impaired. Given the significant functional roles of DGCs in pattern separation and cue discrimination proposed by many previous studies, the current study provides a different perspective in functional studies investigating DGCs. Overall, this is a well-executed and highly informative study. I just have a few minor comments.</p><p>1) What is the nature of &quot;excitatory neurons&quot; identified in sn-RNAseq? This population of neurons is significantly enlarged in the Wlsfl/-;Gfap-Cre mice. Is it possible that they represent the undifferentiated DGCs? Where are they located in the hippocampus? What is the possibility that this population of neurons is responsible for functional redundancy in the absence of most of DGCs?</p><p>2) What happens to EC input to DG in the Wlsfl/-;Gfap-Cre mice? Is it reduced? Does it bypass DGCs and synapse directly onto CA3 pyramidal neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study describes a new mouse model that enables a global analysis of the function of the dentate gyrus. The mouse model - a GFAP-promoter-driven deletion of 'wntless', which causes abolition of wnt signaling in cells with developmental expression of GFAP - produces a 90% reduction of the dentate gyrus. The authors perform a comprehensive analysis of these mice. This study is not only monumental and encyclopedic, but also important and impactful.</p><p>The bottom line is: deleting most of the dentate gyrus causes few overall changes in the connectivity of the remaining hippocampal circuits, gene expression in the remaining hippocampal neurons, or any of the studied behaviors. Negative studies are usually frowned upon, but the fact is in my opinion that negative studies are much more important than positive studies. Scores of papers have assigned crucial roles to the dentate gyrus in complex behaviors, especially features of memory. These studies are usually performed with sophisticated methods whose limitations are overlooked by the elegance of their promise. What this paper shows is that these studies are likely misleading, and that the dentate gyrus may, after all, have a more subtle function. I think this is a very important conclusion that is worthy of publication in a premier journal.</p><p>The technical quality of the presented data is outstanding. The authors performed excellent and complete analyses that go far beyond what is usually done in systems neuroscience papers. The conclusions are compelling, and I have no doubt after reading this paper that the role of the dentate gyrus is more limited than I previously thought and understood from the many other papers on the subject. Yes, it would have been nice to also do electrophysiology and calcium imaging and optogenetics but this is totally unnecessary - The behavioral, anatomical and RNAseq studies are truly conclusive.</p><p>In summary, I recommend publication of this paper without changes or further experimental additions. I think this is an important contribution that is definitive and needs to be out there!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper provides an extremely thorough analysis of a mouse mutant that lack virtually all of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Given great interest in the functions of subfields of the hippocampus, this mouse should be helpful for studies of the DG.</p><p>The authors have chosen an excellent way to present their mouse mutant to the general community.</p></body></sub-article></article>
