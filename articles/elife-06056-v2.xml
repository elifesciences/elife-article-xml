Random segregation of an extra chromosome is predicted to result in a high frequency of trisomic offspring from a trisomic parent. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> with trisomy of the X chromosome, however, have far fewer trisomic offspring than expected. We found that the extra X chromosome was preferentially eliminated during anaphase I of female meiosis. We utilized a mutant with a specific defect in pairing of the X chromosome as a model to investigate the apparent bias against univalent inheritance. First, univalents lagged during anaphase I and their movement was biased toward the cortex and future polar body. Second, late-lagging univalents were frequently captured by the ingressing polar body contractile ring. The asymmetry of female meiosis can thus partially correct pre-existing trisomy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06056.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06056.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06056.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside cells, DNA is found packaged into structures called chromosomes. Most human and animal cells contain two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. Chromosomes from one set pair up with the equivalent chromosome from the other set. However, egg and sperm cells only contain one copy of each chromosome, so that when the egg is fertilized, the resulting cell again has two sets of chromosomes. If there are either more or fewer than two copies of a chromosome in the fertilized cell, this can cause birth defects and conditions such as Down syndrome.</p><p>An egg cell develops from a cell called an oocyte via a process called meiosis. The oocyte first duplicates its DNA so that it contains four copies of each chromosome. The oocyte then divides, and the resulting cells divide again, to produce four cells that each contains one copy of each chromosome. Only one of these cells is an egg cell: the other three are called polar bodies, and these normally self-destruct.</p><p>The tiny roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a model organism used to study meiosis. Worms can be hermaphrodites or males; the hermaphrodites normally have a pair of ‘X’ sex chromosomes. However, sometimes problems with meiosis can produce hermaphrodite worms with three X chromosomes in each of their cells. In these cells, two of the X chromosomes pair with each other as normal, and one X chromosome remains unpaired.</p><p>Cortes et al. examined meiosis in mutant worms that had an extra copy of the X chromosome by marking all the chromosomes with a fluorescent tag. This allowed the movement of the chromosomes to be tracked through images taken using a microscope. This revealed that an unpaired X chromosome moves more slowly than a normal paired set. Furthermore, the unpaired chromosomes tend to move toward the region of the oocyte that will develop into a polar body. Thus, when the oocyte divides, the unpaired chromosomes are placed in the polar body and eliminated. This mechanism improves the chance that the correct number of chromosomes will end up in the egg cell.</p><p>Women with three X chromosomes are often fertile and in most cases produce normal offspring. Further work is needed to see whether human oocytes remove extra chromosomes by a mechanism similar to that seen in the roundworms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06056.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06056.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>trisomy</kwd><kwd>polar body</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM-079421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Francis J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Title: Genetic analysis of the C. elegans cytoskeleton</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mains</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant: T32 GM007377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cortes</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007707</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Floyd and Mary Schwall fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cortes</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office of Research Infrastructure Programs P40 OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Francis J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Female meiotic spindles correct trisomy by expelling extra chromosomes into the first polar body.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During female meiosis, a G2 oocyte containing four genome copies undergoes two asymmetric cell divisions depositing one genome in a single haploid egg, while the other three genomes are segregated into polar bodies. These divisions are mediated by meiotic spindles that are asymmetrically positioned against the oocyte cortex with the pole-to-pole axis of the spindle perpendicular to the cortex. Both the inheritance of only one of the four genome copies and the distinct perpendicular positioning of the meiotic spindle are remarkably conserved among animal phyla suggesting a selective advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maro and Verlhac, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabritius et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maddox et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several advantages of asymmetric meiosis have been suggested previously, yet none are applicable to all animals. Asymmetric meiotic spindle positioning maximizes the volume of a single egg, helps prevent interference with the meiotic spindle by the sperm aster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McNally et al., 2012</xref>), and preserves predetermined embryonic polarity gradients. Here, we suggest a previously unrecognized advantage of asymmetric meiosis, the ability of meiotic spindles to correct trisomy by preferentially depositing the extra chromosome copy into a polar body.</p><p>Accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes to opposite spindle poles depends on a physical attachment, or chiasma, between homologous chromosomes. A chiasma consists of a crossover, which holds the two homologous chromosomes together in a bivalent so that kinetochores can be properly oriented toward opposite poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore and Orr-Weaver, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). When a chiasma does not form, univalent chromosomes may maintain sister cohesion and move to poles independent of their homologs at anaphase I as can occur in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>). If a univalent chromosome biorients, loses cohesion, and segregates sister chromatids at anaphase I (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicklas and Jones, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemaire-Adkins and Hunt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kouznetsova et al., 2007</xref>), the resulting single chromatid will segregate randomly at anaphase II. Random segregation of homologs at anaphase I or single chromatids at anaphase II should result in equal frequencies of haplo and diplo ova in the case of a trisomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and equal frequencies of nullo and diplo ova in the case of a crossover failure.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06056.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trisomy correction during meiosis I.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration showing expected outcomes of female meiosis in XXX wild-type worms, assuming the extra univalent X (red) does not lose cohesion (yellow) between sister chromatids during anaphase I and assuming random segregation.

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the single unpaired X chromosome from an XXX mother is inherited with unexpectedly low frequency with twice as many haploX ova produced as diploX ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>). HIM-8 is a zinc finger protein that binds to specific DNA sequences that are enriched on the X chromosome. <italic>him-8</italic> mutants have a pairing defect that is completely specific for the X chromosome, resulting in two X univalents and five autosomal bivalents in 95% of diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). If the two X univalents segregated randomly, <italic>him-8</italic> mutants would be expected to produce equal frequencies of nulloX ova and diploX ova. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</xref> demonstrated a fivefold preponderance of nulloX ova over diploX ova in <italic>him-8</italic>. Using sex-reversed <italic>him-8</italic> XX males, these authors showed the opposite effect in spermatogenesis. Rather than producing the 50% haploX, 25% diploX, 25% nulloX sperm expected from random segregation, <italic>him-8</italic> XX males produced 86% haploX, 3% diploX, 11% nulloX sperm, indicating symmetric distribution of univalents during male meiosis. Thus, achiasmate maternal X chromosomes are inherited with unexpectedly low frequency in worms.</p><p>Five mechanisms might reduce the frequency of trisomic offspring from trisomic or <italic>him-8</italic> mothers. First, trisomic embryos might die during embryonic development resulting in undercounting of XXX offspring. This is unlikely in <italic>C. elegans</italic> because both XXX and <italic>him-8</italic> mutant mothers produce a very low frequency of dead embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A second possibility is that mitotic non-disjunction in the XXX mother results in a mosaic gonad that contains both diploX and triploX oocytes. Selective apoptosis of XXX germ line cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhalla and Dernburg, 2005</xref>) would then enrich for XX germ line cells. This does not contribute to the segregation bias in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as the most mature diakinesis oocytes in <italic>him-8</italic> and wild-type XXX worms have 7 rather than 6 DAPI-staining bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>; this study). A third possibility is that a univalent present during metaphase I or a single chromatid present during metaphase II would be broken or otherwise degraded during anaphase. A fourth possibility is that many XXX progeny look normal because of the stochastic nature of dosage compensation and thus are undercounted. A fifth possibility is that univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I are preferentially placed in the first polar body. Here, we demonstrate that indeed biased deposition of univalent X chromosomes into the first polar body reduces the frequency of trisomic zygotes resulting from oocytes with unpaired X chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>XXX wild-type oocytes preferentially lose the achiasmate X chromosome between metaphase I and metaphase II</title><p>Elimination of the extra chromosome from an oocyte starting with a trisomy would result in rescue to a euploid state. It has previously been shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> XXX wild-type oocytes have a paired bivalent X and an unpaired univalent X chromosome in pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein, 1984</xref>). We picked wild-type XXX adult hermaphrodites from the progeny of an XXX strain (AV494, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mlynarczyk-Evans et al., 2013</xref>) based on their characteristic dumpy morphology as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</xref>. Meiotic embryos from XXX mothers were fixed and stained for microtubules and DNA. Chromosomes are well separated by bundles of microtubules during <italic>C. elegans</italic> female meiotic metaphase. This unique morphology facilitates counting of individual chromosomes on the metaphase plate when viewed down the pole-to-pole axis of the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that 100% of metaphase I meiotic embryos from XXX wild-type worms had 7 DAPI-staining bodies on the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>), consistent with 6 bivalents and a single univalent X. Two chromosomes were labeled with an X-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe in these spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This result shows that a mosaic gonad resulting from mitotic nondisjunction cannot explain the low frequency of XXX offspring from XXX worms. If the univalent segregated randomly during anaphase I, 50% of metaphase II spindles should have 6 DAPI-staining bodies (6 bivalents) and 50% should have 7 DAPI-staining bodies (6 bivalents and 1 univalent). Instead, 71% of metaphase II spindles contained only 6 DAPI-staining bodies and only 29% contained 7 DAPI-staining bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). These frequencies match the 2:1 ratio of X to XX ova previously interpreted from genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>) and are significantly different than the 50% expected from random segregation (one-tailed p = 0.004, Pearson's chi-squared test). This result eliminates the possibilities that XXX mothers have many XXX offspring that are undercounted due to incomplete penetrance of the XXX dumpy phenotype or that hermaphrodite nulloX sperm contributes significantly to the low frequency of XXX self-progeny. The finding that all assayed metaphase I spindles had 7 chromosomes also indicates that our method of identifying XXX worms as dumpy individuals is accurate and the high frequency of metaphase II spindles with 6 chromosomes is not a result of misidentifying diploid worms as XXX worms. FISH with an X-specific probe revealed that in 6/6 metaphase II embryos with only 6 DAPI-staining bodies, a single hybridization signal was present in the spindle and 2–3 hybridization signals were present in the polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Because only a single X-hybridization signal was observed in the first polar body in 5/5 spindles from diploids, these results demonstrate that single X univalents are deposited in the first polar body with greater than 50% frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>X and V univalents are frequently deposited in the first polar body</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism leading to preferential loss of univalents during meiosis I, we utilized <italic>him-8</italic> worms as a more tractable model. It has previously been shown that diakinesis stage <italic>him-8</italic> oocytes have 5 autosomal bivalents and two X univalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). If segregation of the two X univalents was random, these worms should produce equal numbers of nulloX and diploX ova. Instead, <italic>him-</italic>8 mutants produce a fivefold higher frequency of nulloX ova over diploX ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al., 1979</xref>), indicating that both maternal X univalents are lost at some time after diakinesis in a large fraction of embryos. To determine when maternal X univalents are preferentially lost, we imaged both live embryos within <italic>him-8</italic> worms expressing GFP::tubulin and mCherry::histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>) and also fixed embryos stained with DAPI and anti-tubulin antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>). We assayed the number of chromosomes (defined here as DAPI-staining or mCherry:histone-positive bodies that would include univalents and bivalents) present at metaphase of meiosis I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). At meiosis I metaphase, 7 chromosomes were present in 96% of <italic>him-8</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,K</xref>), with the remainder having 6 chromosomes. If the two univalents segregated randomly without losing cohesion, 25% of metaphase II spindles would be expected to have 5 autosomes and no X, 50% would have 5 autosomes and 1 X, and 25% would have 5 autosomes and 2 X chromosomes. Instead, 40% of <italic>him-8</italic> metaphase II embryos had 5 chromosomes, 55% had 6 chromosomes, and only 5% had 7 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). These frequencies differ significantly from those expected from unbiased segregation (chi-square test, two-tailed p &lt; 0.0001), closely match the ratio of nulloX to diploX ova inferred by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</xref> and support the hypothesis that the majority of X univalents are eliminated between metaphase I and metaphase II.

FISH revealed two X univalents and 7 total DAPI-staining bodies on 93% of all the <italic>him-8</italic> metaphase I plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,L</xref>). At metaphase II, FISH revealed at least two X hybridization foci in the first polar body and none on the metaphase plate when the spindle had 5 DAPI-staining bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). When 6 DAPI-staining bodies were present on the metaphase II plate, we always observed one X hybridization focus each on the metaphase plate and in the first polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Finally, metaphase II embryos containing 7 DAPI-staining bodies had two X hybridization foci on the metaphase plate and none in the first polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that both achiasmate X univalents are deposited into the first polar body in 40% of <italic>him-8</italic> embryos as compared with the 25% expected from random segregation.</p><p>To test whether achiasmate autosomes are also placed in the first polar body with higher than random frequency, we analyzed a strain with a lac operator array integrated on chromosome V and bearing a loss of function mutation in the <italic>him-8</italic> homolog <italic>zim-2</italic>, which contributes to chromosome V pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phillips and Dernburg, 2006</xref>). Unlike the situation with <italic>him-8</italic> and pairing of the X, redundancy between ZIM proteins may contribute to chromosome V pairing. Phillips and Dernburg reported only 72% of diakinesis oocytes with 7 rather than 6 DAPI-staining bodies in a <italic>zim-2</italic> mutant, and our <italic>zim-2</italic> strain with lacO(V) had only 62% of diakinesis oocytes with 7 DAPI-staining bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). FISH revealed two distinct chromosome V hybridization foci and 7 DAPI-staining bodies on 41% of metaphase I spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>). Starting with 41% achiasmate V's, random segregation should yield 10% of metaphase II embryos with both V's in the first polar body (25% of 41%). Instead, FISH revealed 27% of metaphase II embryos had five DAPI-staining bodies on the metaphase plate and chromosome V hybridization foci only in the first polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,E</xref>). Likewise, random segregation of achiasmate V's should yield 10% metaphase II spindles with 7 DAPI-staining bodies on the metaphase II spindle, two distinct chromosome V hybridization foci on the spindle, and none in the first polar body. Only 5% of this embryo class was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). These frequencies are significantly different than those expected from random segregation (chi-square test, two-tailed p &lt; 0.0002). The discrepancy in the fraction of <italic>zim-2</italic> oocytes with 7 DAPI-staining bodies at diakinesis vs metaphase I raises the possibility that chromosomes might be systematically undercounted in <italic>zim-2</italic> metaphase I spindles (but not in wild-type, <italic>him-8</italic>, or XXX metaphase I spindles). If this is the case, the two V univalents must be positioned close together on the spindle because 0/57 <italic>zim-2</italic> metaphase I plates with 6 DAPI-staining bodies had two widely spaced lacO(V) FISH foci and the deviation between expected and observed nulloV metaphase II spindles would be even greater. Two results strongly indicate that the same mechanisms acting on univalent X's in <italic>him-8</italic> mutants also act on V univalents in the <italic>zim-2</italic> mutant. First, the fivefold preponderance of metaphase II spindles with 5 DAPI-staining bodies over those with 7 DAPI-staining bodies is similar to <italic>him-8</italic>. Second, the presence of lacO FISH signal only in the first polar body of metaphase II embryos with 5 DAPI-staining bodies on the spindle is the same in <italic>him-8</italic> and <italic>zim-2</italic>. Thus, achiasmate autosomes, like achiasmate X chromosomes, are preferentially deposited into the first polar body.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Univalents biorient at metaphase I and tend to lag during anaphase I</title><p>To understand the mechanism by which univalent X chromosomes are preferentially deposited in polar bodies, we examined their orientation and position in the spindle.

To analyze this, we conducted time-lapse imaging of embryos from <italic>him-8</italic> worms expressing GFP::tubulin and mCherry::histone, as well as embryos from <italic>him-8</italic> worms expressing these along with GFP::PH (plextrin homology domain) to label the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Our time-lapse analysis revealed that 65% of lagging chromosomes eventually moved toward the cortex and the forming polar body of <italic>him-8</italic> embryos during anaphase I (n = 181) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that preferential expulsion of lagging univalents into the first polar body could contribute to the higher than random frequency of metaphase II spindles with 5 autosomes and no X. Because the polar body contractile ring ingresses inward toward the midpoint of the late anaphase spindle where it normally scissions, we hypothesized that the preferential resolution of lagging chromosomes toward the cortex might result from inhibition of contractile ring scission until the ring ingresses past lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In wild type, ingression of the polar body contractile ring initiates when homologs have separated by 2.3 μm and polar body scission completes when homologs have separated by 5.6 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabritius et al., 2011b</xref>). The bias of univalents that moved toward the cortex before initiation of contractile ring ingression could not be caused by engulfment by the polar body. Therefore, we separated lagging univalents into two categories, early-resolving univalents that moved to one pole while the main chromosome masses were separated by less than 4.0 µm and late-resolving univalents that moved to one pole only after the main chromosome masses were separated by greater than 4.0 µm. If late-resolving univalents were engulfed during polar body formation, elimination of contractile ring activity would reduce the fraction of lagging chromosomes resolving toward the cortex. Indeed, RNAi depletion of the non-muscle myosin, NMY-2, which causes complete loss of cortical furrowing and polar body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabritius et al., 2011b</xref>), in <italic>him-8</italic> embryos resulted in a significant (p = 0.02) reduction in the percentage of late-lagging univalents resolving toward the cortex from 64% to 43% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>As a complementary approach, we asked if more rapid polar body ring ingression would have the opposite effect of NMY-2 depletion. We previously showed that the depletion of the myosin phosphatase, MEL-11, doubled the rate of polar body ring ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabritius et al., 2011b</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the inactivation of MEL-11 might enhance the preferential engulfment of lagging univalents by the first polar body. Unlike NMY-2 depletion, which generates 100% dead embryos, the lethality of <italic>mel-11</italic> mutants is rescued by wild-type sperm so the chromosome constitution of progeny from a <italic>mel-11</italic> mother can be scored by phenotype.

In <italic>him-8</italic> embryos, when there were no lagging univalents, the contractile ring ingressed normally to 50% spindle length as measured from the outside edge of the main chromatin mass in the interior of the embryo. When a lagging univalent was seen segregating into the polar body, the contractile ring was seen ingressing deeper into the embryo to 40% spindle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Alternatively, when a lagging univalent was seen segregating into the embryo, the contractile ring ingressed inward to a shallower depth at 59% spindle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p><p>To further test the idea that a late-lagging univalent might influence the choice of the scission point, we imaged formation of the first polar body in wild-type or <italic>him-8</italic> worms expressing GFP:UNC-59 (septin) and mCherry: histone. Septins are polymerizing GTPases that assemble in the contractile ring with myosin II, F-actin, and anillins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green et al., 2013</xref>). In wild type or <italic>him-8</italic> with early-resolving univalents, GFP:UNC-59 labeled a flat washer–shaped contractile ring that moved down to the midpoint of the elongating anaphase spindle as reported previously for GFP:NMY-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabritius et al., 2011b</xref>). The septin ring transformed into a tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, 255 s) as previously described for myosin and ANI-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dorn et al., 2010</xref>). When cortical furrowing relaxed at the end of telophase I, the septin tube moved outward to the embryo surface, then flopped over, and remained as a separate entity next to the chromosomes in the first polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, 420 s). In 5/10 <italic>him-8</italic> embryos in which the septin-labeled ring reached the lagging univalent, the univalent was trapped in the septin tube and moved with the septin tube outward during cortical relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In these cases, the univalent remained trapped in the septin tube adjacent to the polar body as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>. In 3/10 cases, the septin ring passed the univalent before the tube was formed, and in these cases, the univalent joined the main mass of chromatin in the polar body. In the 2/10 cases where the univalent did not end up in the polar body, the univalent slipped out of the septin tube into the embryo before the septin tube moved toward the embryo surface. These results are consistent with a model where the septin tube traps late-lagging univalents until scission occurs on the embryo side of the septin tube.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06056.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Lagging chromosomes are captured by the septin tube and expelled with polar bodies.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of embryos expressing GFP::septin and mCherry::histone.

Septins act together with anillins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has three anillins: ANI-1 that is required for polar body scission, ANI-2 that is required for gonad development, and ANI-3 that has no known function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maddox et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that ANI-3 might play a non-essential structural role in the polar body septin tube and that <italic>ani-3</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) might therefore allow late-lagging univalents to slip out of the tube back into the embryo. Indeed, RNAi of ANI-3 initiated on L4 <italic>him-8</italic> hermaphrodites (which have already completed spermatogenesis) significantly (p &lt; 0.001 binomial test) reduced the fraction of XO male progeny from 37% (n = 9 mothers, 1960 progeny) to 27% (n = 11 mothers, 2123 progeny), whereas <italic>ani-3</italic> (<italic>RNAi</italic>) had no significant effect on wild-type worms (wt: 0.04% XO, 1% dead, n = 11 mothers; <italic>ani-3</italic> [<italic>RNAi</italic>]: 0.05% XO, 1% dead, n = 17 mothers). This result suggests that compromising the integrity of the septin tube may reduce the efficiency of trapping lagging univalents in the septin tube.

This apparent inconsistency might be explained if additional ANI-3–independent mechanisms act to reduce the number of XXX progeny (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The early anaphase segregation bias</title><p>Lagging chromosomes were resolved prior to contractile ring ingression in 45% of embryos with lagging chromosomes at anaphase I. These were resolved toward the cortex 64% of the time (n = 72), and NMY-2 depletion had no significant effect on this class of embryos (p = 0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that an additional mechanism biasing univalent movement toward the cortex might be at work earlier in the cell cycle. During wild-type meiosis, bivalents congress to the metaphase plate on an 8-µm long spindle that is oriented parallel to the cortex. Upon anaphase promoting complex activation, the meiosis I spindle shortens to 4.8 μm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2003</xref>), then one spindle pole moves to the cortex in a dynein-dependent manner, and homolog separation initiates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellefson and McNally, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2011</xref>). We found that univalents were misaligned toward the spindle poles in fixed <italic>him-8</italic> embryos at late metaphase I, when the meiotic spindle is shortened but not yet rotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). In 46% of these embryos, both univalents were misaligned toward the same pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), close to the 50% expected from random positioning. In fixed <italic>him-8</italic> embryos at the onset of anaphase, when spindles are shortened and rotated but chromosomes are not yet separated, 57% had one or both univalents closer to the cortical pole (38 + 19%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). No embryos had both univalents closer to the interior spindle pole. We hypothesized that one of two mechanisms might link spindle rotation with the early anaphase preference for univalent movement toward the cortex. Univalents might stochastically align closer to one spindle pole before rotation and bias the movement of that pole to the cortex. Alternatively, the cortex-proximal pole might acquire distinct biochemical properties after rotation due to cortical contact and subsequently generate more pulling force on the lagging univalents and pull them preferentially toward the cortex.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06056.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Early bias of univalent X chromosomes might occur at the metaphase to anaphase I transition.</title><p>Representative cartoon diagrams and Z projections from fixed embryos stained with DAPI, anti-tubulin antibody, and LacO(X) FISH probe.

If offset univalents bias spindle rotation or if the cortex-proximal pole exerts greater pulling on univalents after rotation, then a <italic>mei-2</italic>(<italic>ct98</italic>) <italic>him-8</italic> double mutant should have a reduced frequency of male progeny relative to <italic>him-8</italic> alone. At 20°C, the <italic>mei-2</italic>(<italic>ct98</italic>) <italic>him-8</italic> double mutant produced only 21% male progeny (n = 1440 progeny from 14 parents), which is significantly less than the 36% male progeny produced by the <italic>him-8</italic> single mutant (n = 964 progeny from 8 parents; p &lt; 0.0001 by one-tailed binomial test) and is significantly different than <italic>mei-2</italic> (<italic>ct98</italic>) alone (0% males; n = 925 progeny from 8 parents). The reduction in male progeny is unlikely to be due to effects on spermatogenesis, as sperm is unaffected by katanin-null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Mains et al., 1990</xref>). This result is consistent with either spindle rotation-based models for the early anaphase segregation bias. The role of spindle rotation is not conclusive; however, since <italic>mei-2</italic>(<italic>ct98</italic>) meiotic spindles have other phenotypes besides spindle rotation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNally et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Absolute distinction between the two possible rotation models would require unambiguous tracking of both univalents before, during, and after spindle rotation. This was not possible in any of 201 time-lapse sequences. In 8 particularly clear time-lapse sequences, one or both univalents could be identified unambiguously 10–100 s before initiation of spindle rotation. In 6/8 of these cases, the univalent-proximal pole rotated to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,H</xref>). In 1/8 cases, the univalent-proximal pole rotated away from the cortex. In 1/8 cases, the two univalents were offset to opposite poles both before and during rotation. If the cortical environment conferred a stronger pulling force on the cortical pole after rotation, then lagging univalents crossing the midpoint of the anaphase spindle should be common. Time-lapse imaging of spindles after rotation revealed that among 30 embryos in which one or two lagging chromosomes were already positioned closer to one pole at anaphase I onset and the lagging chromosome resolved early, the lagging chromosome resolved toward the pole that it was already close to in 80% of these embryos (data not shown). Among the 20% of embryos in which the lagging chromosome moved to the opposite pole after spindle rotation, the chromosome moved toward the cortex 3 times, toward the embryo 3 times, and in one instance, the two lagging chromosomes resolved to opposite poles. These observations are not consistent with a cortical pole that generates a stronger pulling force after rotation but instead favor the idea that the offset position of univalents before rotation increases the probability that the univalent-proximal pole will move to the cortex.</p><p>Two results suggested that additional factors might contribute to the overall inheritance of univalent X chromosomes. Both <italic>ani-3</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) and <italic>mei-2</italic>(<italic>ct98</italic>) reduced the frequency of male self-progeny from <italic>him-8</italic> worms without increasing the frequency of triploX self-progeny. We therefore tested whether aneuploid sperm might influence phenotypic outcomes by LacO(X) FISH on pronuclear stage embryos from self-fertilized <italic>him-8</italic> mothers (not shown). Before pronuclear meeting, male pronuclei are distinguished from female pronuclei by the presence of sperm asters. We observed 90% haploX, 8% nulloX, and 2% diploX male pronuclei (n = 52). These values are significantly different than the 50%, 25%, 25% expected from random segregation (two-tailed p &lt; 0.0001 by chi square) and are similar to the frequencies obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al.

(1979)</xref> showed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are trisomic for the X chromosome or that fail to form a chiasma between the normal two X homologs have fewer trisomic offspring than expected from random segregation. Our results explain this phenomenon by demonstrating that two cellular pathways preferentially segregate X univalents into the first polar body. Mechanisms reducing the frequency of trisomic offspring have not been investigated in other model organisms because in both mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, animals with trisomy X are not fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schupbach et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tada et al., 1993</xref>), and there are no mutants, like <italic>him-8</italic>, that specifically block crossover formation on one specific chromosome in females. However, women with trisomy 21 or trisomy X are often fertile and have been reported to have more than 50% euploid offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bovicelli et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neri, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliffe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart et al., 1991</xref>). Triploid oysters provide a stronger example of apparent female-specific correction to a diploid state. Eggs produced by triploid females and fertilized with sperm from diploid males result in 57% diploid, 31% triploid, and 12% aneuploid offspring, whereas eggs produced by diploids and fertilized by sperm from triploids result in 15% diploid and 85% aneuploid offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong et al., 2004</xref>). Gaging the likelihood that the phenomenon described here for <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be relevant to trisomic humans or triploid oysters is complicated by two issues. In contrast with trisomic <italic>C. elegans</italic>, triploid oysters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo and Allen, 1994</xref>) and trisomic human oocytes sometimes form trivalent structures rather than a separate bivalent and univalent. Only 42–16% of diplotene oocytes from fetuses with trisomy 21, trisomy 13, or trisomy 18 exhibited a separate bivalent and univalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robles et al., 2007</xref>). It is difficult to predict the behavior of trivalents on the spindle. In addition, it is not clear whether a univalent present during anaphase I of a human or oyster oocyte would be more likely to move to one pole intact as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or to separate equationally. We speculate that single chromatids resulting from equational separation of univalents at anaphase I could be subjected to asymmetric segregation at anaphase II. Our results suggest that any chromosome that lags during late anaphase might be prefentially expelled simply due to the conserved asymmetric nature of polar body formation.</p><p>There is one example where a univalent chromosome exhibits the opposite of the segregation bias reported here in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In the 44–78% of oocytes from XO mice in which the univalent segregates intact at anaphase I, the univalent is preferentially retained in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemaire-Adkins and Hunt, 2000</xref>). This appears to be a difference between worms and mice rather than a difference between a trisomy and a monosomy since sex-reversed XO <italic>C. elegans</italic> produce an excess of nulloX ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgkin, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Discerning the overall significance of preferentially placing univalents into the first polar body is a complex problem. In the case of an XXX mother or a mother with a mosaic ovary containing trisomic and diploid oocytes, these pathways would increase the frequency of normal haploid eggs relative to that expected from random distribution of a single univalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the case of diploid oocytes with two univalent autosomes, however, 100% efficient expulsion of univalents into the first polar body would increase the frequency of lethal monosomy. Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, however, show no significant decrease in haploid eggs (interpreted from the frequency of MII spindles with 6 chromosomes) from <italic>him-8</italic> or <italic>zim-2</italic> mothers relative to the 50% that would occur by random distribution. Thus, the efficiency of placing univalents in the first polar body has evolved to a point that corrects trisomy without reducing the frequency of haploid eggs produced from oocytes that failed to form a chiasma between one pair of homologs. The conservation of these mechanisms in other species will have to be elucidated by studies focused specifically on the concept of chromosomal errors that are corrected, rather than caused, by female meiotic spindles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>The genotypes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

At this frame, spindle length was determined by measuring the distance between the outside edges of the main masses of segregating chromosomes. Lagging chromosomes that decided which way to go when the spindle was more than 4 μm long were classified as late resolving because earlier work indicated that myosin-dependent polar body scission occurs when spindles are longer than 4 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabritius et al., 2011b</xref>).

These were still scored as cortex-fated lagging chromosomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the following for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains: Christian Frøkjær-Jensen, Erik Jorgensen, Aaron Severson, Barbara Meyer, Anne Villeneuve, Amy Maddox, Becky Green, Karen Oegema, Paula Checci, and the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center, which is funded by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor) and two reviewers, as well as a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Both reviewers were generally positive about your paper, but one of them had some concerns about your interpretation.</p><p>Your data clearly show that there is increased probability for unpaired chromosomes to be segregated into the polar body compared to the zygote. The FISH analysis leaves no doubt that the unpaired chromosome is the one being asymmetrically distributed during meiosis I. However, the major contributing factor to the asymmetry appears to be the inability of unpaired chromosomes to lose cohesion during meiosis I. This aspect needs to be paid greater attention as it is arguably a prerequisite for any type of asymmetric distribution to occur. Given recent work from the Meyer lab, the most likely explanation for this is that in the absence of recombination the cohesion is largely comprised of complexes containing Rec8 (deposited during pre-meiotic S-phase), which are more difficult to cleave in meiosis I (on bivalents, the axis of cohesion loss during meiosis I that is defined by crossovers has primarily Coh3/4-containing cohesion; Rec8 and Coh3/4 are different kleisin subunits of the cohesion complex that are employed during meiosis). Another explanation is that the lack of chiasma somehow reduces Aurora B loading onto the chromosome axis and prior work has shown that Aurora B is important for segregation. A supplementary figure shows reduced Aurora B on univalents in meiosis I compared to bivalents and also compared to paired sister chromatids in meiosis II. As mutants in Rec8 show equational division and form viable triploids (when mated to a wild-type male), I suspect the former may be the reason that the unpaired X chromosomes do not show equational meiosis I. Thus, it is not the “asymmetry of female meiosis” but the “inability to dissolve meiotic cohesion and the asymmetry of female meiosis” that is at play here. To address this point, we suggest the following experiment:</p><p>An experimental test would be to make univalents by Rec8 inhibition in the <italic>him-8</italic> mutant and confirm by FISH that there is no asymmetry (anticipated from the genetics). One additional issue here is that sperm meiotic defects are not accounted for in the phenotypic outcomes. It would help if the author used FISH to analyze X chromosomes in sperm nuclei and quantitatively relate the combination of their oocyte and sperm analysis to the phenotypic outcome. There may also be some clever genetic way to fertilize with a male that only delivers an X chromosome; this would be even better.</p><p>You also examine the potential sources of asymmetry. In these cases, we are unsure precisely how spindle length is measured and whether tilting in the Z-axis is accounted for in all of their measurements. The representative images make it unclear precisely how positions (e.g. of the lagging chromosome) were defined. Could you sort this out?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06056.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>An experimental test would be to make univalents by Rec8 inhibition in the</italic> him8 <italic>mutant and confirm by FISH that there is no asymmetry (anticipated from the genetics)</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Severson and Meyer (2014)</xref> showed that the partial depletion of REC-8 from the short arms of a bivalent requires AIR-2. Because removal of the AIR-2 inhibitors, HTP-1/2, from the short arms requires a crossover (Martinez-Perez et al., 2008), it is expected that <italic>him-8</italic> univalents might have both reduced amounts of AIR-2 and increased amounts of REC-8 relative to the short arms of a bivalent. These are not two mutually exclusive possibilities but rather integrally related consequences of a crossover failure. We have added analysis of the fluorescence intensity of REC-8 staining on <italic>him-8</italic> univalents relative to the short-arms of bivalents within the same spindle, along with a citation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Severson and Meyer (2014)</xref> who showed that this would be expected when there is reduced AIR-2. We have not added FISH analysis of <italic>rec-8 him-8</italic> double mutants because this would provide limited new insight. Because <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants produce mostly 12 univalents, it is a relatively weak hypothesis that <italic>rec-8 him-8</italic> would be different than <italic>rec-8</italic> alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in Severson and Meyer (2009) clearly shows that there is no bias toward eliminating univalents at anaphase I in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants. We agree with the reviewers that univalents that biorient and lose cohesion at anaphase I are likely to show no segregation bias at anaphase I. We believe that equational separation of univalents at anaphase I leaves open the possibility of biased (or random) segregation of single chromatids at anaphase II (this was already stated in our Introduction and is now stated in the Discussion). This cannot be studied in <italic>rec-8</italic> because the second polar body is not formed (Severson and Meyer, 2009).</p><p><italic>One additional issue here is that sperm meiotic defects are not accounted for in the phenotypic outcomes.</italic></p><p>Sperm meiotic defects caused by <italic>him-8</italic> can only influence the “phenotypic outcome” of self progeny. Our analysis of female meiotic spindles cannot be influenced by the sperm karyotype and is related in the text to phenotypic outcomes from crosses with wild-type XO males. For example, the first comparison of our MII chromosome counts with phenotypic outcomes (beginning of the Results section) refers to phenotypic outcomes from crosses with wild-type males.</p><p><italic>It would help if the author used FISH to analyze X chromosomes in sperm nuclei and quantitatively relate the combination of their oocyte and sperm analysis to the phenotypic outcome. There may also be some clever genetic way to fertilize with a male that only delivers an X chromosome; this would be even better</italic>.</p><p>We have added analysis of X chromosome number in male pronuclei of <italic>him-8</italic> self progeny to the last section of the results. This section is focused on looking for additional mechanisms, beyond female meiosis, that might contribute to the low frequency of XXX offspring among self progeny. Our FISH analysis of male pronuclei (distinguishable from female pronuclei by the presence of centrosomes) in the self progeny of <italic>him-8</italic> hermaphrodites revealed 90% haploX, 8% nulloX sperm and 2% diplo X sperm (n=52). This agrees with genetic results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</xref> using sex reversed <italic>him-8</italic> XX males and demonstrates that nulloX sperm make a small contribution to the low frequency of XXX self progeny.</p><p><italic>You also examine the potential sources of asymmetry.

Could you sort this out?</italic></p><p>We have added the following sentence in the subsection “The meiotic contractile ring captures lagging X univalents in the first polar body”: “Spindle length was measured between the outside edges of the main chromosome masses and only in frames in which both chromosome masses were in focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>)”. Tilting in the Z-axis occurs in some frames of any time-lapse sequence and is obvious because one chromosome mass goes out of focus.</p></body></sub-article></article>
