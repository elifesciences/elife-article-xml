challenge. Despite indoxyl sulfate (IS) being a potent stimulus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related inflammation, its impact on trained immunity has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that IS induces trained immunity in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP). Inhibition of AhR during IS training suppresses the induction of IS-trained immunity. Monocytes from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have increased ALOX5 expression and after 6 days training, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, healthy control-derived monocytes trained with uremic sera from ESRD patients exhibit increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Consistently, IS-trained mice and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after in vivo and ex vivo LPS stimulation compared to that of control mice. These results provide insight into the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical during inflammatory immune responses in CKD patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trained immunity</kwd><kwd>indoxyl sulfate</kwd><kwd>chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>metabolic reprogramming</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A4A1033767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Won-Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2C3011243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Won-Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2023-00238632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hee Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Indoxyl sulfate, a key uremic toxin in chronic kidney disease (CKD), induces trained immunity in monocytes via crosstalk between aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent epigenetic reprogramming by enhancement of the arachidonic acid pathway and AhR-independent metabolic rewiring.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last decade, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that innate cells can build up immunological memory resulting in enhanced responsiveness to subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon termed trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Netea et al., 2011</xref>). Compared with classical epitope-specific adaptive immunological memory based on an antigen-receptor, trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages is the long-term functional reprogramming elicited by an initial primary insult, mainly pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which leads to an altered response towards a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult after the return to a homeostatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>). It has been well demonstrated that exposure of monocytes or macrophages to <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, fungal cell wall component β-glucan, or Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine enhances their subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens or pathogen components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>). The induction of trained immunity is associated with the interaction of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which can last for prolonged periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanistically, certain metabolites derived from the upregulation of different metabolic pathways triggered by primary insult can influence enzymes involved in remodeling the epigenetic landscape of cells. This leads to specific changes in epigenetic histone markers, such as histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) or histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which regulate genes resulting in a more rapid and stronger response upon a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it has been recently reported that long non-coding RNAs induce epigenetic reprogramming via the histone methyltransferase, MLL1. Subsequently, transcription factors such as Runx1 regulate the induction of proinflammatory cytokines following the secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fanucchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jentho et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Many studies have provided evidence that trained immunity likely evolved as a beneficial process for non-specific protection from future secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>). However, it has also been suggested that augmented immune responses resulting from trained immunity is potentially relevant to deleterious outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases, allergy, and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Valk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulder et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, although most studies have focused on the ability of exogenous microbial insults to induce trained immunity, it is also conceivable that sterile inflammatory insults can evoke trained immunity. In support of this idea, oxLDL, lipoprotein a (Lpa), uric acid, hyperglycemia, and the Western diet have all been recently identified as endogenous sterile insults that induce trained immunity in human monocytes via epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Valk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabău et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that many endogenous insults that cause chronic inflammatory conditions may be involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes and macrophages.</p><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a major non-communicable disease with increasing worldwide prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Couser et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of renal function in CKD patients causes the accumulation of over 100 uremic toxins, which are closely associated with cardiovascular risk and mortality due to their ability to generate oxidative stress and a proinflammatory cytokine milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanholder et al., 2003</xref>). Reflecting this, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a major uremic toxin derived from dietary tryptophan via fermentation of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Since it is poorly cleared by hemodialysis, IS is one of the uremic toxins present at higher than normal concentrations in the serum of CKD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duranton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2021</xref>) and is associated with the progression of CKD and the development of CKD-related complications such as CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Liu, 2017</xref>). We and others have shown that IS promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling and organic anion transporting polypeptides 2B1 (OATP2B1)-Dll4-Notch Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakano et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a role of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages. Moreover, pretreatment with IS greatly increases TNF-α production by human macrophages in response to a low dose of LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the function of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages, little is known with regard to whether IS induces trained immunity. Thus, we investigated whether exposure to IS triggers trained immunity in an in vitro human monocyte model and an in vivo mouse model, as well as the mechanisms involved in IS-induced trained immunity. Our data show that IS triggers trained immunity in human monocytes/macrophages via AhR-dependent alteration of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic rewiring. Thus, this suggests IS plays a critical role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IS induces trained immunity in human monocytes</title><p>To explore whether exposure to IS is involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes, an in vitro model of trained immunity was applied as previously reported by the Netea group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkering et al., 2016</xref>). Freshly isolated human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were preincubated for 24 hr with or without IS and, after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum, restimulated with LPS or Pam3cys for final 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Preincubation of monocytes with IS led to enhanced production of TNF-α, a major monocyte/macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine, upon LPS stimulation. Since 10 ng/ml of LPS significantly increased both TNF-α and IL-6 secretion in IS-trained macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we used this concentration of LPS in subsequent experiments. A clinically relevant concentration of IS in severe CKD has reported the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanholder et al., 2003</xref>). The preincubation effect of IS on cytokine production was observed at a concentration as low as 250 μM, which is the average IS concentration in patients with ESRD in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike IS, preincubation with other protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as <italic>p</italic>-cresyl sulfate (PCS), hippuric acid (HA), indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), and kynurenic acid (KA), did not cause increased secretion of TNF-α or IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, there was no obvious effect on cell viability following pre-incubation of macrophages with 1000 μM of IS after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum or after LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also found that the enhanced cytokine production of IS-trained macrophages was not attributable to potassium derived from IS potassium salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, the increased TNF-α and IL-6 production in IS-trained macrophages was not limited to LPS stimulation, as similar phenomena were observed following stimulation with Pam3cys, a TLR1/2 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). β-glucan-pretreated macrophages exhibit a prototypic feature of trained immunity, characterized by enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines upon restimulation with heterologous stimuli, LPS or Pam3cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkering et al., 2016</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, the level of TNF-α secreted by IS-trained macrophages was comparable with that secreted by β-glucan-trained macrophages, although β-glucan had a more potent effect on IL-6 production than did IS, suggesting that IS plays a role in the induction of trained immunity of human monocytes. Furthermore, alongside elevated TNF-α and IL-6 expressions, there was a notable increase in the mRNA expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> (<italic>CCL2</italic>) observed in IS-trained macrophages, concomitant with a significant reduction in <italic>IL-10</italic>, a cytokine known for its anti-inflammatory properties, within the same cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Correspondingly, alterations in their protein levels mirrored the observed mRNA expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To examine whether uremic serum induces trained immunity of monocytes/macrophages, pooled sera from ESRD patients (184±44 μM of average IS level) or from healthy controls (HCs) were used to treat monocytes isolated from HCs for 24 hr at 30% (v/v), followed by training for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Training with pooled uremic serum of ESRD patients increased the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon re-stimulation with LPS compared to monocytes treated with the pooled sera of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). In addition, expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA was also augmented by training with the pooled uremic sera of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggest that IS induces trained immunity in human monocytes, characterized by the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to secondary TLR stimulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity in human monocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of in vitro experimental model for innate trained immunity.

Assessment of the metabolic profile of IS-trained macrophages on day 6 (prior to re-stimulation with LPS) showed that training with IS led to an enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate production, indicating increased glycolysis and glycolysis capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

To further examine whether the metabolic rewiring by IS-trained cells is linked to the regulation of trained immunity, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a general inhibitor of glycolysis, was added to monocytes before training with IS. 2-DG completely inhibited the augmented production of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained macrophages in response to re-stimulation with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We next sought to determine whether increased expression of TNF-α and IL-6 is a result of epigenetic changes. To this end, chromatin modification of histone 3 trimethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at the promoter sites of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR data illustrate that IS-trained macrophages exhibit enhanced H3K4me3 of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters by day 6 after treatment with 1000 μM of IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This reflects what was previously demonstrated in trained innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duranton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stevens et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, IS-mediated enrichment of H3K4me3 was maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS compared with non-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). When IS-trained macrophages were pretreated with 5’-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor, their production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was reversed to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), implying that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. To explore the potential regulation of IS-induced epigenetic modification by metabolic rewiring, we examined the enrichment of H3K4me3 at the promoters of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> subsequent to treatment with 2-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Our findings suggest that metabolic rewiring influences epigenetic modification, implicating the participation of metabolites. Additionally, heightened enrichment of H3K4me3 at the promoter regions of <italic>HK2</italic> and <italic>PFKP</italic>, pivotal genes associated with glycolysis, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To further elucidate epigenetic modifications in IS-induced trained immunity, we performed a whole-genome assessment of the histone marker H3K4me3 by ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in IS-trained cells on day 6. Among 7,136 peaks, 59 differentially upregulated peaks and 316 downregulated peaks were detected in IS-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To identify the biological processes affected in IS-mediated trained immunity, 59 upregulated peaks in IS-trained macrophages were analyzed through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with Go biological process and the Reactome Gene Set. Activation of the innate immune response and positive regulation of the defense response were identified as major processes via Go biological process analysis. Further, genes involved in regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and metabolism of polyamine were recognized as major gene sets via Reactome Gene Set analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). A genome browser snapshot showing H3K4me3 binding illustrates that H3K4me3 is elevated at the promoters of important target genes associated with activation of the innate immune response, such as <italic>IFI16</italic> (interferon-gamma inducible protein 16), <italic>XRCC5</italic> (X-ray repair cross-complementing 5), and <italic>PQBP1</italic> (polyglutamine binding protein 1) and genes linked to the regulation of ODC, such as <italic>PSMA1</italic> (proteasome 20 S subunit alpha 1), <italic>PSMA3</italic> (proteasome 20 S subunit alpha 3), and <italic>OAZ3</italic> (Ornithine Decarboxylase Antizyme 3, a protein that negatively regulates ODC activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>).

previous study demonstrated that IS-induced TNF-α production in macrophages is regulated through a complex mechanism involving the interaction of NF-κB and SOCS2 with AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of IS-trained immunity, we investigated the role of AhR, a potent endogenous receptor for IS. Ligand-bound activated AhR is known to be immediately translocated into the nucleus and rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dou et al., 2018</xref>). Immunoblot analysis depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> reveals persistent nuclear translocation of IS-mediated AhR even on day 6 (prior to re-stimulation with LPS), which was entirely inhibited by GNF351 treatment, an AhR antagonist, on day 6. Inhibition of AhR by GNF351 during IS training suppressed the increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 following LPS restimulation on day 6 in IS-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), implying that IS-mediated AhR activation may be involved in trained immunity. In addition to TNF-α and IL-6, enhancement of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA expression in IS-trained cells was also completely inhibited, whereas decreased <italic>IL-10</italic> expression was completely reversed by GNF351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To confirm the regulatory role of AhR in trained immunity, we tested whether 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan-derived agonist of AhR, also induced trained immunity in human monocytes. FICZ-pretreated monocytes exhibited augmented expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in response to secondary stimulation with LPS compared to non-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, knockdown of AhR suppressed the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), underscoring the significant role of ligand-bound activated AhR in the trained immunity of human monocytes. We next examined whether inhibition of AhR with GNF351 influences epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. Our ChIP-qPCR assay showed that enrichment of H3K4m3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages was inhibited by GNF351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Of note, assessment of the metabolic profile by measuring ECAR and OCR illustrates that GNF351 has no effect on metabolic rewiring, including enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, in IS-trained cells on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This finding was corroborated by the immunoblotting data, which showed GNF351 had no inhibitory effect on IS-mediated enhancement of S6K activity, which is critical for inducing the aerobic glycolysis in human monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Our findings suggest that IS-activated AhR is involved in regulating epigenetic modifications of IS-trained macrophages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Indoxyl sulfate (IS)-induced trained immunity is regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).</title><p>Monocytes were pretreated with or without GNF351 (AhR antagonist; 10 μM) followed by IS (1000 μM)-training for 6 days.

A total of 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), consisting of 71 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes, were identified in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>; FC ≥± 2, &lt;0.05). GO analysis of these expression data using the Reactome Gene Set is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. IS-trained macrophages had upregulated pathways including those involved in neutrophil degranulation, integrin cell surface interactions, extracellular matrix organization and AA metabolism, whereas pathways associated with kinesins, cell cycle, and the Gα(i) signaling pathway were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Considering the key role of the AA pathway in many inflammatory disorders, we decided to focus on this pathway in the induction of trained immunity by IS. Our findings were supported by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB), in which genes related to AA metabolism were enriched in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells and more importantly, upregulated expression of these genes was inhibited by treatment with GNF351 as illustrated by heatmap analysis of major genes related to AA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Among AA metabolism pathways, the leukotriene metabolic process, but not the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, was primarily involved in the induction of IS-mediated trained immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Confirmatory RT-qPCR analysis on major AA metabolism-related genes was conducted using IS-trained macrophages obtained from independent, HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The mRNA expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>: also known as <italic>5-LOX</italic> or <italic>5-LO</italic>) and ALOX5 activating protein (<italic>ALOX5AP</italic>: also known as <italic>FLAP</italic>), the enzymes catalyzing AA into leukotrienes (a group of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rådmark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pernet et al., 2019</xref>), was higher in IS-trained macrophages than non-trained cells. In addition, the mRNA expression of <italic>LTB4R1</italic> (also known as <italic>BLT1</italic>), a high-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), was also upregulated. The augmented expression of these AA metabolism-related genes was repressed by GNF351 pretreatment as shown by changes in expression of <italic>CYP1B1</italic>, a typical AhR target gene. Thus, this suggests that the IS-activated AhR pathway is involved in enhanced AA-metabolism in IS-induced trained immunity. Immunoblot analysis validated the upregulation of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP expression in IS-trained immunity, which was subsequently inhibited by GNF351 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of AhR suppressed the IS-induced mRNA expression of <italic>ALOX5, ALOX5AP,</italic> and <italic>LTB4R</italic> on day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

The level of TNF-α in serum was increased in IS-trained mice compared to that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). To further investigate the impact of IS-training on innate responses, splenic myeloid cells were isolated after 5 days of training (prior to injection with LPS) followed by in vitro stimulation with 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 hr. The amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant was augmented following culture with LPS-stimulated mouse splenic myeloid cells derived from IS-trained mice compared the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Additionally, we observed upregulation of ALOX5 expression in ex vivo splenic myeloid cells of IS-treated mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L and M</xref>), which was similar to what was observed in monocytes and macrophages from ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). Finally, treatment with zileuton, an ALOX5 inhibitor, inhibited the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in ex vivo splenic myeloid cells of IS-trained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we examined the impact of IS-trained immunity on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). It was observed that BMDM from IS-trained mice did not exhibit heightened production of TNF-α and IL-6, and the expression level of ALOX5 in bone marrow progenitor cells remained unaltered when compared to non-trained cells, indicating that our acute IS-trained mice did not induce central trained immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riksen et al., 2023</xref>). Collectively, these findings offer compelling evidence for the involvement of IS and the induction of the AA pathway in the establishment of trained immunity in both monocytes and macrophages, both ex vivo and in vivo.

Further, recent cohort studies have shown that CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menon et al., 2005</xref>). Uremia accompanying renal failure causes immune dysfunction, which is closely linked to the pathogenesis of CKD-related CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betjes, 2013</xref>). Among over 100 uremic toxins identified, IS is a prototypical protein-bound uremic toxin most likely to be participating in progressive pathophysiology of CVD including endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, and increased atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leong and Sirich, 2016</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that a prolonged hyperactivation of trained immunity is intimately related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hyperglycemia, and the estern diet, all known to be associate with the progression of atherosclerosis, have been reported to induce trained immunity through epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christ et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that IS plays a role as a typical endogenous inflammatory insult in activating monocytes and macrophages and modulating their responses. Given that IS is difficult to clear by hemodialysis, this toxin has a chronic effect on the immune system of patients. Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of IS on trained immunity.</p><p>As observed using a common in vitro model of trained immunity established by Netea and other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which are exposed for 24 hr to the first insult with IS and rested for 5 days without IS, produced an augmented level of TNF-α and IL-6 and decreased level of IL-10 in response to an unrelated second insult with LPS or Pam3cys, which is a feature typical of trained immunity of monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). In contrast to TNF-α and IL-6, major proinflammatory cytokines, IL-10 exerts potent deactivating effects on macrophages and T cells, influencing various cellular processes in inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mallat et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, it is noteworthy that IL-10-deficient macrophages exhibit an augmentation in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smallie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Couper et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the reduced gene expression of IL-10 by IS-trained monocytes may contribute to the heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the induction of trained immunity is coordinated through the interplay of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which is broadly characterized as prolonged changes in transcription programs and cell physiology that do not involve permanent genetic changes, such as the mutations and recombination events crucial for adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, ChIP-Seq and real-time metabolic analysis show that the induction of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes is attributable to epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>), trimethylation of histones at H3K4 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters was increased in IS-trained macrophages and maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with MTA, a methyltransferase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), demonstrating that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. Moreover, H3K4me3-ChIP-Seq data showed that IS-induced trained immunity accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming and H3K4me3 was enriched in genes related to activation of the innate immune responses as illustrated by GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>).</p><p>We identified AhR as a critical mediator of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). AhR is a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor (TF), which is activated by several exogenous compounds, such as benzo[a]pyrene environmental pollutants and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD), as well as by multiple endogenous ligands including tryptophan and indole metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>). AhR plays a multifaceted role in modulating cellular mechanisms such as inflammation, cell growth, and antioxidant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>). AhR is expressed by various immune cells, and its signaling exerts integrative effects on the cellular environment and metabolism of the immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutiérrez-Vázquez and Quintana, 2018</xref>). However, little is known about the role of AhR in the induction of trained immunity.</p><p>In the present study, we show that IS-trained immune responses, characterized by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were attenuated by GNF351, an AhR antagonist, or through the knockdown of AhR using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). This inhibition was accompanied by repression of enriched H3K4me3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating an AhR-dependent mechanism. However, increased glycolysis and mitochondria respiration in IS-trained macrophages were not suppressed by the blockade of AhR activation with GNF351, suggesting the AhR activation is not directly involved in metabolic rewiring in IS-trained immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic rewiring, especially upregulation of aerobic glycolysis, is known as a major mechanism underlying the induction of trained immunity via regulation of epigenetic modification by metabolites, such as mevalonate and fumarate generated from this metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekkering et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to establishing the bidirectional link between heightened glycolysis and activating histone modifications, as evidenced by the suppression of histone modification by 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, in IS-induced immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), recent studies have demonstrated that immune priming long non-coding RNAs (IPLs) also induce epigenetic reprogramming by influencing 3D nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fanucchi et al., 2021</xref>) and that RUNX1, a transcription factor, contributes to the induction of trained immunity by overexpression of RUNX1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that a variety of mechanism is involved in epigenetic modification in trained immunity.</p><p>Although inducers of trained immunity, such as β-glucan, BCG, uric acid, and oxLDL, initiate intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways, each via different receptors, the most common pathway is the Akt/mTOR/HIF1α-dependent induction of aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekkering et al., 2021</xref>). Our data also revealed that training with IS led to enhanced glycolysis, which is critical for the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation as confirmed by experiments with 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Recent studies have shown that IS activates mTORC1 in a variety of cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and THP-1 cells mainly via the organic anion transporters (OAT)/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, but not the AhR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakano et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings suggest that IS-trained macrophages acquire the characteristics of trained immunity by AhR-dependent and -independent mechanisms and enhances proinflammatory responses upon secondary stimulation. Thus, addressing the mechanism underlying AhR-independent metabolic rewiring in IS-trained macrophages will require further investigations.</p><p>A finding of particular interest in our study is that the induction of IS-induced trained immunity is dependent on the AhR-ALOX5/ALOX5AP axis, as depicted by RNA-Seq analysis and confirmatory in vitro analysis of mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). ALOX5 and ALOX5AP are major rate-limiting enzymes associated with the AA pathway, involved in the production of leukotrienes, proinflammatory lipid mediators derived from AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rådmark et al., 2007</xref>). Among leukotrienes, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an extremely potent inflammatory mediator, binds to Gprotein-coupled protein, LTB4R, and enhances inflammatory responses by increased phagocytosis and activation of the signaling pathway for the production of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pernet et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, the LTB4-LTB4R signaling pathway induces the PI3K/Akt or NF-κB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ihara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2005</xref>). AhR-dependent LTB4 production through enhanced ALOX5 expression in hepatocytes reportedly induces hepatotoxicity via neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeda et al., 2017</xref>). The increase in ALOX5 activity and LTB4 expression has been reported in patients with ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maccarrone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maccarrone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montford et al., 2019</xref>) and ALOX5 mediates mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in mononuclear cells of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maccarrone et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, antagonists of ALOX5/ALOX5AP have been used for treatment in CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montford et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with these findings, peripheral monocytes derived from ESRD patients in our cohort have increased expression of ALOX5 and this increase was maintained after differentiation into macrophages with M-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). Considering that pretreatment with the uremic serum of ESRD patients elicits a change in gene expression and cytokine production as observed in IS-trained macrophages, it is likely that increased ALOX5 in monocytes and macrophages of ESRD patients is mediated by IS in uremic serum. Our previous studies have shown that IS is an important uremic toxin in the serum of ESRD patients that elicits proinflammatory responses of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the AhR-ALOX5-LTB4R1 pathway is involved in IS-induced trained immunity of patients with ESRD.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that trained immunity of macrophages is implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD, such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekkering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Valk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulder et al., 2019</xref>). Considering a higher plasma level of IS in ESRD patients even after hemodialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duranton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2021</xref>), this is potentially difficult to reconcile with trained immunity in which there typically is a short exposure to the training stimulus followed by a period of rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>). However, when ESRD monocytes exposed to the IS in the circulation enter atherosclerotic plaques and differentiate into macrophages, they are no longer exposed to IS, because this is protein-bound and hence not expected to the present in the plaque microenvironment.</p><p>Murine models have been widely used to investigate the specific contribution of inducers of trained immunity and the underlying mechanisms to a long-term functional modification of innate cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keating et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Valtanen et al., 2017</xref>). Mice trained with β-glucan enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages in response to secondary microbial stimuli and subsequently obtain increased protection against various microbial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekkering et al., 2021</xref>). Our in vivo and ex vivo mouse experiments for trained immunity demonstrate that IS-trained immunity has biological relevance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Previous studies have shown that intraperitoneal injection of exogenous IS into wild-type C57BL/6 mice leads to an increase of IS in the plasma until 3~6 hr post-injection despite its rapid excretion by the kidney. In this period, the expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-apoptotic genes in peritoneal macrophages was upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rapa et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of IS daily for 3 days elevates IS in the plasma of mice and activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the mouse kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakano et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the IS-injected mouse model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms underlying IS-mediated immune responses. Our data show increased TNF-α in serum after injection of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Moreover, ALOX5 protein expression was increased in splenic myeloid cells derived from IS-trained mice and ex vivo stimulation with LPS for 24 hr induced TNF-α and IL-6 expression in these splenic myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). Thus, this suggests a systemic induction of IS-trained immunity in the mouse model.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study provides new insight into the role of IS as an inducer of trained immunity as well as the underlying mechanisms in human monocytes/macrophages by investigating the effect of IS in vivo and in vitro using experimental models of trained immunity. Here, we demonstrate that IS, a major uremic toxin, induces trained immunity characterized by the increased proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6 in human monocytes following secondary stimulation through epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. IS-mediated activation of AhR is involved in the induction of trained immunity through enhanced expression of AA metabolism-related genes such as ALOX5 and ALOX5AP. Monocytes from patients with ESRD exhibit increased expression of ALOX5 and after 6 day resting, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to LPS. Furthermore, the uremic serum of ESDR patients causes HC-derived monocytes to increase the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS re-stimulation, implying IS-mediates trained immunity in patients. Supporting our in vitro findings, mice trained with IS and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after in vivo and ex vivo LPS stimulation. These results suggest that IS plays an important role in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical in inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD and thus, it holds potential as a therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

DEGs were visualized using the R (ver. 4.1.1) and pheatmap package (ver. 1.0.8). For GSEA, samples were categorized into distinct groups based on treatment conditions. All transcripts within annotated genes (~14,404 features in total) regarding expression values were uploaded to locally installed GSEA software (ver. 4.2.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). The analysis was performed by comparing the 'IS (T)' group against the 'Control' group to identify differentially enriched gene sets within the Reactome pathway database, particularly focusing on the aAA metabolism pathway. A similar comparison was made between the 'IS (T)' and 'IS (T)+GNF' groups to assess the effect of the GNF inhibitor. Outputs were filtered based on a nominal p&lt;0.05 and a normalized enrichment score (NES) &gt;1.3 to determine statistical significance. These thresholds were applied to ensure the robustness of the findings in the context of multiple hypothesis testing.

Cell lysates were separated on an 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary Abs, such as anti-AhR, anti-ALOX5, and anti-ALOX5AP/FLAP, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs for 1 hr. The membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>WST (Water Soluble Tetrazolium Salt) assay</title><p>To test cell viability, IS-trained macrophages were re-stimulated with LPS for 24 hr. Culture media was changed with serum-free RPMI medium and the WST reagent (EZ-CYTOX, DoGenBio, Seoul, Korea) followed by incubation for 1–2 hr. Measurement of the optical density value (450 nm) was performed by Infinite M200 (Tecan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mouse in vivo studies</title><p>For in vivo experiments, C57BL/6 mice (7–8 weeks) were injected intraperitoneally with 200 mg/kg IS in 100 μl PBS daily for 5 days. Another 5 days after IS injection, 5 mg/kg LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) were injected intraperitoneally 75 min prior to sacrifice. Whole blood was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged at 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4℃ to collect mouse serum. The amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in serum was quantified using commercial mouse ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For ex vivo experiments using splenic myeloid cells, IS-trained mice were sacrificed and their spleens were aseptically collected. Single-cell splenic suspensions were prepared in PBS after passage through a 40 mm cell strainer. Splenocytes were seeded at 1x10<sup>7</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates. After incubation for 1 h, adherent cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 hr. The amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in culture supernatants was quantified using commercial mouse ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A two-tailed paired or unpaired non-parametric t-test was performed to analyze data using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2013. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Study approval</title><p>Study protocols were reviewed and approved by the IRB (institutional review board) of Seoul National University Hospital and Severance Hospital.

(1) Although many experiments have been sporadically conducted in many fields such as epigenetic, metabolic regulation, and AhR signaling, the causal relationship between each mechanism is not clear. (2) Throughout the manuscript, no distinction was made between the group treated with IS for 6 days and the group treated with the second LPS (addressed below). (3) Besides experiments using non-specific inhibitors, genetic experiments including siRNA or KO mice should be examined to strengthen and justify central suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the invaluable constructive feedback provided.</p><p>(1) In response to the reviewer's feedback, we conducted additional experiments employing appropriate inhibitors to investigate the causal relationship among the AhR pathway, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic rewiring in IS-induced trained immunity. Notably, metabolic rewiring, particularly the upregulation of aerobic glycolysis via the mTORC1 signaling pathway, stands as a pivotal mechanism underlying the induction of trained immunity through the modulation of epigenetic modifications (Riksen NP et al. Figure 1). Initially, we assessed the enrichment of H3K4me3 at 6-day on promoters of TNFA and IL6 loci after treatment of zileuton, an inhibitor of ALOX5, and 2-DG, a glycolysis inhibitor. Additionally, we evaluated the alteration in the activity of S6K, a downstream molecule of mTORC1, following zileuton treatment. Our findings indicate that AhR-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) signaling induces epigenetic modifications, albeit without inducing metabolic rewiring, in IS-induced trained immunity (Author response image 1). However, IS stimulation promotes mTORC1-mediated glycolysis in an AhR-independent manner. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG impacts epigenetic modifications. We have updated Figure 7 of the revised manuscript to incorporate these additional experimental findings, elucidating the correlation between the diverse mechanisms implicated in IS-induced innate immune memory (Fig. 7 in the revised manuscript). These data have been integrated into the revised manuscript as Figure 3D and 5I, and supplementary Figure 5I.</p><p>(2) We apologize for any confusion arising from the unclear description regarding the distinction between the group treated with IS for 6 days and the group subjected to secondary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. It is imperative to clarify that induction of trained immunity necessitates 1 day of IS stimulation followed by 5 days of rest, rendering the 6th day sample representative of a trained state. Subsequent to this, a 24-hour LPS stimulation is applied, designating the 7th day sample as a secondary LPS-stimulated cell. This clarification is now explicitly indicated throughout the entirety of Figure 1A and Figure 3A in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(3) In accordance with your feedback, we performed siRNA knockdown of AhR and ALOX5 in primary human monocytes. AhR knockdown markedly attenuated the mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6, which are augmented in IS-trained macrophages. Similarly, knockdown of ALOX5 using ALOX5 siRNA abrogated the increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels upon LPS stimulation in IS-trained macrophages (Author response image 2). Our experiments utilizing AhR siRNA corroborate the involvement of AhR in the expression of AA pathway-related molecules, such as ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTB4R1, in IS-induced trained immunity. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Figure 4E and 5G, and supplementary Figure 5H.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Epigenetic modification is regulated by arachidonic acid (AA) pathway and metabolic rewiring, but metabolic rewiring is not affected by the AA pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Monocytes were pre-treated with zileuton (ZLT), an inhibitor of ALOX5, or 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, followed by stimulation with IS for 24 hours.

This suggests that the different LPS responsiveness in IS-trained monocytes caused altered gene expression of TNF and IL6. However, the authors also showed that IS-trained monocytes without LPS stimulation showed increased levels of H3K4me3 at the TNF and IL-6 loci, as well as highly elevated ECAR and OCR, leading to no changes in TNF and IL-6. Therefore, it is unclear why or how the epigenetic and metabolic states of IS-trained monocytes induce different LPS responses. For example, increased H3K4me3 in HK2 and PFKP is important for metabolic rewiring, but why increased H3K4me3 in TNF and IL6 does not affect gene expression needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the constructive critiques provided by the reviewer. While epigenetic modifications in the promoters of TNF-α, IL-6, HK2, and PFKP (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 3C in the revised manuscript), and metabolic rewiring (Figure 2A-D in the revised manuscript) were observed in IS-trained macrophages at 6 days prior to LPS stimulation, these macrophages do not exhibit an increase in TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels before LPS stimulation. This lack of response is attributed to a 5-day resting period, allowing the macrophages to revert to a non-activated state, as depicted in Author response image 3 and 4. This phenomenon aligns with the concept of typical trained immunity.</p><p>Trained immunity is characterized by the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which is evoked by various primary insults and which leads to an altered response towards a second challenge after the return to a non-activated state. Metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming events during the primary immune response persist partially even after the initial stimulus is removed. Upon a secondary challenge, trained innate immune cells exhibit a more robust and more prompt response than the initial response (Netea MG et al. Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease. Nat Rev Immunol. 2020 Jun;20(6):375-388).</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the observation of epigenetic modifications in the promoters of TNF-α and IL-6, and metabolic rewiring prior to LPS stimulation as a secondary challenge. However, cytokine production is contingent on LPS stimulation (Arts RJ et al. Glutaminolysis and Fumarate Accumulation Integrate Immunometabolic and Epigenetic Programs in Trained Immunity. Cell Metab. 2016 Dec 13;24(6):807-819; Arts RJW et al. Immunometabolic Pathways in BCG-Induced Trained Immunity. Cell Rep. 2016 Dec 6;17(10):2562-2571; Ochando J et al. Trained immunity - basic concepts and contributions to immunopathology. Nat Rev Nephrol. 2023 Jan;19(1):23-37). The prolonged presence of higher levels of H3K4me3 on immune gene promoters, even after returning to baseline, is associated with open chromatin and results in a more rapid and stronger response, such as cytokine production, upon a secondary insult (Netea MG et al. Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease. Nat Rev Immunol. 2020 Jun;20(6):375-388).</p><p>The results in Figure 1B may be interpreted as indicating different LPS responsiveness in IStrained monocytes caused altered gene expression of TNF and IL-6. However, it is plausible that trained immune cells respond more robustly even to low concentrations of LPS. In fact, the aim of this experiment was to determine the appropriate LPS concentration.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The changes in mRNA and protein level of TNF-α and IL-6 during induction of IS-trained immunity.</title><p>Human monocytes were treated with or without IS (1 mM) for 24 hrs, succeeded by 5-day resting period to induce trained immunity.

When we consider the short lifespan of monocytes (1-3 days), the authors need to explain the validity of the experimental model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive critiques. As pointed out by the reviewer, human circulating CD14+ monocytes exhibit a relatively short lifespan (1-3 days) when cultured in the absence of growth factors (Patel AA et al. The fate and lifespan of human monocyte subsets in steady state and systemic inflammation. J Exp Med. 2017 Jul 3;214(7):1913-1923). In this study, purified CD14+ monocytes were subjected to adherent culture for a duration of 7 days in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% human AB serum, a standard in vitro culture protocol widely employed in studies focusing on trained immunity (Domínguez-Andrés J et al. In vitro induction of trained immunity in adherent human monocytes. STAR Protoc. 2021 Feb 24;2(1):100365). In response to the reviewer's suggestions, we assessed cell viability on days 0, 1, 4, and 6, utilizing the WST assay. Despite a marginal reduction in cell viability observed at day 1, attributed to detachment from the culture plate, the cultured monocytes exhibited a notable enhancement in cell viability on days 4 and 6 when compared to days 0 or 1 (Author response image 5).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the adhesion of human monocytes to a cell culture dish leads to their activation and induces the synthesis of substantial amounts of IL-1β mRNA as observed in monocytes adherent to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and collagen.</p><p>Morphologically, human adherent monocytes cultured with 10% human serum appear to undergo partial differentiation into macrophages by day 6, potentially explaining the observed lack of decrease in monocyte viability. Notably, Safi et al. have reported that adherent monocytes cultured with 10% human serum exhibit no significant difference in cell viability over a 7-day period when compared to cultures supplemented with growth factors such as M-CSF and IL-3 (Safi W et al. Differentiation of human CD14+ monocytes: an experimental investigation of the optimal culture medium and evidence of a lack of differentiation along the endothelial line.

Therefore, authors need to investigate gene expression at appropriate time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable constructive feedback provided by the reviewer. As indicated by the reviewer, the LPS-induced gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained monocytes exhibited a peak within the initial 1 to 4 hours, followed by a decrease by the 24-hour time point, as illustrated in Author response image 6. Nevertheless, the mRNA expression levels of TNFα and IL-6 were still elevated at the 24-hour mark. Furthermore, the protein levels of both TNFα and IL-6 apparently increased 24 hours after LPS stimulation. Due to technical constraints, sample collection had to be conducted at a single time point, and the 24-hour post-stimulation interval was deemed optimal for this purpose.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of protein and mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 after treatment of LPS as secondary insult in IS-trained monocytes.</title><p>IS-trained cells were re-stimulated by LPS (10 ng/ml) for the indicated time.

The authors also showed that the pretreatment of FICZ, an AhR agonist, was good enough to induce trained immunity in terms of the expression of TNF and IL-6. However, from this point of view, the authors need to discuss why trained immunity was not affected by kynurenic acid (KA), which is a well-known AhR ligand accumulated in CKD and has been reported to be involved in innate immune memory mechanisms (Fig. S1A).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive criticism provided by the reviewer, and we comprehend the raised points. In our initial experiments, we hypothesized that kynurenic acid (KA), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand, might instigate trained immunity in monocytes, despite KA not being our primary target uremic toxin. However, our findings, as depicted in Fig. S1A, demonstrated that KA did not induce trained immunity. Notably, KA-treated monocytes exhibited induction of CYP1B1, an AhR-responsive gene, and elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA at 24 hours post-treatment, comparable to FICZ-treated monocytes. This observation underscores KA's role as an AhR ligand in human monocytes, as emphasized by the reviewer.</p><p>Of particular interest, proteins associated with the arachidonic acid pathway, such as ALOX5 and ALOX5AP - integral to the mechanisms underlying IS-induced trained immunity - did not exhibit an increase at day 6 following KA treatment, in contrast to the significant elevation observed with IS and FICZ treatments (Author response image 7). The rationale behind this disparity remains unknown, necessitating further investigation to elucidate the underlying factors. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Supplementary Figure 5C.</p><fig id="sa2fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Divergent impact of AhR agonists, especially IS, FICZ, and KA on the AhR-ALOX5 pathway.</title><p>Purified ytes underwent treatment with IS (1 mM), FICZ (100 nM), or KA (0.5 mM) for 1 day, followed by 5-day resting period to trained immunity.

IL-10, characterized by potent anti-inflammatory attributes, assumes a pivotal role in constraining the host immune response against pathogens. This function serves to mitigate potential harm to the host and uphold normal tissue homeostasis. In the context of atherosclerosis (Mallat Z et al. Protective role of interleukin-10 in atherosclerosis. Circ Res. 1999 Oct 15;85(8):e17-24.) and kidney disease (Wei W et al. The role of IL-10 in kidney disease. Int Immunopharmacol. 2022 Jul;108:108917), IL-10 exerts potent deactivating effects on macrophages and T cells, influencing various cellular processes that could impact the development and stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, it is noteworthy that IL-10-deficient macrophages exhibit an augmentation in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (Smallie T et al. IL-10 inhibits transcription elongation of the human TNF gene in primary macrophages. J Exp Med. 2010 Sep 27;207(10):2081-8; Couper KN et al. IL-10: the master regulator of immunity to infection. J Immunol. 2008 May 1;180(9):5771-7). As emphasized by the reviewer, the reduced gene expression of IL-10 by IS-trained monocytes may contribute to the heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines.

Consequently, we posited that assessing the mRNA levels of IL-1β would suffice to demonstrate the induction of trained immunity in our experimental protocol. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer's comment, we proceeded to assess the protein levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and MCP-1 as illustrated in Author response image 189. These data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as supplementary Figure 1E.</p><fig id="sa2fig18" position="float"><label>Author response image 18.</label><caption><title>Modulation of cytokine levels in IS-trained macrophages in response to secondary stimulation with LPS.</title><p>Human monocytes were stimulated with the IS for 24 hr, followed by resting period for 5 days.

The authors presented convincing data on histone modification (Figure 2), but did not provide any insights in the promoter DNA methylation status.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for providing valuable comments, which highlight a crucial aspect of our study. Despite the well-established primary role of DNA methylation in epigenetic modifications, recent suggestions propose that histone modifications, particularly H3K4me3 or H3K27ac, play a predominant role in the induction of trained immunity. In this context, our primary inquiry was focused on determining whether IS, as an endogenous insult, induces trained immunity in monocytes, and if so, whether IS-trained immunity is mediated through metabolic and epigenetic modifications - recognized as the major mechanisms underlying the generation of trained immunity. It is imperative to note that our study's primary objective did not encompass the identification of various epigenetic changes. In response to the reviewer's inquiry, we conducted a brief examination of the impact of DNA methylation using ZdCyd (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine), a DNA methylation inhibitor, on IS-induced trained immunity. Our experimental findings indicate that ZdCyd treatment exerts no discernible effect on the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by IS-trained monocytes upon stimulation with LPS, as illustrated in Author response image 19. However, a recent study has shed light on the role of DNA methylation in BCG vaccine-induced trained immunity in human monocytes (Bannister S et al. Neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with a long-term DNA methylation signature in circulating monocytes. Sci Adv. 2022 Aug 5;8(31):eabn4002). Consequently, further investigations utilizing DNA methylation sequencing are warranted to elucidate whether DNA methylation is implicated in the induction of IS-trained immunity.</p><p><bold>Author response image 19.</bold></p><fig id="sa2fig19" position="float"><label>Author response image 19.</label><caption><title>The effect of DNA methylation on IS-induced trained immunity.</title><p>Monocytes were pretreated with ZdCyd (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine, DNA methylation inhibitor), followed by treatment with IS 1 mM for 24 hrs.

In the current investigation, our primary emphasis has been on glycolytic reprogramming, recognized as a principal mechanism for inducing trained immunity in monocytes. This focus stems from preliminary experiments wherein Fluvastatin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, demonstrated no discernible impact on TNF-α production by IS-trained monocytes, as illustrated in Author response image 20. Intriguingly, Fluvastatin treatment exhibited a partial inhibitory effect on the production of IL-6 by IS-trained monocytes. Subsequent investigations are imperative to elucidate the role of cholesterol metabolism in the induction of IS-trained immunity.</p><fig id="sa2fig20" position="float"><label>Author response image 20.</label><caption><title>The effect of cholesterol metabolism on IS-induced trained immunity.</title><p>Monocytes were pretreated with Fluvastatin (cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor), followed treatment with IS 1 mM for 24 hrs.

It is evident from the RNAseq data that neutrophil degranulation (Figure 5B) is the top enriched pathway. This reviewer wonders why the authors did not perform any assays on neutrophils.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for valuable comment. IS represents a major uremic toxin that accumulates in the serum of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), correlating with CKD progression and the onset of CKD-related complications, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Our prior investigations have demonstrated that IS promotes the production of TNF-α and IL-1β by human monocytes and macrophages. Additionally, macrophages pre-treated with IS exhibit a significant augmentation in TNF-α production when exposed to a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Considering the pivotal role of proinflammatory macrophages and TNF-α, a principal cardiotoxic cytokine, in CVD pathogenesis, our focus in this study has primarily focused on elucidating the trained immunity of monocytes/macrophages. Consequently, all experiments were meticulously conducted using highly purified monocytes and monocytederived macrophages derived from both healthy controls and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The reviewer's observation regarding the potential involvement of neutrophils in trained immunity has been duly noted. Subsequent investigations will be imperative to explore the conceivable role of IS-trained neutrophils in the pathogenesis of CVD. Once again, we appreciate the reviewer for their valuable comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 5C (GSEA plots): This reviewer is not sure if one can present the plots assigned with groups (eg.

In response to the reviewer's feedback, we conducted additional in vivo experiments to examine the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from IStrained mice. Upon LPS stimulation, we observed an increase in the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in spleen myeloid cells from IS-trained mice. However, no such increase in these cytokines was noted in BMDMs derived from the same mice (Author response image 22, A and B). In fact, we already observed that that the expression of ALOX5 was not elevated in BM cells derived from IS-trained mice presented in Figure 6L and M of the original manuscript (Author response image 22C).</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that trained immunity can be induced in circulating immune cells, such as monocytes or resident macrophages (peripheral trained immunity), as well as in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) within the bone marrow (central trained immunity) (Kaufmann E et al.

Trained immunity in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nat Rev Cardiol. 2023 Dec;20(12):799-811). It is plausible that central trained immunity in BM progenitor cells may not be elicited in our mouse model, which is relatively acute in nature. Further investigations are warranted to explore the role of IS in inducing central trained immunity, utilizing appropriate chronic disease models.</p><p>We have included this additional data as supplementary figures in the revised manuscript (Suppl.
