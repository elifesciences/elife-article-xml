These interactions contribute to different aspects of host physiology, including juvenile growth, a postnatal developmental process marked by rapid body-size increase and organ maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwarzer et al., 2018</xref>). Juvenile growth results from the integration of environmental cues with the organism’s intrinsic genetic potential, driven by energy and nutritional demands. Harsh environmental conditions, notably nutrient deprivation, result in linear and ponderal growth failure (i.e. stunting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nabwera et al., 2022</xref>), as well as alteration in gut microbiota maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subramanian et al., 2014</xref>), which can be mitigated by microbial interventions and/or microbiota-directed nutritional interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barratt et al., 2022</xref>). Despite some recent advances, the understanding of how gut microbes buffer the deleterious effect of undernutrition and contribute to healthy juvenile growth remains elusive.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (referred here as <italic>Drosophila</italic>) is a valuable experimental model to study the physiological consequences and underlying mechanisms of host–commensal bacteria interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Douglas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grenier and Leulier, 2020</xref>). Bacterial strains associated with <italic>Drosophila</italic> influence multiple physiological processes, including juvenile growth, and on several occasions, the underlying symbiotic cues, that is, bacterial molecules directly impacting host functionalities, have been identified. For instance, amino acids produced by symbiotic bacteria can inhibit the production of the neuropeptide CNMamide in the gut, which shape food foraging behavior by repressing preference for amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Bacterial metabolite such as acetate produced by strains of <italic>Acetobacter pomorum</italic> is necessary to support juvenile growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2011</xref>) by altering the epigenome of enteroendocrine cells and stimulating the secretion of the intestinal hormone Tachykinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jugder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamareddine et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of microbe-mediated <italic>Drosophila</italic> juvenile growth promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>), peptidoglycan (PG) fragments from <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantatum</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) cell walls are directly sensed by peptidoglycan recognition receptors (PGRPs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> enterocytes. This recognition signal, via the IMD/NF-kappaB pathway, promotes the production of intestinal peptidases, which helps juveniles optimizing the assimilation of dietary proteins to support their systemic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erkosar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, in an effort to further characterize the bacterial machinery involved in <italic>Lp</italic>-mediated juvenile growth promotion, we identified through forward genetic screening the <italic>pbpX2-dltXABCD</italic> operon as an important determinant of <italic>Lp</italic>-induced <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matos et al., 2017</xref>). The first gene of the operon, <italic>pbpX2</italic> (here renamed <italic>dltE</italic> for D-Ala-LTA Esterase, see below), is uncharacterized and annotated as a serine-type D-Ala-D-Ala-carboxypeptidase putatively involved in PG maturation cleaving the terminal D-alanine (D-Ala) residue of the peptide stem in newly made muropeptides. Remarkably, <italic>Lp</italic> PG precursors do not contain a terminal D-Ala in peptide stems but a terminal D-lactate (D-Lac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferain et al., 1996</xref>) raising the question of the biochemical activity of DltE. On the other hand, the remaining <italic>dltABCD</italic> encode a multi-protein machinery responsible for the D-alanylation of teichoic acids (TA) in diverse Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perego et al., 1995</xref>) and in <italic>Lp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nikolopoulos et al., 2022</xref>). TAs are anionic polymers localized within the Gram-positive bacteria cell wall, representing up to 50% of the cell envelope dry weight and present in two forms: wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently bound to PG, and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohde, 2019</xref>). Study of an isogenic mutant of <italic>Lp</italic> NC8 (<italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>) strain, deleted for the entire <italic>dlt</italic> operon, revealed that this operon is indeed essential to D-Ala esterification to the cell envelope (most likely on TAs) and that purified D-alanylated cell envelopes triggered intestinal peptidase expression and support <italic>Drosophila</italic> juvenile growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matos et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggested that TA modifications are important cues shaping commensal-host molecular dialog. However, which type of TAs and whether their modification is directly involved remains unaddressed and an indirect influence of the D-alanylation process on PG maturation and PG sensing by the host could not be excluded.</p><p>To address these standing questions, we investigate here the structure, the biochemical activity, and the physiological role of DltE. We also study the impact of DltE on TA structure and modifications in <italic>Lp</italic> cell envelope and test the relative contribution of purified PG, WTA, and D-alanylated-LTA (D-Ala-LTA) from <italic>Lp</italic> cell envelope to support <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth. Our results establish that DltE is not a carboxypeptidase modifying <italic>Lp</italic> PG but rather a D-Ala esterase acting upon D-Ala-LTA. After characterizing the chemical structure of LTAs and WTAs, we show that only LTAs but not WTAs are D-alanylated in <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> cell envelopes and we demonstrate that D-Ala-LTAs, in addition to PG, are direct cues supporting intestinal peptidase expression and juvenile growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the extracellular domain of DltE</title><p>DltE is annotated as a putative serine type D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase. However, sequence comparison with canonical members of this protein family revealed low sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, while the catalytic S-X-X-K motif (Motif 1) is conserved in DltE, the second (Y-X-S) and third (K/H-T/S-G) motifs that complete the active site are altered with only the catalytic Tyr and the Gly residues being conserved, respectively. This suggests a modified active site environment with potentially different catalytic and/or substrate binding mechanisms. Supporting this, we showed that the extracellular catalytic domain of DltE (DltE<sub>extra</sub> 34–397) is not able to bind penicillin although this property is a hallmark of serine type D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidases that belongs to the PBP (penicillin binding proteins) protein family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These features prompted us to determine the structure of the extracellular domain of DltE (DltE<sub>extra</sub>) by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The domain consists of two subdomains, an α-β sandwich (residues 76–126 and 246–397) that form a five strand (β1–β5) antiparallel β-sheet flanked by 5 α-helices (α2, α9–α12) and an α-helix-rich region (residues 127–245) folding in 6 α-helices (α3-α8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). DltE is structurally homologous to the D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase R61 (DDCP) from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonough et al., 2002</xref>) that exhibits the classical β-lactamase fold of PBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The positions of the active site S-X-X-K motif (<sup>128</sup>SIQK<sup>131</sup>), containing the catalytic Ser128 and Lys131 residues, and the catalytic Tyr213 from the second motif are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These last two residues are expected to function as a general base during the acylation step and function as a relay mechanism for the transfer of a proton from the incoming substrate to the departing catalytic serine. In contrast, several striking features distinguish DltE from DDCP and more generally from PBPs and DD-carboxypeptidases. The β3-strand that usually bears the third motif and defines one side of the catalytic cavity is not conserved in terms of length and position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonough et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Second, DltE contains an extra α-helix (α1) at the N-terminus of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), as well as three major structural differences affecting the regions lining the sides of the active site of DDCP and responsible for its cavity-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, e and g</xref>): (1) a 15-amino acid long loop connecting α4 and α5 in DltE (residues 175–190 named Loop I on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that replaces a longer region of 20 residues that is folded in α-helices in DDCP; (2) the mostly unstructured segment ranging from residues 328–346 in DltE and located between α11 and β3 (Loop II on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) is 10 residues longer in DDCP in which it forms an antiparallel β-sheet of three small strands that follows the main 5-stranded β-sheet; and (3) the loop between α8 and α9 (residues 257–283 in DltE) connecting the two subdomains is slightly shorter in DltE and adopts a different position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This last difference is of particular interest because this loop was described as the Ω-like loop in β-lactamases and PBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fetrow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yi et al., 2016</xref>) and shown to play a key role in the maintenance of the active site topology and in the enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The global architecture of the active site cavity of DltE is therefore reshaped and different from that of DDCP enzymes, adopting a deeper cleft topology largely opened on both sides of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>).

Intriguingly, these two molecules are anchored by an interaction network that involves eight different residues, among which are the conserved active site nucleophile Ser128 and the base Tyr213 (Ser 62 and Tyr 159 in DDCP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b and e</xref>). Importantly, the catalytic Ser128 with the hydroxyl group of its side chain positioned at only 2.7 Å away from a carboxylic group of TCEP and tartrate is ideally placed as it would activate a substrate for the enzyme acylation event as described for DDCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonough et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that the tartrate and TCEP molecule may mimic the nature and position of the natural substrate of DltE in its active site and that the acylation/deacylation step of the catalytic reaction is probably preserved in DltE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). In addition, tartrate or TCEP established a series of interactions with the structural elements specific to DltE (see above) and not found in DDCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Notably, a Tyr residue (Tyr338 in DltE) interacting with TCEP or tartrate replaces the conserved arginine (Arg285 in DDCP) in carboxypeptidases. This arginine is key for the recognition of the terminal carboxylate of the peptide substrate and the carboxypeptidase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonough et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, d and e</xref>). Furthermore, the interactions involving motif 2 and 3 that stabilizes the substrate in DDCP and in particular the penultimate D-Ala residue of the peptide substrate are also largely altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, d and e</xref>). In DltE, the hydrophobic contact with TCEP or tartrate is only maintained with the conserved Tyr213 and Gly348 of motif 2 and motif 3, respectively. Instead, residues specific to DltE (Tyr338, His347, Arg345, and Leu349) stabilize the TCEP or tartrate molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Taken collectively, our structural data suggest that DltE would not be able to recognize the D-Ala-D-Ala terminal end of a stem peptide as DDCP does and that DltE would not be a DD-carboxypeptidase.</p><p>In <italic>L. plantarum</italic> PG precursors, a D-Lac residue rather than the more common D-Ala is present in position 5 of the peptide stem with an ester bond between D-Ala<sup>4</sup> and D-Lac<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferain et al., 1996</xref>). Tartrate and TCEP molecules having chemical groups that are also found in D-Lac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we hypothesized that the DltE structural features described above could reflect its ability to act as a carboxylesterase trimming the terminal D-Lac in mature PG. However, two enzymes, namely, DacA1 and DacA2, homologous to the D-Ala-D-Ala-carboxypeptidase DacA (PBP3) of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morlot et al., 2005</xref>) could be potentially responsible for the D-Lac hydrolysis. Thus, we generated an <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> mutant deficient for <italic>dacA1</italic> and <italic>dacA2</italic> and analyzed the PG composition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>, we detected the presence of disaccharide-depsipentapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Gln-mDAP-D-Ala-D-Lac). As D-Lac residues are not detected in WT strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>), this indicates that DacA1 and/or DacA2 could behave as carboxylesterases removing the terminal D-Lac.

Substitution of Gro by Ala in C-2 position is established owing to the very unshielded GroB-2 signal at δ 5.40/75.3.

To assess whether DltE could act on WTA and/or LTA, we first characterized their structure by NMR in <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> and determined their alanylation levels. Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy analysis revealed that WTA from <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> contained two main repetition units composed of ribitol (Rbo)-phosphate chains substituted by two α-Glc residues either in C-2 and C-4 positions (major unit) or in C-3 and C-4 positions (minor unit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Remarkably, no Ala substituents were detected. WTAs purified from Δ<italic>dltXABCD</italic> were structurally identical from those purified from <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>, which supports that the DltXABCD complex is not involved in the D-alanylation of WTA. In contrast to WTA, NMR analysis established that LTA from <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> is constituted by repetitive units of glycerol (Gro)-phosphate chains that were either unsubstituted (Unit A) or substituted with either Ala (Unit B), α-Glc (Unit C) or Ala-6-αGlc (Unit D) groups at C-2 position of Gro residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Relative quantification of NMR signals associated with individual units showed that Unit A was the major form with A/B/C/D ratio of 62:19:15:4. NMR analysis of LTA extracted from Δ<italic>dltXABCD</italic> mutant confirmed the absence of Ala-substituted LTA, as demonstrated by the disappearance of GroB-2 and GroB1,3 signals, GlcD-6 signals and Ala-2 signals on the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectrum and of GroB1 to 3 signals on the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Relative quantification of signals demonstrated that LTA from Δ<italic>dltXABCD</italic> mutant consisted of a simple mixture of Unit A and C in a 70:30 ratio. Taken together, these results establish that <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic> cell envelope carries LTAs with a distinctive pattern of structure and substitution and that only LTAs are D-alanylated. In addition, these observations confirm that the Dlt machinery is necessary to the D-alanylation of <italic>Lp</italic> LTAs.</p><p>Given that only LTAs are alanylated in <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>, we started testing DltE ability to bind LTA through microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, DltE<sub>extra</sub> was able to efficiently bind LTA. Then, we examined the activity of DltE on D-Ala-LTA purified from <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>. To achieve this, we analyzed the relative amounts of Ala esterified to Gro (Gro-Ala) and free Ala released from LTA upon incubation with or without DltE<sub>extra</sub>. Both compounds were detected in the control sample as a result of spontaneous release of D-Ala from LTA when the test was performed without DltE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Upon incubation of LTA with DltE, we observed a clear decrease (56% decrease) of Gro-Ala and a concomitant increase of free D-Ala. This effect was enhanced (64% decrease) with a double amount of DltE<sub>extra</sub> in the test. In contrast, no difference with the control sample was observed for LTA incubated with DltE<sup>S128A</sup> catalytic mutant protein or with DacA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results establish that DltE possesses a D-Ala esterase activity that cleaves the ester bond between the substituting D-Ala and Gro in LTA chains.</p><p>To gain structural insights into this activity, we soaked DltE crystals with LTA extracted from the Δ<italic>dltXABCD</italic> mutant and determined the 3D structure of such enzyme-substrate complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We observe that the cleft harbors an additional, elongated density compatible with the presence of a 2-mer unit of the LTA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Half of the electron density is located at the same place as the tartrate and TCEP ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and would correspond to one unit of Gro-phosphate. It is stabilized by the same interaction network described above for tartrate and TCEP that share similar chemical groups, that is, hydroxyl, carboxyl and phosphate with LTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The second half of the electron density extends further on the catalytic cleft of DltE in the vicinity of Glu290 (in helix α9) and Tyr351 (between β3 and β4), forming thus a negatively charged subsite. The latter is not conserved in DDCP and replaced by a hydrophobic subsite that was proposed to recognize the aliphatic portion of the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6a and b</xref>). These structural features are in agreement with the ability of DltE to bind and hydrolyse D-Ala-LTA, and, together with the biochemical data, they confirm that DltE is a D-Ala esterase acting on D-Ala-LTA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The D-Ala esterase activity of DltE contributes to D-alanylation of the cell envelope and is required to sustain <italic>Drosophila</italic> juvenile growth</title><p>We previously reported that the machinery encoded by the <italic>dlt</italic> operon (including <italic>dltE</italic>) is necessary to support D-Ala esterification in <italic>Lp</italic> cell envelope and sustain <italic>Drosophila</italic> juvenile growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matos et al., 2017</xref>).

Previously, we identified through forward genetic screening the <italic>pbpX2-dltXABCD</italic> operon encoding a bacterial machinery essential to <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>-mediated support to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval growth. Here, using complementary structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we reveal that the protein encoded by the first gene of this operon (now renamed DltE) is not a <italic>bona fide</italic> PBP as it does not bind penicillin nor modifies <italic>Lp</italic> PG. Instead, we establish that DltE is a D-alanine esterase acting upon LTA. While studying its physiological function, we discovered that DltE contributes together with the other proteins encoded by the <italic>dlt</italic> operon (the DltX-A-B-C-D machinery) to the alanylation of LTA on its glycerol residues. The study of DltE’s substrates gave insights on the structure and composition of <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>’s TAs, which revealed that only LTA and not WTA are alanylated in this strain. Finally, prompted by this strain-specific feature and the importance of the <italic>dltEXABCD</italic> operon for <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>-mediated support to <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth, we identified that LTAs alanylated by the DltE/X/A/B/C/D complex (but not WTA, which are not alanylated, nor non-alanylated LTA) act as direct bacterial clues supporting <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal function and juvenile growth.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DltE and the Dlt machinery</title><p>Regardless of the initial DltE in silico annotation as a PBP (PbpX2), our structural data revealed that the global architecture of its active site cavity is reshaped and different from that of canonical PBP enzymes suggesting an alternative substrate recognition mode and/or a different substrate specificity. Hence, we show that D-Ala LTA and not PG is the substrate of DltE. Given its atomic structure and D-Ala esterase activity, DltE may rather relate to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> FmtA, a D-amino esterase acting on teichoic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rahman et al., 2016</xref>). FmtA is, however, different from DltE given that it shows residual PBP activity, is able to interact with ß-lactams, and is encoded apart from the <italic>dltABCD</italic> operon in <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome. So far, the hypothesis advanced for FmtA biological function concerns the removal of D-Ala from LTAs to make it available to transfer onto WTAs or removal of D-Ala from WTA to reset cell surface charge under particular conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rahman et al., 2016</xref>). Considering that WTA are not alanylated in <italic>Lp<sup>NC8</sup></italic>, these observations suggest that DltE possesses a distinct function than FmtA.

We posit that DltE may be involved in the control of D-Ala distribution on the LTA chains and DltE inactivation would result in impaired functioning of the whole D-alanylation machinery.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers find the use of the term &quot;direct symbiotic cue&quot; to not be fully supported by the data.</p><p>(1A) At this stage of the work it is not clear how widespread the release of D-Ala-LTA is. It is not clear if this is a response related strictly to symbionts, therefore the reviewers recommend that D-Ala-LTA is defined as &quot;bacterial cue&quot;.</p><p>(1B) The reviewers also thought that the current results are not sufficient to differentiate if D-Ala-LTA is a nutritional response or cue. We reason that additional experiments to clarify this point would make the paper stronger. We explain our reasoning here and suggest that the authors either perform the suggested experiment or change the wording while discussing the caveats of the present results.</p><p>Regarding the concerns, specifically, reviewer #2 is concerned with the lower loads of the dltE mutant in Figure 4 (and the lack of data regarding the loads in Figure 6). The effect on the larvae size and development could be a result of a possible growth defect of the mutant. A possible experiment to address this point would be one with 10X more mutants added to the food to determine if the phenotype is still the same or not. In addition, the same rationale could be applied to Figure 6, where the effect of adding 10X more ltaS mutant could be tested and compared with adding 1X mutant + 10X LTA. This would enable us to determine if the addition of more mutants or not rescues the phenotype if the response is nutritional. Moreover, if LTA is a cue and not a nutrition source adding 1X LTA or 10X LTA should not make a difference. It could be that the 1X LTA used in the experiment is already a large amount so perhaps adding less than 1X and determining if there is a lower effect on larvae size (or development) is another possibility. We acknowledge that differentiating between nutritional response and bacteria cue might be difficult, therefore we leave the option to the authors to perform these experiments or to change the wording discussing this issue and acknowledging the caveat, and adapted the text to the potential new or the current results.</p><p>2) Please respond to the question raised by reviewer 1 related to the role of DltE esterase activity and the phenotype of the corresponding mutant.</p><p>3) Data presented and written text. In some data figures, only a representative experiment is shown, all the experiments should be shown (replicate experiments can be shown in the supplement). Confirm the NMR results shown in Figure 3 and add any missing data. Regarding abbreviations, please confirm that all abbreviations and acronyms are spelled out, reduce the use of abbreviations to the minimum needed, and correct formatting errors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The results presented clearly show that DltE is an esterase that leads to the release of free D-Ala from D-alanylated-LTA. However, the results also show that dltE mutants have lower D-Ala-LTA, shown by the lower release of D-Ala from alkaline hydrolysis from whole cells of dltE mutants (Figure 4a). These results were interpreted as an indication that the esterase activity of DltE contributes to the D-alanylation of LTA, I do not understand how this is possible and did not see a possible explanation/discussion for this interpretation in the manuscript. Could it be that dltE mutants have a polar effect in the rest of the operon and that is the explanation for the lower D-alanylation of LTA in this mutant? This could also affect the interpretation of the results of panels 4b and 4c. Please clarify/discuss this apparent contradiction.</p><p>2. NMR results shown in Figure 3b need to be clarified. Legend of Figure 3b says that &quot;Multidimensional NMR analysis of LTA isolated from WT L. plantarum&quot; are shown but in the text, it is written that analysis of LTA from WT was compared with that from LTA extracted from the dlt operon mutant to confirm the absence of Ala residues in the mutant. This is an important result of the study and these NMR results need to be shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I find the work compelling. My concerns are listed below.</p><p>1. I find the use of the term symbiosis to be misleading. Symbiosis suggests an intimate association between a specific bacterium and the host, as in the symbiosis between the bobtail squid and Vibrio fischeri. The squid in that case makes the exquisite selection of its partner bacterial strain. As D-Alanylated lipoteichoic acids are not unique to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum or even to lactic acid bacteria in general (it is quite generic), it is misleading to call D-Ala LTA a symbiosis factor. Larvae similarly need RNA to grow, but we do not call it a symbiotic cue. Further mechanistic work to understand how larvae use D-Ala LTA is needed to ascertain whether or not there is any symbiotic cue provided by this specific molecule. To clarify my comment, I would find a title such as, &quot;Structure-Function analysis of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DltE reveals D-alanylated lipoteichoic acids as direct cues supporting <italic>Drosophila</italic> juvenile growth&quot; to be appropriate.</p><p>2. line 258-263 and Figure 4. There is a ~10-fold decrease in CFUs/mL in the mutants at Day 5-7, which makes sense given the cell envelope could be weakened in the mutant. This reduction in CFUs corresponds to a period of rapid growth for the larvae and the reduction in bacterial numbers presumably leads to a proportional decrease in total bacterial metabolism of the food and/or in bacterial bulk nutrition as supplied in proteins and fats etc. Is it known what decrease in growth should be expected? Does the metabolomic composition of the food differ between the bacterial mutants at days 5-7? The concern could be addressed by supplementing the food with 10x more of the mutants to see if this rescues the growth defect. These points should be considered in the text to differentiate the effects of bulk nutrition from growth promotion by a specific symbiotic metabolite.</p><p>3. Figure 5a. Why is only a representative replicate shown? What factors affect the reproducibility of absolute numbers? Could the replicates be combined after some normalization? The other replicates should at least be shown in the supplement.</p><p>Regarding Figure 6, what is the difference between panels D and E besides the addition of the ∆ltaS mutant?</p><p>Panels F and G: why is only one representative replicate shown? The data are normalized, so why are they not combined? Were statistics calculated for the aggregate of the 5 biological replicates or for the one representative replicate? Were there 3 or 5 biologial repliactes. The figure legend is confusing. All the replicates should be shown in the supplement if they cannot be combined in a single panel.</p><p>4. Figure 6d,e. Similar to point 3, all replicates need to be shown somewhere, somehow in the manuscript.</p><p>5. What are the CFUs in Figure 6d,e? This is a beautiful experiment that is critical to the findings. However, one question is whether the addition of D-Ala LTA is supporting increased bacterial growth and thus D-Ala LTA is an indirect nutritional cue. This draws the necessary and sufficient claim into question as well as the claim in the title that the role of D-Ala LTA is direct. Similar to Figure 4, quantifying the CFUs in the experiment would address this concern.</p><p>6. I am not a structural biologist, so I have not done an in-depth technical review of the structural data or arguments. This includes Figures 1-3 and the corresponding supplemental figures. Assuming the conclusions drawn from these data are correct, then I think the paper makes a nice advance in understanding the molecular biology of the cues produced by L. plantarum and sensed by <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The work builds upon a strong foundation of previous studies from the Leulier lab and makes a significant advance.</p><p>To conclude, I think the work is strong and makes a solid advance. My concerns come down to just two words, &quot;symbiotic&quot; and &quot;direct&quot;. I think the authors could remedy these concerns by modifying the writing and/or by performing additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the manuscript was interesting to reach and the data compelling. My only suggestions are in the writing- it would improve the readability and breadth of the manuscript to reduce the jargon and properly introduce words before referring to them as acronyms. Given the work intersects multiple fields it would help to better define or refrain from use unless absolutely necessary to make the text more readily understood by a broader audience. Related, the figures often leave too much up to the interpretation of the reader and more specific labeling of axes would help (for example that figure 4 is referring to larval length or time to pupation is not obvious and could be more explicit).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Abstract – LTAs WTAs used by not defined.</p><p>Intro-</p><p>L68 &amp; 71 – Ap and Lp are used for microbiome members, but not defined.</p><p>L73: should be &quot;This recognition signal….promotes&quot;.</p><p>L345: envelope is missing an 'e'.</p><p>L405&amp;406: should be 'shed' not 'shaded'.</p><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 4 – use clearer axis titles (larval length, time to pupation….). Also, 4d – not really an evolution experiment, so the legend is odd – would make more sense to say microbe abundance/CFUs over time or such (maybe just cut text to 'Number of CFUs on fly food and in larvae….). For 4d it is also very difficult to follow the different symbols per day, they are quite small and at this quality blurry – maybe use headings too?</p><p>Figure 5 and 6 – same comment about axis titles as above. Also, higher quality images are needed – perhaps increase symbols/lines in size or weight.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84669.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers find the use of the term &quot;direct symbiotic cue&quot; to not be fully supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have agree with this statement and have removed “symbiotic” in our title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1A) At this stage of the work it is not clear how widespread the release of D-Ala-LTA is.

It could be that the 1X LTA used in the experiment is already a large amount so perhaps adding less than 1X and determining if there is a lower effect on larvae size (or development) is another possibility. We acknowledge that differentiating between nutritional response and bacteria cue might be difficult, therefore we leave the option to the authors to perform these experiments or to change the wording discussing this issue and acknowledging the caveat, and adapted the text to the potential new or the current results.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers we supplemented the fly food with 10x more bacteria to test for the response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to increased amounts of bacteria. Adding 10x more WT and mutant leads to a slight increase on larval size for both strains when compared to the 1x dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>). The increase is common to both bacterial conditions. Of note, 1x WT is still more beneficial than adding 10x more mutant. This effect is reproduced at the level of the time to pupation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>). Both experiments demonstrate that the effect on growth of <italic>Lp</italic> is not a mere nutritional effect.</p><p>Regarding the association of the bacteria with <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, we inoculate 10x more bacteria and followed their persistence in the fly food. At both concentrations, there were no significative differences between the two strains at the different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1c</xref>).</p><p>We then repeated the experiment from Figure 6e with a higher concentration of purified LTA, thus we added 5x more LTA from WT or ∆<italic>dltXABCD</italic> strains. Results shown in Figure R1d clearly shows that adding more LTA doesn’t improve the growth promoting phenotype of ∆<italic>dlt<sub>op</sub></italic> and ∆<italic>ltaS</italic> when compared to the 1x LTA condition. This demonstrates again that d-Ala-LTAs are not a nutritional source but rather a signaling cue and this is the d-alanylation of LTA that act as a cue not the actual amount of LTA molecule.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(a) Larval size (corresponding to larval longitudinal length at day 6 after egg laying) (b) time to pupation (D50, corresponding to the day in which 50% of the larvae pupate) of eggs associated with different concentrations of WT and D<italic>ltaS</italic> strains.</title><p>1x corresponds to 10<sup>8</sup> CFUs while 10x corresponds to 10<sup>9</sup> CFUs.

Therefore, in this latter mutant we can rule out that the mutation results in a polar effect on the rest of the operon. Because DltES148A recombinant protein is also effectively produced and stable in vitro, we can also exclude an issue with the stability of the mutated form. Regarding the deletion mutant (D<italic>dltE)</italic>, we kept the reading frame by keeping the 2 first and 2 last amino acids on the bacterial genome. We would thus exclude a polar effect in both cases.</p><p>To explain this apparent discrepancy between the DltE enzymatic activity and the D-Ala level in the mutants, we propose that in vivo, DltE could have transesterase activity. As a protein with a classical b-lactamase fold and a catalytic motif SxxK, DltE is expected to form a covalently bound enzyme-substrate intermediate. in vitro, in aqueous solution, hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate leads to free D-Ala, resulting in the detected D-Ala esterase activity of DltE. in vivo, inside the cell wall, we propose that the acyl-enzyme may react with the hydroxyl group of a glycerol moiety of another LTA chain or inside the same LTA chain, leading to the transfer of D-Ala from one glycerol to another one, corresponding to a transesterase activity. DltE would thus be involved in the control of D-Ala distribution on the LTA chains and DltE inactivation could thus result in impaired functioning of the whole D-alanylation machinery. In agreement with this model we have preliminary results demonstrating direct interactions between DltE and DltD. Future work will focus on revealing the biological relevance of these interactions in the context of the Dlt machinery activity.</p><p>We have included the following sentence on the Discussion section (lane 399-401): “We posit that DltE may be involved in the control of D-Ala distribution on the LTA chains and DltE inactivation would result in impaired functioning of the whole D-alanylation machinery”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data presented and written text.
