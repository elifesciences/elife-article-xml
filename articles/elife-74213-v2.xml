Identifying the mechanisms synchronizing neurons in the MOB will be key to understanding how network oscillations support the coding of a high-dimensional sensory space. Here, using paired recordings and optogenetic activation of glomerular sensory inputs in MOB slices, we uncovered profound differences in principal mitral cell (MC) vs. tufted cell (TC) spike-time synchrony: TCs robustly synchronized across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, while MC synchrony was weaker and concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Synchrony among both cell types was enhanced by shared glomerular input but was independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation. Cell-type differences in synchrony could also not be traced to any difference in the synchronization of synaptic inhibition. Instead, greater TC than MC synchrony paralleled the more periodic firing among resonant TCs than MCs and emerged in patterns consistent with densely synchronous network oscillations. Collectively, our results thus reveal a mechanism for parallel processing of sensory information in the MOB via differential TC vs. MC synchrony, and further contrast mechanisms driving fast network oscillations in the MOB from those driving the sparse synchronization of irregularly firing principal cells throughout cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>synchrony</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>gamma frequency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC016560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Nathaniel N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fast network oscillations in the mammalian main olfactory bulb emerge from the dense synchronization of gamma-frequency firing among resonant tufted cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fast network oscillations are widespread in neural activity throughout the mammalian brain, including the main olfactory bulb (MOB), where gamma-frequency (~40–100 Hz) oscillations reflecting the synchronous firing of principal cells are intimately linked with olfactory learning, memory, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Ravel, 2014</xref>). Identifying the mechanisms underlying gamma-frequency synchronization of principal cells in the MOB will be key to understanding how fast network oscillations contribute to the neural coding of a complex, high-dimensional sensory space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). While decades of experimental and modeling studies have identified an important contribution of lateral inhibitory circuits to the synchronization of principal mitral cells (MCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rojas-Líbano and Kay, 2008</xref>), more complete mechanistic understanding is limited by at least three gaps in knowledge.</p><p>First, whether and how tufted cells (TCs) synchronize their firing has not been tested. Overwhelming evidence has established that TCs, a second type of excitatory MOB principal cell, differ from MCs in their intrinsic and synaptic properties, sensory responses, and axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shepherd et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nagayama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burton et al., 2020</xref>). Not only do these findings support a model in which TCs and MCs form parallel pathways encoding complementary information, but they further suggest that TCs and MCs may differentially engage in fast network oscillations. In particular, weaker lateral inhibition among TCs than MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Christie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Geramita et al., 2016</xref>) suggests that TCs may synchronize less than MCs.</p><p>Second, how gamma-frequency oscillations separately emerge across fast (~60–100 Hz) and slow (~40–60 Hz) frequency bands remains unknown. Fast- and slow-gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB are differentially modulated by state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frederick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhuang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting both behavioral relevance and at least partially distinct underlying sources. Indeed, the temporal sequencing of fast- and slow-gamma-frequency oscillations across early and late phases of the sniff cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lepousez and Lledo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manabe and Mori, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frederick et al., 2016</xref>), paralleling early and late sensory-evoked TC and MC firing, has motivated the attractive but untested hypothesis that TCs and MCs synchronize across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manabe and Mori, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mori et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, how lateral inhibitory circuits support gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB remains unclear. A large population of granule cell (GC) interneurons mediate lateral inhibition among MOB principal cells, and several studies have proposed that periodic GC-mediated inhibition opens windows of opportunity for a subset of MCs to synchronously fire across a sparse fraction of gamma-frequency cycles (i.e., a sparsely synchronous oscillation or ‘sparse synchrony’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rall and Shepherd, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eeckman and Freeman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Neville and Haberly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schoppa, 2006</xref>), paralleling pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) theories elsewhere in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). Alternative theories, however, instead point toward the capacity of correlated synaptic currents, independent of periodicity, to reset the phase of resonant neural oscillators, synchronizing periodic firing across several consecutive gamma-frequency cycles (i.e., ‘dense synchrony’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Desmaisons et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Galán et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rubin and Cleland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">David et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used paired cell-type-specific recordings in acute MOB slices together with optogenetic stimulation of sensory inputs to investigate the cell and circuit origins of fast network oscillations in the MOB. Under conditions mimicking the odor-evoked firing patterns of TCs and MCs observed in vivo, TCs exhibited robust, widespread, and enduring spike-time synchrony across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, while MC synchrony was weaker and largely concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Greater synchronization further emerged between cells with convergent rather than divergent glomerular inputs, but occurred independent of lateral excitation, which was absent among TCs. Within both MCs and TCs, spike-time synchronization correlated with firing periodicity, while surprisingly neither excitatory nor inhibitory synaptic currents exhibited detectable gamma-frequency patterning. These results, together with the observation of greater intrinsic resonance among TCs than MCs, argue that gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB emerge in large part from the dense synchronization of periodic firing among resonant TCs – findings with critical implications for the encoding and propagation of olfactory information.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiglomerular activation evokes greater gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony among TCs than MCs</title><p>To investigate the cell and circuit origins of fast network oscillations in the MOB, we recorded TC pairs and MC pairs in acute slices prepared from OMP-ChR2:EYFP mice while photostimulating olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) terminals in glomeruli at 5 Hz to mimic the physiological dynamics of sniff-paced sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wachowiak, 2011</xref>).

Cell-type differences in cross-correlogram central peaks may thus emerge from this difference in phasic vs. tonic firing alone, rather than a difference in network-driven spike-time synchrony. Excluding this possibility, however, simulated spike trains generated from independent Poisson processes with rates matching experimental firing rate patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) replicated the slow-timescale correlations observed in TC spike times but failed to replicate the prominent cross-correlogram central peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E, H and K</xref>). Indeed, isolating fast-timescale synchrony exceeding chance levels (by subtracting simulated from experimental spike-time cross-correlograms) revealed markedly higher central peaks among TCs than MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Multiglomerular activation thus evokes greater spike-time synchrony among TCs than MCs independent of firing rate differences.</p><p>Spike-time cross-correlograms further exhibited pronounced periodicity manifest in regular side peaks across TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and K</xref>) and some MC pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) but absent from simulated spike-time cross-correlograms. To directly investigate such periodic synchrony, we examined spike-time cross-power spectral density (CPSD) (i.e., the power spectrum of the cross-correlogram), which likewise revealed striking cell-type differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, F, I and L</xref>). Specifically, TC pairs exhibited consistently higher CPSD levels overall, indicative of more precise spike-time synchrony. Moreover, TC firing synchronized across both fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, often with a sweeping deceleration across each photostimulation cycle, while MC synchrony was less dynamic and largely limited to slow-gamma frequencies. As with the cross-correlogram analysis of synchrony irrespective of periodicity, these differences in gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony were independent of differences in phasic vs. tonic firing patterns, as chance levels of periodic synchrony in simulated spike trains were concentrated in sub-gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Across all pairs, cell-type differences in the precision and frequency of periodic spike-time synchrony were profound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>).</p><p>To quantify these differences, continuous epochs of periodic spike-time synchrony were isolated by detecting maximal ridges within CPSD spectrograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), similar to previous investigations of fast network oscillations in the MOB and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Roux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cenier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fourcaud-Trocmé et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">David et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">David et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis was restricted to 40–200 Hz to specifically investigate fast-timescale synchrony, and the threshold for ridge detection (ξ) was set to the 95th percentile of 40–200 Hz CPSD values observed throughout the photostimulation protocol in all pairs, ensuring that ridges reflect epochs of robust periodic synchrony. With this approach, 92%of recorded TC pairs exhibited ≥1 CPSD ridge compared to only 31%of MC pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). The cell-type differences in CPSD spectrograms thus emerge at least partially from more widespread periodic synchrony among TCs than MCs. Even when restricting our analysis to only those pairs exhibiting CPSD ridges, however, fundamental differences remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>), with TCs exhibiting both more precise and higher frequency periodic synchrony than MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q and R</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Examination of spike-time CPSD averaged throughout the photostimulation protocol and independent of ridge detection likewise supported these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>).</p><p>Of note, while we searched for CPSD ridges across a wide frequency range, epochs of periodic spike-time synchrony were nevertheless identified almost exclusively within gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), highlighting the marked tuning of MOB circuitry to gamma-frequency oscillations. Additionally, while individual pairs exhibited variable ridge dynamics, periodic synchronization at fast-gamma frequencies consistently emerged early in each photostimulation cycle, and decelerated toward slower gamma frequencies at mean rates up to 0.1–0.2 Hz/ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>As a caveat, it is possible that the differences observed in TC vs. MC spike-time synchrony reflect the artificial conditions of our experimental preparation rather than cell-type differences in network-driven synchronization poised to shape sensory processing in vivo. Specifically, it is possible that the strong optogenetic stimulus combines with the more effective sensory input and greater excitability of TCs than MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jones et al., 2020</xref>) to instantaneously synchronize TC firing (i.e., stimulus-driven synchronization). Indeed, TC firing frequently exhibited rapid synchronization following photostimulation. However, even under a barrage of predominantly asynchronous inhibitory synaptic input (see below) and following pauses in firing in one or both cells of a pair (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and J</xref>), both TC and MC spike-time synchrony persisted at levels higher than expected by chance throughout the average photostimulation cycle (i.e., up to 200 ms following photostimulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Cross-correlogram and CPSD ridge analyses further demonstrated that greater TC than MC spike-time synchrony likewise persisted throughout the entire photostimulation cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

Synchrony was, however, markedly stronger across homotypic than heterotypic pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>). Surprisingly, this enhancement of spike-time synchrony occurred independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation, as homotypic TCs – which displayed robust periodic spike-time synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) – exhibited no lateral excitation, while 100%of the homotypic MC pairs tested exhibited typically asymmetric lateral excitation matching previous accounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>).

While thus highlighting the strong lateral organization of circuitry contributing to fast network oscillations in the MOB, these results more broadly argue against a pivotal contribution of differences in intersomatic distances to the pronounced cell-type differences observed in spike-time synchrony. Similarly, while we recorded from TCs spanning the full depth of the external plexiform layer (EPL), differences in somatic depth also failed to correlate with spike-time synchrony among TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results thus demonstrate that multiglomerular activation evokes robust, widespread, and enduring synchronization of TC firing across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies and limited synchronization of MC firing primarily across slow-gamma frequencies, revealing fundamental cell-type differences that emerge across multiple analyses and cannot be explained by experimental or anatomical factors. As a caveat, the limited spike-time synchrony detected among MCs in our dataset constrains extensive characterization of the frequency of periodic MC synchronization. Our results thus do not exclude a contribution of MC spike-time synchrony to fast-gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB. However, our results do definitively identify robust periodic spike-time synchrony among TCs as a major contributor to fast- and slow-gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB, as reflected by the marked resemblance of TC spike-time CPSD spectrograms to LFP spectrograms recorded in the MOB of freely behaving rodents (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manabe and Mori, 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) exhibit distinct patterns of gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony across the 5 Hz photostimulation cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spike-time cross-power spectral density (CPSD) spectrograms averaged across all TC pairs (upper) and MC pairs (lower) expanded in time across consecutive photostimulation cycles (dashed lines).

In particular, cell-type differences in the (1) relative rates or amplitudes of synchronous vs. asynchronous IPSCs, (2) temporal distribution of IPSC synchrony throughout the photostimulation protocol, or (3) precision of IPSC synchrony may all generate differences in spike-time synchrony within the temporal gating framework. We therefore examined each possibility in turn.</p><p>Decomposition of inhibitory input into synchronous (|Δt<sub>IPSC</sub>| ≤ 1 ms) and asynchronous (|Δt<sub>IPSC</sub>| &gt; 1 ms) IPSCs enabled comparison of their relative rates, amplitudes, and temporal distributions across MCs and TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–H</xref>). In both cell types, synchronous IPSCs appeared tonically throughout the photostimulation protocol at rates greater than that observed spontaneously, but constituted the minority of IPSCs. Indeed, across all cells, the ratio of synchronous to asynchronous IPSC rates increased upon photostimulation onset to a level consistently less than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3I and J</xref>). In contrast, photostimulation evoked synchronous IPSCs with amplitudes comparable to or even larger than asynchronous IPSCs, yielding a constant ratio of synchronous to asynchronous IPSC amplitudes slightly above 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3K and L</xref>). Critically, however, neither the relative rate nor amplitude of synchronous to asynchronous IPSCs was greater among TCs than MCs. Moreover, varying the time window within which evoked IPSCs were classified as synchronous (<italic>w<sub>IPSC</sub></italic>), thus providing a measure of synchrony precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schoppa, 2006</xref>), yielded a consistently larger fraction of synchronous IPSCs (<italic>F<sub>synch</sub></italic>) among MCs than TCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>). Our results thus firmly establish that the greater synchronization of TC than MC firing does not emerge from more synchronous synaptic inhibition among TCs than MCs, refuting our first hypothesis.</p><p>To evaluate whether distinct synchronization of synaptic inhibition across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies parallels the distinct spectral patterns of synchrony among TC and MC firing, we applied an identical CPSD analysis as above to the recorded IPSC times. While multiglomerular activation indeed evoked a visible increase in IPSC-time synchrony across fast frequencies in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, F, I and L</xref>), this increase was fundamentally distinct from the increase observed in spike-time synchrony. In particular, periodic synchronization of IPSC times was weaker, spread across a broader frequency range, and less concentrated into distinct epochs than periodic spike-time synchrony. CPSD analysis of simulated IPSC times generated from independent Poisson processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) in fact revealed that the modest increase in periodic synchronization of IPSC times in both cell types could be attributed entirely to an increase in chance levels of synchrony with increasing IPSC rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Both time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>) and time-independent CPSD analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>) across all pairs supported this conclusion, with modestly higher IPSC-time periodic synchrony among MCs than TCs paralleling the modestly higher evoked IPSC rates among MCs than TCs. These results were further unrelated to any cell-type differences in the proportion of homotypic-to-heterotypic pairs (chi-squared test: p=0.073, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.2) or intersomatic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). Cell-type differences in gamma-frequency synchronization of synaptic inhibition thus do not account for the dynamic synchronization of TC firing across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies and the more stable synchronization of MC firing at slow-gamma frequencies, refuting our second hypothesis.</p><p>As a caveat, the above analyses rely on accurate IPSC detection, which can be difficult during barrages of input. However, equivalent cross-correlogram and CPSD analyses of the raw inhibitory currents recorded throughout the photostimulation protocol likewise failed to reveal more synchronous inhibition among TCs than MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results thus show that differences in synaptic inhibition among TCs and MCs do not underlie the cell-type differences in gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony. Together with the lack of gamma-frequency synchrony in excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), the minimal gamma-frequency synchrony in inhibitory inputs stands in stark contrast to the precise gamma-frequency synchronization of synaptic excitation and inhibition observed during fast network oscillations driven by temporal gating elsewhere in the brain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Whittington et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fisahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atallah and Scanziani, 2009</xref>). Consequently, while synaptic inhibition remains a necessary component of fast network oscillations in the MOB, some other cellular or circuit feature must account for the profound differences observed in periodic synchronization of TC and MC firing, motivating consideration of alternative mechanisms of gamma-frequency synchrony.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Greater oscillatory behavior among resonant TCs than MCs supports dense gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony</title><p>Previously, we used step-current injections overlaid with simulated synaptic currents to demonstrate that aperiodic synaptic input can shift or ‘reset’ the phase of roughly periodically-firing MCs to produce fast-timescale, dense periodic spike-time synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Galán et al., 2006</xref>). Whether such a phase-resetting mechanism contributes to sensory-evoked fast network oscillations in the MOB remains untested, but provides an attractive alternative mechanism whereby cell-type differences in firing periodicity (i.e., oscillatory behavior) and/or phase-resetting properties may act on comparable synaptic input to produce distinct patterns of periodic spike-time synchrony. In accordance with a phase-resetting mechanism, we therefore hypothesized that (1) oscillatory behavior among individual cells correlates with spike-time synchrony within pairs, with TCs exhibiting greater gamma-frequency firing periodicity than MCs; and (2) periodic spike-time synchrony is dense, with firing synchronized across consecutive fast- and slow-gamma-frequency cycles among TCs.</p><p>To analyze oscillatory behavior, we returned to our original dataset and first examined spike-time auto-power spectral density (APSD; i.e., the power spectrum of the auto-correlogram; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). Both MCs and TCs exhibited more periodic gamma-frequency firing than rate-matched Poisson processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), with cell-type differences in APSD spectrograms closely matching the cell-type differences in CPSD spectrograms among pairs.

Here, we uncovered profound cell-type differences in gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony among principal MCs and TCs. Specifically, multiglomerular activation evoked more widespread and precise periodic synchronization of TC than MC firing that persisted throughout the theta-frequency sensory-input cycle. TC synchrony further frequently extended across fast-gamma frequencies with a sweeping deceleration toward slow-gamma frequencies – directly mirroring MOB LFP recordings in vivo – while MC synchrony was concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Mechanistically, greater synchronization arose among cells with convergent rather than divergent apical dendrites but occurred independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation, which was selectively absent among TCs. Surprisingly, cell-type differences in periodic spike-time synchrony could likewise not be traced to any discernable difference in the synchronization of synaptic inhibition, in contrast with temporal gating mechanisms of fast network oscillations elsewhere in the brain. Instead, greater TC than MC spike-time synchrony directly paralleled the greater resonant oscillatory behavior among TCs than MCs and emerged in patterns consistent with a densely synchronous network oscillation. Collectively, our results thus argue that synchronization of periodically firing TCs, likely mediated by a phase-resetting mechanism, strongly contributes to fast network oscillations in the MOB.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fast- and slow-gamma-frequency synchrony in the MOB</title><p>For decades, the MOB has served as a prominent model circuit for investigating fast network oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rojas-Líbano and Kay, 2008</xref>).

Whether convergence of apical dendrites within the same glomerulus – engaging shared intraglomerular circuits and sensory input – enhances or attenuates sensory-evoked spike-time synchrony was thus previously unknown. Here, we have confirmed that multiglomerular activation evokes greater periodic spike-time synchrony among homotypic than heterotypic principal cells, a result with several critical implications for sensory processing in the MOB. In particular, greater synchronization of homotypic than heterotypic pairs suggests that periodic spike-time synchrony may be more important to faithfully communicating the activation of a specific odorant receptor than in binding disparate elements of a sensory input into a single percept. Moreover, the likely short vs. long synaptic integration windows of EPL-interneuron vs. GC populations in the MOB suggests that more vs. less synchronous firing among homotypic vs. heterotypic principal cells, respectively, engages interneuronal circuits with distinct computational roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burton, 2017</xref>).

Complementary lines of evidence have established that lateral excitation and not electrical coupling synchronizes the irregular 0–10 Hz firing of homotypic MCs driven by step-current injection or bath NMDA application. In particular, AMPAR antagonists (but not NMDAR or GABAR antagonists) abolish spike-time synchrony without impacting electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002</xref>). Moreover, lateral excitation amplitudes and asymmetry correlate with the strength and timing of spike-time synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002</xref>) but do not correlate with the strength of electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pimentel and Margrie, 2008</xref>). However, both the limited precision of such aperiodic spike-time synchrony (–10 to +10 ms spike-lag) and prolonged kinetics of lateral excitation (12–23 ms EPSP half-width) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Christie et al., 2005</xref>) are not obviously compatible with the rapid timescale of gamma-frequency synchrony.

Finally, as we now demonstrate, homotypic TCs exhibit robust gamma-frequency spike-time synchrony without lateral excitation. This surprising result not only points toward principal cell electrical coupling as a more likely factor underpinning fast network oscillations in the MOB, consistent with results of connexin36 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pouille et al., 2017</xref>), but further reinforces the critical importance that subcellular positioning of gap junctions and presynaptic specializations has on neural communication within the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourne and Schoppa, 2017</xref>).</p><p>How synchronization of TC firing influences the activity of MCs linked to the same glomerulus, or even whether multiglomerular activation can synchronize MC firing to TC firing, likewise remain open questions of outstanding interest.

Consistent with this prediction, spontaneous firing within homotypic TC-MC pairs exhibits less precise spike-time synchrony than spontaneous firing within homotypic TC pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ma and Lowe, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biophysical sources of intrinsic resonance and oscillatory behavior among MCs and TCs</title><p>Consistent with the contribution of phase-resetting to fast network oscillations in the MOB, intrinsic resonance supporting STOs has previously been observed in MCs both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen and Shepherd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Desmaisons et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Friedman and Strowbridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lagier et al., 2004</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Debarbieux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fourcaud-Trocmé et al., 2018</xref>), can regulate MC spike timing and firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Desmaisons et al., 1999</xref>) and phase-lock MC membrane potentials to gamma-frequency LFP oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lagier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fourcaud-Trocmé et al., 2018</xref>), and supports gamma-frequency synchronization of MC firing in multiple biophysical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li and Cleland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">David et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li and Cleland, 2017</xref>).

The greater propensity of TCs than MCs to exhibit mixed-mode bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>) and STOs suggests that TCs express homogenously high levels of slow potassium currents compared to more heterogenous expression among MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2014</xref>). Functionally, such currents promote reliable encoding of theta-frequency-patterned inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balu et al., 2004</xref>), and indeed, we observed higher levels of theta-frequency synchrony among TC than MC firing. Slow potassium currents and intrinsic resonance among TCs may thus be critically involved in communicating multiplexed theta- and gamma-frequency signals to downstream regions. Differential expression of slow potassium currents likely also influences the phase-resetting properties of TCs vs. MCs, identifying a key area for future investigation. Likewise, changes in resonance and/or phase-resetting properties by modulation of potassium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stiefel and Ermentrout, 2016</xref>) may constitute a mechanism complementary to modulation of lateral inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pandipati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li and Cleland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2015</xref>) for altering fast network oscillations in the MOB across behavioral states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sparse vs. dense gamma-frequency synchronization of MOB principal cells</title><p>Lateral inhibitory circuits are critically involved in synchronizing principal cell firing to generate gamma-frequency oscillations in the MOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lagier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lagier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lepousez and Lledo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>), though the precise mechanism driving synchrony remains contested. Temporal gating of MC activity by synchronous GC-mediated inhibition, paralleling sparsely synchronous network oscillations elsewhere in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>), is ostensibly well-supported by the purported intermittent synchronization of MC firing across a sparse fraction of gamma-frequency cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rojas-Líbano and Kay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang, 2010</xref>). However, our results instead show sustained synchronization of periodically firing principal cells – especially TCs – across timeframes consistent with several consecutive gamma-frequency cycles. This evidence of dense synchrony, together with a broader failure of our data to reveal clear temporal gating, motivates reassessment of how well sparsely synchronous neocortical and hippocampal regimes generalize to the MOB.</p><p>Examples documenting sparse synchrony in the MOB reveal phase-locked firing of individual MCs within approximately half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>) to two-thirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kashiwadani et al., 1999</xref>) of gamma-frequency cycles. While indeed evincing synchronization of individual MCs on only a subset of oscillatory cycles, this level of synchronization is unequivocally distinct from the Poisson-like phase-locked firing of principal cells within only ~5%of gamma-frequency cycles in neocortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang, 2010</xref>). MC firing at net rates slower than gamma frequencies both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cang and Isaacson, 2003</xref>) has further been taken as indirect evidence of sparse synchrony in the MOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bathellier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brea et al., 2009</xref>). However, instantaneous firing rates within spike clusters – particularly within the timeframe of theta-frequency-nested gamma-frequency oscillations, rather than averaged broadly across seconds following sensory input – do register within gamma frequencies. Indeed, consistent with our in vitro results, TCs and MCs in vivo exhibit highly periodic sensory-evoked firing specifically at fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, extracellularly recorded MOB units exhibiting strong sensory-evoked firing at the transition of inhalation-to-exhalation – likely encompassing TCs and strongly activated MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>) – phase-lock to gamma-frequency oscillations in the LFP primarily when firing at gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cenier et al., 2009</xref>), with a prevailing 1:1 spike-to-oscillatory cycle relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">David et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The preponderance of data, including our current results, thus most parsimoniously aligns with a densely synchronous regime in which gamma-frequency oscillations emerge from the synchronization of periodically firing resonant neural oscillators. Indeed, periodic optogenetic activation of MOB principal cells (predominantly MCs – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lepousez and Lledo, 2013</xref>) at rates spanning 25–90 Hz evokes a peak in MOB gamma-frequency oscillations in vivo specifically when principal cells fire at ~40–60 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lepousez and Lledo, 2013</xref>) – results in direct agreement with dense synchronization of resonant neural oscillators and orthogonal to equivalent periodic activation of neocortical principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>). Such dense synchrony amid fast network oscillations in the MOB has critical implications for how information is propagated across synapses with frequency-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oswald and Urban, 2012</xref>), another key direction for future research.</p><p>While our results provide no indication of a temporal gating mechanism underlying neural synchrony in the MOB, phase-resetting and temporal gating mechanisms are not inherently incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li and Cleland, 2017</xref>). Indeed, the reciprocal dendrodendritic architecture of many inhibitory circuits in the MOB will necessarily promote more synchronous and powerful lateral inhibition among synchronously rather than asynchronously firing principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Marella and Ermentrout, 2010</xref>), suggesting a potential avenue by which synchronous inhibition increasingly gates principal cell firing across time, particularly across slower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">David et al., 2015</xref>). A critical consideration, however, is that temporal gating mediated specifically by GCs implies phase-locking of GC firing to gamma-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang, 2010</xref>), which is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lagier et al., 2004</xref>) and cannot intuitively be supplanted by highly localized and asynchronous subthreshold release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burton, 2017</xref>).

Recordings were targeted to the medial MOB, where the MCL reliably appeared as a uniformly compact cell layer, facilitating the differentiation of cell types. MCs and TCs were differentially targeted based on laminar position of somata within the MCL and EPL, respectively, and confirmed through post-hoc visualization of Neurobiotin labeling, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>). In particular, MCs were differentiated from deep TCs if &gt;50% of their cell body resided within the MCL. Recovered morphologies are displayed with images collected at a single plane, with long lateral dendrites extending out of focus. Homotypic and heterotypic pairs were differentiated by assessment of spontaneous long-lasting depolarization synchrony in current- and voltage-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carlson et al., 2000</xref>) as well as post-hoc Neurobiotin visualization. No difference existed between recording age of MCs (25.2 ± 2.3 days) and TCs (24.6 ± 2.5 days) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.24). Cell-attached and current-clamp recordings were made using electrodes (7.7 ± 1.4 MΩ) filled with the following (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 1.8 KCl, 9 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.2 EGTA, and 0.025 Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), along with 0.2%Neurobiotin (Vector Labs). In optogenetic experiments, spike timing was recorded in cell-attached mode when possible to both minimize potential disruption of endogenous cellular physiology and to facilitate comparison of results to previous in vivo single-unit recordings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kashiwadani et al., 1999</xref>). In a subset of pairs (n = 8 TC pairs, n = 6 MC pairs), one or both cells spontaneously entered whole-cell mode, and spike timing was consequently recorded in current-clamp mode. Following each cell-attached recording, whole-cell access was obtained to verify stable resting membrane potentials (TC: –57.1 ± 4.0 mV [n = 52]; MC: –51.9 ± 2.3 mV [n = 32]) matching previously observed values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuroelectro.org/neuron/131/">https://neuroelectro.org/neuron/131/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuroelectro.org/neuron/129/">https://neuroelectro.org/neuron/129/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tripathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tripathy et al., 2015</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_006274">SCR_006274</ext-link>). In a subset of pairs, voltage-clamp recordings of photostimulation-evoked excitatory currents were additionally obtained at a holding potential of –60 mV (i.e., near the reversal potential of IPSCs), while unitary lateral excitation was examined in current-clamp recordings at resting membrane potential. Voltage-clamp recordings of IPSCs were obtained at a holding potential of +10 mV (i.e., near the reversal potential of excitatory postsynaptic currents) using electrodes (8.4 ± 1.3 MΩ) filled with the following (in mM): 123 Cs-gluconate, 3.8 K-gluconate, 1.8 KCl, 9 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 4.4 QX-314, 4.4 BAPTA, and 0.025 AF594, along with 0.2%Neurobiotin. This approach to recording IPSCs, while precluding a direct within-pair comparison of synaptic inhibition to spike timing (due to electrode solution differences), provided the greatest resolution of IPSCs while avoiding contaminating excitatory postsynaptic currents. Such consideration is particularly relevant in TC recordings, where excitatory input frequently appears as both long-lasting depolarizing currents as well as more phasic postsynaptic currents with kinetics indistinguishable from IPSCs (data not shown), reflecting the prominent monosynaptic input from OSNs to TCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Geramita and Urban, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jones et al., 2020</xref>).

For optogenetic stimulation, slices were illuminated by a 75 W xenon arc lamp passed through a YFP filter set and 60× water-immersion objective centered on the glomerular layer superficial to the recorded pair, with all field-stops fully open. Light power density exiting the objective was 1.2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The photostimulation protocol consisted of five 10 ms light pulses delivered with an inter-pulse interval of 200 ms (i.e., 5 Hz), except where noted.

Given the lack of available data on TC synchrony and potential cell-type differences, no a priori power analyses were performed to determine target sample sizes. Experiments were instead designed to encompass a comparable number of pairs as several previous studies of spike-timing computation and coincident inhibition among MOB principal cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schoppa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arevian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Giridhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schmidt and Strowbridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnson and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>).</p><p>All rates were calculated sequentially between events as the inverse of the inter-event interval, except where noted. Spike times were detected in cell-attached recordings using cell-specific current thresholds of 18–100 pA and in current-clamp recordings using a voltage-derivative threshold of 20 mV/ms, with post-hoc visual confirmation of accurate spike detection in all trials. For analyses of spike- and IPSC-time synchrony, event times were first extracted from recordings and then convolved with a Gaussian kernel (1 ms standard deviation) to account for slight differences in thresholds (for spike-time analysis) and event detection across cells. Trains of convolved event times were then mean-subtracted. Spectral and cross-spectral densities were calculated using Welch’s method (100 ms Hamming window, 95%window overlap). For each pair tested, spike-time synchrony and firing periodicity were analyzed across 10.9 ± 3.5 trials; excitatory currents were analyzed across 6.1 ± 1.9 trials; trials with spontaneous bursts of spikes or long-lasting depolarizations immediately preceding photostimulation onset were excluded from analysis. Latency to excitatory input following photostimulation onset was calculated as the first time at which mean baseline-subtracted currents deviated below 2 standard deviations of the baseline current preceding photostimulation.</p><p>IPSCs were detected using a standard template-matching function in Axograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>). Given the high IPSC rate and consequent frequent temporal summation observed, a relatively abridged template was applied, with 4.0 ms total duration, 1.0 ms baseline, 0.4 ms rise time constant, 3.0 ms decay time constant, and 0.5 ms minimum event separation. IPSCs were detected with a threshold amplitude of 2.5× the standard deviation of the baseline noise. 20–80%rise times were calculated for each detected IPSC. Decay constants could not be accurately estimated for a large fraction of IPSCs due to the high IPSC rate; therefore, decay constants were estimated by single-exponential fits to the median waveform across all spontaneous or evoked IPSCs recorded in each cell. For each pair, synaptic inhibition was analyzed across 18.0 ± 6.9 trials.</p><p>To test for unitary lateral excitation, short step currents evoking a single spike were sequentially injected into each cell of a pair across 40.7 ± 25.7 trials. For each direction, postsynaptic recordings were aligned to the presynaptic spike time using an upsampled 1 MHz sampling rate and absolute spike threshold of –40 mV to facilitate precise spike-time detection. Postsynaptic response amplitudes were then calculated as the maximum depolarization in the mean baseline-subtracted membrane potential within 15 ms of the presynaptic spike time. Electrical coupling coefficients were calculated as the ratio of postsynaptic-to-presynaptic membrane potential change (averaged across 55.4 ± 32.3 trials) following a 200–900 pA hyperpolarizing step-current injection to the presynaptic cell.</p><p>Subthreshold intrinsic resonance was analyzed in a previously collected in vitro dataset of TCs (n = 12; age: 16.3 ± 0.8 days) and MCs (n = 10; age: 16.4 ± 1.3 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton and Urban, 2014</xref>). STOs were detected using iterative semi-automated ridge detection applied to continuous Morlet wavelet transforms of subthreshold membrane potentials (isolated by linearly interpolating voltages across spikes), similar to recent in vivo investigation of STOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fourcaud-Trocmé et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, ridge detection was initialized for each subthreshold response across a broad frequency range (10–150 Hz), using a relaxed ridge threshold to capture all possible continuous STOs (ΔHz/ms ≤30). For each candidate STO, frequency was defined by the corresponding ridge maximum, and duration was defined by the continuous length of the detected ridge (surrounding the maximum) over which the instantaneous frequency deviated &lt;20% from the ridge maximum frequency, ensuring regularity in candidate STO frequency. Candidate STOs &lt; 2 periods in duration were rejected. For each remaining candidate STO, a sinusoid with matching duration was then generated with amplitude equal to the membrane potential standard deviation, offset equal to the membrane potential mean, frequency equal to the ridge maximum, and phase determined by minimizing the sum of the squared error between sinusoid and membrane potential. The candidate STO and least squares estimate-sinusoid fit were then visually inspected, and either rejected (e.g., due to irregular membrane potential fluctuations) or confirmed as an STO. This process was then iterated for the same subthreshold response by progressively refining frequency bounds to identify and visually compare all possible STOs, using both the continuous wavelet transform spectrogram and subthreshold membrane potential as guidance, with a maximum of one STO confirmed per temporal epoch.</p><p>For each statistical test, data normality was first determined by the Shapiro–Wilk test, and non-parametric tests applied where appropriate. For visual comparison of normally distributed data, all individual data points are displayed in addition to sample mean and standard errors. For visual comparison of non-normally distributed data, data are displayed as standard boxplots, with data points denoting sample outliers. For statistical tests performed across multiple individual cells or pairs, p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate and reported as p<sub>BH</sub>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers were interested in the topic, but raised a number of issues in their reviews and the subsequent discussion that preclude further consideration of the manuscript at <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. The concerns included the possibility that the synchronized stimulus may have contributed to the observed results; that the time window chosen for analysis needed to be extended; and there was a general concern that the authors had overstated what could be concluded from the results. In particular two of the reviewers that additional evidence was needed to support some of the major conclusions. The possible effects of subtypes of TCs and the role of gap junctions was also raised by one of the reviewers. The full comments of the reviewers are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Burton and Urban represents a thorough and compelling analysis of slice electrophysiology data from mitral and tufted cell pairs that highlight a unique feature of olfactory bulb population activity – that oscillations represent dense as opposed to sparse synchronizations – particularly among tufted cells. The authors also include data with new analysis from previous single cell current clamp data to show that intrinsic subthreshold oscillations entrain tufted cell firing at high and low γ frequencies, and suggest that synaptic inhibition is a mechanism through which subthreshold oscillations are synchronized across cells via phase resetting. The findings are intriguing because they provide a new perspective of what influences/drives oscillations in the olfactory bulb, which in turn, suggests a unique role of OB oscillations in encoding olfactory information and transmission of that information to the cortex via tufted cells.</p><p>While the analyses are thorough, well-presented in the figures, and explained in detail throughout the text, some of the claims of state dependence and phase resetting via synaptic inhibition and/or intrinsic properties may be over-stated without directly testing through experimental manipulations, or via modeling impacts of various forms of synaptic inhibition and/or intrinsic channel/current properties. Overall, however, although the mechanistic and causality claims could be tempered, this is a valuable and high-quality dissection of temporal firing properties between projection cell types in the bulb, with a scholarly and insightful perspective.</p><p>– In the discussion the authors conclude that their results provide evidence that link TCs and MCs to state-dependent γ oscillations. However, these data do not directly address state-dependence, and thus seems to be somewhat intriguing speculation. This could be tested with additional experiments, for example including neuromodulator agonists and antagonists, but if not tested should at least be buffered in concept without such data.</p><p>– Similarly, the authors imply that their data show that synchronous inhibition is responsible for synchronizing TCs through phase resetting. Care should be taken that this not be considered a concrete conclusion given that the current data do not show that synchronous inhibition resets TC STO phase.</p><p>Both of the above points could be addressed simply by tempering language and being more explicit about what is directly shown, and what is speculation.

The authors' main conclusions include that γ synchrony is both larger in magnitude and also faster in frequency in TCs than in MCs. The greater synchrony in TCs is attributed to their greater intrinsic resonance rather than differences in synaptic connections. The authors also conclude that TCs, due to their greater resonance, are the primary driver of synchronized γ oscillations in MOB.</p><p>The question of what drives synchronized γ oscillations in MCs of MOB has received considerable attention in the past two decades, but γ oscillations in TCs have not been mechanistically analyzed. Also, there is still disagreement in the field of what drives γ oscillations in MCs, with different studies placing varying levels of emphasis on the role of synchronized inhibitory synaptic inputs versus intrinsic cell resonance. Thus, the study is addressing important questions, and the results, if conclusive, could have a major impact in the olfactory field as well as the understanding of γ oscillations in the brain more generally. The experiments appear to be of high quality and the results are also generally well-presented. Some of the experimental results are also convincing, for example the pair-cell recordings that show that TCs and MCs do not have major differences in their inhibitory input that could explain differences in the γ oscillations.</p><p>I do however have a number significant concerns with the analysis and interpretation of results. One key overall issue is that the work, in my view, does not adequately exclude the possibility that many of the observations are due to the strong optogenetic stimulus. This concern applies both to their studies showing that TCs have more synchronized spiking than MCs (Figure 1) and also their evidence that the greater intrinsic resonance in TCs is responsible for the greater oscillatory synchrony in TCs (Figure 7). TCs display a strong, rapid phasic response to the stimulus (Figure 1), which is concerning in this respect. There are also concerns with the conclusion that TCs are the primary driver of synchronized spiking overall in MOB. While the authors may be able to show that TCs have more oscillatory synchrony than MCs (assuming caveats are addressed), such a result does not imply that TCs are driving the synchronized oscillations in MCs.</p><p>While the study is addressing important questions and some of the results are convincing, I have the following specific concerns.</p><p>1. The authors have not adequately addressed the possibility that the high level of fast synchrony in TCs does not simply reflect the response to the strong synchronized, optogenetic stimulus. The issue of course is that each cell might expected to have an initial synchronized depolarization immediately after the stimulation of OSNs. This could make the first spikes synchronized and perhaps also a few additional, later spikes if the cells have AHPs that are similar in duration. Based on the spike frequency plots in Figure 1G and 1J, TCs appear to display a strong fast phasic response to the stimulus, raising the possibility that at least some of the early spikes could be synchronized by the stimulus. There are other results as well that contribute to this concern, including the fact that MCs, which display no or little fast phasic spike response (Figure 1A, 1D), have much less spike synchrony on a fast time-scale.</p><p>The authors attempt to address this concern in part by subtracting out cross-correlograms generated from simulated data from their experimental cross-correlogams. They indicate that the cross-correlograms from the simulated data did not display fast time-scale synchrony, which they take as evidence (I believe) that the stimulus is not driving the fast synchrony. This is somewhat ambiguous to me however, and it's not clear that their method would have accounted for artifacts that could have arisen due to the somewhat imprecise nature of optogenetic stimulation. The resulting trial-to-trial variation in OSN stimulation time could have caused the first spike(s) in the two cells for a given trial to be more synchronized than spikes taken from a data set in which trial number has been randomized. In this scenario, the cross-correlogams generated from the simulated data may lack a fast peak, yet the cause of the rapid synchrony would still be the stimulus.</p><p>It would be more convincing if the authors simply showed that the pair-cell recordings displayed just as much spike synchrony in the latter part of each stimulus epoch (e.g., for spikes recorded 100-200 ms after the stimulus) as compared to just after each stimulus. The authors would additionally need to show that TCs showed more synchrony than MCs during the latter 100-200 ms period after the stimulus.</p><p>(2) The case that the greater oscillatory synchrony in TCs is due to their greater intrinsic resonance could be more strongly made. Here one issue of course is whether the subthreshold oscillations due to intrinsic cell properties that can be seen quite clearly when the TCs are directly depolarized (in Figure 6) also have an impact under the much noisier conditions following OSN stimulation. Although it may be difficult, it would be more convincing if the authors can show more directly that the subthreshold oscillations exist following OSN stimulation. An analysis similar to that shown for the direct depolarization condition in Figure 6 could be conducted.</p><p>Similar to what was discussed in Major Point 1 related to synchronized spiking, there is also a concern that the strong synchronized oscillations in TCs that they attribute to resonance could be explained by the stimulus. Do the authors obtain the same results if they restrict the analysis performed in Figure 7 to the last 100 ms of the 200-ms epoch following the start of each stimulus?</p><p>(3) The authors' conclusion that TCs are the major driver of oscillatory synchrony in MOB does not appear to be well-supported. This conclusion appears to be based just on the fact that TC oscillations are larger than those of MCs, but this does not at all mean that TCs are driving the MC oscillations (which is what I believe the authors are implying). The oscillations in the two cell types could of course be driven by completely independent mechanisms. In my view, the present study does not provide substantial evidence (direct or indirect) that TCs are driving the oscillatory synchrony in MCs.</p><p>(4) A final concern, somewhat less central but still notable, has to do with the author's conclusion that the TC oscillatory synchrony occurs at a higher frequency than that of MCs. One issue is that MC synchrony in their experiments is very small in scale, which makes it difficult to analyze. When the cell-pairs are analyzed individually (Figure 1-Supp. Figure 2B), the results of only 4 MC pairs are plotted. Moreover, when comparing the ridge frequencies of those 4 MC pairs with those of the TC pairs, there is no clear evidence for differences. Only 1 out of 4 MCs display very high ridge frequencies (&gt;80 Hz), but the fraction of TCs that display such high ridge frequencies is similarly low. A significant difference is observed in the ridge frequencies between MCs and TCs when they examine their results across their cell populations (Figure 1Q), yet it is somewhat difficult to know what this means when differences cannot be observed when MC pairs are analyzed individually.</p><p>That oscillatory synchrony in MCs is small in magnitude – and thus difficult to analyze – is also reinforced from the simple spike correlograms that the authors show for MCs (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). The authors indicate in the main text that 50% of MC pairs displayed evidence for synchronized spikes, as reflected by an R(spike) value &gt; 1.2, yet the spike correlograms are noisy enough (due to a low number of events) that it is not clear that such R(spike) values are significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Burton and Urban investigated the olfactory nerve (ON) stimulation-evoked spike-time synchrony among the two major types of principal output neurons of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) – tufted cells (TCs) and mitral cells (MCs) in slice preparations with the objective to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying the sensory-evoked γ oscillations, which reflect synchronized population activities of output neurons and have been widely observed in both fast and slow γ frequency bands in the MOB with in vivo extracellular local field potential (LFP) recordings. The methodological strength of this study include: (1) ON was optogenetically activated with minimal stimulus artifact detected in the recorded neurons such that the peak time of all spikes in the recorded neurons can be accurately measured and included for analysis; (2) firing spikes in pairs of TCs or MCs were recorded with the cell-attached mode, an extracellular recording approach at the single cell level enabling direct comparison of data with those collected with in vivo single-unit recordings in the literature. Based on these rigorous experimental approaches, they found that multiglomerular activation results in more rapid, widespread, and precise periodic synchronization of ring activities in TCs compared to MCs. Moreover, TC synchrony extended across fast-γ frequencies and showed a sweeping deceleration, which directly mirror in vivo extracellular recordings in the MOB, while MC synchrony was limited to slow-γ frequencies and less dynamic. These findings support a central role of TCs and related circuits in the generation of sensory-evoked MOB γ oscillations (especially at the fast frequency band), which are usually attributed to the synchronized MC activities temporally gated by the granule cell (GC)-mediated lateral inhibition. Further analyses suggest that differences in periodic spike time synchrony between the two major types of MOB output neurons attribute to their differences in intrinsic resonance that is more widespread and better entrains firing among TCs than MCs. No significant differences were revealed in the synchronization of inhibitory synaptic inputs among TCs vs MCs, indicating that γ oscillations are not generated due to lateral inhibition temporally gated by activities of GCs as previously perceived. Instead, the author found that inhibitory synaptic input played a key role in resetting the intrinsic resonance and phase-locked firing activities in both TCs and MCs. Overall, this work presents solid data with thorough analyses supporting their hypothesis that TCs and related circuits are the major origin of sensory-triggered γ oscillations (especially the fast frequency ones) in the MOB, challenging the classic view of MCs with the GC-mediated lateral inhibition as the main contributors.</p><p>Please address the following concerns</p><p>1. TCs in the MOB are classifies into multiple subtypes including superficial (sTCs), middle (mTCs), and deep (dTCs) tufted cells as targeted by the authors in this manuscript. Due to their different somatic locations in the EPL, the lateral dendrites of these TC subtypes are distributed to distinct laminar portions (superficial to deep) of the EPL where they very likely receive inhibitory synaptic input from different populations (superficial or deep) of GCs. Thus, the weaker synchrony of inhibitory synaptic input in the γ band among different subtypes of TCs compared to MCs as shown in Figure 5 might be because these TCs receive inhibitory input from distinct GCs while MCs may more likely receive inhibitor input from the same subpopulation of GCs.</p><p>2. Gap junctions are widely present in the MOB glomerular circuit including among MCs and TCs. The authors did not mention any potential roles of this electrical synaptic communication in spike time synchrony among MCs or TCs. Actually, this type of work to answer this question could have been done in experiments shown in Figure 5.</p><p>3.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>The manuscript by Burton and Urban represents a thorough and compelling analysis of slice electrophysiology data from mitral and tufted cell pairs that highlight a unique feature of olfactory bulb population activity – that oscillations represent dense as opposed to sparse synchronizations – particularly among tufted cells. The authors also include data with new analysis from previous single cell current clamp data to show that intrinsic subthreshold oscillations entrain tufted cell firing at high and low γ frequencies, and suggest that synaptic inhibition is a mechanism through which subthreshold oscillations are synchronized across cells via phase resetting. The findings are intriguing because they provide a new perspective of what influences/drives oscillations in the olfactory bulb, which in turn, suggests a unique role of OB oscillations in encoding olfactory information and transmission of that information to the cortex via tufted cells.</p><p>While the analyses are thorough, well-presented in the figures, and explained in detail throughout the text, some of the claims of state dependence and phase resetting via synaptic inhibition and/or intrinsic properties may be over-stated without directly testing through experimental manipulations, or via modeling impacts of various forms of synaptic inhibition and/or intrinsic channel/current properties. Overall, however, although the mechanistic and causality claims could be tempered, this is a valuable and high-quality dissection of temporal firing properties between projection cell types in the bulb, with a scholarly and insightful perspective.</p><p>-In the discussion the authors conclude that their results provide evidence that link TCs and MCs to state-dependent γ oscillations. However, these data do not directly address state-dependence, and thus seems to be somewhat intriguing speculation. This could be tested with additional experiments, for example including neuromodulator agonists and antagonists, but if not tested should at least be buffered in concept without such data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this conclusion in the original manuscript was speculative and not explicitly supported by the data.

In particular, while the sum of our evidence strongly points toward a phase-resetting mechanism of γ-frequency spike-time synchrony, similar to mechanisms we have previously proposed (Galán et al., 2006), we did not directly demonstrate that neurons are synchronized by synaptic inhibition resetting their periodic firing phase. This lack of direct demonstration in part reflects the majority of our data comprising cell-attached recordings, and in part reflects the difficulty of pinpointing such causality, which may be best accomplished in a complementary study combining modeling and pharmacological manipulation, as the reviewer suggests. We have thus amended the conclusions throughout our new submission to more clearly state what the data directly demonstrates, and what may be likely as a result. For example:</p><p>“Collectively, our results thus argue that synchronization of periodically-firing TCs, likely mediated by a phase-resetting mechanism, strongly contributes to fast network oscillations in the MOB.” (Discussion, lines 509-510)</p><p>In addition, in focusing primarily on the dense γ-frequency synchronization of tufted cells, we have substantially restructured our new submission such that examination of subthreshold oscillations is only presented as a complementary assessment of oscillatory behavior/tendency:</p><p>“That TCs exhibit greater oscillatory behavior than MCs despite comparable synaptic input following multiglomerular activation suggests that the intrinsic biophysical properties of TCs yield greater tendency toward oscillatory behavior (i.e., resonance) than the biophysical properties of MCs.

However, we agree that this topic is of great interest and merits further thought and investigation. Toward this end, we have included the following discussion in our new submission:</p><p>“How synchronization of TC firing influences the activity of MCs linked to the same glomerulus, or even whether multiglomerular activation can synchronize MC firing to TC firing, likewise remain open questions of outstanding interest. TCs can laterally excite MCs linked to the same glomerulus (Pimentel and Margrie, 2008; Najac et al., 2011), which not only underscores the surprising absence of lateral excitation between homotypic TCs, but also suggests that homotypic TC-MC pairs may parallel homotypic MC pairs in exhibiting synchronous irregular firing but more limited γ-frequency synchrony. Consistent with this prediction, spontaneous firing within homotypic TC-MC pairs exhibits less precise spike-time synchrony than spontaneous firing within homotypic TC pairs (Ma and Lowe, 2010).” (Discussion, lines 602-610)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] While the study is addressing important questions and some of the results are convincing, I have the following specific concerns.</p><p>1.

As stated above, this lack of explicit demonstration in part reflects the majority of our data comprising cell-attached recordings, and in part reflects the difficulty of pinpointing such causality without the ability to selectively manipulate synaptic synchrony and/or subthreshold oscillations. Review of the minority of tufted cell pairs in which spiking activity evoked by multiglomerular activation was recorded in current-clamp mode further revealed either essentially continuous periodic firing or periodic firing interposed with subthreshold epochs strongly contaminated by synaptic activity, precluding the direct analysis of subthreshold oscillations suggested by the reviewer. We have thus amended the conclusions throughout our new submission to more clearly state what the data directly demonstrates, and what may be likely as a result.

Moreover, we now explicitly state:</p><p>“How synchronization of TC firing influences the activity of MCs linked to the same glomerulus, or even whether multiglomerular activation can synchronize MC firing to TC firing, likewise remain open questions of outstanding interest.” (Discussion, lines 602-604)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A final concern, somewhat less central but still notable, has to do with the author's conclusion that the TC oscillatory synchrony occurs at a higher frequency than that of MCs. One issue is that MC synchrony in their experiments is very small in scale, which makes it difficult to analyze. When the cell-pairs are analyzed individually (Figure 1-Supp. Figure 2B), the results of only 4 MC pairs are plotted. Moreover, when comparing the ridge frequencies of those 4 MC pairs with those of the TC pairs, there is no clear evidence for differences. Only 1 out of 4 MCs display very high ridge frequencies (&gt;80 Hz), but the fraction of TCs that display such high ridge frequencies is similarly low. A significant difference is observed in the ridge frequencies between MCs and TCs when they examine their results across their cell populations (Figure 1Q), yet it is somewhat difficult to know what this means when differences cannot be observed when MC pairs are analyzed individually.</p><p>That oscillatory synchrony in MCs is small in magnitude – and thus difficult to analyze – is also reinforced from the simple spike correlograms that the authors show for MCs (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). The authors indicate in the main text that 50% of MC pairs displayed evidence for synchronized spikes, as reflected by an R(spike) value &gt; 1.2, yet the spike correlograms are noisy enough (due to a low number of events) that it is not clear that such R(spike) values are significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the limited occurrence and precision of mitral cell synchrony in our dataset, our new submission focuses more on the widespread and robust tufted cell spike-time synchrony across fast- and slowgamma frequency oscillations than on the frequency differences between MC and TC synchrony. We believe this new focus is not only more concretely supported by the data, as the reviewer notes, but also still highlights a novel and important finding. Moreover, we now explicitly describe the issue raised by the reviewer as an important caveat to consider:</p><p>“As a caveat, the limited spike-time synchrony detected among MCs in our dataset constrains extensive characterization of the frequency of periodic MC synchronization. Our results thus do not exclude a contribution of MC spike-time synchrony to fast-γ-frequency oscillations in the MOB. However, our results do definitively identify robust periodic spike-time synchrony among TCs as a major contributor to fast- and slow-γ frequency oscillations in the MOB.” (Results, lines 255-260)</p><p>In specific response to the concerns regarding the per-pair plot of spike-time CPSD ridge attributes (original submission: Figure 1 —figure supplement 2B; new submission: Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A): this plot was not clearly described in our original submission. In this plot, each point denotes the ridge attributes detected within each of the MC pairs and TC pairs exhibiting spike-time CPSD ridges above the established threshold. Thus, in our original submission, this included only 4 of the 14 MC pairs, as spike-time CPSD ridges were detected in only a small fraction of all MC pairs recorded. In our new submission (containing additional data), this plot now includes 5 of 16 MC pairs and 24 of 26 TC pairs and is more clearly captioned:</p><p>“Distribution of ridge CPSD vs. frequency for the 5/16 MC pairs and 24/26 TC pairs exhibiting spiketime CPSD ridges. Ellipses denote mean ± standard deviation of CPSD and frequencies across all ridges detected in each pair.” (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 caption, lines 1169-1170)</p><p>In addition to clearer description, we have also reformatted the plot itself for greater visual clarity. We believe the plot now more clearly shows strong cell-type differences in periodic synchrony: 4 of the 5 MC pairs plotted are concentrated in low-γ frequencies, in strong contrast to the numerous TC pairs concentrated throughout fast-γ frequencies. Both MCs and TCs also have a single pair exhibiting periodic synchrony at frequencies exceeding fast-γ frequencies, as noted by the reviewer and underscoring the now explicitly stated caveat.</p><p>Finally, given the limited resolution of the <italic>R<sub>spike</sub></italic> metric in quantifying periodic synchrony across faster frequencies, we have removed this analysis from our new submission and instead focused on cross correlogram and CPSD analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Burton and Urban investigated the olfactory nerve (ON) stimulation-evoked spike-time synchrony among the two major types of principal output neurons of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) – tufted cells (TCs) and mitral cells (MCs) in slice preparations with the objective to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying the sensory-evoked γ oscillations, which reflect synchronized population activities of output neurons and have been widely observed in both fast and slow γ frequency bands in the MOB with in vivo extracellular local field potential (LFP) recordings.

Thus, the weaker synchrony of inhibitory synaptic input in the γ band among different subtypes of TCs compared to MCs as shown in Figure 5 might be because these TCs receive inhibitory input from distinct GCs while MCs may more likely receive inhibitor input from the same subpopulation of GCs.</p></disp-quote><p>In our new submission, we test whether within-pair differences in TC somatic depth correlate with either cross-correlogram or CPSD analyses of IPSC-time synchrony, and observe no clear relationship (Figure 6 —figure supplement 7). Our results thus suggest that differences in TC subtype among paired recordings do not contribute to the overall minimal levels of γ-frequency IPSC-time synchrony recorded. We likewise include equivalent analysis across measures of spike-time synchrony, and again observe no clear relationship (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). In both of these figures, we additionally plot the depth of each recorded TC to more transparently document the specific TC subtypes recorded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Gap junctions are widely present in the MOB glomerular circuit including among MCs and TCs. The authors did not mention any potential roles of this electrical synaptic communication in spike time synchrony among MCs or TCs. Actually, this type of work to answer this question could have been done in experiments shown in Figure 5.</p><p>3. Evidence shows chemical synaptic connections among apical dendrites of MCs and TCs or between TCs and MCs. What roles do these dendrodendritic synaptic transmissions potentially play in spike time synchrony among TCs or MCs?</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate the role of intraglomerular signaling, particularly among principal tufted cells (in which lateral excitation was previously unexplored), we have performed additional recordings to bring our total number of homotypic tufted cell pairs and homotypic mitral cell pairs to 11 and 4, respectively.</p><p>With the addition of this new data, we find lateral excitation (typically asymmetric) among all homotypic mitral cell pairs assayed, matching previous reports. Surprisingly, however, lateral excitation was completely absent among homotypic tufted cells, even while mitral cell pairs and tufted cell pairs exhibited comparable electrical coupling. Thus, the stronger γ-frequency spike-time synchrony observed among tufted cells emerges independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation. Moreover, given the stronger γ-frequency spike-time synchrony observed among homotypic than heterotypic pairs in our dataset, independent of cell type, our results now further suggest that some other mode of intraglomerular signaling – likely including electrical coupling – enhances fast network oscillations in the olfactory bulb. These results are now extensively documented in our new submission (RESULTS, lines 198-233; Figure 3). In addition, we discuss the circuit and computational implications of these results in a new section of the DISCUSSION: “Mechanisms and functions of intraglomerular enhancement of spike-time synchrony” (Discussion, lines 563-610).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please provide more details on how dTCs and MCs are preselected and differentiated. Authors described in the Method section that cell-types were identified by their somatic location in the laminar layer of the MOB. But the cell body locations of dTCs and MCs are practically difficult to determine and differentiate in slice preparations.</p></disp-quote><p>In our new submission, we more clearly describe:</p><p>“Recordings were targeted to the medial MOB, where the MCL reliably appeared as a uniformly compact cell layer, facilitating the differentiation of cell types. MCs and TCs were differentially targeted based on laminar position of somata within the MCL and EPL, respectively, and confirmed through post-hoc visualization of Neurobiotin labeling, as previously described (Burton and Urban, 2014). In particular, MCs were differentiated from deep TCs if &gt;50% of their cell body resided within the MCL.” (Materials And Methods, lines 729-734).</p><p>In addition, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 7 now explicitly plot the depth of each recorded TC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
