The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger &lt;30 (y)ears old and older &gt;55 y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as <italic>SATB1</italic>. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein <italic>GJB6</italic> increased with age, and modulation of <italic>GJB6</italic> expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the main risk factors for breast cancers is aging. But how exactly aging contributes to breast cancer is not fully understood. The mammary gland is the part of the breast that can produce milk, and is composed of two major cell types: luminal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells. Most age-related breast cancers are thought to originate from luminal epithelial cells, but some age-related changes in myoepithelial cells may also cause cancer. These changes in breast epithelial cells vary across individuals, which may explain why some individuals are at a higher risk for breast cancer than others.</p><p>Studying age-related changes in luminal and myoepithelial cells may help scientists pinpoint what causes age-related breast cancers. It may also help scientists to  identify those at high risk for breast cancer, or develop alternative treatments. It could also help prevent breast cancers from occuring, getting worse or coming back. Studying age-related changes in gene expression in these two types of breast epithelial cells is the first step.</p><p>Sayaman et al. showed that aging leads to widespread changes in the genes expressed by luminal and myoepithelial cells. The researchers compared luminal and myoepithelial cells from breast tissue samples taken from postmenopausal women older than 55 years and premenopausal women younger than 30 years. Their experiments and analyses revealed that age-related gene expression changes reduced the cells' ability to maintain their identity and function over time. Many of the age-related expression changes occurred in cancer-linked genes.</p><p>Sayaman et al. found luminal and myoepithelial cells had increasingly varied gene expression among older women compared to younger women. Specifically, they saw changes in genes that helped these cells communicate, essentially changing the message relayed from myoepithelial cells to the neighboring luminal cells. The experiments further revealed  large increases and decreases in gene expression with age in luminal cells but not in myoepithelial cells. Most of these age-related changes in luminal cells were linked to genes that play a role in cancer development.</p><p>These findings suggest that age-related changes make luminal cells more prone to becoming cancerous. Sayaman et al. also developed machine learning algorithms to identify age-related gene expression patterns that may distinguish tumor cells from normal breast tissue. More research in larger populations will help confirm the results. But if these efforts are successful, they may one day help clinicians identify women at risk of age-related breast cancers, detect cancers early, or create personalized prevention or treatment approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>cancer susceptibility</kwd><kwd>gene expression variance</kwd><kwd>lineage fidelity</kwd><kwd>lumininal epithelia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA221709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sayaman</surname><given-names>Rosalyn W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01CA279498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sayaman</surname><given-names>Rosalyn W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA244109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33AG059206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EB024989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA237602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BC141351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BC181737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaBarge</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000910</institution-id><institution>Conrad N.

Stereotypical changes appear directional to the observer and are apparent at different physiologic scales, for example phenotypically though wrinkling, graying hairs, and increasing frailty; cellularly through increasing organ dysfunction, and loss of bone density, muscle mass and fat pads; and molecularly through decreasing levels of androgens and estrogens, and the upregulation or downregulation of gene or protein levels. Age-associated directional changes in transcriptomes of whole tissues are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Magalhães et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glass et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Volkova et al., 2005</xref>). These directional molecular changes explain, at least in part, the noticeable phenotypic changes that accompany aging. However, although increased susceptibility to a plethora of diseases, including cancers, is a prominent consequence of aging, the emergence and onset of diseases vary among same-aged individuals. Indeed, variance in gene expression between individuals arises in the contexts of tumors, diet, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bashkeel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brinkmeyer-Langford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Viñuela et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that this variability among individuals may itself be an important molecular phenotype of aging, and individuals with outlier expression profiles provide an avenue for understanding biological processes that explain the differences in cancer susceptibility between individuals as they age.</p><p>The breast is an excellent model system for examining aging at the cellular and molecular levels because normal tissue from individuals spanning the adult lifespan is available from common cosmetic and prophylactic surgeries. Cultured pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) support growth of breast epithelial cell lineages from women across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garbe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Labarge et al., 2013</xref>) and enable detailed, reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stampfer et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, there are well-established lineage-specific markers and cell-sorting protocols that facilitate experimentation at lineage-specific resolution. Furthermore, breast tissue provides an ideal model for studying aging-associated cancer susceptibility as 82% of new breast cancers are diagnosed in women ≥ 50 y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DeSantis et al., 2019</xref>). Directional changes in gene expression with age have been reported in whole breast tissue, including changes associated with biological processes involved in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee and Lee, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yau et al., 2007</xref>). However, aging is also associated with significant shifts in proportions of breast cell lineages, including epithelial and stromal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garbe et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is unclear how tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging reflect changes in cell-intrinsic and microenvironment states. Lineage-specific analyses are needed to unravel such mechanisms.</p><p>The mammary epithelium, the origin of breast carcinomas, is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages—myoepithelial cells (MEPs) and luminal epithelial cells (LEPs). MEPs are basally located and contractile and have tumor suppressive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pandey et al., 2010</xref>). Luminal epithelial cells (LEPs) are apically located and include subpopulations of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) secretory cells, which represent 80–95% of luminal cells in breast tissue, and ER positive cells (ER+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth and Smith, 2006</xref>). We previously demonstrated loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia as an aging phenomenon—in which the faithfulness of expression of established lineage-specific markers diminishes with age without loss of the lineage-specificity of other canonical markers nor of the gross phenotypic and histological differences between LEPs and MEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyano et al., 2017</xref>). Although our earlier work focused on a few select LEP-specific and MEP-specific markers, we hypothesized that the aging mechanisms we observed could impinge upon genome-wide maintenance of lineage fidelity and could thus be potential drivers of susceptibility to cancer initiation in breast tissue.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. Directional responses reflect stereotyped changes associated with upregulation or downregulation of gene expression between younger and older cohorts; variant responses reflect increases in gene expression variance within a cohort associated with the heterogeneity of individuals within a group. Through transcriptomic profiling of primary LEPs and MEPs, we found that loss of lineage fidelity in gene expression with age was a genome-wide phenomenon. We identified two models mediating loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia with age: (i) via directional changes identified through differential expression (DE) analysis; and (ii) via an increase in variances identified through differential variability (DV) analysis. Age-dependent DE explained part of the observed loss of lineage fidelity, while our model of the overall increase in variances with age also accounted for a comparable fraction of this loss. Directional changes in expression with age strikingly occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells, whereas changes in variance were found in both lineages. Genome-wide directional changes in gene expression in LEPs involved dysregulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as <italic>SATB1</italic> with age. We also detected this dysregulation in bulk tissue that consist of all lineages of the stroma and epithelia. Loss of lineage fidelity led to enrichment of genes and biological processes commonly dysregulated in cancers, and altered the LEP-MEP interactome that was significantly modulated by apical cell-cell junction proteins, such as <italic>GJB6</italic>. Modulating <italic>GJB6</italic> expression via shRNA in MEPs was sufficient to reduce the rate of molecular aging of adjacent LEPs as determined with a breast-specific biological clock. Using machine learning, we showed that genes that had age-dependent directional and variable changes in normal LEPs had predictive value in distinguishing normal breast tissue from breast cancers and in classifying breast cancer PAM50 subtypes. Age-dependent changes in LEPs reflected dysregulation of biological processes that are convergent with breast cancer. The degree and variability of age-dependent changes across individuals may explain the differential susceptibility between individuals to breast cancer initiation, and to the development of specific breast cancer subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide loss of lineage-specific expression in breast epithelia with age</title><p>Mammary glands are bilayer structures consisting of Keratin 19 (KRT19)-positive LEPs surrounded by KRT14-positive contractile MEPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We further interrogated the Nee et al. dataset which included women who have undergone chemotherapy as well as women who carry <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations. We found chemotherapy increased the magnitude of enrichment of the old LEP signature in Basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left panel). Interpreting this shift was challenging until pathways related to aged luminal cells were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Basal cells appeared to be most sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy or to potentially have the most durable perturbations (time since treatment was not reported) to pathways related to MYC, G2/M checkpoints, and p53. Our findings lend further credence to loss of lineage fidelity and accelerated aging in women with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations as Luminal1 cells from these women did not look as young as their age-matched average risk counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right panel) and resembled menopausal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Parity and obesity are often discussed in the context of breast cancer susceptibility. To address how they may affect the aging signature, we used the Murrow et al. dataset. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that enrichment of the aging LEP gene expression signature in Luminal and Basal compartments was minimally affected by parity or obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), reinforcing our findings in bulk tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the aging signature we developed from enriched LEPs extends to single-cell studies of epithelial cell types and provides valuable insight towards analysis of these datasets.

Indeed, in our prior work, we showed that <italic>ELF5</italic> expression was dynamic and responsive to age-dependent microenvironment changes and expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> and published <italic>ELF5</italic>-target genes showed age-dependent correlation in LEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyano et al., 2017</xref>), and that <italic>ELF5</italic> served as an independent biological clock in breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Miyano et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>ELF5</italic> was downregulated in younger LEPs when co-cultured on apical surfaces of older MEPs for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), concordant with the observed phenomenon of <italic>ELF5</italic> downregulation in LEPs with age.</p><p>A key part of our variant responses hypothesis is that tuned windows of expression is essential for proper function, and deviations either up or down from this range in older individuals could lead to aging-dependent dysregulation. Thus, selective KD of upregulated genes or overexpression of downregulated genes in specific MEP samples that show outlier expression would be ideal; however, as tuning windows of expression are difficult to achieve experimentally by overexpression, our co-culture experiments focused on KD of DV genes in specific old MEP samples where we see upregulated expression above the 75% quantile distribution in young MEP samples. Thus, we asked whether knockdown or inhibition of <italic>GJB6</italic> expression in the older MEPs with the highest expression, relative to younger MEPs, could restore proper signaling between LEPs and MEPs. To test this, we used our established heterochronous co-culture system and measured recovery of LEP expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> as a readout of biological age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). MEP cell strains used in KD experiments were specifically selected to be the samples from older women with ~two-fold increase expression of GJB6 that were above the 75% quantile distribution of GJB6 expression in young MEP.</p><p>If bringing variant <italic>GJB6</italic> under tighter control prevents chronologically older MEPs from imposing older biological ages in younger LEPs, then <italic>ELF5</italic> levels should not decrease in co-culture. LEPs from younger women were co-cultured for 10 days on older MEPs treated with either shGJB6 or scramble shRNA (shCtrl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When co-cultured on top of older MEP-shGJB6 relative to older MEP-shCtrl, LEPs maintained expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> at higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), consistent with the higher expression levels in younger women. LEP-expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> likewise showed a stepwise (although non-significant) increase when older MEP feeder layers were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of a non-specific gap junction inhibitor 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (18αGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, reducing <italic>GJB6</italic> expression in older MEPs that overexpressed <italic>GJB6</italic> relative to younger MEPs prevented these older MEPs from imposing an older biological age on co-cultured younger LEPs as determined by <italic>ELF5</italic> expression. Based on these results, we propose that variance is a driver of stereotypical aging phenotypes at the tissue level, and that constraining specific changes caused by an increase in molecular noise during aging, such as in cell-cell communication nodes, may prevent the spread of age-related cues within epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs shape predictors of normal breast tissue and PAM50 subtypes</title><p>We propose that aging mechanisms operate through at least two distinct pathways: (i) General dysregulatory mechanisms, which are reflected in directional age-dependent changes that share common features with known cancer mechanisms. These changes contribute to an increased overall susceptibility to cancer as individuals age. (ii) Individual-specific dysregulatory mechanisms, which are identified by variations in aged populations. These variations may help explain why certain individuals have greater vulnerability to cancer (not all aged individuals develop cancer) and why those who do develop cancer develop specific subtypes.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering and machine learning (ML) algorithms can effectively capture the influence of DV genes. It is worth noting that even DE genes inherently exhibit variability. We suggest that by integrating the variability in aging responses, we can gain further insights that not only enable the identification of key branching points in clustering and the most relevant age-dependent biomarkers in classification but also help explain the varying susceptibility of individuals to specific breast cancer subtypes. Indeed, we found that 98% of age-dependent DE and DV genes in LEPs (580 of 589 genes in the TCGA cohort) were differentially expressed between PAM50 intrinsic subtypes (KW BH adj. p&lt;0.05, post hoc Wilcoxon BH adj. p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1A and B</xref>). When we further analyzed the median expression of DE and DV genes across PAM50 LumA, LumB, Her2, and Basal subtypes, we found differential distribution of median expression across subtypes (Fisher’s exact test Bonferroni adj. p&lt;0.05). (i) The largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in younger LEPs had the highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes. (ii) The largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in older LEPs had highest expression in LumA and lowest expression in Basal subtypes. And (iii), the largest fraction of DV genes with higher variance in older LEP had highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes. In contrast (iv), DV genes that had higher variance in younger LEPs showed no association between subtype and median expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Our GSEA and literature review of genes that showed age-dependent changes in LEPs revealed enrichment for pathways and genes commonly dysregulated in breast cancers. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of TCGA primary tumor and matched normal samples (n=1201) based on expression of LEP-derived age-dependent DE and DV genes (k=589 genes) in the TCGA cohort identified four main sample clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>): (i) cluster 1 represented predominantly by PAM50 LumA and Her2 breast cancer subtypes; (ii) cluster 2 by PAM50 LumB and LumA subtypes; (iii) cluster 3 by PAM50 Basal subtype; and (iv) cluster 4 by matched normal samples. This suggests that age-dependent changes in LEPs may reflect dysregulation of biological processes that play a role in tumor initiation in normal tissue and in the etiology of breast cancer subtypes. We therefore assessed whether DE and DV genes that change in LEPs with age can be used as biomarkers that can classify normal tissue from cancer and predict breast cancer subtypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs shape predictors of normal breast tissue and PAM50 subtypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of TCGA samples from matched normal and primary tumor tissue based on expression of age-dependent DE and DV genes identified in LEPs (adj. p&lt;0.05).

Transcriptomic changes lead to a loss in lineage fidelity with age where faithfulness of lineage-specific expression is diminished. This is seen via the genome-wide loss of tuned windows of expression of lineage-specific genes and decrease in the magnitude of differential expression between the genes that define LEPs and MEPs. Our approach delineated the contribution of each epithelial lineage and identified two models mediating loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia with age—either via directional changes, as measured by differential gene expression, or via an increase in variance, as measured by differential variability analysis. Aging-dependent expression variances occurred in both lineages, whereas the overwhelming majority of directional expression changes with age occurred in LEPs. This is a striking finding when one considers the two lineages arise from common progenitors, and that their juxtaposition in tissue allows for direct cell-cell communication.</p><p>We hypothesize that LEPs are the nexus of integration for variant responses that lead to stereotyped directional age-dependent outcomes in mammary gland. This is likely the result of a dynamic process of iterative feedback between LEPs and MEPs, as well as other cell types in the breast. LEPs from older women still maintained canonical LEP-specific features but exhibited genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity that implicated dysregulation of genes with known roles in breast cancer. This suggests that susceptibility to cancer entails loss of proper specification of the luminal lineage, and that age-dependent molecular changes in LEPs contributes to this loss. Age-dependent directional changes in LEPs were detectable in bulk tissue and implicated downregulation of chromatin and genome organizers, such as <italic>SATB1</italic>, suggesting means by which loss of lineage fidelity may be perpetuated genome-wide. The pathways affected by transcriptomic changes during aging were commonly linked with breast cancer, and the age-dependent changes in LEPs reflected relevant biology that distinguished normal tissue from breast cancers and predicted PAM50 breast cancer subtypes. Together our findings illustrate how age-dependent changes in LEPs contribute to the aging biology of breast tissue, and we propose that this biology reflects dysregulation convergent with processes associated with breast cancers.</p><p>Studies of gene expression during aging in human tissues have been largely restricted to analysis of bulk tissue lacking in cell-type-specific resolution and have been focused on directional changes with age using DE analysis. Bulk analyses make it impossible to separate effects of aging that are driven by the intrinsic changes that occur molecularly within each lineage vs. compositional changes that reflect shifts in cell type proportions. Lineage-specific analyses provide intermediate resolution between bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq and allow for cost effective analysis of cell population-level responses and interactions. As such, lineage-resolution analyses also provide an avenue to validate computational deconvolution methods that have emerged to extract cell-type-specific contributions in bulk tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shen-Orr and Gaujoux, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Titus et al., 2017</xref>). We provided evidence that breast tissue-level changes with age are driven not just by changing compositions of the breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garbe et al., 2012</xref>), but by intrinsic molecular changes in the underlying cell populations. Indeed, while bulk tissue expression reflects cellular heterogeneity, we were able to identify age-dependent changes in bulk tissue that mirror the DE in LEPs with age, suggesting that LEPs contribute, if not drive, certain emergent properties of breast tissue.</p><p>These findings were further validated in our analysis of existing scRNA-seq studies of non-tumorigenic primary breast tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murrow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pal et al., 2021</xref>). We showed that our LEP-derived aging signature developed from lineage-specific RNA-sequencing captured aging biology of epithelial cell types at the single-cell level, with genes upregulated in older LEPs enriched in Luminal1 cells from the menopausal cohort and genes upregulated in younger LEPs enriched in Luminal1 cells from the premenopausal cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pal et al., 2021</xref>). We further showed that our LEP-derived aging signature was enriched in women who had received chemotherapy and those with increased risk of developing breast cancer, lending further support to earlier findings of accelerated aging phenotypes in these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shalabi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Siddique et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the age-related decline in lineage fidelity within the luminal compartment was a histologically and molecularly observable phenomenon at the population level, which signified alterations in cell subpopulations. These changes appear to encompass shifts in subpopulation proportions and modifications in the gene expression of specific cell types and across defined cell states.</p><p>We found significant downregulation of the genome organizer <italic>SATB1</italic> in LEPs and breast tissue with age (adj. p&lt;0.05), as well as concordant dysregulation of known SATB1-target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, <italic>SATB1</italic> was also downregulated in PAM50 LumA, LumB, and Her2 breast cancer subtypes relative to their matched normal tissue and had the lowest expression in luminal subtype cancers—the subtype most associated with aging. SATB1 has genome organizing functions in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kohwi-Shigematsu et al., 2013</xref>), and has been described as a key regulator of EMT in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Naik and Galande, 2019</xref>). Although our results suggest that loss of SATB1-mediated genome organization with age is associated with the observed age-dependent dysregulation in the luminal lineage, SATB1’s role in normal breast epithelia and in the context of aging remain to be fully elucidated. Moreover, we postulate that mechanisms of SATB1-mediated genome organization in breast cancers are likely more complex than in aging normal epithelia due to the highly dysregulated state of cancers; this biology is also likely to be highly subtype-specific given the differential expression of <italic>SATB1</italic> across breast cancer subtypes. We also identified an additional 60 genes that showed concordant age-dependent directional changes in LEPs (adj. p&lt;0.05) and in primary tissue (unadj<italic>.</italic> p&lt;0.05) despite the difference in platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarray). Network and community analyses showed enrichment of genes involved in chromosomal rearrangement, including <italic>BCL11A</italic>—a subunit of the BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>MLLT3</italic>—a chromatin reader component of the SEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moustakim et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>ZNF521</italic>—a transcription co-factor with established roles in stem cells of diverse organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Scicchitano et al., 2019</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>PHC1</italic> and <italic>PCGF3</italic>—components of the PcG multiprotein PRC-1-like complex required for developmental maintenance of repressed but transcriptionally poised chromatin configuration through alteration of chromatin accessibility, folding, and global architecture of nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Illingworth, 2019</xref>). <italic>BCL11A</italic>, <italic>MLLT3, ZNF521, PHC1</italic>, and <italic>PCGF3</italic> also showed subtype-specific dysregulation in breast cancers; <italic>BCL11A</italic>, <italic>ZNF521, and PHC1</italic> were specifically downregulated in luminal subtype cancers relative to their matched normal tissue. We speculate that chromatin and genome organization play a key role in maintaining the luminal lineage and that their dysregulation may mediate loss of lineage fidelity observed genome-wide with age.</p><p>The striking phenotypic changes in LEPs are starkly juxtaposed to MEPs, which have so far revealed few obvious signs of changes with age. Nevertheless, our experiments using heterochronous bilayers of MEPs and LEPs demonstrated that the chronological age of MEPs controls the biological age of LEPs, thus illustrating that MEPs do change with age and revealing the existence of a non-cell autonomous mechanism that integrates aging-imposed damage across the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyano et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we showed that changes in MEPs largely involved changes in gene expression variances with age. Moreover, we showed that aging-associated increases in variances in both lineages drove a large fraction of the observed loss of lineage fidelity in epithelia of older women, comparable to the contribution of age-dependent directional changes. In our opinion, changes in variance are an underappreciated component of aging analyses. DE analysis is a ubiquitous statistical tool used in expression profiling studies, whereas only more recently have changes in variance been systematically analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bashkeel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brinkmeyer-Langford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Slieker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Viñuela et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Xie et al., 2011</xref>) and differential variance analytical tools developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Phipson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Phipson and Oshlack, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ran and Daye, 2017</xref>).</p><p>For changes to be detected as significant in DE analysis, the following assumptions must be met: (i) the biological phenomenon causes dysregulation that is directional (e.g., genes are either upregulated or downregulated), and (ii) dysregulation occurs at the same time in the same genes, and in the same pattern across the majority of individuals in the group of interest (i.e., it is stereotypic). Although some aging processes may be deterministic, like telomere shortening, other processes may be stochastic, born from accumulated random physicochemical insults that manifest as an increase in noise in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Todhunter et al., 2018</xref>). In the latter case, the signal itself is the noise in the system. Another way to view this type of dysregulation is by observing the deviation from a set range. A change in the dynamic range of expression, for instance, of regulatory genes such as TFs that have very tuned or narrow windows of expression, can lead to dysregulation as expression deviates from the set range. This noise can lead to decoupling of tightly regulated networks.</p><p>Although we observed both increases and decreases in dynamic range with age, we specifically focused on increases in variance and their effect on loss of lineage fidelity with age, hypothesizing that genes that have very tightly tuned windows of expression in younger healthy individuals and that see large increases in variance in older individuals, are good candidates for susceptibility factors that could be predictive of breast cancer risk.</p><p>Moreover, in our view, this age-dependent differential variability between individuals is linked to the described increase in cellular heterogeneity in older individuals in single-cell studies, where aged cells were shown to have increased transcriptional variability and loss of transcriptional coordination compared to younger cells of the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Enge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Levy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2017</xref>). We had previously proposed that this within-sample transcriptional variability which leads to the identification of cell states and cell sub-populations in scRNAseq data, in turn, could lead to the observed shifts in transcriptomes at the cell population-level and bulk tissue-level in RNAseq data between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Todhunter et al., 2018</xref>). As this gene expression shift in the cell population-level and bulk tissue-level varies per individual and is dependent on the distribution of specific cell states and identified cell sub-populations in any specific individual, transcriptomic profiles of samples from some older individuals can deviate from the mean expression observed in the studied cohort. Thus, we suggest that the increase in cellular heterogeneity with age underlies the cell population-level increases in variances between the individuals. Indeed, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed how variations in cellular characteristics within specific cell lineages, as identified by defined cell states, were strongly linked to particular samples—underscoring the significance of the differential variability between individuals. This further supported the utility of DV analysis in RNA-seq studies that could identify genes for which increasing variances among individuals reflect the unique cell states and increasing cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level. As such, the molecular signals of aging cells may not be fully captured as stereotyped directional changes. Instead, a large fraction of age-associated changes will be reflected as increases in measured variance in the molecular signal across an aged cohort.</p><p>We identified potential ligand-receptor pairs and cell-cell junction proteins, including tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junction components, that potentially mediate dysregulated cell-cell and cell-microenvironment signaling within the epithelium. We provided experimental validation for the role of the gap junction protein GJB6 (Connexin-30) in mediating the ability of MEPs to impose an aging phenotype on LEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyano et al., 2017</xref>). It is unclear whether this occurs chemically through passage of ions or small molecules through gap junction channels, indirectly via gap junction-mediated structural proximity of LEPs and MEPs, or via signaling complexes with connexin-interacting proteins including cytoskeletal elements, tight and adherens junctions, and enzymes like kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dbouk et al., 2009</xref>). How this occurs will require further exploration.</p><p>GSEA further identified age-dependent enrichment of gene sets in LEPs and MEPs that were commonly dysregulated in breast cancers, including gene sets related to inflammation and immunosenescence, processes synonymous with aging and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fulop et al., 2017</xref>); cell-cycle related targets of E2F transcription factors, which are thought to play a role in regulating cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lanigan et al., 2011</xref>); and targets of the oncogene <italic>MYC.</italic> Aging associated changes in the immune response were further implicated through our ligand-receptor pair analysis where we identified known immune-associated ligands and receptors that exhibited loss of lineage-specific expression in breast epithelia. We had previously shown that in situ innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration of the breast epithelia and interstitial stroma change with age consistent with a decline in immune surveillance and increased immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zirbes et al., 2021</xref>). How age-dependent changes in other cell types in the breast including stromal, vascular, and immune cell populations are linked to the dysregulation of epithelial signaling with age remains to be fully elucidated. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of FACS isolated primary immune, stromal, and vascular cell types from normal breast tissue had identified lineage-specific expression of ligands and receptors that could contribute to dynamic and reciprocal signaling between cell types in the breast interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Del Toro et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Thi et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, reciprocal changes in these other cell types may contribute to the differential variability observed in epithelial cell types via cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions.</p><p>Although our age-specific analyses did not identify oncogenes that were DE between younger and older epithelia, gene set enrichment in LEPs and MEPs revealed a putative example of priming, a process in which certain pathway components undergo molecular changes that set the stage for potential dysregulation as aging progresses, a phenomenon we previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sayaman et al., 2021</xref>. We did not detect changes in <italic>MYC</italic> expression with age, but MYC targets were among the gene sets that were significantly enriched in DE or DV analysis. MYC is amplified or overexpressed in ~35% of breast cancers and exerts pleiotropic effects across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of cancer progression, MYC can induce telomerase activity, which enables bypass of the replicative senescence barrier in mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Garbe et al., 2014</xref>). Although we do not have evidence for the direct involvement of MYC in this context, we speculate that secondary events such as demethylation at MYC binding sites at target genes could explain the enrichment of MYC relevant signatures. In another candidate example of priming, we observed significant downregulation of known EMT regulatory genes <italic>GRHL2</italic> and <italic>SGSM2</italic> in older LEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Xiang et al., 2012</xref>), but no loss of E-cadherin (<italic>CDH1</italic>) expression in LEPs with age. Given E-cadherin’s pivotal role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity within epithelial structures, we did not expect dysregulation of E-cadherin in the context of aging in normal cells. As above, we speculate that further secondary events downstream of <italic>GRHL2</italic> and <italic>SGSM2</italic> dysregulation could lead to the perturbations in E-cadherin expression necessary to drive EMT and oncogenic transformation.</p><p>That age-dependent changes are evident in epithelial lineages isolated from primary HMEC cultures suggest a degree of epigenetic stability that allow aged epithelial cells to occupy metastable states. Indeed, our examination of DNA methylation in matched LEP and MEP samples showed age-dependent differential methylation (DM) at promoter proximal regions of DE genes and negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in these samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Miyano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sayaman et al., 2021</xref>). DM genes in older LEPs likewise showed enrichment for signaling pathways that have been shown to play a role in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sayaman et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, LEPs of older women also exhibited loss of epigenetic suppression of retrotransposons that affect regulation of genes with oncogenic potential, specifically genes associated with luminal breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Senapati et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, age-dependent activation of gene expression networks in older breast epithelia that are stabilized through concomitant age-dependent changes in the epigenetic landscape could prime aged epithelia for oncogenic gene activation.</p><p>We proposed two distinct pathways through which we could explain how aging mechanisms contribute to aging-associated cancer susceptibility. (i) General dysregulatory mechanisms, which were reflected in directional age-dependent changes that share common features with known cancer mechanisms. These changes contribute to an increased overall susceptibility to cancer as individuals age. (ii) Individual-specific dysregulatory mechanisms, which were identified by variations in aged populations. These variations may help explain why certain individuals are more vulnerable to cancer initiation (i.e., not all aged individuals develop cancer), and why those who have cancer develop specific subtypes.</p><p>Using machine learning, we built a predictive elastic net model using the expression of age-dependent DE and DV genes identified in LEPs in breast tissue samples. This model could classify normal breast tissue from breast tumors and predict breast cancer subtypes in publicly available normal and cancer tissue transcriptomes from more &gt;3000 women. Although association of mammary lineage-derived signatures with breast cancer subtype is well-established in the literature, our study notably demonstrates that changes in aging-associated genes specifically in the luminal lineage were robust predictors of breast cancer subtypes. These findings suggest that what is typically attributed to oncogenesis might actually be age-related changes within the luminal lineage. Moreover, based on our analysis of the relative contribution of the identified LEP-derived aging-associated DE and DV genes to the predictive model of breast cancer subtypes, we found DV genes to be strong predictors of PAM50 LumA, LumB and Her2 subtypes but held no strong predictive value for PAM50 Basal subtypes. Luminal subtypes are by far the most associated with aging, and we hypothesize that increased variances may underly the transcriptomic architecture of luminal cancer subtypes. Therefore, we speculate that inclusion of age-dependent DV genes derived from the luminal lineage could lead to better subtype predictors.</p><p>Collectively, our findings illustrate how tissue-level predictive biomarkers of breast cancer that have subtype-specific expression relative to matched normal samples are dysregulated with age at the cell population-level, specifically in the luminal lineage. The contribution of non-epithelial cell types to the age-dependent expression of these genes in bulk tissue remains the subject of future studies. Given that the mammary epithelium is the origin of breast carcinomas and age is the most significant risk factor for breast cancers, age-dependent changes in the transcriptomic landscape of luminal cells may be key contributing factors to the tissue-level dysregulation of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment signaling in breast cancers and may reflect relevant biology convergent with the development of frank tumors. Indeed, the variance in expression of these genes across aged individuals may reflect the differential susceptibility of certain individuals to specific breast cancer subtypes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies show how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women. We show that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of the aging process and is likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. Strikingly, LEPs can integrate age-dependent signals from MEPs and almost exclusively exhibit the stereotyped, directional changes seen in aging epithelia that comprise a prominent signal detected in bulk tissue. Age-dependent directional and variant changes in LEPs even shape the tissue-level expression of predictive biomarkers that classify normal tissue and breast cancer subtypes, illustrating how age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs may play a key role in tissue transformation into frank cancers. We also demonstrate how increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes. Because cancer susceptibility indicates a state that could be more easily pushed towards cancer initiation, we can consider the variances between aged individuals to occupy multiple metastable states, some of which represent susceptible phenotypes that can be perturbed towards development of specific cancers. We speculate that these variance-driven changes are examples of age-dependent priming events that push epithelial cells towards metastable states susceptible to malignant transformation. Therefore, the degree to which breast-cancer associated genes are variably expressed across the different cell populations of the breast and across different individuals may explain why breast cancers develop in only a subset of women in a subtype-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>The FACS-enriched luminal epithelial (LEP) and MEP myoepithelial (MEP) cells from finite lifespan, non-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) grown to 4th passage serve as our experimental model system.

Sample-level biological replicates (m) are data derived from the same subject but from separate cell culture/co-culture, FACS isolation, sample and library preparation, and RNA-sequencing experiments. Sample replicates are typically bridge samples used across different experiment batches. Technical replicates (l) are data derived from a single subject from a single sample pre-processing experiment (e.g., qPCR). When sample replication for the same subject can be modeled, analyses are done at sample level; if not, analyses are done at subject level by taking the mean value of sample replicates (see Method Details and Quantification and Statistical Analysis section).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin T Spike (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Both reviews identified major flaws that could impact the underlying interpretation. If the authors feel that they can satisfactorily overcome these weaknesses, an appeal would be something we would be glad to consider.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Sayaman et al. presents a detailed analysis of bulk transcriptomic data from sorted and cultured human mammary epithelial cells from donors of different ages, &lt;35yrs and &gt;55yrs. The authors conclude from their analysis that both myoepithelial and luminal cells undergo increased expression variance with aging and luminal cells also experience directional changes in the expression of select genes in aged individuals that portend a loss of lineage fidelity. Examining several of these genes alone and in multi-gene signatures across archival breast cancer and normal breast gene expression data sets, the authors determine that breast cancers deregulate genes that are differentially expressed in the breast of young and aged individuals. The presentation is clear, and the analysis and data shown are generally sound, however, in the manuscript's present form the omission of some key descriptions and data (detail below) undercut its interpretability and impact.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The manuscript is generally very well-written and clearly organized.</p><p>• The gene expression analysis is thorough and several of the findings are potentially interesting. Thus, the aspect of this study would provide a useful resource for the field. For example, the mapping of potential ligands and receptors that could act in heterotypic signaling is particularly interesting.</p><p>• Graphic representations are eye-catching although some are so full of information that they might benefit from some simplification or more thorough description.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• A fatal flaw in the interpretation of the data may be present if the authors do not determine (and report) the heterogeneity of the effects at the single-cell level. For instance, the division of mammary epithelium into basal and luminal populations may be overly simplistic. Each of these sorted populations is likely comprised of multiple cell types and if their proportions change as a function of age, hormonal status, or even something as trivial as differences in cell isolation or sorting marker expression in aged donors – then the differences observed might not reflect changes in Luminal cell and Basal cell transcriptome per se, but rather differential admixing of cell types in the samples tested – i.e. the cells themselves could theoretically be relatively unchanged but simply present in different proportions. The authors may be aware of this problem as they cite 4 prior works that identify this issue. Yet, it is critical for the interpretation of the expression differences in the present study that cellular heterogeneity is addressed experimentally.</p><p>• The menopause/pregnancy/gravidity/parity status of all samples should be assessed and addressed in the manuscript. Although generally associated with increased age, the post-menopausal hormonal context is very different than it would be in younger women. The hormonal effects on lineage distribution/fidelity should be discussed alongside the age theme/theory.</p><p>• Ability to segregate different subtypes of breast cancer with mammary lineage-derived signatures is well-established in the literature. The analysis would carry more weight if evaluated for prognosis and in multivariate analysis to determine if there is a value added to the assessment of these specific genes. Related to this, it would be helpful to describe in greater detail what multi-testing correction approach was used (and mention it and/or apply it also to figure 4 and supplements as appropriate). Were all genes tested in this analysis significantly different in their expression?</p><p>• A previously published association between GRHL2 and SGSM2, and E-cadherin downregulation is noted, however, no mention of E-cadherin expression in this dataset is discussed to determine whether a similar reprogramming is present.</p><p>• SATB1 is noted to be decreased in LEPs of older women relative to younger women, correlating to decreased expression in breast cancer relative to normal tissue. Further analysis should be performed to determine whether SATB1 target genes are also downregulated to justify the claim that 'SATB1-mediated genome organization may play a regulatory role in the maintenance of the luminal lineage…'. Also, is SATB1 expression in the various breast cancer subtypes different when stratified for age as well?</p><p>• The rescue of ELF5 expression in LEPs when co-cultured with MEP-shGJB6 could be expanded to include additional LEP-specific TFs/markers to determine whether shGJB6 regulates biological aging as the whole of specific regulation of ELF5.</p><p>• The authors should more clearly describe what key findings in this work go beyond the findings they reported in the 2017 Aging paper (cited above) which also showed age-related changes in the mammary transcriptome and may have used many of the same samples.</p><p>• Some axes are a bit hard to understand. For example, is the expression of ELF5 really 50x higher than RPS18, a typically very highly expressed gene (Figure 5E)?</p><p>• For the differential variance of KDM2B, how much of this variance can be attributed to the one low point? I.e. is this value an outlier or is the variance still elevated if it is removed? It would be good to see other genes in which there is differential variance rather than just one example.</p><p>• Figure 3 supplement 1 viii is never mentioned in the text, and since it is looking at DV rather than DE it seems out of place here</p><p>• There are some additional seemingly paradoxical observations that would benefit from further explanation. For example, HES4 is a target of Notch1 and is downregulated in older LEPs but is typically associated with breast cancer progression. Why would cells be getting less tumorigenic with regard to HES4 if aging is generally indicative of more tumor-prone phenotypes? A similar question could be posed for ZNF503.</p><p>• Figures such as strata plots and interactome maps are effective at including a lot of information in a condensed format, however, there can sometimes be too much going on in a single panel that can make it difficult to follow. For example, figures 1C-E effectively convey the main point even without figure 1B. Furthermore, try to choose color-blind safe color schemes (i.e. avoid red and green in the same figure).</p><p>• The terms &quot;variance&quot; and &quot;directional changes&quot; need clearer descriptions at the outset.</p><p>• To address concerns about cellular heterogeneity, the authors could:</p><p>1) Show the sorting that was done to isolate these populations (and that was done to separate them post-culturing). Are the populations clearly distinct such that slight changes in cell dissociation, labeling, or isolation by FACS are unlikely to be responsible for the population-level expression changes? Looking back at one cited prior work (Miyano and Sayaman et al. Aging 2017 Oct 9;9(10):2026-2051), the markers used appear to create a continuum of expression in some settings with potentially subjective sort gates applied. Related to this, Elf5 is a known alveolar specifier. Are such cells equally partitioned into the LEP vs MEP sorted pools based on the markers used? 2) Use an orthogonal method to confirm that sorting was effective and show the data. 3) Carry out in situ validation of the observations to delineate what proportion of the luminal or myoepithelial compartments in vivo show the directional expression changes uncovered following culture. Increased intra-sample expression variation could also be orthogonally quantified this way. 4) Compare findings to recent single-cell transcriptomic studies e.g. Gray et al. Dev Cell. 2022 Jun 6;57(11):1400-1420.e7.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is significant as how aging-associated genetic and epigenetic changes in various cell types of the mammary gland may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility is unclear. The study involved a reasonable number of patient-derived mammary epithelial cell samples for extensive bioinformatics and machine learning analyses. The data such as loss of lineage fidelity during aging supports previous findings from the senior author's group and others. The identified aging-associated genes such as SATB1 may serve as intervention targets. However, significant alteration of gene expression and loss of lineage fidelity in LEPs should be expected between LEPs of premenopausal and postmenopausal women since hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptor-expressing cells are mainly, if not exclusive, present in the LEP population. Thus, the authors should analyze and present the percentage of the differentially expressed (DE) genes between the young LEPs and old LEPs shown in Figure 3 which are menopause, estrogen, and progesterone-dependent genes. This should provide confidence as to whether the cultured cells used in the study can model the gene expression changes in situ, particularly given that only 97 genes were found to be significant age-associated DE genes in the normal human breast tissue (Figure 4-table supplement 1) out of 471 DE genes identified from the cultured young and old LEPs shown in Figure 3B. Another precaution may be warranted in interpreting the data as to whether the gene expression of the mammary cells from mammoplasty reduction is significantly affected by a different set of environmental factors since the donors were likely obese in comparison to the general population. Could the data such as the significant enrichment of the Early and Late Estrogen Response gene sets in the old LEPs shown in Figure 3H be more related to this unique donor population since estrogen-responsive genes are expected to be more highly expressed in premenopausal women than postmenopausal women?</p><p>1. For the section related to Figure 2 and associated supplementary data, using the expression change of ligands and receptors to identify disruption of lineage-specific signaling pathways would be less robust than using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the changes of various signaling pathways between LEP and MEP as a function of aging because gene expression of ligands and receptors does not always translate to their protein expression and signaling pathways are often modulated by posttranslational modifications.</p><p>2. The authors should state whether there are limited lineage-specific genes that show reduced expression variance in the old LEPs and MEPs in comparison to the young ones to demonstrate that the increased expression variance is aging-dependent in the mammary epithelial cells.</p><p>3. While it is reasonable to suggest that genes with an increased variance of expression during aging may contribute to loss of lineage fidelity during aging, the rationale for including them for clustering and predicting breast cancer subtypes in Figure 6 needs to be further supported by evidence.</p><p>4. The authors should explain how siRNA-mediated knockdown can be used to reduce the level of variance of GJB6 and to constrain specific molecular noise. Did the two old MEP cells used in Figure 5G express the highest levels of GJB6 among all old MEP cells? Would knockdown of GJB6 in MEPs expressing lower GJB6 not increase ELF5 expression?</p><p>5. The data shown in Figure 6 do not depict what genes and expression data were used to predict breast cancer in Figures 6C and 6D. How the findings may be translated?</p><p>6. The authors should consider analyzing, or at least discussing, the potential interaction among aging, menopause, and obesity of mammoplasty reduction donors in regulating gene expression and expression variance.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Luminal epithelial cells integrate variable responses to aging into stereotypical changes that underlie breast cancer susceptibility&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study of Sayaman et al. used a large panel of early passage ex vivo isolates from breast tissues of young and old donors to interrogate global transcriptome underpinning of age-related reduction in lineage fidelity. This study follows on earlier findings from LaBarge lab that revealed the loss of lineage fidelity induced by aged myoepithelial cells (MEP), but the effects manifesting in luminal epithelia (LEP). In-depth bioinformatical analyses of these ex vivo cultures, followed by interrogation of public datasets and some experimental studies validate and expand earlier inferences made with a limited subset of lineage-specific markers. More importantly, these analyses enable authors to make several well-supported novel inferences of high conceptual, biological and clinical importance. This is a substantially revised manuscript, and the technical concerns raised by previous reviewers appear to be adequately addressed/resolved.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Use of a large panel of early passage LEP and MEP lineage isolates, rigorously validated to adequately reflect in situ lineage phenotypes. The large number of samples enabled authors to discover the contribution of between-individual variability, which would not be possible with a smaller number of samples.</p><p>This study provides additional support for prior hypothesis that age-related increase in cancer incidence reflects loss of proper specification of LEP lineage.</p><p>In-depth unbiased interrogation of transcriptional differences between young and old lineages enabled new network-level insights that substantially advance our understanding of this under-appreciated contributor to the causal link between increased cancer risk and aging.</p><p>Definition of gene signatures of young and old LEP enabled the authors to infer the premature aging effects of chemotherapy exposure and BRCA mutations – supporting the author's suggestion that aged LEP lineage could be potentially used as a leading marker of physiological breast epithelia aging which could be useful for both risk stratification and deeper understanding of breast cancer etiology. On the latter, the analyses found no evidence of increased aging with parity and BMI, important breast cancer risk factors, suggesting distinct causality from that of aging, chemo and BRCA mutations.</p><p>To this reviewer, the most conceptually intriguing inference is the contribution of aging-associated increase in variability between samples. Aging-related increases in variability between individuals have been noted in some prior studies, but this phenomenon appears to be underappreciated and understudied. The lack of attention likely reflects unclear sequela of the phenomenon, as the consequences of variability are not intuitively obvious. Unlike the directional changes in specific genes, the enhanced variability does not lend to a straightforward hypothesis addressable via reductionist experimental pipelines. This study sheds new light on the potential consequences of this between-individual variability. First, it makes a compelling argument that the increased individual-individual variability is a substantial contributor to age-related lineage fidelity in both LEP and MEP lineages. Second, by highlighting the observed variability ins specific cancer-related genes, the authors make a logically sound argument that this between-individual variability likely translates to between-individual differences in age-related cancer risk.</p><p>Experimental documentation that normalization of expression of gap junction GJB6 gene, up-regulated in a subset of old MEPs prevents the induction of aged phenotypes in LEP suggests the possibility of a potential pharmacological rejuvenation of breast epithelia that could potentially reduce cancer risk. At this point, this is a far shot as the clear path to pharmacological intervention is lacking. Still, this is an important proof of principle that supports the utility of follow-up efforts in this direction.</p><p>Importantly, while this work focuses exclusively on breast epithelia, given the universality of aging-related physiological alterations across all tissues, and the concomitant increase in cancer incidence, this study suggests the potential utility of investigating the relevance of the above findings towards other tissues.</p><p>Limitations.</p><p>The conclusions are primarily based on bioinformatical inferences from cultured cells. The inferences are compelling and additionally supported by analyses of non-dissociated organoids and bioinformatical analyses of publically available datasets. Still, there seems to be a missed opportunity of providing additional credence through histological analyses of gene expression in situ.</p><p>This is a long, complex, data and analysis-heavy manuscript. While there is no &quot;fluff&quot; and the writing is very thoughtful with clear description of the premises, experiments and inferences, there is some redundancy and some parts of this work are difficult to get through. Together with the massive lengths and complexity, this would probably deter some readers.</p><p>The discussion links the reported age-related increase in between-individual variance with a more appreciated phenomenon of an increase in noise-driven cellular heterogeneity, which appears to be shared between aging and cancers. The link between noise-driven cell-cell variability the variability between samples does not appear to be intuitively clear. This is a very intriguing connection, which would warrant additional elaboration.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>Please define &quot;stereotypical&quot;, this is an important descriptor that can be misconstrued.</p><p>Differential expression inferred from the analyses of cultured samples has been validated in undissociated, non-cultured organoids. Together with the demonstrated utility of using the gene signatures, derived from the cultured isolates, in interrogating bulk transcriptomics dataset, the evidence is deemed sufficient. Still, it would have been useful to further support by in situ (by IF or IHC) validation, or at least point out to prior studies that demonstrate the differences in situ. Given the numbers of DE genes, I assume there must be ones with large differences, abundant expression and strong epitopes. If this is not feasible or if doing so would entail substantial new effort, it would be unreasonable to deter the publication of this work. Therefore, this recommendation is meant to be considered as a suggestion rather than a request.</p><p>Per the last point in the public review, the connection of between sample variability and between cell variability needs to be elaborated. It is not intuitively obvious how one would follow from another.</p><p>Related to the previous point, I found the description of the premise and inferences from the GJB6 down-regulation experiment very confusing. In my opinion, this part warrants a separate manuscript as it will be probably lost in the already massive amount of work presented in the manuscript. If this is unrealistic at this point and/or if the authors disagree with this suggestion, I recommend to either elaborate the rationale and conclusions more clearly or to simplify. The hypothesis presented in line 556 is not entirely clear to me, and 6C schemata is insufficient to clarify. The authors interpret the effect of GJB6 downregulation in preventing the imposition of aged phenotype on LEPs as supporting variance as the driver of stereotypic aging phenotypes (lines 582-585). Perhaps this was stated in the hypothesis illustrated by 6C, but I could not understand the connection, and the reasoning appears to be somewhat contrived. It is unclear whether the stable difference in GJB6 expression between different MEP isolates can be attributed to the effects of noise. There seems to be an implicit assumption of between-cell variability in increased GHB6 expression in aged MEP, and that higher between-sample variability somehow emerges from this cell level variance – but this is not stated explicitly, and no evidence of variability between MEP cells from the same isolate is provided. If the authors see a logically clear connection that is missed by this reviewer, there should be a way to elaborate it more clearly. Otherwise, the more on-the surface (and probably more trivial) inference is that (a) between sample variability is of biological significance, as upregulation of GHB6 ages LEPs, and (b) the result indicates a potential utility of pharmacological intervention to suppress LEP aging. The experimental part of this section could benefit from elaboration as well. Does &quot; the subset of older MEPs with higher expression relative to younger MEPs&quot; refers to isolates with highest expression level? If so, it can be stated more explicitly.</p><p>Lines 274-287 confer a key inference of the insufficiency of directional changes to explain loss of lineage fidelity. The inference is well-supported by the data and reasoning, but it took substantial time and effort to digest the paragraph. It might be worth to re-write the paragraph, perhaps with adding a schemata to make it easier to digest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors precisely culture primary mammary epithelial cells from breast reduction surgeries from a set of younger (&lt;30 years) and older (&gt;55 years), then separate the luminal and myoepithelial cells by flow cytometry, and perform gene expression profiling and compare differences between groups. Genes that show differential expression or differential variability with aging are interpreted as indicative of a loss of cell identity. Comparisons with publically available datasets for single cell RNA sequencing of breast tissue find overlap with aging-dependent differences as well as response to chemotherapy and presence of BRCA mutations. The authors also find overlap with datasets of bulk RNA sequencing, which they interpret as indicating that the luminal/myoepithelial aging phenotype may dominate the overall aging differences in the whole tissue. They also find that their genesets can be used to create classifiers of breast cancer subtypes as defined by PAM50 classifications, and further identify specific genes that, when manipulated, suppress heterotypic induction of aging-associated gene signatures.</p><p>One key strength of the study is the comprehensive and thorough evaluation of their gene sets across multiple types of datasets, which strongly supports their assertions that the age-associated differences in luminal and myoepithelial cells are the principal definers of overall aging in the breast. Another key strength is the careful and thorough evaluation of the concept that differential variability of gene expression is a key characteristic of aging. This is a very challenging concept, and the authors do an excellent job of presenting it. A subtle point not reinforced in the text is that since these experiments were performed on passaged epithelial cell populations, the aging-dependent gene expression differences have a degree of epigenetic stability, which further reinforces their assertions that the changes in the epithelial subtype lineage determinants are the principal drivers of the aging phenotype (and cancer susceptibility).</p><p>Weaknesses of the study include the lack of consideration of other cell types in the breast and their role in the aging process; while this is briefly mentioned in the discussion, it is certainly an essential component of aging and cancer. It may be that the loss of epithelial lineage fidelity is the underlying cause of aging, but these changes will occur in combination with reciprocal changes in stromal cell types, and these may contribute to epigenetic programming and differential variability. This possibility could be evaluated as an extension of the dataset comparisons in the study. Minor weaknesses include the need for comparison of aging differences across racial backgrounds and in association with obesity and parity, although the careful evaluation of this current set provides a critical foundation for these future studies.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>This study was carefully performed and beautifully presented. The results argue for a new paradigm of aging in the breast, and it is to be expected that these concepts will be challenging to parse. I have no major issues with any aspect of the study. One point that could benefit from clarification is the concept that gene expression changes precede oncogene alterations. This was briefly alluded to in the manuscript, but the interpretation of this was unclear to me: are the authors suggesting that epigenetic activation of gene expression networks may support oncogenic gene activations that will drive the same pathways? If so, this point could benefit from further discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95720.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Sayaman et al. presents a detailed analysis of bulk transcriptomic data from sorted and cultured human mammary epithelial cells from donors of different ages, &lt;35yrs and &gt;55yrs. The authors conclude from their analysis that both myoepithelial and luminal cells undergo increased expression variance with aging and luminal cells also experience directional changes in the expression of select genes in aged individuals that portend a loss of lineage fidelity. Examining several of these genes alone and in multi-gene signatures across archival breast cancer and normal breast gene expression data sets, the authors determine that breast cancers deregulate genes that are differentially expressed in the breast of young and aged individuals. The presentation is clear, and the analysis and data shown are generally sound, however, in the manuscript's present form the omission of some key descriptions and data (detail below) undercut its interpretability and impact.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The manuscript is generally very well-written and clearly organized.</p><p>• The gene expression analysis is thorough and several of the findings are potentially interesting. Thus, the aspect of this study would provide a useful resource for the field. For example, the mapping of potential ligands and receptors that could act in heterotypic signaling is particularly interesting.</p><p>• Graphic representations are eye-catching although some are so full of information that they might benefit from some simplification or more thorough description.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• A fatal flaw in the interpretation of the data may be present if the authors do not determine (and report) the heterogeneity of the effects at the single-cell level. For instance, the division of mammary epithelium into basal and luminal populations may be overly simplistic. Each of these sorted populations is likely comprised of multiple cell types and if their proportions change as a function of age, hormonal status, or even something as trivial as differences in cell isolation or sorting marker expression in aged donors – then the differences observed might not reflect changes in Luminal cell and Basal cell transcriptome per se, but rather differential admixing of cell types in the samples tested – i.e. the cells themselves could theoretically be relatively unchanged but simply present in different proportions. The authors may be aware of this problem as they cite 4 prior works that identify this issue. Yet, it is critical for the interpretation of the expression differences in the present study that cellular heterogeneity is addressed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge Reviewer #1's concerns regarding luminal subpopulation heterogeneity. However, we respectfully disagree that this constitutes a 'fatal flaw' in our study. Our approach aligns with established methodologies where transcriptional changes at the population level yield significant insights despite inherent cellular heterogeneity. Such population-level analyses, akin to those used in examining immune cell subtypes, remain informative for understanding breast epithelial lineages.</p><p>Our data encompass both luminal and myoepithelial populations, replicating findings from authoritative studies in the field that also encounter similar heterogeneity. Moreover, our previous work has addressed the very issue Reviewer #1 raises. In 'Cell Reports' (2018), we differentiated between luminal subtypes and demonstrated that the predominant subtype remains consistent across age groups. Consequently, we maintain that our methodology is robust, the identified biomarkers are predictive of breast cancer subtypes, and the potential heterogeneity does not undermine the validity of our findings. Further, corroborating evidence from single-cell analyses in multiple independent studies supports our classification of mammary epithelium and substantiates our conclusions.</p><p>As you know, mammary glands are bilayered structures composed of the two major epithelial lineages of the breast with Keratin 19 (KRT19)-positive luminal epithelial cells (LEP) surrounded by KRT14positive contractile myoepithelial cells (MEP). The luminal lineage is composed of ER+ hormone sensing and ER- secretory populations with ER- LEP. Human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) primary cultures are known to maintain MEP and ER- LEP lineages. In previous papers (Nature Aging 2021, Cancer Prev Res 2021) we showed examples of breast aging biomarkers ELF5 (expression and promoter methylation) and KRT14 intermediate filament expression that were also initially identified in FACS enriched luminal or myoepithelial cells, successfully identify young women who are higher than average risk for breast cancers. We show in this manuscript that large sets of luminal aging biomarkers we identified were predictive of breast cancer subtype.</p><p>Here, we used FACS-enriched primary luminal (LEP) and myoepithelial (MEP) cells as the foundational cell source for these analyses. The ER- luminal cells represents 80-95% of luminal cells in breast and comprise the cells of origin for breast cancer. Moreover, ER- luminal cells can be maintained in finite lifespan cell cultures and thus studied experimentally. In the opinion of reviewer #1, our choice of bulk sequencing these enriched populations would mask the possibility that certain subtypes of luminal cells were becoming enriched with age, and that we must address this heterogeneity experimentally. We published (Cell Reports 2018) a CyTOF study (29 antibodies) examining normal breast epithelia with our primary HMEC culture system and uncultured primaries (n=57, 16-91yr). Two clusters were robustly identified representing these two distinct epithelial cell types: ER- LEP and MEP. We demonstrated there are possibly four subtypes of ER- LEP, but only one subtype accounts for ~90% of the luminal lineage independent of age. Thus, we believe this issue has been addressed experimentally using primary HMEC, that our design was not a fatal flaw, and that we could easily address this issue with some careful explanation to the readers/reviewers.</p><p>The division of mammary epithelium into myoepithelial and ER+ and ER- luminal populations has been supported by numerous studies including single-cell studies. In a separate published manuscript (Nee et al., Nature Genetics 2023), our collaborators performed single cell RNA seq of mammary tissue from non-tumor samples (reduction mammoplasty, prophylactic mastectomies, contralateral to DCIS/tumor) from BRCA1 mutation carriers (n=11, 24-50y) and noncarriers (n=11, 21-54y). We identified three epithelial cell types: a basal (MEP) and two luminal cell types: secretory luminal 1 (ER- LEP) and hormone-sensing luminal 2 (ER+ LEP); ER- are the dominant luminal population as expected. The existence of these three distinct epithelial cell types: basal-myoepithelial and luminal hormone sensing luminal secretory, in primary tissue have been established in several other independent scRNA-seq studies consistent with the epithelial lineages well-established in literature from histological, functional, and FACS-based enrichment sequencing studies of normal breast tissue see, (1) Nguyen et al., Nat Comm 2018, scRNA-seq of normal breast epithelia from reduction mammoplasty (n=7, 17-37yr) identified basal, secretory L1 and hormone responsive L2 luminal epithelial cell populations; (2) Pal et al., EMBO 2021, scRNA-seq of normal and BRCA+/- preneoplastic tissue (n=22, 19-69y), TNBC and HER2+ tumors (n=14, 25-84y), and ER+ tumor tissue and lymph node (n=19, 45-84y) identified basal, luminal progenitor (KIT high), and mature luminal (ESR1 and PGR high) epithelial cell populations; (3) Murrow et al., Cell Systems 2022, scRNAseq of normal reduction mammoplasty tissue (n=28, 19-39y) identified basal/myoepithelial, secretory luminal and HR+ luminal epithelial cell populations; and (4) Gray et al., Dev Cell 2022, scRNA-seq of mammary tissue from non-tumor samples (reduction mammoplasty, prophylactic mastectomies, (n=3, 36-41y)) identified basal, alveolar luminal (KIT, ELF5 and PROM1 high) and hormone sensing luminal (ESR1, PGR and PRLR high) epithelial cell populations.</p><p>We point out that no distinct subpopulation clusters in tSNE or UMAP projections of the ER- and ER+ luminal and basal cell types from normal tissue were established in any of these studies. While cell states have been reported in the scRNA-seq studies, the states and differentially expressed genes associated varied across studies and it was unclear how highly linked individual sample-level variation were to the presence of these cell states. Indeed, in Murrow et al., density plots highlighting the transcriptional cell state of hormone-sensing luminal cells and basal/myoepithelial cells were highly associated with individual samples [Murrow et al., Cell Systems 2022, Figure 1C], and in our reanalysis of the Nee et al., dataset, the fraction of identified cell states was dependent on specific samples [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and 1H</xref>]. This underscored the significance of differential variability between individuals and further support the utility of DV analysis in RNA-seq studies that identify genes with increasing variance across different subjects that could reflect the unique cell states and increasing cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level.</p><p>As Reviewer #1 mentions, we cited single cell studies in discussion to address how observations at the lineage level are potentially due to heterogeneity at single cell level. We have provided a treatment of this phenomenon in a review article we authored in 2018 and cited. We have made revisions to the discussion to make this point clearer. That is, the age-related decline in lineage fidelity within the luminal compartment was a histologically and molecularly observable phenomenon at the population level, which signified alterations in cell subpopulations. These changes may encompass shifts in subpopulation proportions and modifications in the gene expression of specific cell types and across defined cell states.</p><p>To address reviewer concerns, we added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and accompanying section on “Age dependent gene expression changes detected at the single cell level” where we validated aging-specific gene sets that we detected in FACS enriched populations in non-tumorigenic breast tissue samples from available single-cell studies (Pal et al., Nee et al., and Murrow et al.,). To discuss the epithelial lineages across the three different scRNA-seq datasets, we adopted the Luminal1 (luminal adaptive secretory precursors), Luminal2 (luminal hormone-sensing), and Basal (basal-myoepithelial) terminology from Nee et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The menopause/pregnancy/gravidity/parity status of all samples should be assessed and addressed in the manuscript. Although generally associated with increased age, the post-menopausal hormonal context is very different than it would be in younger women. The hormonal effects on lineage distribution/fidelity should be discussed alongside the age theme/theory.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that interactions between aging, menopause, pregnancy/gravidy/parity are worthy of assessing in the context of age-related cancer susceptibility. There was paucity of complete data sets with aging, menopause and obesity information. In our case, the HMEC bank was established ca1974 and is one of the larger collections of banked reduction mammoplasty tissue. Menopause and BMI were not collected for a majority of samples prior to 2016.</p><p>To delineate menopausal impact, cohorts were stratified to &lt;30y (premenopausal) and &gt;55y (postmenopausal), intentionally omitting middle-aged women due to ambiguous menopausal status. Previous work (Shalabi et al., Nat Aging 2021; Miyano, Sayaman et al., Cancer Prev Res 2021) indicated mutation carriers exhibited precocious aging markers, aligning with scGSEA findings that Luminal1 cells in BRCA1 mutation carriers aged faster than non-carriers [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, our analysis distinguished aging-related gene expression from obesity and parity influences (referencing Burkholder et al., BCR 2020; Santucci-Pereira et al., BCR 2019) [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>]. Overlap with obesity and parity-related genes was minimal, corroborating the specificity of our aging LEP signature was unaffected by these factors [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>]. Thus, we affirm our findings are predominantly age-driven.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Ability to segregate different subtypes of breast cancer with mammary lineage-derived signatures is well-established in the literature. The analysis would carry more weight if evaluated for prognosis and in multivariate analysis to determine if there is a value added to the assessment of these specific genes. Related to this, it would be helpful to describe in greater detail what multi-testing correction approach was used (and mention it and/or apply it also to figure 4 and supplements as appropriate). Were all genes tested in this analysis significantly different in their expression?</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we demonstrated that mammary lineage-derived signatures that could predict breast cancer subtypes involved aging-associated genes that were specifically changing in the luminal lineage. These findings suggest that what is typically attributed to oncogenesis might actually be age related changes within the luminal lineage. Our machine learning model, using a non-linear ensemble method, captures the nuanced expression patterns of genes that vary with age, not just those that are differentially expressed. This could explain why certain older individuals are more susceptible to breast cancer initiation and subtype development.</p><p>While we expected aging-related DE and DV genes to be more associated with cancer initiation, we subsequently conducted survival analysis as Reviewer #1 suggested, assessing the contribution of top ML predictors (scaled variable importance ≥ 25%) in each subtype to overall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI). We employed multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to test the simultaneous effect of all top predictors on survival time, adjusting for age at diagnosis and cancer stage (early vs. late). In PAM50 LumA cancers, we found 13% and 17% of top predictors (k<sub>LumA_top _pred</sub>=47) were associated with OS and PFI respectively; in PAM50 LumB cancers, 5% and 16% of top predictors (k<sub>LumB_top _pred</sub>=37) were associated with OS and PFI; and in in PAM50 Basal cancers, 0% and 3% of top predictors (k<sub>LumB_top _pred</sub>=14) were associated with OS and PFI (Wald <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A-2C</xref>]. These suggest that subtype-specific expression of genes dysregulated with age in the LEP lineage also impact biology underlying survival outcomes specifically in patients with luminal type cancers.</p><p>Multiple testing adjustment in TCGA analysis was performed using Benjamini-Hochberg for selected genes that were discussed. To improve on the analysis, we have formalized the Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc pair-wise Wilcoxon statistical tests comparing breast cancer subtypes and matched normal samples across all age-dependent DE and DV genes identified in LEPs (see Methods). We found 98% of age-dependent DE and DV genes (580 of 589 genes, respectively, in the TCGA cohort) to be differential expressed between PAM50 intrinsic subtypes (KW BH adj. p&lt;0.05, post hoc Wilcoxon BH adj. p&lt;0.05) [new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1A and 1B</xref>]. When we further analyzed median expression of DE and DV genes across PAM50 LumA, LumB, Her2 and Basal subtypes, we found differential distribution of median expression across subtypes: (i) the largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in young LEP had the highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes; (ii) the largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in old LEP had highest expression in LumA and lowest expression in Basal subtypes; and (iii) the largest fraction of DV genes with higher variance old LEP had highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes (Fisher’s exact test Bonferroni adj. p&lt;0.05); in contrast (iv) DV genes with higher variance in young LEP showed no association between subtype and median expression levels [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• A previously published association between GRHL2 and SGSM2, and E-cadherin downregulation is noted, however, no mention of E-cadherin expression in this dataset is discussed to determine whether a similar reprogramming is present.</p></disp-quote><p>In addressing the expert reviewer's observations regarding our findings on E-cadherin (CDH1), we acknowledge the lack of differential expression with age in LEPs (adj. p=0.86). Despite the positive correlation between the expression of GRHL2 and SGSM2 in LEPs (R=0.47, p=0.014), our analysis indicates no significant linear association with CDH1 expression [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-D</xref>]. Given E-cadherin’s pivotal role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity within epithelial structures, its stable expression in the context of aging in normal cells aligns with expectations and is consistent with established biological principles, particularly as perturbations in E-cadherin expression are often correlated with oncogenic transformation.</p><p>The point raised by the reviewer is indeed insightful and has been incorporated into our Discussion section. This addition underscores the concept of 'priming' in cellular pathways during aging—a process we have previously documented (Sayaman, Miyano et al., bioRxiv 2021). In this process, certain pathway components undergo expression changes that set the stage for potential dysregulation as aging progresses.</p><p>Moreover, it is important to note that while the initiation of cancer requires a precipitating oncogenic event, our findings suggest that the cellular groundwork for accelerated malignancy progression may be laid by such age-associated changes. In a parallel observation, we have noted dysregulation of MYC targets in the aging milieu, although MYC itself does not exhibit such dysregulation. This nuance has been elaborated upon as a salient point in our discussion, emphasizing the complexity of gene regulation and pathway interaction in the aging landscape.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>CDH1</italic> shows no age-dependent change in expression in luminal epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of <italic>CDH1</italic> in young vs. old LEP with DE adj. <italic>p-values</italic>.

Our foundational work established the gradual loss of lineage fidelity as a consequence of aging, characterized by a decline in the specific expression of certain lineage markers, without affecting the expression of other key lineage-specific markers or the overall phenotypic and histological distinctions between luminal epithelial progenitors (LEPs) and myoepithelial progenitors (MEPs) as reported in (Miyano, Sayaman et al., Aging 2017). This study analyzed the expression of five LEP-specific and five MEP-specific biomarkers through qPCR, with microarray data from LEP and MEP samples (n=4 young &lt;30y and n=5 old &gt;55y) serving as a validation tool. The limited sample size meant that the microarray analysis was predominantly effective for differential expression (DE) analysis between LEP and MEP samples, where effect sizes were significant enough for reliable detection. Age-related effects were evaluated within gene sets through the use of hierarchical clustering algorithms, although not explicitly quantified at the individual gene level through DE analysis between the younger and older cells. Additionally, our Aging 2017 publication recognized non-cell autonomous aging mechanisms via our LEP/MEP co-culture system.</p><p>Building upon the findings from our 2017 study, we proposed that the aging-related alterations observed could affect the genome-wide preservation of lineage fidelity, potentially influencing susceptibility to cancer initiation in breast tissue. Employing a more robust RNA-seq dataset, which includes the cell strains from the earlier microarray analysis, we demonstrated that the reduction in lineage fidelity at the genomic expression level is a global aging phenomenon. This comprehensive dataset enabled us to establish a statistical definition for loss of fidelity and conduct a detailed statistical analysis of age dependent differential expression (DE) and differential variability (DV), revealing two distinct patterns of age-related changes—directional and variant responses—that are implicated in the observed loss of lineage fidelity with age. Lastly, we provided evidence that these age-related DE and DV alterations in LEPs are biologically significant and relate to breast cancer subtype differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Some axes are a bit hard to understand.

We have taken steps to verify the reproducibility of isolating LEPs and MEPs using different LEP markers (CD227, MUC1 and CD133, PROM1) and MEP markers (CD10, MME and CD271, NGFR), ensuring comparability. This reproducibility is evident in the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples, which consistently groups samples from the same subject together, irrespective of the FACS strategy or RNA-seq batch used [see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and the updated <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>].

MEP markers CD271 (NGFR) and CD10 (MME) were found to be highly expressed in the Basal cell type. It is noteworthy that the CD133/CD271 marker combination was exclusively used to isolate LEP and MEP populations in organoid systems, thereby excluding the ER+ luminal population.

For the section related to Figure 2 and associated supplementary data, using the expression change of ligands and receptors to identify disruption of lineage-specific signaling pathways would be less robust than using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the changes of various signaling pathways between LEP and MEP as a function of aging because gene expression of ligands and receptors does not always translate to their protein expression and signaling pathways are often modulated by posttranslational modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is predicated on the ranking of differentially expressed (DE) genes, which can sometimes miss the nuances of cell-cell communication, especially where the disruption is due to the loss of either lineage-specific expression of ligands or their cognate receptors. This limitation is exemplified in our approach depicted in [new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>], which demonstrates scenarios where GSEA may not fully capture the complexity of ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p>In the instance of younger cells (&lt;30 years), as shown in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ai</xref>], we note active lineage-specific signaling in both directions, and GSEA successfully identifies the associated pathways for both ligands and receptors. Conversely, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>] presents a scenario in which the age-related loss of LEP specific receptor expression occurs. Here, LEP receptor DE is identified and its pathway is detected by GSEA. The illustration in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aiii</xref>] represents a contrasting case where the MEP-specific expression of the cognate ligand is lost with age. Although the MEP ligand DE and its pathway are recognized by GSEA, the LEP receptor does not show DE, hence its pathway remains undetected by GSEA.</p><p>Our methodology overcomes this by including the LEP receptor in our functional enrichment analysis in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aiii</xref>], thereby accounting for the MEP-directed LEP receptor signaling pathway. This approach acknowledges the shift in cell-cell signaling homeostasis to a state where only LEP → LEP signaling predominates. We view these disruptions in cell-cell signaling as critical areas for further research.</p><p>Equally noteworthy, as seen in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>], even when the lineage-specific expression of both LEP and MEP ligands is preserved, our functional enrichment methodology still captures the dysregulation of both MEP ligand and LEP ligand pathways due to loss of the LEP receptor. This is particularly relevant when such dysregulation is due to the absence of the cognate receptor, metaphorically similar to the ineffectiveness of communication that occurs when one is 'shouting into the void'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should state whether there are limited lineage-specific genes that show reduced expression variance in the old LEPs and MEPs in comparison to the young ones to demonstrate that the increased expression variance is aging-dependent in the mammary epithelial cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The genes with decrease in variance with age (DV adj. p&lt;0.05, log2 fold change in dispersion&lt;0) were reported in [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1C and 1D</xref>]. We did not focus on genes which showed a decrease in variance with age as interpretation of this phenomenon was more complicated and required gene-level examination. For one, it could mean that the dynamic range in older cells remained within the expected functional range of the gene as seen in younger cells. However, a decrease in variance could also reflect gene expression being turned on or off in the older cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While it is reasonable to suggest that genes with an increased variance of expression during aging may contribute to loss of lineage fidelity during aging, the rationale for including them for clustering and predicting breast cancer subtypes in Figure 6 needs to be further supported by evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>This question is at the heart of the manuscript, and we have included this response in the Results and Discussion sections. We proposed that aging mechanisms operate through at least two distinct pathways: (i) General dysregulatory mechanisms, which were reflected in directional age-dependent changes that share common features with known cancer mechanisms. These changes contribute to an increased overall susceptibility to cancer as individuals age. (ii) Individual-specific dysregulatory mechanisms, which were identified by variations in aged populations. These variations may help us understand why certain individuals have higher vulnerability to cancer (i.e., not all aged individuals develop cancer), and why those who do develop specific cancer subtypes.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering and machine learning (ML) algorithms can effectively capture the influence of DV genes. It is worth noting that even DE genes inherently exhibit variability. We suggest that by integrating the variability in aging responses, we can gain further insights that not only enable the identification of key branching points in clustering and the most relevant age-dependent biomarkers in classification but also help us understand the varying susceptibility of individuals to specific breast cancer subtypes. Indeed, we found 98% of age-dependent DE and DV genes in LEPs (580 of 589 genes in the TCGA cohort) to be differential expressed between PAM50 intrinsic subtypes (KW BH adj. p&lt;0.05, post hoc Wilcoxon BH adj. p&lt;0.05) [new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1A and 1B</xref>]. When we further analyzed median expression of DE and DV genes across PAM50 LumA, LumB, Her2 and Basal subtypes, we found differential distribution of median expression across subtypes: (i) the largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in young LEP had the highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes; (ii) the largest fraction of DE genes upregulated in old LEP had highest expression in LumA and lowest expression in Basal subtypes; and (iii) the largest fraction of DV genes with higher variance old LEP had highest expression in Basal and lowest expression in LumB subtypes (Fisher’s exact test Bonferroni adj. p&lt;0.05); in contrast (iv) DV genes with higher variance in young LEP showed no association between subtype and median expression levels [new Figure 7—figure supplement 1A].</p><p>Of interest, in our analysis of the predictive power of DE and DV genes in identifying PAM50 subtypes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>], we observed that DV genes were strong predictors (scaled variable contribution ≥ 25%) of PAM50 LumA, LumB and Her2 subtypes and bore no strong predictive value for PAM50 Basal subtypes. Luminal subtypes are by far the most associated with aging and we hypothesized that increased variances may underly the transcriptomic architecture of luminal cancer subtypes. Thus, we speculate that inclusion of DV genes in LEP could lead to better predictors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should explain how siRNA-mediated knockdown can be used to reduce the level of variance of GJB6 and to constrain specific molecular noise.

The authors should consider analyzing, or at least discussing, the potential interaction among aging, menopause, and obesity of mammoplasty reduction donors in regulating gene expression and expression variance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the potential interaction between aging, menopause, and obesity in the context of reduction mammoplasty donors above. Further evaluation of obesity and parity-related gene expression patterns, as described by Burkholder et al. (BCR 2020) and Santucci-Pereira et al. (BCR 2019), was provided within the framework of our identified age-related gene expression patterns [refer to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>]. The genes displaying directional and variant responses in LEPs and MEPs were found to be distinct from those previously reported to be associated with obesity, parity, and time since full-term pregnancy (FTP) in breast tissue. Specifically, our age-dependent DE and DV genes in LEPs and MEPs showed minimal overlap with published gene sets related to obesity, parity, and time since FTP. This observation is bolstered by our scGSEA analysis of the Murrow et al. dataset, where enrichment of the aging LEP signature in luminal and basal compartments was found to be only marginally affected by parity or obesity [refer to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>], thus reinforcing our findings in bulk tissue.</p><p>Moreover, our prior publications have demonstrated that hallmark aging changes in mammary epithelia and breast tissue are expedited in young pre-menopausal women with germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 (Shalabi et al., Nature Aging 2021; Miyano, Sayaman et al., Cancer Prevention Research 2021; Zirbes et al., JMGBN 2021).

This study follows on earlier findings from LaBarge lab that revealed the loss of lineage fidelity induced by aged myoepithelial cells (MEP), but the effects manifesting in luminal epithelia (LEP). In-depth bioinformatical analyses of these ex vivo cultures, followed by interrogation of public datasets and some experimental studies validate and expand earlier inferences made with a limited subset of lineage-specific markers. More importantly, these analyses enable authors to make several well-supported novel inferences of high conceptual, biological and clinical importance. This is a substantially revised manuscript, and the technical concerns raised by previous reviewers appear to be adequately addressed/resolved.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Use of a large panel of early passage LEP and MEP lineage isolates, rigorously validated to adequately reflect in situ lineage phenotypes. The large number of samples enabled authors to discover the contribution of between-individual variability, which would not be possible with a smaller number of samples.</p><p>This study provides additional support for prior hypothesis that age-related increase in cancer incidence reflects loss of proper specification of LEP lineage.</p><p>In-depth unbiased interrogation of transcriptional differences between young and old lineages enabled new network-level insights that substantially advance our understanding of this under-appreciated contributor to the causal link between increased cancer risk and aging.</p><p>Definition of gene signatures of young and old LEP enabled the authors to infer the premature aging effects of chemotherapy exposure and BRCA mutations – supporting the author's suggestion that aged LEP lineage could be potentially used as a leading marker of physiological breast epithelia aging which could be useful for both risk stratification and deeper understanding of breast cancer etiology. On the latter, the analyses found no evidence of increased aging with parity and BMI, important breast cancer risk factors, suggesting distinct causality from that of aging, chemo and BRCA mutations.</p><p>To this reviewer, the most conceptually intriguing inference is the contribution of aging-associated increase in variability between samples. Aging-related increases in variability between individuals have been noted in some prior studies, but this phenomenon appears to be underappreciated and understudied. The lack of attention likely reflects unclear sequela of the phenomenon, as the consequences of variability are not intuitively obvious. Unlike the directional changes in specific genes, the enhanced variability does not lend to a straightforward hypothesis addressable via reductionist experimental pipelines. This study sheds new light on the potential consequences of this between-individual variability. First, it makes a compelling argument that the increased individual-individual variability is a substantial contributor to age-related lineage fidelity in both LEP and MEP lineages. Second, by highlighting the observed variability ins specific cancer-related genes, the authors make a logically sound argument that this between-individual variability likely translates to between-individual differences in age-related cancer risk.</p><p>Experimental documentation that normalization of expression of gap junction GJB6 gene, up-regulated in a subset of old MEPs prevents the induction of aged phenotypes in LEP suggests the possibility of a potential pharmacological rejuvenation of breast epithelia that could potentially reduce cancer risk. At this point, this is a far shot as the clear path to pharmacological intervention is lacking. Still, this is an important proof of principle that supports the utility of follow-up efforts in this direction.</p><p>Importantly, while this work focuses exclusively on breast epithelia, given the universality of aging-related physiological alterations across all tissues, and the concomitant increase in cancer incidence, this study suggests the potential utility of investigating the relevance of the above findings towards other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much, we appreciate your thoughtful commentary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Limitations.</p><p>The conclusions are primarily based on bioinformatical inferences from cultured cells.

Due to the extensive cost and effort in validating the specificity of antibodies for histological and immunofluorescence analyses, we believe this effort is better suited to follow-up manuscripts that explore mechanisms of action and functional validation of our findings that are underway in our laboratory. However, we have published multiple papers showing some of the age-dependent gene expression changes that are reported also herein as part of some of the large gene sets that came out of these analyses. KRT14 and ELF5 changes in LEPs, and KRT19 changes in MEPs are cardinal examples that we reported and that others have confirmed. The histological observations from these earlier works, in part, motivated the computational genome-wide exploration in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Per the last point in the public review, the connection of between sample variability and between cell variability needs to be elaborated.

We are very pleased that our message came across the page in a clear manner. As R1 states we are far away from any application that harnesses or targets increased variance genes towards a therapeutic end.</p><p>Regarding the link between the increase in heterogeneity observed in samples from older individuals and our findings here of the increase in variability between individuals as they age, we expanded the Discussion section to elaborate on the topic as suggested:</p><p>“Moreover, in our view, this age-dependent differential variability between individuals is linked to the described increase in cellular heterogeneity in older individuals in single-cell studies, where aged cells were shown to have increased transcriptional variability and loss of transcriptional coordination compared to younger cells of the same tissue (Enge et al., 2017; Kowalczyk et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2020; Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2017). We had previously proposed that this within-sample transcriptional variability which leads to the identification of cell states and cell sub-populations in scRNAseq data, in turn, leads to the observed shifts in transcriptomes at the cell population and tissue-level in RNAseq data between samples (Todhunter et al., 2018). As this gene expression shift in the cell population and tissue-level varies per individual and is dependent on the distribution of specific cell states and identified cell sub-populations in any specific individual, transcriptomic profiles of samples from some older individuals can deviate from the mean expression observed in the studied cohort. Thus, we suggest that the increase in cellular heterogeneity with age underlies the population-level increases in variances between the individuals. Indeed, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed how variations in cellular characteristics within specific cell lineages, as identified by defined cell states, were strongly linked to particular samples—underscoring the significance of differential variability between individuals.”</p><p>This concept is largely illustrated in Figure 2 of Todhunter and Sayaman et al., Curr Op in Cell Bio 2018, and we think we have shown formal evidence of this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the previous point, I found the description of the premise and inferences from the GJB6 down-regulation experiment very confusing. In my opinion, this part warrants a separate manuscript as it will be probably lost in the already massive amount of work presented in the manuscript. If this is unrealistic at this point and/or if the authors disagree with this suggestion, I recommend to either elaborate the rationale and conclusions more clearly or to simplify. The hypothesis presented in line 556 is not entirely clear to me, and 6C schemata is insufficient to clarify. The authors interpret the effect of GJB6 downregulation in preventing the imposition of aged phenotype on LEPs as supporting variance as the driver of stereotypic aging phenotypes (lines 582-585). Perhaps this was stated in the hypothesis illustrated by 6C, but I could not understand the connection, and the reasoning appears to be somewhat contrived. It is unclear whether the stable difference in GJB6 expression between different MEP isolates can be attributed to the effects of noise. There seems to be an implicit assumption of between-cell variability in increased GHB6 expression in aged MEP, and that higher between-sample variability somehow emerges from this cell level variance – but this is not stated explicitly, and no evidence of variability between MEP cells from the same isolate is provided. If the authors see a logically clear connection that is missed by this reviewer, there should be a way to elaborate it more clearly. Otherwise, the more on-the surface (and probably more trivial) inference is that (a) between sample variability is of biological significance, as upregulation of GHB6 ages LEPs, and (b) the result indicates a potential utility of pharmacological intervention to suppress LEP aging. The experimental part of this section could benefit from elaboration as well. Does &quot; the subset of older MEPs with higher expression relative to younger MEPs&quot; refers to isolates with highest expression level? If so, it can be stated more explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this needed a clearer rationale and we have endeavored to provide that. In the response to the first set of reviewers, we had explained the rationale more clearly and have now incorporated this response into the manuscript:</p><p>“A key part of our variant responses hypothesis is that tuned windows of expression is essential for proper function, and deviations either up or down from this range in older individuals could lead to aging-dependent dysregulation. Thus, selective KD of upregulated genes or overexpression of downregulated genes in specific MEP samples that show outlier expression would be ideal; however, as tuning windows of expression are difficult to achieve experimentally by overexpression, our co-culture experiments focused on KD of DV genes in specific old MEP samples where we see upregulated expression above the 75% quantile distribution in young MEP samples. Thus, we asked whether knockdown or inhibition of <italic>GJB6</italic> expression in the older MEPs with the highest expression, relative to younger MEPs, could restore proper signaling between LEPs and MEPs. To test this, we used our established heterochronous co-culture system and measured recovery of LEP expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> as a readout of biological age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). MEP cell strains used in KD experiments were specifically selected to be the samples from older women with ~2-fold increase expression of GJB6 that were above the 75% quantile distribution of GJB6 expression in young MEP.”</p><p>Additionally, we considered adding more data to the paper that are part of our ongoing studies in support of the concept that controlling the expression levels of highly variant genes (like GJB6) in MEPs could exert an impact on LEPs, but both reviewers have remarked upon the already comprehensive nature of this paper. Thus, we provide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref> that shows a summary of a series of experiments whereby we expressed shRNAs in an old MEP strain (n=1) to silence subset of genes that showed either age dependent DE (increased in O v Y) or DV (increased in a subset of O v Y); we then performed a 10 day heterochronus culture with young LEPs as we show in the manuscript for GJB6. The trend seems to be that oMEPs modified with shRNAs against most of the DV genes positively impacted ELF5 expression levels in yLEPs, whereas silenced DE genes did not have as strong an effect. The summary of these data is provided below. Taken together with the GJB6 example it is tempting to speculate that these highly variant genes may be highly connected to pathways in MEPs that exert a biological aging effect on LEPs.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of genes that show age-dependent upregulation or increased variability in old MEPs lead to increase expression of ELF5 in co-cultured young LEP.</title><p>Genes identified as DE or DV via RNA-seq and proteins identified as DE via mass spec are knocked-down in old MEP, followed by 10 day heterochronus culture with young LEP.

As LEPs exhibited the vast majority of age-dependent DE changes, we further hypothesized that LEPs serve as integration nodes for dysregulation in MEPs where variant changes converge via common pathways that lead to directional changes in genes downstream of these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 274-287 confer a key inference of the insufficiency of directional changes to explain loss of lineage fidelity.

We found that only 9% of the lineage-specific DE loss was attributable to age dependent DE in either LEPs or MEPs (adj. <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Expanding our criteria to include genes with at least a 2-fold change in DE due to age, we found that these age-related changes accounted for only 21% of the observed loss in lineage-specific expression. This led to a notable reduction in the difference in expression levels between LEP- and MEP-specific genes in older cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Further analysis showed that the age-related DE genes in LEPs and MEPs did not overlap with genes associated with obesity, parity, or time since full-term pregnancy in breast tissue (Burkholder et al., 2020; Santucci-Pereira et al., 2019) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>).

Comparisons with publically available datasets for single cell RNA sequencing of breast tissue find overlap with aging-dependent differences as well as response to chemotherapy and presence of BRCA mutations.

It may be that the loss of epithelial lineage fidelity is the underlying cause of aging, but these changes will occur in combination with reciprocal changes in stromal cell types, and these may contribute to epigenetic programming and differential variability. This possibility could be evaluated as an extension of the dataset comparisons in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have been working for some years now to understand contribution from the stromal cell types (e.g., fibroblasts and immune cells) to aging phenotypes that we observe in epithelia. We view epithelia as the terminal recipients in breast of age dependent changes. In its entirety this is a massive problem and as such we are breaking our analysis and experiments in smaller parts.</p><p>We have expanded the original Discussion text as follows to address the stated limitations:</p><p>“Aging associated changes in the immune response were further implicated through our ligand receptor pair analysis where we identified known immune-associated ligands and receptors that exhibited loss of lineage-specific expression in breast epithelia. We had previously shown that <italic>in situ</italic> innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration of the breast epithelia and interstitial stroma change with age consistent with a decline in immune surveillance and increased immunosuppression (Zirbes et al., 2021). How age-dependent changes in other cell types in the breast including stromal, vascular, and immune cell populations are linked to the dysregulation of epithelial signaling with age remains to be fully elucidated. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of FACS isolated primary immune, stromal, and vascular cell types from normal breast tissue had identified lineage-specific expression of ligands and receptors that could contribute to dynamic and reciprocal signaling between cell types in the breast interactome (Del Toro et al., 2024). Thus, reciprocal changes in these other cell types may contribute to the differential variability observed in epithelial cell types via cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>This study was carefully performed and beautifully presented. The results argue for a new paradigm of aging in the breast, and it is to be expected that these concepts will be challenging to parse. I have no major issues with any aspect of the study. One point that could benefit from clarification is the concept that gene expression changes precede oncogene alterations. This was briefly alluded to in the manuscript, but the interpretation of this was unclear to me: are the authors suggesting that epigenetic activation of gene expression networks may support oncogenic gene activations that will drive the same pathways? If so, this point could benefit from further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper itself is originally part of larger computationally-focused manuscript analyzing matched gene expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) data which is available on bioRxiv (Sayaman and Miyano et al., 2021: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.430777v1) where we provide more thorough treatment of this topic. Due the length and complexity of the subject, we decided to split the paper with this manuscript focused on gene expression; we aim to submit the companion DNAm manuscript after publication of this paper. Our DNAm manuscript tackles the concept of “epigenetic priming” that we believe precedes and contributes to oncogenic activation and we summarize key points below:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Epigenetic changes recapitulated the loss of lineage fidelity we observed in gene expression, and age-dependent differential methylation (DM) changes were overwhelmingly found in the LEP lineage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A majority of lineage-specific and age-dependent differentially expressed genes had differentially methylated (DM) regions, particularly in promoter-proximal regions, and showed negative correlation between expression and DNAm levels. This suggested that epigenetic alterations lead to the metastability of gene expression changes. DM genes likewise showed enrichment for Hallmark pathways that have been shown to play a role in cancer progression.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interestingly, there were also a large fraction of genes in LEPs with age-dependent DM of CpG sites that did not have concomitant gene expression changes with age.</p></list-item><list-item><p>These same CpG sites were also DM in cancers, and the corresponding genes were highly expressed in a subtype-specific manner and relative to their matched normal tissue.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moreover, these age-dependent DM sites were also binding sites for transcription factors that are upregulated in specific breast cancer subtypes relative to normal tissue.</p></list-item></list><p>These findings led us to hypothesize that these demethylated CpG sites in older women are “primed” and could provide a mechanism for both aging-associated increase in cancer susceptibility and differential susceptibility between individuals to cancer initiation as they age and the development of specific cancer subtypes. We propose that gene activation may occur during cancer initiation in the subset of women with dysregulated expression of TFs that bind these age-dependent DM regions. And because some these TFs themselves are differentially variably expressed in older LEPs, it could explain why only certain individuals develop cancer and in subtype-specific manner. It is however important to note that genes with oncogenic activation had further DNAm changes outside the regions that are DM with age, which suggests that further epigenetic alterations might occur to stabilize the tumorigenic state.</p><p>We added the following brief statement to the discussion to address Reviewer 2’s comments:</p><p>“That age-dependent changes are evident in epithelial lineages isolated from primary HMEC cultures suggest a degree of epigenetic stability that allow aged epithelial cells to occupy metastable states. Indeed, our examination of DNA methylation in matched LEP and MEP samples showed age-dependent differential methylation (DM) at promoter proximal regions of DE genes and negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in these samples (Miyano et al., 2017, Sayaman et al., 2021). DM genes in older LEPs likewise showed enrichment for signaling pathways that have been shown to play a role in cancer progression (Sayaman et al., 2021). Moreover, LEPs of older women also exhibited loss of epigenetic suppression of retrotransposons that affect regulation of genes with oncogenic potential, specifically genes associated with luminal breast cancers (Senapati et al., 2023). Thus, age-dependent activation of gene expression networks in older breast epithelia that are stabilized through concomitant age-dependent changes in the epigenetic landscape could prime aged epithelia for oncogenic gene activation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
