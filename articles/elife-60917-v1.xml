Trade-offs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation—such as mutations or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways—can also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. We find that a highly conserved RNA-modifying enzyme, the pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB, can act as a prion, endowing yeast with greater proliferation rates at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Cells harboring the prion grow larger and exhibit altered protein synthesis. This epigenetic state, [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] (<italic>b</italic>etter <italic>i</italic>n <underline><italic>g</italic></underline>rowth), allows cells to heritably yet reversibly alter their translational program, leading to the differential synthesis of dozens of proteins, including many that regulate proliferation and aging. Our data reveal a new role for prion-based control of an RNA-modifying enzyme in driving heritable epigenetic states that transform cell growth and survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells make different proteins to perform different tasks. Each protein is a long chain of building blocks called amino acids that must fold into a particular shape before it can be useful. Some proteins can fold in more than one way, a normal form and a ‘prion’ form. Prions are unusual in that they can force normally folded proteins with the same amino acid sequence as them to refold into new prions. This means that a single prion can make many more that are inherited when cells divide. Some prions can cause disease, but others may be beneficial.</p><p>Pus4 is a yeast protein that is typically involved in modifying ribonucleic acids, molecules that help translate genetic information into new proteins.

The results also describe how cells balance a tradeoff between growth and lifespan without any changes in the genome. This helps to highlight that genetics do not always explain the behaviors of cells, and further methods are needed to better understand cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prions</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>RNA modification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM109680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Enrichment Program 1015119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AG013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeberlein</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Edgar A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM125162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakobson</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2-GM119140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF-CAREER-MCB116762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholar Award (14-SSP-210)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011034</institution-id><institution>Sidney Kimmel Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kimmel Scholar Award (SFK-15-154)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarosz</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David &amp;

Although they can be independently controlled—for example, when cell division is disrupted, cell size continues to increase, whereas restricting cell growth does not completely inhibit division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Johnston et al., 1977</xref>)—coupling is common due to their dependence on the same biochemical building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Su and O’Farrell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). Changing cell size and proliferation genetically or through chemical perturbation—whether via diet, nutrient sensing (e.g., TOR signaling), or growth factor signaling and stress responses—also impacts lifespan across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Pitt and Kaeberlein, 2015</xref>). The importance of tightly controlling each of these properties is underscored by the many mutations affecting cell size and proliferation that are pathogenic, leading to cancer, developmental abnormalities, and numerous diseases of age (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Organisms commonly alter the relationship between cell size and proliferation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Su and O’Farrell, 1998</xref>). In oocytes of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, for example, a massive expansion in cytoplasmic volume without cellular division precedes a later step of numerous cellular divisions without cytoplasmic growth. The rates of cell size increase and proliferation can be strongly coupled to nutrient sensing and changes in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Turner et al., 2012</xref>).

Epigenetic tuning of cell size and proliferation could in principle provide a stable yet reversible mechanism to alter the relationship between these properties according to differing needs in fluctuating environments. Histone modifications can enable such adaptation in a way that can be heritable over several mitotic divisions. However, apart from a few notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Catania et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>), most studied examples are erased during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Moazed, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Prions are distinct among epigenetic mechanisms in that they are faithfully transmitted through both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Garcia and Jarosz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wickner, 1994</xref>). The unusual folding landscape of prion proteins, which allows the recruitment of proteins from the naïve to the prion fold, promotes a mode of inheritance that is both stable and reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">McKinley et al., 1983</xref>). For example, transient perturbations in molecular chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>), specific environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Singh et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Tuite et al., 1981</xref>), or regulated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kabani et al., 2014</xref>) can induce or eliminate prion states. It is now appreciated that this form of information transfer is far more common than previously realized, occurring not only in mammals but also in wild fungi, plants, and even bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chakrabortee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Halfmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yuan and Hochschild, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the inheritance of a prion-based epigenetic state that alters yeast cell physiology, potentiating a trade-off between proliferation and lifespan.

We then quantitatively model the adaptive value of this <italic>‘live fast, die young’</italic> growth strategy in fluctuating environments. [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells are larger and exhibit increased protein synthesis while maintaining Pus4-dependent pseudouridylation activity. Finally, we find evidence for analogous Pus4-dependent epigenetic control of cell size in wild yeast. The epigenetic inheritance of an altered form of an RNA-modifying enzyme over long biological timescales, as occurs in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], reveals a new mechanism by which regulation of these activities can be perpetuated across generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cells bearing a prion-like epigenetic element live fast and die young</title><p>We recently discovered more than 40 protein-based epigenetic elements in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that are both heritable and reversible upon transient perturbation of protein chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>). Many of the proteins that underlie this behavior have the potential to regulate growth. One of these epigenetic states was induced by transient overexpression of the highly conserved pseudouridine synthase <italic>PUS4</italic>/TRUB, which catalyzes the formation of a ubiquitous pseudouridine on U55 in tRNAs in bacteria, yeast, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gutgsell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Zucchini et al., 2003</xref>). Mutation of U55 leads to large fitness deficits, second only to mutations in the tRNA anticodon loop, highlighting the functional importance of this nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

Upon closer examination, we noticed that cells harboring the Pus4-induced element also achieved an ~60% faster maximal proliferation rate than naïve cells in the absence of zinc stress in standard rich medium (YPD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, p=0.0095, unpaired t-test).

We tested two versions of the firefly luciferase gene: the first contained the standard suite of firefly mRNA codons; the second produced an identical protein product, but via codons that are rarer in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, reducing steady-state protein levels by approximately fivefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). Each plasmid contained an identical <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene with its natural set of codons that served as an internal control (normalizing for copy number and general transcriptional activity). The firefly reporter with normal codons did not produce more luciferase activity in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells than in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

This is because commitment to S phase entry—budding of a daughter yeast cell—depends on sufficient production of proteins needed to replicate the genome and essential cellular structures. Accelerating the production of these factors can thus shorten this period. We measured the fraction of naïve and [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by counting the fraction of unbudded cells (i.e., cells in G1).

We tested this idea using two methods: (1) 2-D gel electrophoresis on pulse-labeled, newly synthesized proteins, and (2) a screen for differential expression of over 5000 GFP-tagged proteins.</p><p>We pulse-labeled [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine into newly synthesized proteins for 1 hr and then separated total protein using 2-D gel electrophoresis. Although labeling for less time than a cell division limited the number of newly synthesized proteins we could measure, we chose this time to minimize the contributions from factors other than protein synthesis, such as degradation. We observed [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine counts of 9.7 cpm/µg and 11.5 cpm/µg protein from naïve and [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, respectively, indicating that cells harboring the prion synthesized proteins faster than naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We also analyzed the [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine signal from 13 proteins that we could separate by 2-D gel electrophoresis. In [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, seven were increased, one was decreased, and five remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). These data suggest that [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells have an altered translation program, with variations in even the most rapidly synthesized proteins.</p><p>To identify specific proteins with altered levels in prion-containing cells, we capitalized on the dominance of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] in genetic crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), mating haploid cells harboring the prion to a genome-wide collection of superfolder-GFP gene fusions (‘SWAT’ library; ~ 5500 ORFs; fused seamlessly to retain endogenous promoter/regulatory elements; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Weill et al., 2018</xref>). Equivalent matings between naïve strains and this genome-wide collection served as controls. To control for the potentially larger size of the [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] cells, we assessed protein levels in these diploid strains in terms of the relative GFP levels (normalized by OD<sub>600</sub> and Z-scored) within the naïve and [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] GFP-fusion collections separately. Mating and fluorescence measurements were performed in biological duplicate: the SWAT library was mated to two independent [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] isolates alongside naïve controls. The reported OD<sub>600</sub>-normalized GFP levels are the mean of two technical duplicates of each biological duplicate. Protein levels measured in this way were generally well correlated between naïve and [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] strains (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.76; p&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), in concordance with our results from electrophoresis of total cellular protein.

These proteins did not show any strong enrichment in physicochemical properties, nor were they enriched in Pus4-dependent pseudouridylation sites (see Appendix 1 for further discussion). We also did not observe a widespread increase in the expression of ribosomal proteins. We did, however, observe that proteins that were increased in [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] cells had a modest decrease in their codon adaptation index (CAI) at the 5' end of their mRNAs relative to all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), indicating that cells harboring the prion might more efficiently translate these messages. The dip in CAI that is typical in the 5' end of all genes, known as ‘translational ramping,’ is thought to reflect the bias toward translational control near the beginning of ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Frumkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>). (Lower CAI can both reduce the speed of elongation by requiring rarer tRNAs and lead to differences in mRNA structure that might also affect initiation or elongation efficiency.) These data are consistent with our luciferase reporter data in which rarer codons throughout the message output more protein in [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] than in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as well as the resistance of prion cells to the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Many hits were logically connected to the enhanced translation, increased size, and shortened lifespan of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells.

BC187 yielded the largest change upon curing, an ~40% reduction in the translation of a firefly luciferase containing a ‘normal’ suite of codons, similar in magnitude to what we had observed with [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] cells generated in the laboratory. Thus, since the loss of a chaperone-dependent epigenetic element reduced translational output from the reporter, the original, wild isolate (uncured) has higher protein synthesis, as we saw for [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] in the BY4741 laboratory strains.</p><p>Second, we examined the localization of Pus4 in BC187 and its Hsp70 cured derivative. We transformed uncured and cured strains with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged Pus4 protein and imaged cells using epifluorescence microscopy. In uncured cells, we observed Pus4 in a fragmented network throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), similar to what we observed in laboratory [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, in cured BC187 cells, the signal was more diffuse.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the relationship between Pus4 and cell size in BC187. The original [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] trait identified in laboratory yeast strains (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>) was induced after transient overexpression of Pus4 protein. Therefore, we tested whether transient overexpression of Pus4 protein could re-establish the large-cell phenotype in BC187 derivatives that had been subject to curing by transient Hsp70 inhibition. Indeed, cured BC187 cells treated in this way became large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). By contrast, transient overexpression of Pus4 did not increase the size of the already-large BC187 natural isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, re-initiation of this epigenetic trait could be accomplished with transient Pus4 overexpression alone, thereby bearing strong similarities to [<italic>BIG<sup>+</sup></italic>] in common laboratory strains and establishing Pus4 as a driver of epigenetic cell size control in this model eukaryote. Together, these observations suggest that epigenetic and potentially Pus4 prion-mediated control of mechanisms like [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] that we have described in the laboratory is also likely present in nature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epigenetic inheritance is most commonly thought to be driven by enzymes that modify chromatin and DNA. Here we show that an enzyme that catalyzes the epigenetic modification of RNA can itself be controlled by an extrachromosomal epigenetic process: a self-templating protein conformation that persists over long biological timescales. We found that prion cells not only maintain pseudouridylation activity but that activity can be increased, even without any detectable increase in <italic>PUS4</italic> expression. Future studies should address whether Pus4-dependent modification of <italic>TEF1/TEF2</italic> mRNA plays a role in the phenotypes of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] as this mRNA, which is the major non-tRNA substrate of Pus4, encodes a central elongation factor that binds to and escorts tRNAs to the ribosome. The modest changes we observed in the relative abundance of a few dozen mRNAs in actively growing cells do not appear to drive these growth or aging phenotypes based on their known functions.</p><p>Instead, we found that changes to the translational control of numerous genes are logically connected to these phenotypes. These include genes that affect cell size, chronological lifespan and replicative lifespan, translation control and ribosome biogenesis, and differential sensitivity to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Translation is a rate-limiting step for growth in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Polymenis and Schmidt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sonenberg, 1993</xref>) and is often activated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Other prions in yeast also affect translation, including [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] and [<italic>MOD</italic><sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudin-Baillieu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], they lead to losses of their underlying protein activities, impairing translation and, in turn, growth in many conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudin-Baillieu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, translation appears to be amplified—it is faster, leading to higher expression levels of many proteins. We are unaware of an example in the literature of a mutation that enhances translation under nutrient-replete conditions.</p><p>More investigation is needed to determine the precise mechanism by which translation is altered. Increased polysome density can be associated with increased translation (more protein produced per mRNA) or decreased translation (due to defects in elongation or termination leading to accumulation of ribosomes). However, multiple lines of evidence lead us to favor the former interpretation. First, [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells are resistant to the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide. Second, their rates of bulk translation as measured by [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation are also higher than naïve cells. General defects in translation elongation or termination, by contrast, would be expected to reduce this activity. Our luciferase reporter data shows an improved translation of mRNAs containing rare codons, which slow translation elongation. Finally, when measuring the proteome-wide effects on translation using our GFP screen, not only did we observe logical connections between the gene functions of altered proteins and the observed [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] growth phenotypes, but it was the proteins whose expression increased that contained a feature consistent with enhanced elongation of their mRNAs: their ORF 5′ ends had a lower CAI. Collectively, these data suggest an increase in translation elongation efficiency of many mRNAs as a parsimonious model.</p><p>The various possible mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive—some mRNAs in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells may indeed be translated faster to produce more protein without any defects and perhaps exhibit elevated rates of elongation and termination. In contrast, other mRNAs in the same cells may be subject to deficiencies at any of these steps. Examining protein synthesis at higher resolution, using methods like ribosome profiling, and in response to perturbations to ribosome-associated quality control pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandman and Hegde, 2016</xref>), may reveal the landscape of changes to protein synthesis in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells in greater detail.</p><p>Translation is also coupled to cell size, proliferation, and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ecker and Schaechter, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kaeberlein and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Lloyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Steffen and Dillin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tanenbaum et al., 2015</xref>). Cell size, which is determined in large part by the activity of the TOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fingar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>), has been inversely correlated with lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), and older cells are larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Egilmez et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, molecules that extend lifespan, such as rapamycin, also influence cell size and proliferation by restricting the cell’s translation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beretta et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Terada et al., 1994</xref>). Here we describe an epigenetic paradigm that links all of these fundamental cellular properties: translation, cell size, proliferation, and lifespan. In future studies, we plan to explore to what extent the effect on lifespan may serve as material for selection to favor or disfavor [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]. At present, we favor a hypothesis in which the aging defect of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells is due at least in part to pleiotropic consequences of their increased proliferation and translation capacity. Although these features have already been linked to aging in genetic studies, we note that such theories of antagonistic pleiotropy in aging are not without controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hughes and Reynolds, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The replicative lifespan of wild budding yeast strains varies widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kaya et al., 2015</xref>) and has been associated with changes in oxidative phosphorylation, respiration, and differences in metabolite biosynthesis. Genetic screening has also offered some insight into the genetic basis of this variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, genetic mapping efforts have identified polymorphisms underlying natural variation in chronological lifespan variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Kwan et al., 2011</xref>). The genetic architecture of natural lifespan, both chronological and replicative, remains obscure, however. Our data further demonstrate that it can be subject to strong epigenetic control.</p><p>We note that prior studies have characterized genetic links between cell size and lifespan in yeast—mutants that make cells larger tend to age faster, and older cells tend to be larger than younger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Zadrag-Tecza et al., 2009</xref>). [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] provides an epigenetic mechanism to alter these relationships heritably. Exerting epigenetic, rather than genetic, control over basic cell growth behaviors could be valuable in the face of fluctuations between nutrient-replete and nutrient-poor conditions. Theory predicts that such mechanisms can have substantial adaptive value when the frequency of environmental fluctuations is rare relative to the frequency of phenotypic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">King and Masel, 2007</xref>). In agreement with these inferences, our modeling quantitatively described the long-run selective advantage of this ‘<italic>live fast, die young</italic>’ prion state that we measured, illustrating the importance of considering not only steady-state phenotypes but also the ecological context in which prion states are expressed. Of particular relevance to this point is our data demonstrating that transient perturbation of Hsp70 activity can eliminate [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]. Conditions in which the prion confers a growth benefit match those that promote its propagation. Conversely, conditions in which the prion is detrimental, shortening lifespan, are also known to reduce chaperone expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Werner-Washburne et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Werner-Washburne and Craig, 1989</xref>) and could thereby cure the prion. The strong dependence of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] on chaperones therefore means that it is a natural epigenetic sensor of its environment.</p><p>Our data from wild yeast isolates demonstrates that cell size and protein synthesis can also be under epigenetic control in natural isolates and is influenced by Pus4. Exploring whether a [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic mechanism that promotes proliferation in nutrient-replete conditions is conserved in metazoans is a major goal for the future. Indeed, cancer cells also experience frequent oscillations in their environments: as tumors grow and metastasize, cells are exposed to shifting gradients of oxygen and glucose that influence their proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schito and Semenza, 2016</xref>). Regulation of cell physiology in these situations is best understood at the level of transcriptional changes due to the relative ease of profiling them. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that translational hyperactivation can also fuel pathological proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Robichaud et al., 2019</xref>). Our discovery of a protein-based mechanism that changes cell growth via engagement of an altered translational program argues for greater investigation into the epigenetic control of post-transcriptional processes in both normal biology and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Strains were stored as glycerol stocks (25% glycerol [Amersco, Solon, OH] in appropriate media) at –80°C and revived on YPD or amino acid dropout media before testing. Yeast were grown in YPD at 30°C on a TC-7 roller drum wheel (New Brunswick) unless indicated otherwise. Yeast transformations were performed with a standard lithium–acetate protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gietz et al., 1992</xref>).

A small globule of this cell mixture was then restreaked to single colonies on SD-Lys-Met agar plates to select for diploids.</p><p>Diploids constructed for the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> were made by crossing [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] or naïve haploids to the PCR-verified seamless GFP-Pus4 or seamless GFP-Par32 haploid strains, respectively. Due to overlapping auxotrophic makers in each parent strain, diploids could not be selected on dropout plates from cell mixtures. Instead, pools of the mated cells were grown in several successive competitions to allow diploids to outcompete haploid parents. Diploids were then isolated from single colonies, and verified using either microscopy to measure cell size (GFP-Pus4), which is significantly larger than either haploid parent, or PCR amplification of the GFP tag/ORF junction (GFP-Par32), which yielded two distinct bands matching the expected sizes of the wild-type allele and the tagged allele, in contrast to the haploid parental strains that yielded only one or the other band sizes. These isolated diploids were then imaged as described below.</p><p>Sporulations were performed inoculating single diploid colonies in Pre-SPO liquid media (YPD with 6% glucose) for 2 days at room temperature on a roller drum wheel. Cells were then pelleted and washed twice in SPO media (1% potassium acetate [Sigma, St. Louis, MO], 320 mg CSM-Met powder [Sunrise Scientific], 20 mg methionine [Sigma] per liter), and then diluted 10-fold into 3 mL cultures of SPO. These cultures were incubated on a rotary wheel for 1 week at room temperature, before dissecting tetrads on a Singer Instruments MSM400 (Somerset, England).</p><p>The 3XFLAG-Pus4 strains were constructed using PCR combined with the ‘Delitto Perfetto’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Storici and Resnick, 2006</xref>). Canavanine mutants were constructed by pelleting 500 µL of a saturated YPD liquid culture, resuspending it in 100 µL YPD and plating this on SD-Arg agar plates containing 60 µg/mL canavanine (Sigma), and growing for 2 days at 30°C. Single canavanine-resistant colonies were picked and re-tested for resistance before further testing.</p><p>Cytoductions were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>. A BY4742 strain with a defective <italic>KAR1</italic> allele (<italic>kar1-15</italic>) was created as an initial recipient for cytoplasmic transfer. This allele prevents nuclear fusion during mating while permitting cytoplasmic transfer. The strain carries auxotrophic markers distinct from those in the putative [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] or naïve donor strains, and was also converted to petite with growth on ethidium bromide (strains were grown in YPD with 25 µg/mL ethidium bromide for approximately two-dozen generations before testing for growth on YP-glycerol). This allowed cytoplasmic transfer to be scored through the restoration of mitochondrial respiration, while selecting for auxotrophic markers unique to the recipient strain. The recipient and donor strains were mixed together on YPD-agar and grown overnight, followed by selection of heterokaryons and resulting haploid cytoductants on dropout media (selecting for the BY4742 recipient strain markers) containing glycerol as a carbon source. One more round of selection was used while replica-plating onto a dual-selection agar plate (SD-Lys-Met) to confirm that the colonies were not diploids. One additional round of propagation on a non-selective plate was performed before doing ‘‘reverse cytoductions,’ which were performed in the same way except selecting for BY4741 auxotrophy in recipient naïve strain. In the reverse cytoductions, the donors were naïve or putative-[<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] BY4742 <italic>kar1-15</italic> cytoductants from the first round, and the recipients were wild-type or <italic>pus4</italic>∆ naïve BY4741 petite cells.</p><p>Transient <italic>PUS4</italic> deletion experiment strains were made by the Delitto Perfetto method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Storici and Resnick, 2006</xref>).

Three independent transformants of BC187 (previously cured by transient Hsp70 inhibition) bearing this plasmid were grown in SGalactose-Ura for 48 hr at 30°C. Overexpression was stopped by outgrowth in non-selective YPD medium for 48 hr. Strains lacking the overexpression plasmid were isolated by plating to single colonies on media containing 5-FOA. Uracil auxotrophy was confirmed before subsequent measurements of cell size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Growth assays</title><p>Biological replicates of each yeast strain were pre-grown in rich media (YPD).

Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to growth media at either 0.01 µg/mL or 0.05 µg/mL, as indicated. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was added to growth media at 10 µM. Cell growth was monitored with continuous measurements of OD<sub>600</sub> (approximately every 10 min) at 30°C over 96 hr using BioTek Eon or Synergy H1 microplate readers (Winooski, VT).

On days indicated, a dilution was made of each replicate to achieve dozens to hundreds of colonies on a YPD plate, which were then counted using a colony counter (Synbiosos Acolyte, Frederick, MD). Dilution was ~100,000× at early stages of the experiment and was later empirically determined due to significant cell death. We note that aging the cells in SPO did not lead to significant acidification (pH of old cultures was found to be &gt;5), as has been reported for cells aged in YPD, which contains high levels of glucose that upon metabolism leads to the secretion of organic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Murakami et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of replicative lifespan</title><p>RLS was assessed using the standard method of isolating virgin cells on agar YPD (2% glucose) plates, and then separating their daughter cells at each cell division by micromanipulation and counting the total number of daughters produced by each mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Steffen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wasko et al., 2013</xref>). Strains were streaked from glycerol stocks onto YPD plates and allowed to grow at 30°C until individual colonies could be selected for each strain. Colonies were lightly patched onto fresh YPD overnight and 20 cells were isolated by microdissection from each patch. These cells were incubated at 30°C for ~2 hr until they had formed daughter cells, at which time individual virgin daughter cells were selected and arrayed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Steffen et al., 2009</xref>) for lifespan analysis. From these, daughter cells were removed by microdissection and counted approximately every 2 hr during the day. Plates were maintained at 30°C during the day and placed at 4°C overnight. At least four independent replicates (arising from different colonies) of 20 individual mother cells each were measured for each strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Curing</title><p>Three regimes of chaperone inhibition were tested: (1) transient exposure to a dominant-negative version of Hsp70 (Ssa1) to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jarosz et al., 2014</xref>); (2) transient exposure to radicicol (RPI) to inhibit Hsp90 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>); and (3) transient exposure to guanidinium hydrochloride (Sigma) to inhibit Hsp104 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ferreira et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Regime 1 was performed by transforming cells with a plasmid, PDJ169, harboring a dominant-negative version of Hsp70 (Ssa1) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakrabortee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jarosz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lagaudriere-Gesbert et al., 2002</xref>). Transformants were picked and restreaked by hand or replica-pinned using a Singer HDA robot a total of 12 times on SD-Ura to promote Ssa1<sup>DN</sup> expression. (Anecdotally, we note that prion phenotypes are frequently cured with fewer than 12 restreaks, but for reasons of technical throughput, 12 were used in this experiment.) Then plasmids were eliminated by plating on media containing 5-fluoroortic acid (SD-Ura +0.1% 5-FOA + 50 µg/mL uracil) and plasmid loss was verified by replating on SD-Ura. Colonies were then tested for the elimination of prion phenotypes.

Before mixing cells, saturated cultures were measured to have near equal cell densities, and ‘time zero’ measurement was made by plating the initial cell mixture and counting the number of canavanine-resistant colony-forming units (CFUs) relative to total CFUs. These initial strain mixtures were then grown for 2 days on a roller drum wheel at 30°C, after which cells were diluted 50,000-fold or 25,000-fold and plated on YPD or canavanine plates, respectively. These plates were grown at 30°C for 2 days before counting colonies. The liquid cultures were diluted 1:1000 in 5 mL of fresh YPD, and this process was repeated nine more times. Swapping of canavanine resistance between naïve and [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] was done to correct for the potential of canavanine resistance to influence cell growth.

Therefore, as for data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> we also normalized firefly luciferase values to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase, which is expressed from the same plasmid.

After decanting the supernatant, pellets were quickly resuspended in ice-cold Polysome Lysis Buffer (PLB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Jan et al., 2014</xref>) (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 µg/mL cycloheximide, 1% Triton X-100, RNase-free reagents), 250 µL total PLB per sample. Resuspended pellets were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were weighed to ensure their weights were near equal and then thawed on ice. 250 µL of additional ice-cold PLB was added per sample, making slightly over 0.5 mL per sample. Samples were then flash-frozen in tiny pellets (‘yeast dippin’ dots’) by pipetting directly into a small dewar filled with liquid nitrogen and a wire mesh basket nested inside. Tiny pellets were then stored at –80°C until lysis. Samples were lysed using a Retsch Cryomill (Haan, Germany) with 25 mL canisters and the following program: pre-cool, then 12 cycles of 15 Hz × 3 min. Smears of lysate were stained with Trypan blue and imaged under a microscope to verify efficient lysis. (We suspect with larger sample volume:canister volume ratios, fewer cycles would be necessary.)</p><p>Lysates were loaded onto 10–50% sucrose gradients pre-poured on a BioComp Gradient Master 108 (Fredericton, ND, Canada). Lysates generally contained RNA concentrations around 12–18 µg/µL. 30 µL of lysate was carefully pipetted onto the top of the sucrose gradient, and samples were spun in a Beckman SW41 Ti Rotor for 2.5 hr at 4°C at 40,000 rpm. Gradients were analyzed on a Brandel fractionator (Gaithersburg, MD). Technical replicates (same lysate independently loaded onto separate gradients) showed a very high degree of similarity, as did biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>[<sup>35</sup>S]-Methionine pulse labeling</title><p>Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Esposito and Kinzy, 2014</xref>.

Comparing the altered gene set to yeast transcripts with more double-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kertesz et al., 2010</xref>), no relationship emerged. We also compared the gene list to mRNAs that have been experimentally validated to be pseudouridylated by Pus4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carlile et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Lovejoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>), but did not see any significant correlation or changes among the limited number targets that contained Pus4-dependent pseudouridylation sites in these studies, and which were present in the SWAT gene collection (13 genes overlapped these two categories). Given the limited reproducibility of mapping pseudouridylation sites transcriptome-wide in yeast from past studies, with large variability sample to sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Safra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zaringhalam and Papavasiliou, 2016</xref>), it is possible that the earlier studies missed possible Pus4 mRNA targets that could have been present in the list of altered genes. Therefore, we also created a position weight matrix (PWM) from an alignment of sequences centered around pseudouridine sites in tRNAs and mRNAs that were experimentally verified in the previous studies (41 sequences of 17 nucleotides in length), and then used this PWM to scan the yeast genome for other predicted Pus4 target sites. The scan produced 433 hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), which, when compared to 127 proteins that changed from the SWAT gene collection, overlapped by only five genes.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;.

The authors demonstrated that transiently overexpression of Pus4 induced an epigenetically controlled prion-like state that showed faster growth but shorter lifespan. These phenotype changes appeared to be linked to altered protein synthesis, a mechanistic insight that explains both the faster growth and shorter lifespan phenotypes. All reviewers are impressed with the study and think that this manuscript is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they also raised several concerns that should be addressed before this manuscript is accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The abstract and introduction lack deepness and incorporate some unclear concepts. For example:</p><p>Line 16 – The opening sentences of the abstract introduce a jargon that is not true for organismal aging. That can be true in the single cell level for some cell types and for some organisms, however; there is no general concept in the aging field that organisms are evolved to select one of these strategies. This sentence was not clarified in the introduction part with further details on the origin of this statement along with necessary references.</p><p>Line 18: &quot;Lifespan is often inversely correlated with cell size and proliferation&quot;. Similarly, this argument in the abstract was not explained in the introduction. Although, there are references regarding to the inverse correlation of cell size and lifespan, there has not been much argument/discussion and related reference about inverse correlation of proliferation rate and lifespan. In fact, in yeast, there is no defined general concept that describes inverse correlation between proliferation rate and aging. More clarification is needed on this statement.</p><p>2) All three reviewers pointed out some issues with Figure 4.

Overall, this is quite an intriguing paper to read. Most of the experiments were well thought out and designed, most of the data presented are clear and support their conclusions. However, there are a few issues that should be further addressed or clarified before it is accepted for publication.</p><p>1. In Figure 4G, it does appear that the cytoplasmic localization of Pus4 in [BIG+] cells is ER, maybe rough ER, which may support its function in mRNA pseudouridinylation and promoting protein synthesis. This may be further verified by using inducing [BIG+] in GFP-tagged ER marker or rough ER marker strains.</p><p>2. The data in Figure 5B are the least clear and convincing in this paper. It is difficult to tell the difference between [BIG+] and pus4del. These data should be quantified in the same way as Figure 7.</p><p>3. The assessment of RNA levels in [BIG+] cells is the biggest issue in this manuscript. RNA-seq from bulk cell sample should be used with spike-in controls normalizes to cell count in order to detect global mRNA level changes (PMID: 23101621). Also, it has been shown clearly that cell size is positively correlated with RNA content (PMID: 30718850). Hence, the levels of RNA or mRNA in each cell should be carefully determined, either by bulk RNA-seq with spike-in control, or single cell RNA-seq.</p><p>4. Figure 6 shows that [BIG+] cell growth was not efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and that [BIG+] cells have higher levels of polysomes. Hence, it should be tested whether TOR signaling is hyperactivated by [BIG+] and that whether this hyperactivation can be efficiently inhibited or attenuated by rapamycin. This can be done by analyzing the phosphorylation levels of Sch9, a target of TOR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Garcia et al., demonstrates a unique case of post-transcriptional modification &quot;pseudouridylation&quot;, on growth adaptation and its effect on lifespan. This modification is induced by transient overexpression of the highly conserved pseudouridine synthase PUS4/TRUB. Authors demonstrated that prion like state of the PUS4 gene affects yeast cell physiology and phenotypes including, growth rate, cell size and lifespan. Authors also connected these phenotype changes to translational regulation of small number of proteins with rare codons. Interestingly these phenotypes are altered without changing mRNA level, including total tRNA and ribosomal RNAs. In addition, global level of protein translation and/or abundance was not affected by this process. They concluded these observations in the light of several carefully designed and elegant experiments. Overall, findings are interesting, and manuscript is written well. As such, the manuscript will greatly promote progress in the field of studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging. However, there are several points to be clarified/improved, which will further strengthen the study. Therefore, the manuscript is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, and I recommend its publication after the following revisions are addressed.</p><p>1 – The abstract and introduction lack deepness and incorporate some unclear concepts. For example:</p><p>Line 16 – The opening sentences of the abstract introduce a jargon that is not true for organismal aging. That can be true in the single cell level for some cell types and for some organisms, however; there is no general concept in the aging field that organisms are evolved to select one of these strategies. This sentence was not clarified in the introduction part with further details on the origin of this statement along with necessary references.</p><p>Line 18: &quot;Lifespan is often inversely correlated with cell size and proliferation&quot;. Similarly, this argument in the abstract was not explained in the introduction. Although, there are references regarding to the inverse correlation of cell size and lifespan, there has not been much argument/discussion and related reference about inverse correlation of proliferation rate and lifespan. In fact, in yeast, there is no defined general concept that describes inverse correlation between proliferation rate and aging. More clarification is needed on this statement.</p><p>2 – Line 727: Authors claim &quot;These observations suggest that epigenetic, and potentially prion-mediated control of mechanisms like the [BIG+] prion that we have described here, may be widespread in nature&quot;. Out of 23 wild yeast isolates, authors only tested four of them and showed the cell size differences. Out of these 4 isolates, only 2 of them showed decreased translation. Authors are clearly cherry picking the results to convince that the observed BIG phenotype is widespread. From the data they present, it is not true. These wild isolates have been previously characterized to have many SNPs and different phenotypes under different stress conditions. Transient inhibition of Hsp70 may cause differences in cell phenotypes, including cell size by acting on different mechanism. The direct testing of BIG phenotype should be performed through transient expression of PUS4 in these strains and measuring the cell size. Also, strains with increased cell size should be subjected to RLS or CLS measurement to align with authors' conclusion. In addition, YPD medium specificity of BIG phenotype already indicates that it is not widespread and it is condition specific. I do not think any of these wild isolates' niches were similar to the YPD condition in their natural environment. Overall, this part is very weak and with the current version, it does not add any further strength to the findings.</p><p>3 – Authors conclude that this newly identified prion-based mechanism engages an altered translational program to favor a 'live fast, die young' strategy. There are several interesting findings in this manuscript, however they are somehow disconnected from each other. Basically how these findings are complementing to each other and to their role in observed phenotype need deeper discussion. In the discussion part, authors are only focusing on altered modification of TEF1/TEF2 elongation factors. Some of their findings have not been mentioned. For example, findings of 130 differentially expressed proteins with decreased codon adaptation index along with the findings of no decrease in global protein level are very interesting results. However, the authors seem to avoid discussing these findings. In addition, their findings about [BIG+] cells enhancing translation of some proteins, especially those containing a greater frequency of rare codons need more highlight and to be connected to other findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 :</italic></p><p>The authors report the discovery and characterization of [BIG+] a new yeast prion which shares some properties with other well-studied yeast prions, but also shows some differences, for example in chaperone dependency and physical state. That this prion can apparently control cell growth behaviour of both lab and wild strains of the organism is intriguing, but the precise mechanism by which this is achieved is not fully established in this study. In ruling out any impact on transcription and steady state mRNA/tRNA levels the focus is on a potential post-transcriptional mechanism involving differential synthesis of a relatively large number of proteins. Among the proteins identified there are a number of candidates that could explain the observed [BIG+] phenotypes of cell size and life span changes, but we are left with a list without any one in particular being pinpointed or directly linked to the [BIG+] phenotype.</p><p>There are two issues where I have some concerns:</p><p>1. The authors provide several lines of evidence that [BIG+] impacts on the translation of a subset of mRNAs, but I felt the analysis (cf Figure 6) was of relatively low resolution or indirect. Using a coomassie stain of a 1D SDS-PAGE (Fig6G) analysis is a very low resolution approach to look for global differences in protein levels and it would be relatively straightforward – and more informative – if a high res analysis was undertaken. For example, a 2D-SDS PAGE study using pulse-35S-Met-labelled proteins would identify any major changes in the rates of synthesis of at least the higher abundance proteins in [BIG+] vs [big-] cells and give strong evidence for the proposed altered translational programme. The approach they do use – although a clever one – uses quantitation of GFP fluorescence using an N terminally located GFP for 4000+ different proteins. Ideally one would have liked to have seen some evidence that those proteins identified by this screen also showed differences in levels in their native form i.e. without GFP fusions. Also, the shift in ribosome loading shown in Figure 6H; could the increase in the size of polysomes reflect a defect in translation termination?</p><p>2. From the data shown it is not clear what the physical form of the Pus4 protein is, in [BIG+] cells. In a relatively low resolution image of Pus4-GFP fusions (Figure 4G) the authors argue that there is a &quot;substantial fluorescence in a fragmented network throughout the cytoplasm&quot; only in [BIG+] cells but to make this statement we need to see higher res images. I was not convinced by the images shown. If they do exist they are clearly not the only form seen in [BIG+] cells as in Figure 8C a wild strain shows Pus4-GFP puncta. Why this difference? Furthermore, the majority of Pus4 in the [BIG+] lab strain is located in the nucleolus; how do we know this is the nucleolus and what happens to the contents of the nucleolus in the cytoduction experiments reported here? A more biochemical approach into analysis of the state of the Pus4 protein is also needed using the methods applied to the study of other yeast prions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60917.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The abstract and introduction lack deepness and incorporate some unclear concepts.

In CMC-treated samples from both naive and [BIG+] cells, we observed mutations surrounding the U55 site, characteristic of lesions generated by CMC adduct formation at Ψ55. We did not observe any such mutations in CMC-treated samples from cells lacking the Pus4 protein, confirming that the assay is specific to Pus4 activity. These data provide further evidence that a major substrate of Pus4, tRNA, is pseudouridylated in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer 1 raised some issues with the RNA-seq analysis.

Please address these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response can be broken up into two parts:</p><p>1. Reviewer #3 expressed concern about our conclusion that translation is altered in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], mainly since we had not performed experiments that directly measure the rate of protein synthesis.</p><p>2. Reviewer #1 asked us to measure phosphorylation levels on Sch9, to mechanistically bolster our observation that [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells are more resistant to rapamycin, an inhibitor of Tor, an Sch9 kinase.</p><p>Measuring the rate of protein synthesis:</p><p>In response to Reviewer #3’s concern regarding how translation is affected, we have performed their suggested <sup>35</sup>S-methionine labeling experiment and 2-D gel electrophoresis and thank them for the suggestion. These data are now described in lines 449–455 and 484–494. The rate of new total protein synthesis is indeed higher in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells than in naïve cells, consistent with other results in our manuscript. We have added these data as Figure 6G of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The 2-D gel analysis offered more evidence of an altered translation program. Our efforts to keep the <sup>35</sup>S-methionine pulse brief, the low level of many proteins affected by [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], and limitations on the total amount of protein that could be run on our gel apparatus restricted the number of proteins that could be observed. Nonetheless, we were able to reproducibly visualize thirteen radiolabeled proteins. Following a <sup>35</sup>S-methionine pulse in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells the signal for seven of these proteins increased, one decreased, and five remained very similar (Figures 6H–I). These data provide further support for suggestion that [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells have an altered translation program, with variations in even the most rapidly synthesized proteins. This was consistent with results we previously reported from the GFP screen.</p><p>Measuring the phosphorylation of Sch9/TOR activity:</p><p>We also addressed TOR activity by investigating phosphorylation of Sch9, a principal target of the TOR kinase (Urban et al., 2007 (PMID: 17560372)). We have conducted this assay in consultation with two labs that have used it extensively. The assay relies on chemical fragmentation of a tagged version of Sch9 protein, followed by resolving the fragments using PAGE and Western Blot analysis. Sch9 protein is chemically fragmented using NTCB, which cyanylates cysteine residues. Under alkaline conditions, this leads to cleavage at the modified residues and release of a ~50kD C-terminal fragment of Sch9, which both permits Western blot analysis because the HA-tag is on the C-terminus, and theoretically permits better separation of differentially phosphorylated forms using PAGE. Six Tor1-dependent phosphorylation sites are within this C-terminal fragment.</p><p>Despite many attempts at this assay, it has not worked well for us in our strains. We do not see the characteristic multiple fragments corresponding to differentially phosphorylated forms of Sch9, the patterns of which have been reported to change when cells are treated with TOR pathway effectors, rapamycin or cycloheximide (Urban et al., 2007).</p><p>In Figure 1A from Urban et al., 2007 they used the Sch9 cleavage assay to show that chemicals that perturb activity of the TOR pathway alter the pattern of Sch9 phosphorylation. They observed at least five distinct bands centered around the 50kD marker band.</p><p>Lane 5: untreated cells</p><p>Lane 6: treated with Rapamycin for 30m—this inhibits Tor1 which leads to rapid reduction in Sch9 phosphorylation, collapsing the series of differentially phosphorylated proteins to a completely unphosphorylated form that runs faster through the gel matrix.</p><p>Lane 7: inhibition of translation using cycloheximide has the opposite effect of rapamycin treatment—this triggers the cell to increase growth to compensate for reduced translation, and since more phosphorylation of Sch9 corresponds with increased protein synthesis, this leads to an increase in the ratio of fully-phosphorylated Sch9 compared to less phosphorylated forms, and thus more intense bands higher up in the gradient of bands centered around 50kD.</p><p>Lane 8: Wortmannin, a kinase inhibitor (thus Tor1 inhibitor), has a similar effect as rapamycin treatment: reduced phosphorylation of Sch9 and more intense lower bands.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> is a representative blot of NTCB-treated Sch9 protein from our many attempts to replicate this assay. We used the same concentrations of cycloheximide and rapamycin used in the Urban <italic>et al.,</italic> study. We have attempted many different gel running conditions and varied lysis conditions with input from other investigators knowledgeable about this technique. We have also modified our strains to make them prototrophic, as was done in the Urban <italic>et al.,</italic> study. We also note that in parallel with these experiments, we have successfully reproduced the effects of these drugs in inhibiting cell growth.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60917-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Despite this, even in our control naïve BY4741 strains, we do not see the multiple distinct bands observed in the earlier study in untreated cells, nor do we see an expected shift in the bands in rapamycin-treated cells. Thus, we cannot conclude from this assay whether the phosphorylation status of Sch9 is different in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]. Encouragingly, with cycloheximide treatment, we did observe a characteristic shift upward of the C-terminus, indicating increased phosphorylation as seen in the prior publication. However, it is not to the same extent as previously reported and because of the lack of distinct phosphorylated forms, it is challenging to evaluate whether there is a difference in Tor1 activity in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] using this assay. As an alternative, we also ran our lysates on “<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labchem-wako.fujifilm.com/us/category/00908.html">Phos-tag</ext-link>” gels, which contain chemicals that exacerbate differences in the migration of phosphorylated polypeptides (causing them to run more slowly than in standard PAGE gels). Unfortunately, these have also not resolved the relevant differentially phosphorylated forms.</p><p>To conclude, we have committed significant resources in this assay, and consulted extensively with experts in them, but have nonetheless been unable to reproduce the variety of differentially phosphorylated forms of Sch9. It is therefore challenging to conclude much from these experiments about potential differences in Tor1 activity in naïve and [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells — our data neither support nor refute potential differences. Some of the discrepancies may arise from multiple differences in genetic background between our strain (BY/S288C) and those used in prior papers reporting this assay. However, chasing these down would take a significant amount of time and offers no guarantee of success. We therefore turned to alternative approaches to assess TOR activity.</p><p>Our alternative approach for analysis of TOR activity in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]:</p><p>We have used another method that is complementary to the Sch9 phosphorylation analysis and has proved informative about differences in the TOR pathway in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells. We examined a protein whose localization depends on Tor1 activity, Par32 (<italic>p</italic>hosphorylated <italic>a</italic>fter <italic>r</italic>apamycin 32). Par32 is a downstream effector that is phosphorylated by Npr1 in response to Npr1's phosphorylation by Tor1. Changes to Par32 localization can therefore be linked to changes in Tor1 activity. Normally present mostly in the plasma membrane, inhibition of the TOR pathway causes Par32 to move away from the plasma membrane (Varlakhanova et al., PMID: 30156471). To examine whether Par32 localization is altered in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells relative to naïve controls, we crossed these strains to a partner containing a seamlessly GFP-tagged <italic>PAR32</italic> gene. We then measured the fraction of Par32 protein localized to the plasma membrane and quantified this ratio for many cells. In naïve cells, we observed a fraction of membrane Par32 signal that matched the previous study (~1.3). In [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, we observed a significant increase in this ratio, an average 60% higher value. This result would be consistent with the higher TOR activity in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, possibly explaining why they are more resistant to rapamycin (Figure 6B). We have added these new data to the revised manuscript, in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>For responses to other more specific comments regarding data in Figure 6, see below directly under reviewer prompts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer 2 pointed out the weakness in the analysis presented in Figure 8. Please consider addressing this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2 explained that they found our claim of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] being in wild yeast strains weakened by the small number of the 23 wild isolate strains tested with phenotypes consistent with the prion. Likewise, they pointed out that the way we determined these traits were epigenetic was via transient chaperone inhibition. Although consistent with a prion-based phenotype, this experiment does not rule out other prions that do not depend upon Pus4.</p><p>We have now performed additional experiments and modified our language in this section to address the reviewer’s concern. We intended to identify whether a [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like state exists in wild strains. Indeed, because of the conditional benefit of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], and based on our prior work identifying prions in wild fungal isolates, we did not expect that most of them would harbor this element, or another like it. However, the California wine strain BC187 had some features that resemble those we observed for strains harboring [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] that we studied in the laboratory. We now provide further experimental evidence supporting a [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like mechanism in BC187 cells.</p><p>In the original submission, we showed that BC187 exhibited permanent cell size changes, changes in translation, and differences in Pus4 expression after transient inhibition of Hsp70. Reviewer 2 suggested that we subject chaperone ‘cured’ BC187 cells to transient Pus4 overexpression to reverse the ‘curing’ process and restore a [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like state, an excellent suggestion that we followed. When we transiently overexpressed Pus4 in BC187 cells that had been previously ‘cured’ of [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>], the cells returned to their original “large” size (Figure 8D, revised manuscript). The same manipulation did not affect the already large BC187 lineages that had not been subject to transient Hsp70 inhibition (Figure 8—figure supplement 1, revised manuscript). Therefore, the specific overexpression of Pus4 alone can recreate a [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>]-like state in wild yeast, as it does in laboratory yeast.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also recommended that we measure RLS and CLS in BC187 before and after transient chaperone inhibition. We attempted a CLS experiment, growing cells for more than two months, but unfortunately, the cultures completely evaporated before we could detect a significant reduction in viability. From work by Kaya <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015 (PMID: 27030810), it is known that BC187 wild yeast strains are very long-lived compared to laboratory <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>The RLS experiments have also not been possible to pursue because they are performed in close quarters by a team of students, and restrictions from the University of Washington (where our RLS experiments were performed) prohibit doing them at this time. Due to the extended timeline of these experiments and uncertainty about when institutional regulations might permit them, we unfortunately do not foresee completing them in a timeframe consistent with other essential revisions that were requested.</p><p>Our additional data nonetheless demonstrate that transient overexpression of Pus4 alone leads to changes in cell size in wild yeast strain BC187 that are curable by transient Hsp70 inhibition. We agree that finding more examples in other strains will be essential to claim that this is &quot;widespread&quot; and have softened our language accordingly. However, our success in finding the element after screening just twenty strains suggests it may be as frequent, if not more so, as multiple other prions that have been discovered in natural <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Reviewer 2 also pointed out some issues with discussion, which should be considered to improve the clarify of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for pointing out that our discussion missed an opportunity to integrate our various results, particularly effects on protein synthesis. We have significantly revised our discussion to address this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;A prion accelerates proliferation at 1 the expense of lifespan&quot;, authors Garcia et al., reported that pseudouridine synthase Pus4 acts as a prion switch that regulate the epigenetic state of cell growth by promoting protein synthesis. Overall, this is quite an intriguing paper to read. Most of the experiments were well thought out and designed, most of the data presented are clear and support their conclusions. However, there are a few issues that should be further addressed or clarified before it is accepted for publication.</p><p>1. In Figure 4G, it does appear that the cytoplasmic localization of Pus4 in [BIG+] cells is ER, maybe rough ER, which may support its function in mRNA pseudouridinylation and promoting protein synthesis. This may be further verified by using inducing [BIG+] in GFP-tagged ER marker or rough ER marker strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion that we determine whether Pus4 protein could be co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> showing fusions to two fluorescent proteins: (1) GFP-Pus4 as used in Figure 4G, and (2) dsRed-HDEL, containing a C-terminal sequence that promotes retention of the dsRed protein in the ER. Since we do not see significant overlap in the signal from the two proteins, we conclude that these data do not support Pus4 protein being localized specifically to the ER. Understanding what structures they might co-localize with will be an exciting area for future study.

The assessment of RNA levels in [BIG+] cells is the biggest issue in this manuscript. RNA-seq from bulk cell sample should be used with spike-in controls normalizes to cell count in order to detect global mRNA level changes (PMID: 23101621). Also, it has been shown clearly that cell size is positively correlated with RNA content (PMID: 30718850). Hence, the levels of RNA or mRNA in each cell should be carefully determined, either by bulk RNA-seq with spike-in control, or single cell RNA-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

Figure 6 shows that [BIG+] cell growth was not efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and that [BIG+] cells have higher levels of polysomes. Hence, it should be tested whether TOR signaling is hyperactivated by [BIG+] and that whether this hyperactivation can be efficiently inhibited or attenuated by rapamycin. This can be done by analyzing the phosphorylation levels of Sch9, a target of TOR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

This modification is induced by transient overexpression of the highly conserved pseudouridine synthase PUS4/TRUB. Authors demonstrated that prion like state of the PUS4 gene affects yeast cell physiology and phenotypes including, growth rate, cell size and lifespan. Authors also connected these phenotype changes to translational regulation of small number of proteins with rare codons. Interestingly these phenotypes are altered without changing mRNA level, including total tRNA and ribosomal RNAs. In addition, global level of protein translation and/or abundance was not affected by this process. They concluded these observations in the light of several carefully designed and elegant experiments. Overall, findings are interesting, and manuscript is written well. As such, the manuscript will greatly promote progress in the field of studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging. However, there are several points to be clarified/improved, which will further strengthen the study. Therefore, the manuscript is suitable for eLife, and I recommend its publication after the following revisions are addressed.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1 – The abstract and introduction lack deepness and incorporate some unclear concepts. For example:</p><p>Line 16 – The opening sentences of the abstract introduce a jargon that is not true for organismal aging. That can be true in the single cell level for some cell types and for some organisms, however; there is no general concept in the aging field that organisms are evolved to select one of these strategies.

Similarly, this argument in the abstract was not explained in the introduction. Although, there are references regarding to the inverse correlation of cell size and lifespan, there has not been much argument/discussion and related reference about inverse correlation of proliferation rate and lifespan. In fact, in yeast, there is no defined general concept that describes inverse correlation between proliferation rate and aging.

Out of 23 wild yeast isolates, authors only tested four of them and showed the cell size differences. Out of these 4 isolates, only 2 of them showed decreased translation. Authors are clearly cherry picking the results to convince that the observed BIG phenotype is widespread. From the data they present, it is not true. These wild isolates have been previously characterized to have many SNPs and different phenotypes under different stress conditions. Transient inhibition of Hsp70 may cause differences in cell phenotypes, including cell size by acting on different mechanism. The direct testing of BIG phenotype should be performed through transient expression of PUS4 in these strains and measuring the cell size. Also, strains with increased cell size should be subjected to RLS or CLS measurement to align with authors' conclusion. In addition, YPD medium specificity of BIG phenotype already indicates that it is not widespread and it is condition specific. I do not think any of these wild isolates' niches were similar to the YPD condition in their natural environment. Overall, this part is very weak and with the current version, it does not add any further strength to the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful comments.

Please see our response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Authors conclude that this newly identified prion-based mechanism engages an altered translational program to favor a 'live fast, die young' strategy. There are several interesting findings in this manuscript, however they are somehow disconnected from each other. Basically how these findings are complementing to each other and to their role in observed phenotype need deeper discussion. In the discussion part, authors are only focusing on altered modification of TEF1/TEF2 elongation factors. Some of their findings have not been mentioned. For example, findings of 130 differentially expressed proteins with decreased codon adaptation index along with the findings of no decrease in global protein level are very interesting results. However, the authors seem to avoid discussing these findings. In addition, their findings about [BIG+] cells enhancing translation of some proteins, especially those containing a greater frequency of rare codons need more highlight and to be connected to other findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful comments.

That this prion can apparently control cell growth behaviour of both lab and wild strains of the organism is intriguing, but the precise mechanism by which this is achieved is not fully established in this study. In ruling out any impact on transcription and steady state mRNA/tRNA levels the focus is on a potential post-transcriptional mechanism involving differential synthesis of a relatively large number of proteins. Among the proteins identified there are a number of candidates that could explain the observed [BIG+] phenotypes of cell size and life span changes, but we are left with a list without any one in particular being pinpointed or directly linked to the [BIG+] phenotype.</p><p>There are two issues where I have some concerns:</p><p>1. The authors provide several lines of evidence that [BIG+] impacts on the translation of a subset of mRNAs, but I felt the analysis (cf Figure 6) was of relatively low resolution or indirect. Using a coomassie stain of a 1D SDS-PAGE (Fig6G) analysis is a very low resolution approach to look for global differences in protein levels and it would be relatively straightforward – and more informative – if a high res analysis was undertaken. For example, a 2D-SDS PAGE study using pulse-35S-Met-labelled proteins would identify any major changes in the rates of synthesis of at least the higher abundance proteins in [BIG+] vs [big-] cells and give strong evidence for the proposed altered translational programme. The approach they do use – although a clever one – uses quantitation of GFP fluorescence using an N terminally located GFP for 4000+ different proteins. Ideally one would have liked to have seen some evidence that those proteins identified by this screen also showed differences in levels in their native form i.e. without GFP fusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful comments.

We have added more discussion of these data, including addressing this specific point, to the Discussion section (lines 662–685).</p><p>In the future, we wish to use ribosome profiling to address this question more thoroughly but decided that this type of analysis was beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. From the data shown it is not clear what the physical form of the Pus4 protein is, in [BIG+] cells. In a relatively low resolution image of Pus4-GFP fusions (Figure 4G) the authors argue that there is a &quot;substantial fluorescence in a fragmented network throughout the cytoplasm&quot; only in [BIG+] cells but to make this statement we need to see higher res images. I was not convinced by the images shown. If they do exist they are clearly not the only form seen in [BIG+] cells as in Figure 8C a wild strain shows Pus4-GFP puncta. Why this difference? Furthermore, the majority of Pus4 in the [BIG+] lab strain is located in the nucleolus; how do we know this is the nucleolus and what happens to the contents of the nucleolus in the cytoduction experiments reported here? A more biochemical approach into analysis of the state of the Pus4 protein is also needed using the methods applied to the study of other yeast prions?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. Please see how we addressed general issues with GFP signal in our response to Essential Revisions request #2. This also allowed us to improve our images of the wild strain shown in Figure 8C.</p><p>To our knowledge, the contents of the nucleolus are not exchanged during a cytoduction experiment, since there is no nuclear fusion (Vallen et al., 1992, PMID 1607389). Because we have observed that some Pus4 protein also resides in the cytoplasm in [<italic>BIG</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells, we presume that at least some of the prionogenic form of Pus4 is also located here, permitting transmission from exchange in this compartment alone.</p><p>We agree that more extensive biochemical analysis of Pus4 in the context of its prionogenic conformation warrants further investigation, but believe that these types of experiments are beyond of the scope of the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
