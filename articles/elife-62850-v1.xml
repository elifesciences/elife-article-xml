While a growing body of knowledge exists on specific regulatory mechanisms involved in developmental plasticity, less is known about the regulation of behavioral plasticity. Behavioral plasticity is of special interest and presents unique challenges, as behavioral traits derive from the integrated actions of genetic, transcriptomic, and neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Over the past 20 years, a close relationship between behavioral variation and brain gene expression has been documented across a range of organisms and behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zayed and Robinson, 2012</xref>). Still, the regulatory architecture underlying connections between the genome, brain, environment, and behavior are not well resolved, in part because behavior is itself a complex phenotype with substantial variation between individuals. To fully understand how genomic and transcriptomic variation is transduced into behavioral plasticity, we need both high-dimensional behavioral data at the individual level as well as information on regulatory genomics for those same individuals.</p><p>Modification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) has emerged as an important driver of plasticity during the development and evolution of morphological phenotypes. For example, gains and losses of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (e.g. binding sites for transcription factors (TFs)) influence species-specific wing melanization patterns in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies and <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prud'homme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Werner et al., 2010</xref>). Pelvic loss in stickleback fish convergently evolved through deletion of a tissue-specific enhancer of the TF <italic>Pitx1</italic> in multiple natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). In other cases, similar morphological novelties arose independently through modification of distinct developmental programs, as observed for beak size variation across clades of finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallarino et al., 2012</xref>). Recruitment of genes involved in developmental plasticity in the evolution of novel phenotypes is thought to be facilitated by the fact that TFs and other regulatory genes often have great temporal flexibility, with extensive variation in expression across developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dufour et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Similar to its role in morphological variation, plasticity in GRNs is theorized to influence behavioral variation, over both organismal and evolutionary time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). Brain gene expression is often responsive to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrasekaran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cummings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rittschof et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Whitfield et al., 2003</xref>) and the regulatory activity of many TFs is context-specific with respect to behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrasekaran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, modification of hormone signaling and GRNs in peripheral tissues has effects on brain GRNs and resulting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ament et al., 2012</xref>). These results demonstrate that GRNs are plastic not only across developmental timescales but also influence real-time behavioral variation. Still, the link between changes in GRNs and behavioral plasticity is weaker than for developmental plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>), and to our knowledge, no empirical studies have linked brain GRN plasticity to individual differences in behavior.</p><p>Eusocial insects are ideal for studying how GRN activity influences both developmental and behavioral plasticity at the individual scale. Eusociality is characterized by a reproductive division of labor between queen and worker castes, representing a developmentally plastic polyphenism well-studied in many species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michener, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wheeler, 1986</xref>). Queens are specialized for reproductive functions, including mating and egg-laying, and in species with complex eusociality have levels of fecundity orders of magnitude greater than their solitary ancestors. Workers, on the other hand, typically do not perform reproductive behaviors and in many cases are sterile or unable to mate, instead performing many different non-reproductive behaviors in a colony that are essential for colony growth and development. Species with complex eusociality also often show additional within-caste behavioral plasticity, with individuals specializing on specific subsets of tasks based on differences in worker age, morphology, or genetic predisposition. The extensive behavioral plasticity observed in colonies of eusocial species may be linked to ancestral developmental plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kapheim et al., 2020</xref>), highlighting the interconnectedness of gene regulation in both developmental and behavioral phenotypes relevant for social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We studied the relationship between brain GRN activity and behavior at the individual scale. We focused on a recently discovered, surprising form of behavioral plasticity among worker honey bees. Honey bee workers do not mate, but they possess functional ovaries and can produce viable haploid eggs. Laying workers (LW) are rare in queenright colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratnieks, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Visscher, 1996</xref>) but frequent in situations of permanent queenlessness, when colonies lose their queen and then fail to rear a replacement queen. In these cases, up to 50% of workers may activate their ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakagami, 1954</xref>) and some of these workers lay eggs, producing thousands of drones prior to colony death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Page and Erickson, 1988</xref>). Recently, it was discovered that some LWs engage in both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naeger et al., 2013</xref>), a level of behavioral plasticity not previously described in honey bee workers. Studying honey bee workers in LW colonies enables investigation of the molecular architecture of behavioral variation typically only seen when comparing queens and workers, without the confounds of caste-specific developmental and physiological differences.</p><p>Recent advances in machine learning and automatic behavioral tracking have enabled the study of individual behavior for thousands of members within social insect colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gernat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mersch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wario et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gernat et al., 2020</xref>). We used automatic behavioral tracking, genomics, and the extensive behavioral plasticity present in honey bee colonies with LW to test the hypothesis that individual differences in behavior are associated with changes in the activity of brain GRNs (i.e. changes in the expression of TFs and their target genes). Our results provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of individual differences in behavior by brain GRNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extensive variation in behavior across laying workers</title><p>To define the behavior of individual bees, we deployed a high-resolution, automatic behavior monitoring system on six LW colonies in which each bee (n = 800 per colony) was individually barcoded, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gernat et al., 2018</xref>.

With the exception of colony F, more workers were identified as layers than foragers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Across all colonies, a high proportion of bees were observed laying eggs (54% with at least two egg-laying events on at least one day) or foraging (28% with at least two foraging trips on at least one day) during the recording period, while 10.8% of bees performed both egg-laying and foraging on the same day at least once during the seven days of tracking. A small number of these ‘generalist’ bees (1.3%; 45 individuals) were exceptional in their consistent high performance of both measured behaviors, with a minimum of two egg-laying events and two foraging trips on the same day, across at least three days. Three-day ethograms of an egg-layer, generalist, and forager are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Ovary dissection of a subset of individuals revealed that 100% of specialized egg-layers and generalists had active ovaries (ovary scores of 3–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hess, 1942</xref>), compared with only 54% of the specialized foragers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

These results provide new mechanistic insights into the important role played by brain GRNs in the regulation of behavioral variation, with implications for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of complex traits.</p><p>Our high-dimensional behavioral data revealed a near continuous distribution of phenotypes along an axis of egg-laying and foraging, two behaviors that are typically expressed separately in the queen and worker castes of honey bee colonies. Consistent with previous reports of ovary activation in queenless colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Page and Erickson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakagami, 1954</xref>), over half of workers tracked laid eggs. Some of these workers also engaged in foraging, consistent with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naeger et al., 2013</xref>, which supports the suggestion that some laying workers are not ‘selfish’ reproducers but engage in activities that may benefit the colony as a whole. We also showed a decoupling between ovary status and behavior for some individuals, unlike what has been observed in many other social insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michener, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson, 1971</xref>). Two-thirds (14/21) of the foragers had activated ovaries, but most laid eggs infrequently or not at all, demonstrating that ovary activation alone is not a strong predictor of exactly which individuals will lay eggs. This decoupling of reproductive physiology from reproductive behavior is consistent with the evolutionary co-option of reproductive signaling pathways for non-reproductive behaviors, a phenomenon well documented in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsuruda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Page et al., 2012</xref>). Given previous demonstrations of cross-talk between peripheral tissues and brain gene networks in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ament et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>), our results further suggest that behavioral variation in queenless workers likely involves the coordinated actions of multiple tissue types, including the ovary.</p><p>Like the task specialization observed in typical, queenright colonies of honey bees and many other social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oster and Wilson, 1979</xref>), the majority of individuals in LW colonies showed consistency in performance of either egg-laying or foraging, but not both. It is important to note that genetic variation may contribute to individual differences in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Page and Robinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Page and Robinson, 1994</xref>). However, the induction of egg-laying behavior in queenless colonies is itself a plastic response, suggesting that at least for egg-laying and generalist individuals, a combination of hereditary and environmental factors likely influence the development of these behavioral phenotypes. Task specialization can contribute to increased efficiency in social insects, either through learning or reduction of task switching costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trumbo and Robinson, 1997</xref>; c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dornhaus, 2008</xref>). In queenless colonies of honey bees, specialization along a reproductive/non-reproductive axis may lead to increased production of haploid males prior to the death of workers, with specialized foragers collecting food for these developing drones while specialized egg-layers work to produce thousands of drones synchronously in these terminal colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Page and Erickson, 1988</xref>). These findings suggest that LW honey bees may display a form of colony organization that is adaptive, as opposed to one of chaos and competition, which has long been thought to characterize LW colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ratnieks et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ratnieks and Wenseleers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dadant &amp; Sons, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006</xref>). Worker derived drones have viable sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gençer and Kahya, 2011</xref>) and therefore may provide a permanently queenless honey bee colony with a final fitness opportunity if the males can successfully mate with queens. It is difficult to evaluate this hypothesis because the incidence of permanently queenless colonies is not known in natural populations of honey bees. However, production of drones by workers in LW colonies is similar to that observed in bumble bees, where worker competition over male production is a normal part of the colony cycle after queen death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cnaani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Free, 1955</xref>), or even prior to queen death in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Velthuis and Duchateau, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with many other studies of behavior and brain gene expression across animal species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bukhari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mello et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Whitfield et al., 2003</xref>), we identified robust brain transcriptional signatures associated with specific behavioral states. Beyond these group level differences, we also discovered that large components of this molecular variation were correlated with behavior, and both behavior and brain gene regulatory activity were continuous across bees. Our finding that both brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility vary continuously with behavioral phenotype suggests that behavioral plasticity is subserved by continuously varying molecular programs, rather than threshold-based or quantized changes.</p><p>At the individual bee level, changes in the expression of TFs, accessibility of TF motifs in enhancers and promoters, and activity of TF module target genes were all strongly associated with behavioral state. This is highlighted by the results of our predictive analysis, where 97% of specialists were accurately predicted to phenotype based on TF expression alone, despite the small number of TFs relative to all differentially expressed genes. Spatial and temporal integration of discrete events such as TF binding, aggregated at the whole brain level and across TFs and genes, may lead to the continuous variation we observed in gene expression and chromatin accessibility (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Araya et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to predicting the collective behavioral phenotypes of individual bees, our analysis of GRNs allowed us to probe the influence of TF module activity on single behaviors. We identified a set of 23 TF modules that were associated with all aspects of behavior and physiology we measured. These TFs appear to coordinate sets of behaviors that are not overtly linked (e.g. proportion of nectar foraging trips and number of eggs laid) but may be influenced by the same regulatory machinery. Three of these modules are activated by TFs downstream of JH, a hormone with numerous well-studied roles in social insect behavior, including the regulation of oogenesis in queens and age-related division of labor in workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsuruda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hamilton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Page et al., 2012</xref>). Our results are consistent with a role of JH signaling in queenless colonies of worker honey bees, regulating a behavioral division of labor between specialized egg-layers and foragers. These findings match previous work describing differences in JH titers between egg-laying workers and foragers in queenless colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robinson et al., 1992</xref>), and suggest that mechanisms underlying variation in egg-laying behavior may be similar to nurse/forager differences in queenright colonies. Overlap in brain gene expression profiles between nurses and egg-layers further supports this conclusion.</p><p>By combining our analysis of GRNs in individual bees with motif enrichment in gene regulatory regions across individuals, we identified a set of 15 TFs which appear to play a key role in regulating specialist behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Intriguingly, many of these TFs were also identified as relevant for social evolution, with increases in TF motif presence in gene promoters of social compared with solitary species of bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapheim et al., 2015</xref>). We observed especially strong overlap of these evolutionarily-implicated TFs and those with motif enrichment within differentially expressed genes or differentially accessible chromatin of specialist phenotypes. This suggests that regulatory regions that arise during evolutionary transitions to eusociality may be maintained and even further refined for the regulation of specialized subcastes in social species. In contrast, comparatively little overlap was seen when comparing evolutionarily-implicated TFs with TFs whose expression was most predictive of specialist behavioral phenotypes. This mismatch between TF expression and motif presence may reflect the complexity of GRNs, where genetic and epigenetic landscapes modulate the effects of TF activity. Alternatively, these results may reflect differences in the mechanisms underlying intra- vs. interspecific variation in social behavior. Further research exploring the role of these TFs and their activity in a range of contexts is needed to provide clarity on these results.</p><p>While behavioral specialization appears to be common among members of queenless honey bee colonies, the finding of even a small number of generalist bees who perform both egg-laying and foraging has intriguing implications. The presence of these generalists suggests that despite the long divergence from a solitary ancestor (~85 my, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branstetter et al., 2017</xref>), honey bees retain great flexibility for performance of multiple behaviors that are typically confined to either the queen or worker caste. Latent plasticity in social insects that is inducible under extreme conditions is also seen in morphologically and temporally defined worker subcastes under queenright conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robinson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson, 1980</xref>). Generalists showed high variation in behavior, and similarly were difficult to predict phenotypically based on TF activity, unlike specialists. Further, brain GRN activity in these individuals was less defined, with fewer TF modules showing significant up- or down-regulation in generalist individuals compared with specialists. Combined with PCA on brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility, these findings suggest that generalists are molecularly intermediate between specialized groups.</p><p>Our discovery of intermediate generalist phenotypes in laying worker colonies, along with their molecular signatures, provides support for one of the leading theories of eusocial evolution, the Ovarian Ground Plan Hypothesis (OGPH). The OGPH posits that the emergence of queen and worker castes from solitary ancestors involved the genetic decoupling of reproductive and non-reproductive behavioral programs through changes in gene regulation acting on ancestral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gadagkar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turillazzi and West-Eberhard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">West-Eberhard, 1987</xref>). The phenotypic continuum we observed in laying worker colonies, with both reproductive and non-reproductive specialists as well as generalists, suggests that this decoupling process is at least partially reversible and/or incomplete in honey bees, unlike in eusocial species where workers lack reproductive anatomy and corresponding behaviors entirely (e.g. ants and higher termites). Additionally, molecular characterization of this behavioral variation, especially our TF analyses, supports the hypothesis that incremental changes in gene regulatory network activity led to the decoupling of solitary behavioral programs into distinct queen and worker castes. This hypothesis is consistent with previous research linking changes in TF activity with social evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapheim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kapheim et al., 2020</xref>). If correct, this hypothesis provides a framework for understanding the evolution of eusociality at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>)</td><td valign="top">queens</td><td valign="top">Honey Bee Insemination Service, Washington State University</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">SDI colonies</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>)</td><td valign="top">workers</td><td valign="top">University of Illinois Bee Research Facility</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">RNeasy Mini Kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">74104</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">RS-122–2103</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">FC-121–1031</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011848">SCR_011848</ext-link></td><td valign="top">v0.36</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">STAR</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015899">SCR_015899</ext-link></td><td valign="top">v2.5.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">bwa</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010910">SCR_010910</ext-link></td><td valign="top">v0.7.17</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Picard</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006525">SCR_006525</ext-link></td><td valign="top">v2.10.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R project for statistical computing</td><td valign="top">R Core Team</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bees and colony setup</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Source colonies</title><p>Honey bee colonies were maintained according to standard beekeeping practices at the University of Illinois Bee Research Facility in Urbana, Illinois.

Filtering involved removal of potential tracking errors, including removal of barcodes that did not pass read error correction. In addition, records for barcodes that were read twice in the same image were removed, as were hive image records of the same barcode identified more than 5 cm/second between successive detections, which are likely to be misidentifications. An average of 94.51% of detections remained after these filtering steps (range across colonies: 91.94–97.11%). Finally, the time of death of each bee was estimated using the last time she was observed for at least 4 min during a 5 min window above the third row of honeycomb cells from the bottom of the hive; dead bees tend to accumulate below this level prior to being removed by other bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gernat et al., 2018</xref>). Records for bees following their time of death were filtered out so behavioral scores (below) were calculated only over times in which bees were alive.</p><p>In entrance monitor images, barcodes were similarly detected as in hive images, but with parameters adjusted for images produced by the Raspberry Pi camera.

The software Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) was used to mark the bCode positions of all workers laying eggs in an initial set of 1500 hive images, followed by an additional set of 782 images, each annotated by three independent observers. After the initial identification of egg-laying bees in these images, the two seconds before and after each egg-laying event were also annotated for those bees.

Methods are described fully in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gernat et al., 2020</xref> and are presented briefly here. The first CNN used images cropped to include just a small rectangular region behind the barcode of each bee. For egg-laying bees, these images show the honeycomb, because their abdomen is backed into the comb and thus not visible. For non-layers, these images show the abdomen. The CNN was trained to differentiate between these two cases. The second CNN was applied to images of bees that were identified as potential egg-layers by the first CNN. It used slightly larger images that showed the entire bee and was trained to use information about the bee’s posture and her immediate surroundings to identify false positives, which were subsequently filtered out.</p><p>Application of a CNN to an image results in a score between 0 and 1 that reflects the likelihood of that image showing the event of interest. Deciding whether a score is sufficiently high for assuming that the event took place involves thresholding that score. To choose thresholds for each CNN score and a minimum egg-laying duration, a calibration set of images, which were not used for training the CNNs, was used to estimate the performance of the egg-laying detector for different threshold combinations. Thresholds were chosen from this calibration set to maximize the detector’s positive predictive value, then were applied to an independent test set of images that had also never been seen by the detector to obtain unbiased performance values. Based on the performance estimation on the test set of images, the egg-laying detector had the following performance: 99.71% accuracy, 35.39% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 99.71% negative predictive value. Minimizing false positives came at a cost to sensitivity, but bees who lay eggs will likely do so more than once over the course of the experiment and can thus still be identified as egg-layers (honey bees possess multiple ovarioles, each of which can develop eggs simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hess, 1942</xref>]). Egg-laying detections were further aggregated into events: subsequent detections that occurred within 10 s and 11.2 mm (the width of two honeycomb cells) of one another were assumed to belong to the same egg-laying event and were merged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Filtering and annotation of entrance data</title><p>Raw detections of bees in the entrance were filtered as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geffre et al., 2020</xref>.

These traversal events were then determined to be incoming or outgoing based on the positional coordinates of the bee at the start and end times of each event. Numbers of foraging trips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) was inferred from series of outgoing and incoming events.</p><p>Incoming foraging trips were additionally annotated with trophallaxis data to determine whether a forager likely returned with nectar.

Parameters used for the detector resulted in the following performance metrics based on test images: 88.7% sensitivity, 99.6% specificity, 90.4% positive predictive value, 99.6% negative predictive value, and 88.9% accuracy in determining trophallactic role (donor or receiver) of each bee. If a bee was a trophallaxis donor within 5 min after returning from a trip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seeley, 2009</xref>), with no trophallaxis reception prior to the donation, that foraging trip was annotated as a nectar trip. Additionally, incoming trips were manually annotated for pollen on the hindlegs of returning bees for colonies D-F. Combining these nectar and pollen data for each trip, the proportion of foraging trips with nectar (‘p.nectar’), pollen (‘p.pollen’) or both (‘p.both’) were calculated per bee in these colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Specialist and generalist scores</title><p>In order to characterize the activity of egg-laying and foraging for each bee, two behavioral scores were created. The ‘specialist’ score describes how specialized an individual was on either egg-laying (scores near −1) or foraging (scores near +1) relative to other bees in the colony; bees that consistently performed both egg-laying and foraging, or that performed neither behavior, have specialist scores near 0. The generalist score ranges from 0 to 1 and describes the degree to which an individual performed both egg-laying and foraging behaviors, differentiating bees with specialist scores near 0 based on the performance (or not) of egg-laying and foraging. Scores were created by first counting the number of egg-laying and foraging events per day. Bees were then ranked for each behavior relative to other bees in the colony on the same day, with tying ranks being assigned the minimal rank (e.g. if three bees were tied between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> ranked bees, they all received a rank of 5). Ranks were then normalized by dividing by the maximum rank, so that all ranks were in the range [0,1]. The normalized rank space for each bee (i.e. normalized egg-laying rank and normalized foraging rank) was then mapped to behavioral scores (and corresponding color space) using the following formulae in polar coordinates (ρ,θ) on the two-dimensional rank space: generalist score = (1/2)ρ<sup>2</sup>sin<sup>4</sup>2θ, specialist score = sin(θ-π/4)ρ<sup>4</sup>cos<sup>4</sup>2θ. Note that the numerical value of the scores has no biological meaning, but is simply a mapping from rank space to the space of colors as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Selection of bees for sequencing</title><p>The median of specialist and generalist scores was weighted to emphasize the latter part of the experiment; days 15–21 received a weight of 1–7, respectively, and each day’s score was multiplied by this weight. These scores were used to characterize the overall behavior of each bee in the colony.

ASTRIX uses gene expression data to identify interactions between TFs and their target genes. The ASTRIX algorithm has been previously used to infer brain GRN models for various organisms including the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bukhari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shpigler et al., 2017</xref>). These models showed significantly high accuracy in predicting gene expression changes in the brain and identified TFs that regulate social behaviors.</p><p>Here we applied ASTRIX using the gene expression data of the 45 individual bees along with a list of honey bee TFs as input to identify regulatory interactions. We normalized the transcriptomics data prior to GRN construction using the ComBat algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>) to minimize batch and colony effects in the data. The effectiveness of the normalization was checked using PCA. Any TF predicted to interact with a given target gene by ASTRIX had to pass through two criteria: (1) share a significant degree of mutual information with the target gene (p-value&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>), and (2) explain at least 10% of the variance of the target gene, quantified by Least angle regression algorithm. Similarly, each target gene included in the GRN must be predicted with a correlation of at least 0.8 by the ASTRIX model using expression levels of TFs.</p><p>The GRN model built by ASTRIX predicted 2190 genes with a Pearson’s correlation of 0.8 or higher using expression levels of TFs. Overall, the GRN inferred by ASTRIX contains 4500 interactions between 190 TFs and the 2190 target genes.

TFs whose targets were over-represented among the behavior-correlated genes were then determined. Significance of the overlap between the list of behavior-correlated genes with targets of each TF (‘TF module’) was estimated using the hypergeometric test.</p><p>Finally, to identify TF modules associated with expression changes in each individual (‘Individualized TF modules’), genes that were upregulated or downregulated in each individual were identified using z-transformation. Genes in each individual with z-scores above 2 (i.e. two standard deviations above mean) or below −2 were considered to be differentially expressed in an individual. This list of genes was then overlapped with TF modules to identify modules significantly associated with each individual using the hypergeometric test of overlap.</p><p>We used a Random Forests classification algorithm for predicting individual behavioral group from TF expression levels. A leave-one-out cross validation analysis was performed wherein the algorithm was trained using data from the remaining 44 individuals and then used to predict the behavior of the 45<sup>th</sup> individual using its TF levels. The model achieved an accuracy of 82% in predicting behavior. Performance of the model was evaluated by comparison with random shuffling of the behavior labels. We made predictions 100 times with a different set of shuffled labels and compared the accuracy of predictions (i.e. total individuals for which behavioral group was correctly predicted) between the random model and the Random Forest algorithm using a t-test (p=1×10<sup>−8</sup>). This suggests that TF expression levels can accurately forecast the behavior of the individual, especially for specialists. The relative importance of each TF in predicting behavior was determined using Out-of-bag predictor importance estimation, wherein each predictor’s value is permuted and the corresponding impact on model accuracy is determined (importance scores given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

The researchers found that expression of many genes and accessible chromatin differed between the foragers and layers, with generalists sharing profiles from both groups. Through transcription factor motif analysis, the researchers found that motifs were enriched in differential accessibility or in the regulatory regions of genes, and could be used themselves to predict behavior, including correlating with some specific metrics like eggs laid or number of forging trips. Some of these DEGs were also found in species and caste-specific differences shown in previous studies. These results show that behavioral plasticity exists along a continuum of varying molecular pathways; the researchers suggest these results have implications for adaptive colony organization even in queenless colonies, as well as supporting the Ovarian Ground Plan Hypothesis. The data are excellent, but the reviewers have raised a few concerns about interpretations that should be clarified in a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was some concern among the reviewers regarding the use of the specialization score. The behaviors were rank scored with -1, 0 and +1 as the maximum points for layer, generalist, and forager, respectively, but it is not clear how this continuum (as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1) was then discretized into the three categories, like in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, for further comparison and to support the statements made in the Discussion. Moreover, the data presented state that gene expression and chromatin availability are correlated with behavior at the individual level (subsection “Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility are correlated with behavioral variation” and Discussion). However, most of these conclusions are instead based on the specialization score (rather than direct behavioral measurements). While this metric seems great for classifying individuals, using it as a quantitative metric of behavior minimizes the distinctions between different behavioral states and comparisons of behavior within states. For example, in Figure 3E and F, the trends look to be clearly driven by differences between the two specialist groups, but not relationships within behavioral groups. Furthermore, the authors linked genetic variables in TF modules (Supplementary file 8) directly to individual behaviors, which was preferred by some reviewers compared to the specialization score. We encourage the authors to present the corresponding analysis with the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq PCs. We also encourage the authors to consider placing a figure in the main text that relates to Supplementary file 8, as this is an important result (Discussion).</p><p>2) One reviewer suggested the terms &quot;plasticity&quot; and &quot;behavioral plasticity&quot; need clarification in the Introduction, and when interpreting the experiments, as sometimes plasticity is confused with genetic variation. There is the potential for genetic differences between these two types of variation, which is both important and very interesting, so the authors should discuss this with more clarity. In particular, the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity (e.g. Abstract, Introduction, Discussion), could also be due to genetic differences and this should be clarified. There are certainly ways in which the experiment does reflect unambiguous plasticity, such as the induction of laying behavior after queen removal and the switch between laying and foraging that occurs within generalists. There is scope to discuss some aspects of these data through the lens of plasticity, but the authors need to be much more explicit and focused when they do so.</p><p>3) The authors used brain tissue, but several of the genetic correlations they found might not necessarily have to do with neurobiology directly. Indeed, the Introduction starts out with the statement &quot;Behavioral plasticity is of special interest and presents unique challenges, as behavioral traits derive from the integrated actions of genetic, transcriptomic, and neuronal networks&quot;. Of course, behavioral traits start with genes, and the brain is needed for responding to many stimuli, but those genes might also influence morphology, biomechanics, physiology, biochemistry, or a host of functions that directly impact behavior. Indeed, the third paragraph of the Introduction mentions the role of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in the development and evolution of morphological phenotypes. In the Introduction, the authors should consider acknowledging this more explicitly and perhaps even describe some potential gene or GRNs in bees that have been implicated in related behavioral phenotypes, as discussed in the end of the Results. This would set up the narrative better for the Results and Discussion, since several of the gene functions discussed are not necessarily (directly) neuronal in nature.</p><p>4) The authors have compared their data in this manuscript to other previously published datasets to make broad claims about the evolution of eusociality. In Figure 6, can the authors explain why the group-predictive TFs seem to not overlap with the list implicated in evolution and what that means for their broad claims in the Discussion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62850.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was some concern among the reviewers regarding the use of the specialization score.

To determine the molecular basis of behavioral phenotypes, however, we made the choice to select from behavioral extremes, including only bees that consistently and frequently engaged in the behaviors of interest. This made discretizing into three categories straightforward (specialist scores near -1 are layers, scores near +1 are foragers, scores near 0 with generalist scores near +1 are generalists), which allowed for group-level, standard statistical approaches to analyze both RNAseq and ATACseq datasets. We have added a clarification about our choice of behavioral extremes and the assignment of these bees to groups:</p><p>“Sampled individuals were among those with the most extreme specialist and generalist scores within each colony, and were assigned to behavioral groups based upon their lifetime behavior (Figure 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the data presented state that gene expression and chromatin availability are correlated with behavior at the individual level (subsection “Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility are correlated with behavioral variation” and Discussion).

For example, in Figure 3E and F, the trends look to be clearly driven by differences between the two specialist groups, but not relationships within behavioral groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we chose extremes for our molecular sampling, we are indeed limited in our ability to make conclusions about within-group variation when using the specialist score as a proxy for behavior. However, the molecular continuum we see for both gene expression and chromatin accessibility (i.e., PCs in what is now Figure 2) is not discretized despite our choice of extremes, and the PCs also show that generalists are molecularly intermediate. We believe this does demonstrate that gene expression and chromatin availability are correlated with behavior overall, but have removed the wording about this being at the individual level in the Abstract and Discussion. These sections now read:</p><p>“Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles were correlated with behavioral variation, with generalists intermediate in behavior and molecular profiles.”</p><p>“Beyond these group level differences, we also discovered that large components of this molecular variation were correlated with behavior, and both behavior and brain gene regulatory activity were continuous across bees.”</p><p>As these are statements are summaries of all of our results, including the module correlations discussed below which use behavioral measurements themselves (and not the specialist score), we believe they are accurate representations of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors linked genetic variables in TF modules (Supplementary file 8) directly to individual behaviors, which was preferred by some reviewers compared to the specialization score.

In response to the comments above, we have added a new figure (part of what is now Figure 3) which summarizes a subset of these results (full results are still in Supplementary file 8). We have also changed the order of our Results section to present these analyses immediately following the PCA results. Figures 2 and 3 now illustrate analyses which together speak to the molecular underpinnings of behavioral variation: pairwise differences between groups (Figure 2C-D), correlations between PCs and the individual behavioral aggregate specialist score (Figure 2E-F), and correlations between TF module activity and individual behavioral/physiological metrics (Figure 3A). We believe this new ordering and presentation of results paints a clearer picture of the connections between molecular mechanisms and behavior and thank the reviewers for these very helpful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One reviewer suggested the terms &quot;plasticity&quot; and &quot;behavioral plasticity&quot; need clarification in the Introduction, and when interpreting the experiments, as sometimes plasticity is confused with genetic variation. There is the potential for genetic differences between these two types of variation, which is both important and very interesting, so the authors should discuss this with more clarity. In particular, the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Discussion), could also be due to genetic differences and this should be clarified. There are certainly ways in which the experiment does reflect unambiguous plasticity, such as the induction of laying behavior after queen removal and the switch between laying and foraging that occurs within generalists. There is scope to discuss some aspects of these data through the lens of plasticity, but the authors need to be much more explicit and focused when they do so.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there may be genetic variants influencing the variation in behavior we see across individuals, despite our use of single-drone inseminated (SDI) colonies which reduces genetic variation relative to naturally-mated honey bee colonies. We saw variation in the performance of behaviors both within and across SDI groups, which is suggestive of plasticity not only attributable to genotype, but of course we do not know the contribution of genetic variation to the observed behavioral differences. In the Introduction we mention that subcaste specialization is in part due to genetic differences, and we have added clarification that genetic differences likely also contribute to the behavioral variation we see:</p><p>“It is important to note that genetic variation may contribute to individual differences in behavior (Page and Robinson, 1991; Page and Robinson, 1994). However, the induction of egg-laying behavior in queenless colonies is itself a plastic response, suggesting that at least for egg-laying and generalist individuals, a combination of hereditary and environmental factors likely influence the development of these behavioral phenotypes.”</p><p>Our primary focus is on how differences in GRN activity (which is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors) shape behavioral plasticity. As the reviewer mentions, behavioral plasticity is readily apparent in some individuals (e.g., generalists) while less obvious in others. However, in social insects the colony itself is often discussed as a unit, and laying worker colonies as an aggregate demonstrate a behaviorally plastic response to the loss of the queen. We have carefully reviewed our use of the terms “plasticity” and “behavioral plasticity” throughout and revised the wording to be more clear. In some cases, this was a simple switch from “behavioral plasticity” to “behavioral variation,” since as the reviewer points out not all of our phenotypes are necessarily plastic but could have underlying genetic predispositions. We hope these revisions better reflect the scope of our study. The revised version includes these modified lines:</p><p>“We studied the relationship between brain GRN activity and behavior at the individual scale.”</p><p>“These results provide new mechanistic insights into the important role played by brain GRNs in the regulation of behavioral variation, with implications for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of complex traits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors used brain tissue, but several of the genetic correlations they found might not necessarily have to do with neurobiology directly. Indeed, the Introduction starts out with the statement &quot;Behavioral plasticity is of special interest and presents unique challenges, as behavioral traits derive from the integrated actions of genetic, transcriptomic, and neuronal networks&quot;. Of course, behavioral traits start with genes, and the brain is needed for responding to many stimuli, but those genes might also influence morphology, biomechanics, physiology, biochemistry, or a host of functions that directly impact behavior. Indeed, the third paragraph of the Introduction mentions the role of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in the development and evolution of morphological phenotypes. In the Introduction, the authors should consider acknowledging this more explicitly and perhaps even describe some potential gene or GRNs in bees that have been implicated in related behavioral phenotypes, as discussed in the end of the Results. This would set up the narrative better for the Results and Discussion, since several of the gene functions discussed are not necessarily (directly) neuronal in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, especially considering the hormone-related signaling pathways we implicate based on our GRN analyses of behavior. We have added to the Introduction a reference to literature demonstrating how modification of signaling pathways in peripheral tissues can affect brain GRNs and behavior:</p><p>“In addition, modification of hormone signaling and GRNs in peripheral tissues has effects on brain GRNs and resulting behavior (Ament et al., 2012).”</p><p>We now additionally reference two honey bee papers demonstrating similar tissue cross-talk in the Discussion:</p><p>“Given previous demonstration of cross-talk between peripheral tissues and brain gene networks in the honey bee (Ament et al., 2012; Wheeler et al., 2013), our results further suggest that behavioral variation in queenless workers likely involves the coordinated actions of multiple tissue types, including the ovary.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have compared their data in this manuscript to other previously published datasets to make broad claims about the evolution of eusociality. In Figure 6, can the authors explain why the group-predictive TFs seem to not overlap with the list implicated in evolution and what that means for their broad claims in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>The candidate TFs shown in Figure 6 (now Figure 5) are derived from multiple analyses and data types, including four in this manuscript and one previously published comparative genomic dataset. We were struck with how much overlap we found in general across these broad data and analysis types, but of course there is not perfect overlap among any given pair of analyses.</p><p>The “Group predictive TFs” and “Implicated in eusocial evolution” TFs indeed show little overlap, which is potentially very interesting, but may also be expected given the nature of the analyses. The former is derived from TF activity and its correlation to behavior, while the latter is comparing motif presence across genomes of multiple species of bees. In addition, many TFs (140, see Supplementary file 8) had non-zero importance scores in the predictive analysis, so a reduction to the “most” informative is only part of the complex picture of GRN activity and behavior. Finally, the evolutionary analysis is purely computational, and we do not know whether the activity of these implicated TFs and their targets is also linked to social behavior.</p><p>To provide readers with more context and some possible explanations regarding the overlap we do (and do not) see, we have added the following section to the Discussion:</p><p>“By combining our analysis of GRNs in individual bees with motif enrichment in gene regulatory regions across individuals, we identified a set of 15 TFs which appear to play a key role in regulating specialist behavioral phenotypes. […] Further research exploring the role of these TFs and their activity in a range of contexts is needed to provide clarity on these results.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
