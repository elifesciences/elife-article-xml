cell-cycle progression, polarized cell growth and multicellular development. Here, we define a novel regulatory mechanism by which the motor activity and function of the fission yeast type one myosin, Myo1, is modulated by TORC2-signalling-dependent phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the conserved serine at position 742 (S742) within the neck region changes both the conformation of the neck region and the interactions between Myo1 and its associating calmodulin light chains. S742 phosphorylation thereby couples the calcium and TOR signaling networks that are involved in the modulation of myosin-1 dynamics to co-ordinate actin polymerization and membrane reorganization at sites of endocytosis and polarised cell growth in response to environmental and cell-cycle cues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51150.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of animals, yeast and other eukaryotes all contain a network of filaments known as the actin cytoskeleton that helps to maintain cell shape. When a cell grows, it needs to carefully regulate its actin cytoskeleton to allow the cell to increase in size.</p><p>A family of proteins known as the myosins bind to actin filaments and act as motors to undertake many cellular activities, which include reorganising the cytoskeleton and moving cargo around the cell. Myosin proteins contain three distinct sections: a motor domain that exerts force against actin filaments, a long region known as the lever arm and a tail region that binds to cargo and other molecules.</p><p>Cells control the activities of myosin proteins in several ways. For example, a protein known as calmodulin binds to the lever arm of myosin to regulate how long and stiff it is, and it can also alter how the motor domain behaves. Furthermore, proteins known as kinases add molecules called phosphate groups to specific parts of the myosin proteins in response to changes in the environment surrounding the cell. Previous studies reported that one of these sites is within a section of the lever arm region that binds to calmodulin. However, it remained unclear whether the action of the protein kinase affects how calmodulin regulates myosin.</p><p>Baker et al. used biochemical approaches to study a myosin protein from fission yeast called myosin I. The experiments showed that a protein kinase system called TORC2 added phosphate groups to myosin I affecting how the protein interacted with calmodulin and also alter the shape of the lever arm. This in turn directly affected the ability of the yeast cells to modulate their actin cytoskeleton and grow in response to changes in the nutrients available in the surrounding environment.</p><p>Myosin proteins and TORC2 play critical roles in many processes happening in healthy cells and these proteins are often badly regulated in many types of cancer. Therefore, these findings may benefit research into human health and disease in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pombe</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>TORC2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J012793/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geeves</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulvihill</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M015130/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulvihill</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Industry Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulvihill</surname><given-names>Daniel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mashanov</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name><name><surname>Molloy</surname><given-names>Justin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mashanov</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name><name><surname>Molloy</surname><given-names>Justin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mashanov</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name><name><surname>Molloy</surname><given-names>Justin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cairn Research Ltd, Faversham, UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>iCASE industrial bursary</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IQ domain phosphorylation regulates calmodulin binding and myosin-1 function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton underpins cellular organization by maintaining cell shape through the transmission of mechanical signals between the cell periphery and the nucleus, thereby influencing protein expression, protein organization and cellular architecture in response to the needs of the cell. Myosins, which are actin-associated motor-proteins, work in collaboration with an array of actin-binding proteins to facilitate global cytoskeletal reorganization and a plethora of other processes including cell migration, intracellular transport, tension sensing and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Connell et al., 2007</xref>). Each of the many classes of myosin contain three distinct domains: an actin-binding ATPase motor domain that exerts force against actin, a lever arm or neck region that contains light-chain-binding IQ motifs, and a tail region that specifies cargo binding and other molecular interactions.</p><p>Although the different classes of myosin perform very different cellular functions, they all operate through the same basic mechanism: the motor domain undergoes cyclical interactions with actin, which are coupled to the breakdown of ATP. Each molecule of ATP that is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate can generate movement along actin of 5–25 nm and force of up to 5 pN. The regulation of acto-myosin motility is multi-faceted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heissler and Sellers, 2016a</xref>), combining regulatory pathways that operate through the actin track (historically called thin-filament regulation) and myosin-linked regulation (historically called thick-filament regulation). This latter control is often mediated by phosphorylation of the heavy chain or light chain(s), or by calcium-regulation of light-chain binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heissler and Sellers, 2016b</xref>). Phosphorylation at the conserved ‘TEDS’ site motif, which is located within the myosin motor domain of class one myosin, affects acto-myosin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bement and Mooseker, 1995</xref>), whereas phosphorylation within the tail region of class five myosin controls cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>). By contrast, phosphorylation of class two myosin light chains and/or heavy chain can change the folded state of the heavy chain, thereby altering actin interaction and the ability to form filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Redowicz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kendrick-Jones et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pasapera et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, phosphoregulation of myosin can occur in the head, neck and tail regions, as well as in the light chains, and its impact varies across myosin classes and between paralogues within the same class. The impact of phosphorylation upon the motile function of most myosins remains to be established.</p><p>The genome of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> encodes five myosin heavy chains from classes 1, 2, and 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Win et al., 2002</xref>). The single class one myosin (UniProt Accession: Q9Y7Z8), here termed Myo1, is a 135-kDa protein with a motor domain, a neck region (containing two canonical IQ motifs), and a 49-kDa tail region containing a myosin tail-homology-2 domain (MYTH-2), a membrane-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an SH3 domain and a carboxyl-terminal acidic region. The acidic region associates with, and activates, the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). The myosin motor has a conserved TEDS site, which is phosphorylated to modulate the protein’s ability to associate with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attanapola et al., 2009</xref>). Myo1 associates with membranes, primarily at sites of cell growth, where it is required for endocytosis, actin organization and spore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirotkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itadani et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains associate with the IQ motifs within the myosin neck to regulate both the length and the stiffness of the lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trybus et al., 2007</xref>) and the behavior of the motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamek et al., 2008</xref>). Calmodulins are ubiquitous calcium-binding proteins that associate with and regulate the cellular function of diverse proteins. Calcium associates with up to four EF hand motifs within the calmodulin molecule to instigate a conformational change that modulates the molecule's affinity for IQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crivici and Ikura, 1995</xref>).</p><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> pombe has two calmodulin-like proteins, Cam1 and Cam2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takeda and Yamamoto, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itadani et al., 2006</xref>). Cam1 is a typical calmodulin that associates with IQ-domain-containing proteins in a calcium-dependent manner to modulate functions as diverse as endocytosis, spore formation, cell division and spindle pole body integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takeda and Yamamoto, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itadani et al., 2010</xref>). Although Cam2 shares Cam1’s ability to regulate Myo1, Cam2 differs from Cam1 in two important respects: Cam2 is not essential for viability and is predicted to be insensitive to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sammons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itadani et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, although cells that lack Cam2 show defects in spore formation following sexual differentiation, they have no significant growth-associated phenotypes during the vegetative growth cycle.</p><p>From yeast to man, TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling plays a key role in modulating cell growth in response to changes in cell-cycle status and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartmuth and Petersen, 2009</xref>). The mTOR kinase forms two distinct protein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), which are each defined by unique components that are highly conserved across species. TORC1 contains the Regulatory Associated Protein of mTOR (RAPTOR), whereas in TORC2, RAPTOR is replaced with the Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR (RICTOR). Both TORC1 and TORC2 complexes control cell migration and F-actin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu and Parent, 2011</xref>). TORC2 plays a key role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in yeasts, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and mammalian cells, modulating actin organization and growth in response to cell-cycle progression and the cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, TORC2 recruits and phosphorylates the fission yeast AGC kinase Gad8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuo et al., 2003</xref>), a homologue of human SGK1/2 kinase, to regulate cell proliferation, the switch to bipolar cell growth, cell fusion during mating, and the subsequent meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2016</xref>). The basic principles of the control of the calcium signaling and phosphorylation signaling pathways are understood, but little is known about the interplay between these parallel modes of regulation.</p><p>We have used molecular cell biological, biochemical and single-molecule biophysical techniques to identify and characterize a novel TORC2−Gad8-dependent system that regulates the calcium-dependent switching of the binding of different calmodulin light chains to the neck region of Myo1. We define the contribution that each calmodulin makes to the regulation of this conserved motor protein and describe how they affect the conformation of the Myo1 lever arm. We propose that a concerted mode of regulation involving calcium and phosphorylation controls the motility and function of Myo1 in response to cell-cycle progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> pombe myosin-1 is phosphorylated within the IQ neck domain</title><p>Phospho-proteomic studies of the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson-Grady et al., 2008</xref>) have revealed a conserved phosphoserine residue that is located within the IQ-motif-containing neck region of class I and V myosins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Cam2 is recruited to sites of endocytosis later than Myo1 and Cam1, but prior to vesicle scission/budding, whereupon, like CAPZA<sup>Acp1</sup>, Sla2 and actin, Cam2 remains associated with laterally oscillating, internalized, endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Similarly, simultaneous imaging of Cam1 and Cam2 in <italic>cam1.mCherry cam2.gfp</italic> cells revealed how each protein localizes to a significant proportion of foci lacking the other calmodulin, thereby highlighting the different timings of the engagement of each molecule with the endocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Finally, although Cam1 recruitment to endocytic foci is abolished when Myo1 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the intensity, volume and number of Cam2 foci actually increases in the absence of Myo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 1), even though the internalization and lateral ‘oscillating’ dynamics of Cam2 and actin were dependent on Myo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F &amp; G</xref>).

However, it is worth noting that there are currently differences of opinion on the relationship between levels of Gad8 activity and cytosolic calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>). The structures of the IQ region of Myosin-1 and calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that phosphorylation of Myo1<sup>S742</sup> is likely to impact Cam2 binding at the 1<sup>st</sup> IQ position. Furthermore, our data reveal that CaM is unable to associate with IQ2 alone, as occupancy of IQ1 is required before a second CaM can bind to IQ2 (i.e. regulatory cooperative binding occurs). This switch in light-chain occupancy may provide a mechanism to change the stiffness of the Myo1 neck region (i.e. the ‘lever arm’) and might thereby modulate the movement and force that is produced by this region during the acto-myosin ATPase cycle and/or the load-sensitivity of its actin-bound form.</p><p>Observations within budding yeast indicate that motor activity from a ring of myosins at the lip of the endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mund et al., 2018</xref>) is necessary for endocytic internalization, but the mechanism by which the myosin interacts with actin to facilitate this localized activation is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).

At the critical concentration, myosin heads are able to interact with actin filaments nucleated from either adjacent Myo1 tails or WASP-activated Arp2/3 complexes, which are tethered to the membrane via molecules such as the Talin-like Sla2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirotkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>). The Myo1 is then primed to act as a tension sensor against the actin filament as it pushes against the membrane of the internalized endosome and grows against the significant 0.85 MPa (8.3 atm) turgor pressure within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minc et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The number of Myo1 molecules at the plasma membrane focus remains constant as the membrane is internalized until 2 s after Cam1 disassociates from Myo1. The trigger for Cam1 release is unknown, but the speed at which the event takes place indicates that it is likely to be initiated by a rapid localized spike in calcium. This could perhaps be driven by a critical level of membrane deformation coupled to calcium influx, similar to processes proposed for mechano-transduction and the role of mammalian myosin-1 within the stereocilia of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batters et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Once Cam1 detaches from the Myo1 molecule, the neck loses rigidity, reducing tension between the myosin motor and the actin filament, to promote detachment from F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). Single molecules of Myo1 do not reside for long at the plasma membrane (off rate is ~8 sec<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), so without an interaction with actin, Myo1 would leave the endocytic patch a second or so after losing its Cam1 light chain. Therefore, after Cam1 release, there is a 2 s delay in the disappearance of Myo1 signal as it disassociates from the endocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).</p><p>The conformation and rigidity of the Myo1 lever arm therefore play a key role in modulating the tension-sensing properties of the motor domain. This is consistent with our data showing that wild-type phosphorylation-competent Myo1 resides at the membrane ~1.8 s longer than does Myo1 mutant protein that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 742 (Myo1<sup>S742A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phosphorylation-dependent changes in the conformation of the myosin neck provide a simple mechanism to modulate the rate of endocytosis according to the size and needs of the cell. Similarly, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Myo1<sup>S742</sup> phosphorylation, a single Cam2 resides at the IQ1 motif of the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). While bringing about a change in the conformation of the first half of the myosin lever arm (adjacent to the motor domain), the vacant IQ2 motif allows flexibility within the carboxyl half of the neck region. This would provide a relatively tension-insensitive motor that stalls against the actin polymer, which would therefore persist significantly longer at the endocytic foci, as observed to occur here in meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 1). These changes in lever-arm properties change the overall rate of endocytosis, as observed in differences in the time taken for endosomes to internalize within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Tables 1 and 2).</p><p>Thus, phosphorylation-dependent changes in the calcium-regulated conformation and rigidity of the myosin lever arm could provide a universal mechanism for regulating the diverse cytoplasmic activities and functions of myosin motors within all cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast cell culture</title><p>Cell culture and maintenance were carried out according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moreno et al.

All 3D image stacks were subjected to blind 3D deconvolution before analysis. Average size, number and cellular distribution of foci were calculated from all foci present within ≥30 cells for each sample examined. Timing of foci events were calculated from kymographs generated in Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The proportion of cells displaying a bent cell phenotype was determined from more than 350 calcofluor (1 mg.ml<sup>−1</sup>) stained cells for each strain. Bent cells were defined by a deviation in the direction of growth of &gt;5° from the longitudinal axis.</p><p>TIRF data analyses, including single-molecule detection and tracking, were undertaken using GMimPro software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mashanov and Molloy, 2007</xref>). Endocytic events were identified by creating an image representing the standard deviation of each pixel over the whole video sequence (known as a ‘z-projection’). Bright spots in this image correspond to regions of the yeast cell that showed large intensity fluctuations associated with endocytic activity. Intensity trajectories in these regions of interest (ROIs) (0.5 µm diameter, 5 × 5 pixels) were saved for future analysis. To correct for local variation in background signal, the average intensity in a region of 1.5 µm diameter around the endocytosis site (but not including the central region of interest) was subtracted. Data from ROIs that were contaminated by other endocytosis events, occurring in close proximity and close in time, were manually excluded from the analysis. It was critical to identify the start and end of each endocytosis event accurately so that individual traces could be averaged. To facilitate this, the rising and falling phases of the intensity trace were fitted with a straight line (60 data points, 3 s duration), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for example. The intercept of this line with the baseline intensity gave the t<sub>start</sub> and t<sub>end</sub> values and event duration (T<sub>dur</sub> = T<sub>end</sub> Tst<sub>art</sub>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The amplitude (intensity) of the event A<sub>av</sub> was measured at the middle of the event by averaging 60 data points from 5<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> second from the T<sub>start</sub> (gray bar on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Intensity traces for each given condition were synchronized to the starting point (T<sub>start</sub>) and averaged. (Except Cam2-GFP traces, which were synchronized using t<sub>start</sub> measured from simultaneously acquired Cam1-mCherry signal.) Similarly, traces were synchronized to their end point (T<sub>end</sub>) and averaged. The mean duration of the events (T<sub>dur</sub>) for each condition was then used to reconstruct the mean intensity changes with calculated errors for event amplitude and timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 2). We used the results of single-molecule imaging experiments to calculate the number of single fluorescent molecules contributing to the spot intensity at a given time. As the falling and rising phases of most events fitted well to a simple linear equation, the slope of the fitted lines was used to estimate the rate of accumulation and dissociation of the fluorescent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As Cam2-GFP remained bound to the endocytic vesicle, when vesicle scission occurred, intensity fell rapidly to zero as the vesicle diffused from the TIRF evanescent field; the time of scission was defined as T<sub>scis</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Single-particle tracking was performed using GMimPro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mashanov and Molloy, 2007</xref>) (ASPT module) so that the paths (or trajectories) of individual Myo1 molecules bound to cell membrane could be traced. Trajectories were analyzed to yield mean intensities for individual mNeonGreen- and eGFP-labeled proteins, which could be used to estimate the number of fluorescently tagged molecules associated with each endocytotic event. Intensity-versus-time plots were generated from averages of &gt;30 foci for each protein in each genetic background examined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Balasubramanian, I Hagan, P Nurse, C Shimoda and T Pollard for strains; and Ben Goult, Iain Hagan and Janni Petersen for stimulating discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in its present form.</p><p>This manuscript reports identification of a novel mechanism by which phosphorylation of fission yeast myosin-1 heavy chain, in combination with calponins, controls endocytosis and actin dynamics during bipolar growth and meiosis. The three reviewers stated that the data presented in the manuscript are interesting and potentially very important. However, the manuscript has several shortcomings. First, the manuscript organization is confusing, and it lacks many important details making it very hard to follow. Second, some experiments (e.g. the blots presented in Figure 1) are of insufficient quality, and should be repeated. Third, the link between myosin-1 phosphorylation and TORC2 should be examined in much more detail, and it would be important to provide better insights into physiological roles of TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of myosin-1. Thus, an extensive amount of additional work would be required to address these issues.</p><p>All three reviewers, however, felt that the results presented in the manuscript are novel and interesting. Therefore, if you can address the main points raised by the reviewers by extensively re-writing the manuscript, by carrying out much more thorough analysis of the TORC2-myosin-1 interplay (i.e. provide stronger evidence that phosphorylation at this site in myosin-1 is TORC2-dependent, and examine whether it is a direct substrate of TORC2 or an indirect substrate of a protein kinase that is activated via TORC2-mediated phosphorylation), as well as by providing better quality data on certain key experiments, we would be glad to consider a new submission on this topic for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We hope that the comments by the three reviewers will help you in improving the manuscript, and in deciding whether you will resubmit this work to <italic>eLife</italic> or elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript focuses on the mechanisms by which phosphorylation and calmodulins control the activity of fission yeast myosin-1 in vitro and in cells. The authors demonstrate that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> myosin-1 can be phosphorylated within the IQ motif in a TORC2-dependent manner. This myosin phosphorylation peaks at the early interphase during vegetative growth as well as from G1 until completion in spore formation during meiosis. Replacing the wild-type myosin-1 by a phospho-deficient <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> mutant results in various abnormalities, including defects in actin dynamics at the old cell end during bipolar growth as well as in various deficiencies during meiosis. By extensive biochemical and cell biological analysis, the authors present evidence that only one calmodulin isoform, Cam1, associates with myosin-1 during vegetative growth. They show that phosphorylation at S742 does not affect Cam1-binding to myosin-1, but instead modulates lever arm length upon Cam1 binding. On the other hand, both Cam1 and Cam2 associate with myosin-1 during meiosis, and here the association of Cam1 and Cam2 with myosin-1 appears to be affected by S742 phosphorylation.</p><p>The manuscript contains an impressive amount of data, and it provides interesting new insights into the interplay between myosin-1, calmodulins, and TORC2 signaling pathway. However, the manuscript was quite difficult to follow for two reasons. First, the figure legends and the manuscript text lack many important details, thus making it often hard to understand the rationale and details of the performed experiments. Second, the manuscript organization was somewhat confusing and it appeared as loosely related observations on myosin-1 phosphorylation, calmodulins, endocytosis and meiosis. Thus, the manuscript would benefit from significant re-writing and re-organization, as well as on better 'Discussion' (and a model figure) that would more clearly summarize the main findings.</p><p>1) The physiological links between TORC2, myosin-2 phosphorylation, endocytosis, and meiosis remain somewhat elusive from the manuscript. Moreover, it remained unclear whether Ste20 (Rictor) phosphorylates myosin-1 at S742 or if myosin-1 is phosphorylated by some other downstream kinase. Thus, better discussion on the links between TORC2-dependent myosin-1 phosphorylation and the observed phenotypes would be required to address these issues.</p><p>2) The blots presented in Figure 1 are of insufficient quality. For example, from the blot presented in Figure 1A it is difficult the see the different myosin-1 bands over the background. Moreover, I do not understand why myosin-1 (as detected by a-<italic>myo1</italic> antibody) runs as a sharp band in <italic>ste20</italic><sup>+</sup> sample and as a smear in the <italic>ste20Δ</italic> sample. Finally, the data presented in Figure 1F should be carefully quantified to convincingly show the effects of <italic>myo1.S742</italic> on the growth inhibition in minimal nitrogen media.</p><p>3) The links between myosin-1 phosphorylation and calmodulins with abnormal shmoo tips and spore defect phenotype in meiosis are not particularly clear. Thus, some additional experiments could clarify this issue. The authors show in Figure 7D that actin foci are much less dynamic during meiosis compared to vegetative cells. This is interesting. Could the authors examine the possible effects of Cam2 deletion and <italic>myo1.S742S</italic> on the dynamics of actin patches during meiosis? Does Cam2 deletion affect myosin-1 or Cam1 dynamics during meiosis?</p><p>4) The model figure (Figure 8) is not particularly informative, and e.g. the panels A-E merely summarize the data from earlier publications (and not the new findings presented in this manuscript). Thus, the authors should prepare a completely new version of the model figure that summarizes their own findings on the effects of TORC2-dependent myosin-1 phosphorylation (and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) on Cam1 and Cam2 binding, on lever arm length, and on the function of myosin-1 during vegetative growth and meiosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Baker et al. examines the potential novel regulation of yeast myosin-1 by phosphorylation of the heavy chain in one of the calmodulin binding sites. The study uses an interesting combination of biochemical and live cell imaging techniques to approach the problem. The study is novel and should be of interest to a broad audience from biochemists to cell biologist. I do have some concerns which should be addressed.</p><p>1) The manuscript is not well written and is hard to follow. This is, in part, due to lack of explanation in several places, figures being labeled with abbreviations that are not explained and lack of detail in the figure legends.</p><p>2) I worry that the use of an anti-phosphomyosin antibody is not going to address stoichiometry of phosphorylation. The authors never really show that phosphomyosin-1 is associating with endocytic patches. What if only 10% of the myosin ever gets phosphorylated and that this material remains in the cytoplasm? Can the anti-phosphomyosin antibody be used for immunofluorescent studies of the cells? In the absence of this, could you incubate the cells with phosphatase inhibitors and see whether the normalized staining of the <italic>myo1</italic> band increases beyond what you're currently seeing in control cells?</p><p>3) I'm always a bit suspicious of phosphomimetic mutations. For example, in vitro myosin-2 studies phosphomimetic replacement of S19 does not mimic the effects of phosphorylation very well as shown in a study from the Sweeney and Trybus labs in addition to others (e.g. Sweeney et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 91:1490−1494, 1994). Are any AGC family kinases available commercially and, if so, have the authors considered buying some and trying to phosphorylate the IQ peptides to determine its effect on calmodulin binding?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this work, the authors utilize a mutant allele (Myo1<sup>S742A</sup>) of the Type 1 myosin of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Myo1 to interrogate how presumed TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Myo1 modulates its interaction with calmodulins (Cam1 and Cam2) and affects endocytosis at specific locations within the cell. Characterization of interaction of the Cam's with Myo1 by an in vitro binding assay (via intramolecular FRET) seems well done, convincing, and provides a strong foundation for interpreting the in vivo microscopy observations of both wild-type and the <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> mutant cells. However, of grave concern is the fact that the major claim of this paper – that Myo1 function is regulated via TORC2-dependent phosphorylation (as stated even in the Title of the paper) – is not substantiated. Given that the most novel aspect of this work is, purportedly, that Myo1 is regulated via its TORC2-mediated modification, publication of the work cannot be recommended unless and until more convincing data are presented to support this specific conclusion. In addition, and regrettably, the text of the manuscript overall is very convoluted and often lacks key explanations of important experimental details, which makes interpretation of the results difficult for the reader, and would need extensive revision before further consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The immunoblots presented in Figures 1A, 1C, and 7C are of extremely poor quality. Because the results of these particular experiments are the primary data used to argue that TORC2 phosphorylates Myo1 at S742, these studies need to be repeated to provide more convincing evidence. In this regard, the most highly phosphorylated species of Myo1 still seem to be present in the <italic>ste20Δ</italic> and <italic>gad8Δ</italic> mutant strains. This ambiguity can be addressed by treatment of the lysates with phosphatase to determine which bands are actually phosphorylated species. For Figure 1A, no mention is made in either the corresponding figure panel or manuscript text about the rationale behind the use of the <italic>gad8Δ</italic> strain.</p><p>2) It is clear that the <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> allele has a much more deleterious effect in cells undergoing meiosis (Figure 6) than in cells undergoing vegetative growth (Figure 4). If TORC2 does indeed phosphorylate Myo1, it would be important to know, first, whether TORC2 function is elevated in meiotic cells compared to mitotic cells and, second, what the effect of different growth conditions (vegetative, sexual, and nutrient limiting) is on the association of Myo1 with Cam1 vs. Cam2 as assessed via co-immunoprecipitations. These experiments would lend at least some support for a link between TORC2 and calcium signaling pathways in the regulation of Myo1. One prediction from the data presented in the present manuscript is that binding of Cam2 to Myo1 could regulate endocytic events to inhibit growth.</p><p>3) It is unclear why the authors chose to use only the non-phosphorylated <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> allele in all of the in vivo experiments and only the phosphomimetic <italic>myo1.S742D</italic> allele in all of the in vitro experiments. Both alleles should be used in under both assay conditions to provide essential internal consistency and appropriate controls in all of the experiments.</p><p>4) Figure 3 presents evidence suggesting that the <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> mutant strain undergoes atypical polar cell growth, but no model or explanation for this phenotype is given. Statistical analysis of the sub-cellular distribution of the mNeonGreen.Myo1 signals in Figure 4D and the distribution of actin may help to explain this observation. With regard to the misregulation of polar growth caused by the <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> allele, this phenotype does not seem very deleterious and certainly does not significantly affect the growth rate of the cells (Figure 4C). Can this allele be combined with any other genetic backgrounds that are known to affect polar growth to exacerbate this phenotype?</p><p>5) Figure 2 presumably contains a wealth of useful data, but is extremely hard to interpret due to a lack of detailed experimental information in the corresponding figure legend, as well as a general lack of labels and titles on the graphs (specifically panels B, C, and I).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TORC2-Gad8 dependent myosin phosphorylation modulates regulation by calcium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Pekka Lappalainen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a resubmission of a manuscript focusing on the links between calcium, TORC2, and type 1 myosin (Myo1) in actin dynamics. The authors have carried out several new experiments, as well as revised the manuscript text according to the suggestions by three original reviewers. The study provides interesting new information on the roles of fission yeast calmodulins (Cam1 and Cam2), and TORC2/Gad8 dependent phosphorylation on the activity and cellular functions of Myo1.</p><p>The current version of the manuscript was evaluated by two of the original reviewers who found the manuscript significantly improved. Because one of the original reviewers was unable to evaluate the new version of the manuscript, it was also reviewed by another expert on TOR signaling. This reviewer stated that some additional experiments are required to strengthen the conclusions concerning the TORC2/Gad8 dependence of Myo1 phosphorylation, and its cell cycle regulation. Finally, the manuscript is not particularly reader-friendly, and the authors should still revise the manuscript text to make it better accessible for a non-specialist reader.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that Myo1<sup>S742</sup> phosphorylation is dependent on Gad8 and Ste20 (rictor subunit in TORC2). However, whether this is a direct or indirect phosphorylation remains unknown. The data would be more convincing if the authors would replace Figure 1B with a better quality blot, more rigorously quantify the levels of phosphorylated Myo1, and also include a <italic>tor1Δ</italic> mutant strain to their analysis. In the absence of biochemical experiments to test Myo1 phosphorylation by Gad8, they should clearly state that the data do not necessarily support direct phosphorylation of Myo1 by Gad8.</p><p>2) For the studies on cell cycle regulation of Gad8 and Myo1<sup>S742</sup>-P, the authors should also test if the level of TORC2-Gad8 activity is regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner. If this is not the case, the authors should tone down their conclusions that Gad8 is responsible for the cell cycle phosphorylation of Myo1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51150.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The manuscript contains an impressive amount of data, and it provides interesting new insights into the interplay between myosin-1, calmodulins, and TORC2 signaling pathway.

This is consistent with the serine location within an AGC consensus site, the reported cell cycle variation in Gad8 kinase activity in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles and Gad8’s role in regulating the switch from monopolar to bipolar. We have added new data showing Myo1<sup>S742</sup> phosphorylation is abolished in cells lacking Gad8 (Figure 1B), and that it is significantly reduced in <italic>gad8.T6D</italic> cells (Figure 1B), which have significantly reduced kinase activity compared to the wild type. We have added more background text in the manuscript and models to Figures 1 and 7 to provide the reader the appropriate context of how the study relates to the TORC2-Gad8 signalling pathway.</p><p>We looked into attempting in vitro kinase assays with the endogenous fission protein kinase to provide further evidence of direct phosphorylation. Unfortunately none of the epitope labelled <italic>gad8</italic> strains are functional, and each display growth and cell cycle defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The blots presented in Figure 1 are of insufficient quality. For example, from the blot presented in Figure 1A it is difficult the see the different myosin-1 bands over the background. Moreover, I do not understand why myosin-1 (as detected by a-myo1 antibody) runs as a sharp band in ste20<sup>+</sup> sample and as a smear in the ste20Δ sample. Finally, the data presented in Figure 1F should be carefully quantified to convincingly show the effects of myo1.S742 on the growth inhibition in minimal nitrogen media.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these westerns and replaced each of the blots shown in Figure 1. Statistics for cell lengths of cells shown in the new Figure 1E (old Figure 1F) have been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The links between myosin-1 phosphorylation and calmodulins with abnormal shmoo tips and spore defect phenotype in meiosis are not particularly clear. Thus, some additional experiments could clarify this issue. The authors show in Figure 7D that actin foci are much less dynamic during meiosis compared to vegetative cells. This is interesting. Could the authors examine the possible effects of Cam2 deletion and myo1.S742S on the dynamics of actin patches during meiosis? Does Cam2 deletion affect myosin-1 or Cam1 dynamics during meiosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now undertaken timelapse imaging of GFP-Act1 in <italic>myo1.S742A</italic>, as well as <italic>mNG.myo1</italic> and <italic>cam1.gfp</italic> in and <italic>cam2∆</italic> cells in meiosis, and the data is included in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The model figure (Figure 8) is not particularly informative, and e.g. the panels A-E merely summarize the data from earlier publications (and not the new findings presented in this manuscript). Thus, the authors should prepare a completely new version of the model figure that summarizes their own findings on the effects of TORC2-dependent myosin-1 phosphorylation (and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) on Cam1 and Cam2 binding, on lever arm length, and on the function of myosin-1 during vegetative growth and meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Baker et al. examines the potential novel regulation of yeast myosin-1 by phosphorylation of the heavy chain in one of the calmodulin binding sites. The study uses an interesting combination of biochemical and live cell imaging techniques to approach the problem. The study is novel and should be of interest to a broad audience from biochemists to cell biologist. I do have some concerns which should be addressed.</p><p>1) The manuscript is not well written and is hard to follow. This is, in part, due to lack of explanation in several places, figures being labeled with abbreviations that are not explained and lack of detail in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been changed and edited significantly, to make it easier to read and follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I worry that the use of an anti-phosphomyosin antibody is not going to address stoichiometry of phosphorylation. The authors never really show that phosphomyosin-1 is associating with endocytic patches. What if only 10% of the myosin ever gets phosphorylated and that this material remains in the cytoplasm? Can the anti-phosphomyosin antibody be used for immunofluorescent studies of the cells? In the absence of this, could you incubate the cells with phosphatase inhibitors and see whether the normalized staining of the myo1 band increases beyond what you're currently seeing in control cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now established conditions for undertaking immunofluorescence with the anti-Myo1 S742-phosphorylated-antibody, and this illustrates the phosphorylated form of the Myo1 protein localises to at least a sub-set of the endocytic Myo1 foci (see Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I'm always a bit suspicious of phosphomimetic mutations. For example, in vitro myosin 2 studies phosphomimetic replacement of S19 does not mimic the effects of phosphorylation very well as shown in a study from the Sweeney and Trybus labs in addition to others (e.g. Sweeney et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 91:1490−1494, 1994). Are any AGC family kinases available commercially and, if so, have the authors considered buying some and trying to phosphorylate the IQ peptides to determine its effect on calmodulin binding?</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the reviewer’s reservations on the use of phosphomimetic substitutions, we are confident in the phosphomimetic nature of the proteins, as the data is consistent with the in vivo findings. We could find no commercially produced full length equivalent AGC kinases available. We also looked into attempting in vitro kinase assays with the endogenous fission Gad8 kinase to provide further evidence of direct phosphorylation.</p><p>However none of the epitope labelled <italic>gad8</italic> (or Tor1) strains, from which the Gad8 would be immunoprecipitated, are functional, each displaying growth and cell cycle defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The immunoblots presented in Figures 1A, 1C, and 7C are of extremely poor quality. Because the results of these particular experiments are the primary data used to argue that TORC2 phosphorylates Myo1 at S742, these studies need to be repeated to provide more convincing evidence. In this regard, the most highly phosphorylated species of Myo1 still seem to be present in the ste20Δ and gad8Δ mutant strains. This ambiguity can be addressed by treatment of the lysates with phosphatase to determine which bands are actually phosphorylated species. For Figure 1A, no mention is made in either the corresponding figure panel or manuscript text about the rationale behind the use of the gad8Δ strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these westerns and replaced each of the blots shown in Figure 1. We have repeated the experiment presented in the original Figure 7C, and due to protein instability in starved cells, we have not been able to improve on the original blot presented, however, we feel it supports the statement that Myo1 serine 742 is phosphorylated during the sexual/meiotic cycle.</p><p>We have added text to describe the rationale behind the <italic>gad8∆</italic> strain and added additional data that address the ambiguity – see response to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is clear that the myo1.S742A allele has a much more deleterious effect in cells undergoing meiosis (Figure 6) than in cells undergoing vegetative growth (Figure 4). If TORC2 does indeed phosphorylate Myo1, it would be important to know, first, whether TORC2 function is elevated in meiotic cells compared to mitotic cells and, second, what the effect of different growth conditions (vegetative, sexual, and nutrient limiting) is on the association of Myo1 with Cam1 vs. Cam2 as assessed via co-immunoprecipitations. These experiments would lend at least some support for a link between TORC2 and calcium signaling pathways in the regulation of Myo1. One prediction from the data presented in the present manuscript is that binding of Cam2 to Myo1 could regulate endocytic events to inhibit growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that Gad8 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Myo1, and its published activity coincides with the events activity in the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles, and roles in promoting the switch to bipolar growth and responding to nutrient abundance coincides precisely with our observations on the serine 742 phosphorylation dependent Myo1 functions.</p><p>While we were are able to immunoprecipitate Myo1, Cam1, or Cam2 alone, we were unable to detect co-purification of the other proteins (not shown). Other publications that have demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of fission yeast Myo1 with calmodulin have done so using strains in which the heavy and/or light chains have been dramatically overexpressed. This not only perturbs the normal stochiometry of the proteins being examined (that is an important factor here), it leads to cell cycle and morphological defects, with post-translational regulation likely to be disrupted significantly. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion that Cam2 IQ binding may simply inhibit growth (by disrupting lever arm rigidity/structure and motor activity), and we have added this model to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear why the authors chose to use only the non-phosphorylated myo1.S742A allele in all of the in vivo experiments and only the phosphomimetic myo1.S742D allele in all of the in vitro experiments. Both alleles should be used in under both assay conditions to provide essential internal consistency and appropriate controls in all of the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>In vitrothe recombinant protein remains unmodified and therefore we need to mimic phosphorylation, which is why use the phosphomemetic aspartic acid substitution. In yeast cells however, the reverse is true, and the most appropriate method to understand the impact of the phosphorylation event upon the cell, is to replace the serine for a phosphorylation resistant alanine residue. We could see no significant benefit in replacing the serine for an aspartic acid within the yeast cell, and repeating each analysis again for this strain, as it would not provide further insight into the mechanism described here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3 presents evidence suggesting that the myo1.S742A mutant strain undergoes atypical polar cell growth, but no model or explanation for this phenotype is given. Statistical analysis of the sub-cellular distribution of the mNeonGreen.Myo1 signals in Figure 4D and the distribution of actin may help to explain this observation. With regard to the misregulation of polar growth caused by the myo1.S742A allele, this phenotype does not seem very deleterious and certainly does not significantly affect the growth rate of the cells (Figure 4C). Can this allele be combined with any other genetic backgrounds that are known to affect polar growth to exacerbate this phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done as the reviewer requested and compared polarised growth in <italic>myo1</italic> and <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> cells lacking combinations of <italic>cam2∆</italic>, and the <italic>tea4∆</italic> deletion. Tea4 was chosen for as it demonstrates a strong polarity defect, role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, and regulating the onset of bipolar cell growth (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, while the <italic>myo1.S742A</italic> allele did not exacerbate <italic>tea4∆</italic> associated defects, the <italic>cam2∆</italic> did. This provides another indication that Cam2 and Myo1 play independent roles during the mitotic cell cycle. Text has been added to describe this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2 presumably contains a wealth of useful data, but is extremely hard to interpret due to a lack of detailed experimental information in the corresponding figure legend, as well as a general lack of labels and titles on the graphs (specifically panels B, C, and I).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 has now been simplified significantly and contains fewer panels to simplify interpretation for the reader.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that Myo1<sup>S742</sup> phosphorylation is dependent on Gad8 and Ste20 (rictor subunit in TORC2).

The data would be more convincing if the authors would replace Figure 1B with a better quality blot, more rigorously quantify the levels of phosphorylated Myo1, and also include a tor1∆ mutant strain to their analysis.
