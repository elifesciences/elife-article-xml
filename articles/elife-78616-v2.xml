However, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of the immune microenvironment in AM. Therefore, in this study, we collected clinical samples from Chinese patients with AM and conducted single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the heterogeneity of its tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and the molecular regulatory network. Our analysis revealed that genes, such as <italic>TWIST1</italic>, <italic>EREG</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF9</italic>, and <italic>CTGF</italic> could drive the deregulation of various TME components. The molecular interaction relationships between TME cells, such as MIF-CD44 and TNFSF9-TNFRSF9, might be an attractive target for developing novel immunotherapeutic agents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Acral melanoma is a type of cancer that affects the hands and feet.

But cancer is complicated. Malignant cells recruit other cells to help them survive and grow, and to protect them from attacks by the immune system.

In recent years, the incidence of malignant melanoma has been increasing, with an annual increase rate of 3-5%. Approximately 300,000 new cases and 60,000 deaths are recorded every year. It poses a serious threat to the health of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swick and Maize, 2012</xref>). For patients with confirmed or suspected in situ melanoma, surgical resection is the first treatment option, with a good prognosis provided that metastasis had not occurred. However, metastatic melanoma is the most fatal type of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wahid et al., 2018</xref>), beceuse patients are susceptible to relapse after surgery, resulting in a poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of &lt;10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKean and Amaria, 2018</xref>). Melanoma is generally divided into four types: cutaneous melanoma (CM; occurring primarily in the head, neck, trunk, and limbs), acral melanoma (AM; occurring primarily in the palms, soles of feet, and nail beds where there are no hair follicles), mucosal melanoma, and uveal melanoma. In contrast to the epidemiological data of a proportion of &lt;10% AMs out of the total number of cases of melanoma in the European-descent populations, the proportion of AM cases of the total melanomas in Asians is as high as 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cormier et al., 2006</xref>), and terminal AMs have been considered as a subtype of melanoma with poor prognosis and poor immune efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rose et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors are the pathological basis of tumor recurrence, disease deterioration, and eventual death. The development of a tumor, including invasion and metastasis, is a continuous, progressive, multifactor, and multistep process in coordination with the tumor microenvironments (TMEs). The immune system recognizes tumor antigens and kills tumor cells, but it is not sufficiently strong to eliminate tumors that have formed within the body. Solid tumors are complex tissues comprising not only tumor cells but also stromal cells, inflammatory cells, the vascular system, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which are collectively defined as the TMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Single-cell sequencing is a study of the genome and transcriptome at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). Through genome-wide or RNA amplification, high-throughput sequencing can elucidate the gene structure and gene expression status of individual cells, reflecting the intercell heterogeneity. Compared with the traditional RNA sequencing, the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is more suitable for analyzing the TME components and heterogeneous populations. Its application in the investigations of the TME has provided an unprecedented solution to its cellular and molecular complexities; thus, deepening our understanding of the heterogeneity, plasticity, and complex crossover interactions among different cell types in the TMEs. With the continuous accumulation of scRNA-seq datasets, it will become an indispensable component of tumor immunology, and it will continue to drive scientific innovations in precision immunotherapy and eventually be adopted in routine clinical practice in the foreseeable future. This new technique allows us to conduct better characterization of developmental lineages and differentiation states, which are crucial in understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive the functional diversity of the immune cells in the TMEs.</p><p>In this study, we collected lesion biopsy samples from six patients with clinical AM along with three adjacent paracancerous tissues and a metastatic lymph gland (LG) sample and performed 10× Genomics scRNA-seq and analyses. Our study delineates the scRNA landscape of AM and describes the molecular regulatory network of the TME cells. Combined with cytological experiments, we validated some of the results of our analyses, providing an important reference for AM research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq and cell type identification revealed the heterogeneity of AM</title><p>We collected eight clinical tissues from six patients with AM, including four samples of primary lesions (PLs), three samples of adjacent tissues (ATs), and one sample of LG metastatic tissue.

In the PLs, the AMs had a higher proportion of malignant cells and CAFs, but a lower proportion of lymphocyte infiltrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that AMs may be caused by friction at the extremities. In the metastatic LGs, the proportion of malignant cells was similar between AMs and CMs, but there was still a larger proportion of CAFs in the metastatic LG of AM, which was almost absent in the metastatic LGs of CMs. The endothelial cells and fibroblasts in PLs of AMs interacted more closely with other types of cells, while the secretion signals of immune and myeloid cells in CMs were more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

In the primary tissues, NT, ncWNT, IL1, and GDF cell interaction signaling pathways were specifically identified. NT, ncWNT, and GDF signals were secreted primarily by malignant cells, and IL1 signals were secreted primarily by neutrophils. Chemerin, NRG, and GDF cell interaction signaling pathways were specifically identified in the LG metastatic tissues.

We consider that the cells of subcluster 1 are in a higher malignant state. SCENIC can use the random forest to identify the TF coexpression network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>). We identified the corresponding TF modules in clusters 3 and 1. Among them, TF <italic>TWIST1</italic> and its corresponding coexpression module in the subcluster 1 had higher area under curve (AUC) scores and expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We suspected that TWIST1 may influence the interactions between malignant cells and the other cells by regulating ECM. Therefore, we analyzed the interactions between different malignant cell subclusters and other cell types, and showed that the subcluster with high activity of TWIST1 had stronger interaction strength with stroma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Cells in subcluster 1 interact with receptors of stromal cells such as fibroblasts, through COL1A1-ITGA2 and other collagen pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>), and some of these genes, such as <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A1</italic>, and <italic>COL6A3</italic>, were regulated by TWIST1 in coexpression module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Unlike the epidemiological characteristics of AM in the Western population, wherein the proportion of AMs is &lt;10% out of the total number of cases of melanoma, the proportion of AMs in Asian melanoma patients is approximately 70%, accompanied with poor prognosis and immune efficacy. Single-cell sequencing technology can more intuitively reveal the composition of various types of cells in the microenvironments and determine the specific subgroups that cannot be considered by traditional bulk sequencing.</p><p>Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including lymphocytes, TAMs, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are important components of the TMEs. On the one hand, these immune cells can kill tumor cells (such as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells); on the other hand, they can also promote tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Existing studies show that immune cells in the TMEs can play a role in promoting tumor development through immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joyce and Fearon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruffell et al., 2010</xref>), promoting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeNardo et al., 2008</xref>), inhibiting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), secreting growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balkwill et al., 2005</xref>), helping tumor cells escape growth suppressing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), promoting tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kessenbrock et al., 2010</xref>), and altering the energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buck et al., 2017</xref>). Like macrophages, TAMs have two forms of macrophages, M1-type and M2-type. The M1-type macrophages can inhibit and phagocytose tumor cells, whereas the M2-type macrophages play immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting roles. We observed that the M2-type macrophages with a high expression of <italic>EREG</italic> had a weaker migration ability, but their ability to promote tumor development is stronger; thus, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment.</p><p>In addition to immune cellular components, stromal components such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts are important components of the TMEs. By secreting TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noma et al., 2008</xref>) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olofsson et al., 1999</xref>), tumor cells can induce and activate CAFs and endothelial cells, change the tumor cell phenotype, reshape the ECM, help generate blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels, and then accelerate the outward escape of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Folkman, 1990</xref>). In recent years, researchers have found that the stromal components in the TMEs also affect the antitumor immune effects, indicating that it is important to target the related stromal cells in the process of tumor immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turley et al., 2015</xref>). Fibroblasts normally maintain the structure of the tissues. However, in the early stage of tumor formation, several chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, etc.) secreted by tumor cells can transform normal fibroblasts around the tumor into CAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), gradually forming a microenvironment suitable for malignant proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.</p><p>Given the important role of TMEs in tumor progression, it has become an important therapeutic target. Considering the elimination of immunosuppressive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TME as an example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Topalian et al., 2016</xref>), antibodies that can block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) have been marketed and have achieved remarkable results in the treatment of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eroglu et al., 2015</xref>), lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robert et al., 2015</xref>), Merkel cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engels, 2019</xref>), and other tumors. Targeted drugs that block the activation of the VEGF signaling pathway and inhibit tumor metastasis, such as sorafenib and bevacizumab, have also been widely developed. Nevertheless, although these drugs have improved survival in patients with advanced-stage disease, their efficacy is limited, and the response rate is low for AM, which is more common in the Asian population. Therefore, a better understanding of the TME of AM could accelerate the discovery of new targets or combination therapeutic strategies to help clinicians select the appropriate treatment regimens and predict outcomes. Here, we have generated a single-cell transcriptome landscape, elucidated the components of the microenvironment within AM tissues, and analyzed the cell interactions.</p><p>In this study, we identified nine cell types in the AM microenvironment, among which malignant cells accounted for the largest proportion, followed by CAFs. Through cell communication analyses, we found that among ATs, PLs, and LG samples, the interactions between malignant cells and macrophages, T and B cells and CAFs became increasingly stronger. This suggests that metastatic/malignant cells may have a stronger ability to remodel the surrounding stromal cells. We also found that malignant cells with a high expression of <italic>TWIST1</italic> have the highest degree of malignancy and higher ability to invade and metastasize. TWIST1 is one of the EMT-inducer prototypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>); however, to what extent these different functions of TWIST1, including its effects on EMT, stemness, proliferation, and apoptosis, are functionally linked or whether these functions are independently regulated by TWIST1 remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasinska et al., 2018</xref>). We suspected that TWIST1 may influence the interactions between malignant cells and other cells by regulating ECM.</p><p>Currently, immune therapy primarily targets T cells (PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4). However, these T cells with high expressions of <italic>PDCD1</italic> and <italic>CTLA4</italic> are almost absent in a significant number of patients with AM, which may make the patients unresponsive to immune checkpoint suppression therapy. At the transcriptional level, our data found that <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> was highly expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the AM microenvironment, and existed at the end of the pseudotime trajectory, while <italic>PDCD1</italic> and <italic>CTLA4</italic> expression levels were relatively low. Additionally, there was a ligand-receptor relationship with tumor cells. Several previous studies have found that TNFRSF9 plays an important role. TNFRSF9 is an important activated immune checkpoint molecule on surface of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheuk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckstrum and Bany, 2011</xref>), which has a complex bidirectional signal regulation mechanism. The two proteins, TNFRSF9 and TNFSF9, play multiple roles in a variety of cancers, autoimmune, infectious and inflammatory diseases, mediating complex immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shuh et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, many studies have found that TNFRSF9/TNFSF9 is involved in immune regulation of various tumors, including pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glorieux and Huang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), but their specific role in tumor development has not been clarified. Currently, the prevailing theory is that TNFRSF9 agonists can be used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases mainly mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but may worsen autoimmune diseases mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Geuijen et al. found that TNFRSF9 agonists in combination with PD-L1 effectively activated and amplified tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells; thus, enhancing tumor control and elimination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geuijen et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, targeting TNFRSF9<sup>+</sup> T cells may be a novel choice for AM therapy but more validations are required to determine whether it is exciting or antagonistic.</p><p>Furthermore, CAFs are important in the TMEs. This is because previous studies have shown that CAFs regulate angiogenesis by producing proangiogenic factors, such as FGF-2 and VEGF-A, thereby providing essential information for highly proliferating tumor cells. CAFs can also help tumor cells overcome immune surveillance by recruiting immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages and MDSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flavell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In this AM dataset, we annotated a new subcluster of fibroblasts, CTGF<sup>+</sup> CAFs, which might be a key factor in AM tumor occurrence and metastasis. CTGF<sup>+</sup> CAFs act on malignant cells through CTGF and may occur through SPP1-CD44, PTN-NCL, and MDK-NCL interactions to affect M2-type macrophages. Using AUC of the TF motif score of each cell, as estimated by SCENIC, we found that the NFATC4 motif was specifically activated in CTGF<sup>+</sup>CAFs and TF NFATC4 could activate the expression of genes, such as CTGF. The public dataset shows that patients with a high expression of NFATC4 target genes have lower survival rates. These results suggest that NFATC4 is a potentially important regulator of AM development.</p><p>Almost in the same period as our study, Li et al. also carried out a study on scNA-seq for AM, and reported similar, as well as different, results compared to our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>). For example, we both found out that AMs are less infiltrated by immune cells than non-AMs. However, the two studies identified different microenvironmental components. For instance, our study identified a large proportion of CAFs, which were not obvious in Li’s data. Furthermore, we both found novel immunotherapeutic targets that are more suitable for AM but are not samilar. These differences may be caused by the fact that the samples of the two studies were from different ethnic groups and have different sample types. The small sample sizes included in the two studies may also lead to the differences in the results. Therefore, it is still necessary to further expand the study cohort and strengthen the attention to AMs.</p><p>However, there are certain limitations associated with our study. First, the number of clinical samples used for analyses was small, which may limit the generalizability of our results. Second, more metastatic samples could have made our grouping more convincing. Finally, the experiments included in our study did not use AM cell lines, and we could not perform experimental verification of all the genes that were mined, because we could not obtain the AM cell lines and experimental materials in time owing to the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>To summarize, we determined the expression profile of cellular elements in AM and confirmed the characteristics of these tumor-related elements by scRNA-seq. Through in-depth analysis of interactions among the microenvironments components, we proposed the prognostic markers and therapeutic targets with potential for clinical transformation. Our study provides an understanding of cancer immunology and is an important resource for future drug discovery for AM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and samples</title><p>All samples were obtained from the General Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army, Beijing, China.

proportion it represents out of all melanoma cases among European-descent individuals, which has translated into an important gap of knowledge in the field and hindered the development of effective therapies to control the disease. Therefore, studies that address this unmet need in melanoma research are very important. Here, He and collaborators analyse eight samples from six patients with acral melanoma through single-cell RNA sequencing. They describe the tumour microenvironment in these tumours, including descriptions of interactions among distinct cell types in the tumour microenvironment and potential biomarkers.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including C Daniela Robles-Espinoza as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In this study, He and collaborators analyse eight samples from six patients with acral melanoma through single-cell RNA sequencing. They describe the tumour microenvironment in these tumours, including descriptions of interactions among distinct cell types and potential biomarkers. The reviewers agreed that this study is important as it focuses on an understudied type of melanoma and is quite detailed. However, they have also identified a number of points to address before publication.</p><p>1. In several parts of the text and figures, the authors assume that their samples represent the &quot;progression of tumours&quot; and this seems to be one of the most relevant comparisons that the study makes. However, these samples do not recapitulate tumour progression. Adjacent tissue is not considered a stage of tumour progression. Also, the number of samples is low (especially metastasis n=1) to conclude that changes observed are not sample-dependent. Could the authors please comment on these issues?</p><p>2. This study focuses on tumour-microenvironment interactions. When reading such a study, those interested in these interactions and in melanoma biology and treatment will undoubtedly ask if what is seen in acral melanoma is similar to what is seen in non-acral skin melanoma. The only comparison that is made in this sense is regarding TNFRSF9 expression in the current cohort, and in cutaneous melanoma single-cell data previously published. If these comparisons, even if only in the discussion, are not done, it does not help one understand why it would be relevant to study cutaneous melanomas located in acral skin. Could the authors please add a comparison with what has been observed in cutaneous melanoma, are there any differences or similarities between these diseases?</p><p>3. The two reviewers commented on this point: Finding that expression of TNFRSF9 is higher than PDCD1 and CTLA-1 in exhausted T cells of acral melanomas is interesting, especially because it is shown that in non-acral cutaneous melanoma, the opposite occurs. But this sole information is not sufficient to suggest that TNFRSF9 would be a &quot;suitable immune check target for AM treatment&quot;. Perhaps the authors assume too much from a bioinformatic analysis? Are there any other data that can support this hypothesis? Or is this claim solely based on a biomarker expressed by infiltrating T-cells?</p><p>4. Related to &quot;Pseudotime analyses of malignant cells&quot;, the main conclusion of this part is that there is a subpopulation of tumour cells (cluster 1) that is in a more terminal/highly malignant state. The authors identify TWIST as a transcription factor that may be related to malignancy and show that it can induce EMT markers and an aggressive phenotype in A375 cells. TWIST is a known EMT regulator with a role in aggressiveness, and therefore this information is not novel. Have the authors considered repeating their experiments in an acral cell line? Considering the line of thought that the authors follow in the other figures, it would be more relevant to look at how TWIST expression influences the communication of melanoma cells with other stromal cells. For instance, is the interaction profile of cells expressing TWIST different from cells expressing transcription factors involved in the Cluster 1 phenotype? Are these populations communicating differently with the stromal cells?</p><p>5. Line 85: &quot;we initially identified aneuploid mutant cells as malignant cells, which were derived primarily from primary and lymph gland metastatic tissues, and diploid mutant cells were identified as cells of other microenvironmental components&quot; – what is the basis to assume this? Were most of the diploid cells found in adjacent non-malignant tissue? Were the aneuploid cells expressing oncogenic markers? Can the authors make such an assumption without backing it up with additional evidence?</p><p>6. Line 28. &quot;Moreover, a single-cell reference for AM has not been established.&quot; Reviewers comment that other work should be acknowledged here, and the authors should seek to place their results in the context of other previous similar work. For example, see similar work by Keiran Smalley's group (PMID 35247927).</p><p>7. Finally, both reviewers commented that the figures need much more description to be understandable. Specifically:</p><p>a. Figure S1D needs more description than just &quot;Heatmap showing the copycat result&quot;. What do the colors and columns mean? Also, please label axes.</p><p>b. In Figure S1F, what does a higher score mean?</p><p>c. Figure S1G is confusing to a reviewer – It seems that the clusters constituted the immune cell labels (as it appears to be the case in Figure S1F), however, it seems a cluster can be constituted by several different immune cell types? Can the authors specify please what the clusters indicate then?</p><p>d. Is the left panel of figure S1G necessary? Is it not redundant with the right panel?</p><p>e. Should Figure S3 be called differently? Not all the figure is about TWIST1.</p><p>f. Figures 2A-C – do the colors mean anything? What does a thicker line mean? What is an ongoing and incoming interaction strength?</p><p>g. Figure 3A – clusters are not labeled so it is not easy to follow the narrative.</p><p>h. Figure 3B – What are the colors at the top? The columns?</p><p>i. Figure 4A, 4D – labeling colors are important – which color marks M1 and which M2?</p><p>j. Figure 5D – What is the black blurb? Can Figure 5F be above Figure 5H? Figures 5F and 5H have the same legend but they don't look the same. Can colours be labeled on top?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78616.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

It is not accurate to represent the adjacent tissue samples as ‘tumour progression’, and our study does not want to focus on the tumour developmental process. We have revised the related description in the text.</p><p>Tumor adjacent tissues (ATs) have always been the focus of research on TMEs. Some studies believe that there are a lot of mutations and clone amplification in normal tissues adjacent to cancer, which may be in a pre-cancerous state (PMID: 33004515), and many single-cell studies of tumours have also sampled and paired para-cancer tissues (e.g., PMID: 29988129; PMID: 35303421). Metastatic lymph gland (LG) tissue can demonstrate the microenvironmental status of migrated tumour cells in the new environment.</p><p>The sample amount does limit the generality of the results, and we pointed out in the Discussion section. Most acral melanoma (AM) patients opt for surgical resection at an early stage to avoid the possibility of metastasis, so we rarely encountered patients with lymph gland (LG) metastases. We only collected one metastatic sample, because it is highly rare in the clinic. The sample that we collected has a high quality, such as a high cell activity of single cell suspension after dissociation (95.30%) and rich densities of tumor cells and other stroma cells. Therefore, we added its sequencing data into the overall analysis, hoping to contribute to the comprehensiveness of resources and research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have already suppled the comparation of AMs with non-acral skin cutaneous melanomas (CMs), using the published data. The results are supplemented in the first part of the results and Figure 1 G-I. The current results showed that the AMs had a higher proportion of malignant cells and CAFs, but a lower proportion of lymphocyte infiltrations in the primary lesions (PLs). In the metastatic lymph glands (LGs), the proportion of malignant cells was similar between AMs and CMs, but there was still a large proportion of CAFs in the metastatic LGs of AMs, which was almost absent in the metastatic LGs of CMs. The endothelial cells and fibroblasts in PLs of AMs interacted more closely with other types of cells, while the secretion signals of immune cells and myeloid cells in CMs were more active. In LGs, malignant cells in metastatic LGs of AMs secreted stronger signals to immune cells and myeloid cells, and other interactions were weaker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Perhaps the authors assume too much from a bioinformatic analysis? Are there any other data that can support this hypothesis? Or is this claim solely based on a biomarker expressed by infiltrating T-cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the key question. We agree with you that it is not sufficient to suggest that TNFRSF9 would be a new target. We provided a possibility that TNFRSF9 may serve as a novel therapy. To get more support, it requires multi-omics analyses and assays. In fact, RNA sequencing can only put forward insight from the perspective of expression levels. We perused other similar reports at the scRNA level; for example, a similar article (PMID: 35247927) also considered VISTA and ADORA2 as potential novel targets for immunotherapy according to the increased expression of VISTA and ADORA2. At the transcriptional level, our data found that TNFRSF9 was highly expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the AM microenvironments, and existed at the end of the pseudotime trajectory, whereas PDCD1 and CTLA-4 expression levels were relatively low. In addition, there was a ligand-receptor relationship with tumor cells.</p><p>In addition to the differences in expression that transcriptomes can provide, several previous studies have found that TNFRSF9 plays an important role in cancer, autoimmune diseases and inflammation. TNFRSF9 is an important activated immune checkpoint molecule on surface of T cells (PMID: 21560035, PMID: 14671675), which has a complex bidirectional signal regulation mechanism. The two proteins, TNFRSF9 and TNFSF9, play multiple roles in a variety of cancers, autoimmune, infectious and inflammatory diseases, mediating complex immune responses (PMID: 23531747). In recent years, many studies have found that TNFRSF9/TNFSF9 is involved in immune regulation of various tumours, including pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 31288851, PMID: 21059892), but their specific role in tumour development has not been clarified. Currently, the prevailing theory is that TNFRSF9 agonists can be used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases mainly mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, but may worsen autoimmune diseases mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. Geuijen et al., found that TNFRSF9 agonists in combination with PD-L1 effectively activated and amplified tumour-specific cytotoxic T cells, enhancing tumour control and elimination (PMID: 34290245). Our current results suggested that targeting TNFRSF9 may benefit patients with AM, but more validation is required to determine whether it is activated or anergic. The above content has been supplemented in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Are these populations communicating differently with the stromal cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your very good question. The pseudotime analyses showed that TWIST1 was highly expressed in terminal site, and SCENIC found that TWIST1 and its corresponding co-expression module in the subcluster 1 had higher AUC score (Figure 3B and Figure3—figure supplement 1C). Therefore, we suspected that TWIST1 might play a vital regulatory role in the development of malignant cells by regulating the target genes in its co-expression module. We have analysed the communication between subcluster1 (<italic>TWIST1</italic><sup>+</sup> malignant cells) and other stromal cells, and the results are supplemented in the last paragraph of the third part of our Results section. Figure 3 and Figure3—figure supplement 1 have also been revised. We analysed the interactions between different malignant cell subclusters and other cell types, and showed that the subclusters with high activity of TWIST1 had stronger interaction strength with stroma cells (Figure 3F). Cells in subcluster 1 interacted with receptors of stromal cells, such as fibroblasts through COL1A1-ITGA2 and other collagen pathways (Figure 3G and Figure3—figure supplement 1H), and some of the genes, such as COL1A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, were regulated by TWIST1 in a co-expression module.</p><p>We would like to try to replicate the assays in AM cell lines as you rightly suggested, but to our regrets and unfortunately, it is difficult for us to obtain AM cell lines. No commercial AM cell lines can be purchased from ATCC or ECACC. AM cell lines are more difficult to establish and there are few reports on methods for establishing primary acral melanoma cell cultures (PMID: 22578220, PMID: 17488338). Some Japanese and Chinese researchers have isolated the primary generation of AM cells (e.g., PMID: 17488338, PMID: 22578220, PMID: 34097822), but due to the customs policy and the COVID-19 epidemic, we could not receive them within a short period. Moreover, these studies also stated their limitations; namely, that the stability during serial passaging was not evaluated. Therefore, it may be very time-consuming to obtain operable AM cell lines for functional assays. Thus, I am afraid that we would not be able to improve the experiments in a short time; that is really a pity. However, our research group would like to have the opportunity to separate and culture primary cells in subsequent studies, and improve relevant experiments according to your valuable suggestions. Many thanks, again, for your comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

An effective approach to distinguish tumour cells from normal cells involves the identification of aneuploid copy number profiles, which are common (88%) in most human tumours (PMID: 29622463) and are not found in stromal cell types that have diploid genomes. Gao et al., developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach, called copy number karyotyping of aneuploid tumors (CopyKAT), to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5 Mb from read depth in high-throughput scRNA-seq data (PMID: 33462507). We used this tool to define malignant cells; hence, the term ‘aneuploid’. Adjacent non-malignant tissues barely contain aneuploid cells (Figure1—figure supplement 1E). We also annotated the cells with marker genes; the aneuploid cells were confirmed to express oncogenic markers (Figure 1E and Figure1—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Both studies were carried out at about the same period, and Li et al.'s study had not yet been published when we wrote our manuscript. We perused the study by Keiran Smalley's Group and found some similarities and differences between the two studies. We have already revised the description in Line 28, and added something new with regard to the research of Keiran Smalley's Group in the Discussion section. For example, we both have found that AMs are less infiltrated by immune cells than non-acral melanomas.</p><p>However, the two studies identified different microenvironmental components. We have both found new immunotherapeutic targets that are more suitable for AM, but they are not the same. These differences may be caused by the fact that the samples for the two studies were from different ethnic groups and had different sample types. The small sample sizes included in the two studies may also lead to the difference in results. Therefore, it is still necessary to further expand the study cohort and strengthen the attention to AM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Also, please label axes.</p></disp-quote><p>We adjusted Figure S1D to S1C(Figure1—figure supplement 1D to Figure1—figure supplement 1C). Warm colours represent the increase in copy number, while cold colors represent the loss of copy number. Columns represent genomic positions. In aneuploid cells, copy number amplification and deletion are more frequent, which are more consistent with the characteristics of the malignant cells. We have labelled the colour and columns in Figure S1C(Figure1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

Since the cell population information obtained by Seurat process is a method independent of prior knowledge, the same cell cluster generally belongs to the same cell type. At the same time, the number of genes identified by the single-cell sequencing data of 10× Genomics is insufficient, and it is inevitable that there will be fluctuations in the expression of marker genes in a few cells, resulting in false-positive cell annotation results. Therefore, we will take the results of cell classification as the main, and the results of cell annotation as the auxiliary. The proportion of cell types in SingleR annotation results in each cell population will be counted, and the principle of minority obeying majority will be used to determine cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.

Different colours represent different cell types. The thickness of the line represents the strength of cellular interactions, and the thicker the line, the stronger the strength of the interactions. Outgoing means cells secrete signals or have ligands, while incoming means cells receive signals or have receptors. The corresponding outgoing and incoming interaction strength of the cells are obtained through the statistics of expression levels of ligand- and receptor-coding genes in the cells.
