In this context, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>Pa</italic>) is of special concern since colonizing strains frequently acquire multiple drug resistance (MDR). Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a neutrophil-derived, endogenous protein with high bactericidal potency against Gram-negative bacteria. However, a significant range of people with CF (PwCF) produce anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies against BPI (BPI-ANCA), thereby neutralizing its bactericidal function. In accordance with literature, we describe that 51.0% of a total of 39 PwCF expressed BPI-ANCA. Importantly, an orthologous protein to human BPI (huBPI) derived from the scorpionfish <italic>Sebastes schlegelii</italic> (scoBPI) completely escaped recognition by these autoantibodies. Moreover, scoBPI exhibited high anti-inflammatory potency towards <italic>Pa</italic> LPS and was bactericidal against MDR <italic>Pa</italic> derived from PwCF at nanomolar concentrations. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of highly active orthologous proteins of huBPI in treatment of MDR <italic>Pa</italic> infections, especially in the presence of BPI-ANCA.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that makes people produce unusually thick and sticky mucus that clogs their lungs and airways. This inevitably leads to recurring bacterial infections, particularly those caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Antibiotics are needed to treat these infections. However, over time most bacteria build modes of resistance to these drugs and, once multiple drug-resistant bacteria colonize the lung, very limited treatment options are left. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are desperately needed.</p><p>Notably, humans themselves express a highly potent antimicrobial protein called BPI (short for Bactericidal/permeability‐increasing protein) that attacks Gram-negative bacteria, including multiple drug-resistant strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Unfortunately, many people with cystic fibrosis also generate antibodies that bind to BPI and interfere with its antimicrobial function.</p><p>Faced with this conundrum, Holzinger et al. set out to find BPIs made by other animals which might not be recognized by human antibodies and also display a high potential to attack Gram-negative bacteria. Based on specific selection criteria, Holzinger et al. focused their attention on BPI made by scorpionfish, a type of venomous fish that live near coral reefs.</p><p>Compared to other BPI proteins they investigated, the one produced by scorpionfish appeared to be the most capable of binding to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> via a prominent surface molecule exclusively found on Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, when Holzinger et al. tested whether the antibodies present in people with cystic fibrosis could recognize scorpionfish BPI, they found that the BPI completely evaded detection. The scorpionfish BPI was also able to pre-eminently attack <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. In fact, it was even able to potently kill drug-resistant strains of the bacteria that had been isolated from people with cystic fibrosis.</p><p>This study suggests that scorpionfish BPI could serve as an alternative to antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis that have otherwise untreatable bacterial infections. Drug-resistant bacteria which cause life threatening conditions are on the rise across the globe, and scorpionfish BPI could be a potential candidate to treat affected patients. In the future, animal experiments will be needed to explore how highly potent non-human BPIs function in whole living organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein</kwd><kwd>scorpionfish</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>multiple drug resistance</kwd><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) from the scorpionfish <italic>Sebastes schlegelii</italic> escapes detection by BPI autoantibodies derived from people with cystic fibrosis and reveals excellent anti-inflammatory potency as well as profound antimicrobial activity towards <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> including multiple drug-resistant strains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive disorder induced by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins, 1992</xref>). Defects in <italic>CFTR</italic> negatively influence homeostasis of airway surface liquid and mucus of the respiratory epithelium, aggravating mucociliary clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gustafsson et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the clinical improvements achieved by CFTR modulators in people with at least one F508del mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Middleton et al., 2019</xref>), chronic pulmonary infections with the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>Pa</italic>) will continue to determine disease progression in untreated or unresponsive CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emerson et al., 2002</xref>). In these cases, continuous suppressive antibiotic therapy is a standard regime to improve survival. However, the long-term application of antibiotics promotes the emergence of persister populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>) and multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pitt et al., 2003</xref>), thus limiting the therapeutic options. The neutrophil-derived bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is highly active against Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiss et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, BPI acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator by neutralizing Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dentener et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss et al., 1983</xref>). By inhibiting growth of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>Ec</italic>) and neutralizing endotoxic activity of LPS in a picomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ederer et al., 2022</xref>), it is one of the most effective antimicrobials in the human body. The recombinant N-terminal fragment of human BPI (rBPI21) was shown to be highly effective against MDR Gram-negative bacteria, including MDR <italic>Pa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weitz et al., 2013</xref>). However, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies directed against BPI (BPI-ANCA) found in up to 83% of people with CF (PwCF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theprungsirikul et al., 2021b</xref>) inhibit the bactericidal function of BPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McQuillan et al., 2020</xref>). Coherently, BPI-ANCA correlate with increased colonization with <italic>Pa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hovold et al., 2020</xref>), impaired lung function and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlsson et al., 2007</xref>). To restore BPI function, we speculated that orthologous proteins with conserved bactericidal and LPS-neutralizing activity would escape recognition by intrinsic BPI-ANCA and therefore preserve their bactericidal activity when applied to BPI-ANCA-positive PwCF. Based on known properties, sequence homologies, and structural considerations, we selected murine BPI (muBPI) of the house mouse <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wittmann et al., 2008</xref>), scorpionfish BPI (scoBPI) of the Korean rockfish <italic>Sebastes schlegelii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), and oyster BPI (osBPI) of <italic>Magallana gigas</italic> (Pacific oyster, previously <italic>Crassostrea gigas;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) for comparison to human BPI (huBPI, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>). In contrast to huBPI, neither muBPI nor scoBPI were recognized by BPI-ANCA present in the sera of PwCF. Furthermore, scoBPI displayed superior LPS-neutralizing capacity and bactericidal activity towards MDR <italic>Pa</italic> at a nanomolar range.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparison of the N-terminal barrel in orthologous BPI</title><p>The N-terminal domain of huBPI contains three highly cationic regions (regions I–III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), which engage with the negatively charged moieties of LPS to neutralize its pro-inflammatory potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Little et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gazzano-Santoro et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the affinity towards LPS is roughly determined by the respective quantity of basic amino acids. Preserved LPS neutralization as well as bactericidal activity was previously described for BPI orthologues derived from distantly related species such as the Pacific oyster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and ray finned fish (Actinopterygii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun and Sun, 2016</xref>). In comparison to nine other Actinopterygii BPI sequences, scoBPI comprised the highest number of the cationic amino acids arginine, histidine, and lysine in the corresponding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). A sequence alignment also revealed that scoBPI contained more basic amino acids in regions I–III than muBPI and osBPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and D</xref>). In contrast to LPS binding, only 15 amino acids in region II determine the antimicrobial activity in huBPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Little et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within this region, sequence analysis revealed a conserved cationic charge with a total of five basic amino acids for muBPI or six for osBPI, scoBPI, and huBPI, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Exploiting the published three-dimensional structures and electrostatic surface potentials for huBPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beamer et al., 1997</xref>) and AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>), predictions for the orthologous proteins displayed a highly condensed positively charged cluster in scoBPI that was exclusively found at the N-terminal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Within the investigated class of Actinopterygii, acBPI of the sterlet <italic>Acipenser ruthenus</italic> (subclass Chondrostei) and gaBPI of the Atlantic cod <italic>Gadus morhua</italic> (subclass Neopterygii) also presented a cluster of positive charges in the respective area along with a relatively high quantity of basic amino acids in functional regions I–III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A</xref>). Interestingly, overall sequence identity with scoBPI was comparably low (56.4 and 62.8%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In conclusion, this initial screen revealed a higher quantity of positively charged surface areas for scoBPI and other fish BPI compared to the mammalian muBPI or the distantly related osBPI.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment and analysis of orthologous proteins to human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (huBPI).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of amino acid sequences of orthologous proteins.

Sequence homology between huBPI and Actinopterygii orthologues, including scoBPI, was low ranging from 36.2 to 38.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and, consistent with distant or close relationship to huBPI, 24.9% for osBPI and 54.3% for muBPI, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that BPI-ANCA in the sera of PwCF would not bind to non-huBPI. First, we screened the sera of 39 PwCF for the presence of BPI and BPI-ANCA. While levels of BPI in the sera were comparable among PwCF and an age- and sex-matched control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), BPI-ANCA as measured in arbitrary units (AU) were significantly increased in PwCF (control: mean 314.8 AU, 95% confidence interval [CI] 209.3–420.4 AU; CF: mean 2218.0 AU, 95% CI 1271.0–3166.0 AU, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on our evaluation described above, we selected muBPI, scoBPI, and osBPI for functional analysis.

Next, we were interested in whether BPI was also active against the highly adapted <italic>Pa</italic> strains from PwCF. Therefore, six distinct MDR <italic>Pa</italic> isolates of five PwCF were selected (mean age at sample collection 24.8 ± 7.1 y). Broad-spectrum resistance, including resistance to Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ceftazidime, Cefepime, Imipenem, and Meropenem, was verified by disc diffusion testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Despite major adaptions during chronic <italic>Pa</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>), three of the six isolates were also highly susceptible to both huBPI and scoBPI at concentrations of 20 nM after 1 hr of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

One of the less sensitive strains (isolate 5) potentially emerged from a previous isolate (isolate 2) in a time course of 3.3 y, possibly indicating adaptions to a long-term BPI exposure in vivo. In accordance with literature for huBPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichele et al., 2006</xref>), mucoid strains were susceptible to both huBPI and scoBPI.

Indeed, we even observed a trend towards superior antibiotic activity against MDR <italic>Pa</italic> for scoBPI compared to huBPI at a concentration of 500 nM. As opposed to established antibiotics that mainly target processes associated with bacterial cell envelope biogenesis, DNA replication, transcription, and protein biosynthesis, the mode of action of BPI relies on membrane disruption by binding to LPS of the outer cell wall in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wiese et al., 1997</xref>). Bactericidal activity via membrane perturbation of MDR <italic>Pa</italic> by scoBPI could be verified by TEM and explains the susceptibility to BPI despite MDR. As seen by viability imaging, the bactericidal activity of scoBPI was impressively fast and occurred within 1–3 hr. Activity via membrane permeabilization implies inhibition of non-replicating bacteria, possibly also including persister mutants of <italic>Pa</italic> commonly found in CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartell et al., 2020</xref>). Sustained immune responses towards <italic>Pa</italic> in PwCF trigger a mucoid phenotype that is associated with resistance to host antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malhotra et al., 2018</xref>), impaired phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabral et al., 1987</xref>), and formation of biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Høiby et al., 2010</xref>), allowing for bacterial persistence in the CF environment. As shown previously for huBPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichele et al., 2006</xref>), mucoid <italic>Pa</italic> isolates were indeed highly susceptible to the bactericidal action of scoBPI. Beyond CF, ESKAPE pathogens (<italic><underline>E</underline>nterococcus faecium</italic>, <italic><underline>S</underline>taphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic><underline>K</underline>lebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic><underline>A</underline>cinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic><underline>P</underline>a,</italic> and <italic><underline>E</underline>nterobacter</italic> spp.) were defined by the WHO as priority pathogens for new antimicrobial drug development as these are continuously associated with multiple drug resistance and severe nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rice, 2008</xref>). In this aspect, further studies of scoBPI on the Gram-negative members of the ESKAPE cluster, such as <italic>Pa</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>-complex, and various Enterobacteriaceae, are worthwhile. It is noteworthy that BPI-ANCA are also frequently found in other inflammatory disorders like non-CF bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theprungsirikul et al., 2021b</xref>), vasculitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manolova et al., 2001</xref>). Since pulmonary <italic>Pa</italic> infections are common in non-CF bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theprungsirikul et al., 2021b</xref>) and Gram-negative infections are known to be a leading cause of hospitalization in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teh et al., 2018</xref>), scoBPI might be of interest in patient groups other than CF as well. Administration of the recombinant human rBPI23 (amino acids 1–199) and rBPI21 (amino acids 1–193) has previously been tested in clinical phase I–III studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Mohlen et al., 1995</xref>). Thereby, rBPI23 efficiently neutralized the endotoxic activity of LPS in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Mohlen et al., 1995</xref>). Despite the peracute disease course of pediatric meningococcal sepsis and a limited number of patients, rBPI21 was shown to improve clinical outcome by trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levin et al., 2000</xref>). In a less acute setting, such as chronic persisting or exacerbation of <italic>Pa</italic> infections, the use of rBPI21, scoBPI, or the N-terminal barrel of scoBPI might even be more promising. Despite long-term infections in the tested MDR <italic>Pa</italic> and varying sensitivities, complete resistance to BPI was not found. Clearly, further studies should address this issue in a larger cohort. As suggested by our PBMC data, scoBPI potently neutralized the inflammatory potential of <italic>Pa</italic>-derived LPS and consequently prevented LPS-induced release of TNF and IL-6. Chronic pulmonary inflammation arises early in PwCF, leading to tissue destruction, and eventually accounts to respiratory failure and the premature deaths of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantin et al., 2015</xref>). The abundance of neutrophil-derived elastase in the lungs of PwCF is considered as the essential mediator of this persistent local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>) and there is evidence that elastase release is primed by TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taggart et al., 2000</xref>). It is also known that macrophages in PwCF are hyperresponsive to LPS, further driving dysregulated inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the benefits of administration of scoBPI by joining antimicrobial activity and LPS neutralization, including reduction of TNF release, could potentially extenuate inflammation and, thereby, tissue destruction. In future, BPI-ANCA could be purified and concentrated from sera or bronchoalveolar fluid of PwCF to show that these autoantibodies indeed selectively inhibit the bactericidal and LPS-neutralizing activity of huBPI but not scoBPI. Moreover, efficiency of scoBPI should be studied in vivo, for example, in CF and non-CF mouse models. Another interesting issue for further studies is whether LPS modifications commonly found in CF <italic>Pa</italic> isolates alter the interaction with BPI. These modifications include changes of the lipid A moiety by addition of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose or changes in its fatty acid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ernst et al., 1999</xref>), loss of the O-antigen and changes to the core oligosaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knirel et al., 2001</xref>). While LPS binding and the antimicrobial activity of BPI are mediated by the N-terminal barrel of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Little et al., 1994</xref>), the C-terminal barrel is known to enhance phagocytosis by opsonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iovine et al., 1997</xref>). Fittingly, murine <italic>Bpi</italic>-deficient neutrophils display decreased phagocytosis of <italic>Pa</italic> in pulmonary infection models which could be reconstituted by exogenous BPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Theprungsirikul et al., 2021a</xref>). Future in vitro studies will elucidate whether the C-terminal barrel of scoBPI also opsonizes <italic>Pa</italic> for phagocytosis by human cells. Concerning clinical use, one limitation might be a possible induction of antibodies against scoBPI during long-term or repeated applications. Therefore, therapeutic use may rather be indicated in short-term settings. Moreover, the starlet <italic>A. ruthenus</italic> (Actinopterygii, subclass Chondrostei) is only distantly related to the scorpionfish <italic>S. schlegelii</italic> (Actinopterygii, subclass Neopterygii). Congruently, acBPI shows only low sequence identity to scoBPI, thus low epitope overlap. Surprisingly, we found a similar positively charged cluster at the N-terminal tip of both orthologues. Therefore, Actinopterygii BPI other than scoBPI may also bear therapeutic potentials and should be tested functionally.</p><p>Collectively, we define scoBPI as a distantly related, orthologous protein to huBPI that combines LPS-neutralizing capacity and bactericidal activity towards MDR <italic>Pa</italic> isolates. Further investigations on scoBPI and other BPI orthologues are highly encouraged to develop novel therapeutics against Gram-negative MDR infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant BPI orthologues</title><p>Templates for recombinant BPI were designed by flanking the corresponding BPI sequences without native signal peptides (huBPI: amino acids 32–487; muBPI: amino acids 28–483; scoBPI: amino acids 19–473; osBPI: amino acids 20–477) with an N-terminal HA-signal peptide and a C-terminal FLAG-tag.

In detail, bacteria were grown aerobically with shaking (180 rpm) at 37°C in LB-Broth Base medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5 g/l of NaCl until an absorbance of approximately 1.1 at 600 nm was reached. Phenol (90%) was added to reach a final concentration of 1% and the resulting suspension was shaken (90 rpm) for 1 hr at 37°C and then at 4°C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation (9000 × <italic>g</italic>, 20 min, 4°C) and subsequently washed three times with water (centrifugation conditions as above). The lyophilized pellet (recovery, 2.78 g) was washed with ethanol, acetone (twice), and diethyl ether, and then dried. The pellet was resuspended in water (approximately 14 mg/ml), sequentially treated for 24 hr each at RT with DNase/RNase and proteinase K (100 μl of 10 mg/ml solutions per gram dry weight for each enzyme), then underwent dialysis (14 kDa cutoff) and lyophilization (yielding in 610 mg bacterial mass). For hot phenol-water extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westphal and Jann, 1965</xref>), bacteria were resuspended in 45% aqueous phenol (40 ml per g bacteria) and stirred for 30 min at 68°C. After centrifugation (5600 × <italic>g</italic>) for 20 min at 4°C, the upper water phase was collected. The extraction was repeated with the same volume of water as had been collected. Combined water phases and the phenolic phase were dialyzed against water at RT (14 kDa cutoff). Prior to lyophilization, the dialyzed phenolic phase (PP) was centrifuged (600 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 20°C) and divided into supernatant and sediment. The main part of the LPS was recovered from the water phase (184 mg). A portion (20.9 mg) of this LPS preparation was further purified by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 HR (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) on a column (2.5 × 120 cm) using a 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer as eluent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jimenez-Barbero et al., 2002</xref>), yielding 6.8 mg.

For quantification of BPI in human sera, Luminex-beads coupled with anti-BPI antibody 3F9 (Hycult Biotech) were incubated with patient or control sera overnight at 4°C. BPI was detected with biotinylated anti-BPI antibody 4H5 (Cat# HM2042, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_532909">:AB_532909</ext-link>; Hycult Biotech) and Streptavidin-PE (Agilent). Concentrations were quantified with BPI as a standard extracted from neutrophils (Wieslab AB, Malmö, Sweden). For measurement of BPI-ANCA, recombinant BPI orthologues were coupled to beads and the respective coupling efficiency was controlled by incubation of beads with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Cat# F3165, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_259529">:AB_259529</ext-link>; Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min followed by incubation with anti-mouse-PE (#715-065-140, Dianova, Eching, Germany) for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Bacteria were pelletized, the supernatant replaced by cacodylate-buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution (all reagents from EMS, Science Services, Munich, Germany) and the samples were fixed for 12 hr at RT. Alginate (Epredia Cytoblock Replacement Reagents, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to enhance pellet stability for the untreated control. After that, bacteria treated with scoBPI and untreated control were enclosed with 4% low melting agarose. The Lynx microscopy tissue processor (Reichert-Jung, Wetzlar, Germany) was used for the embedding process, including a secondary fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide solution (EMS, Science Services), dehydration and infiltration with EPON-mixture (Embed, DDSA, NMA, DP30). The EPON-infiltrated pellets were transferred in silicon molds and overlaid with fluid EPON-mixture and harden at 60°C in the heating oven. Semithin sections (0,75 µm) were used to define relevant areas and ultrathin sections (80 nm) were then cut by use of the Reichert Ultracut S (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The ultrathin sections were then contrasted with aqueous 2% uranyl-acetate (EMS, Science Services) and 2% lead-citrate solution (Leica Ultrostain II, Leica Microsystems) for 10 min each.

The term “CF patients” was exchanged to “people with CF (PwCF)” throughout the whole manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2B, C – Who are the healthy controls? Are they age/sex-matched to the people with CF?</p></disp-quote><p>Sera of healthy controls were derived from anonymous blood donors. Thus, no data on sex or age was available. We therefore collected a new cohort of healthy controls which are now age- and sex-matched regarding the CF group. PwCF were pseudonymized and had to be de-pseudonymized for determination of age and sex. This made us aware that 7 sera originated from identical patients. Only the first serum was used in these cases (leaving 39 instead of 46 patients). We are sorry for the mistake.</p><p>All samples were (re-)measured in parallel, including samples from PwCF as well as from healthy controls. New data are added in the text and as source data. No difference in serum BPI levels was found between the groups in the age- and sex-matched data set. Yet, p-value for BPI-ANCAs between PwCF and controls remained at p°&lt;°0.0001. Percent of positivity for BPI-ANCAs changed from 54.3% to 51.0%. Cross reactivity towards orthologues was unchanged (muBPI, scoBPI) or was even lower than previously found (2.6% instead of 6.5%, osBPI). In accordance to the new data, respective passages were corrected in the abstract, Figure 2 B, C and E, the legend to Figure 2 as well as the respective text passage.</p><p>“First, we screened the sera of 39 PwCF for presence of BPI and BPI-ANCA. While levels of BPI in sera were comparable among PwCF and an age- and sex-matched control group (Figure 2B), BPI-ANCA as measured in arbitrary units (AU) were significantly increased in PwCF (control: mean 314.8 AU, 95% confidence interval (CI) 209.3 – 420.4 AU; CF: mean 2218.0 AU, 95% CI 1271.0 – 3166.0 AU, p &lt; 0.0001; Figure 2C).“</p><p>“While huBPI was bound by anti-BPI antibodies in 51.0%, muBPI and scoBPI were not recognized at all and osBPI was only detected by 2.6% of the CF sera (Figure 2E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As shown by McQuillan et al.<sup>1</sup>, BPI-ANCA purified from sera of PwCF can inhibit the bactericidal function of huBPI. To perform the requested experiment with BPI-ANCA derived from PwCF, an ethic statement would be necessary and methods for purification have to be established. Therefore, this experiment cannot be done within 2 months as required by the <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines.</p><p>As an alternative we tried to use a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained after vaccination with holo-BPI (Cat# HM2170, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_532911">AB_532911</ext-link>; Hycult Biotech, Uden, Netherlands). Unfortunately, increase of IL-6 and TNF secretion was seen with the antibody alone and in combination with LPS derived from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Both data sets indicate contamination of the antibody with proinflammatory substances. Although diluted, the sodium acid contained in the antibody (0.02%) might also influence the experiment. Therefore, a sodium acid free antibody tested for low endotoxin content would be necessary. To the best of our knowledge such an antibody is not commercially available. Additionally, a rabbit antibody might not reflect the effects of BPI-ANCA derived from PwCF. To our opinion, the use of currently commercially available non-human antibodies does not meet the standards required by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Background activity of a rabbit polyclonal anti-huBPI in PBMCs.</title><p>(A) Levels of IL-6 and TNF in supernatants of PBMCs stimulated for 24 h with a polyclonal anti-huBPI antibody.
