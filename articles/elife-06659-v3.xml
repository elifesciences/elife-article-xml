The mechanistic basis for its action, however, is only poorly understood. Here, we have established a physical assay to determine whether the binding of condensin to native chromosomes in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> involves entrapment of DNA by the Smc–ScpAB ring. To do so, we have chemically cross-linked the three ring interfaces in Smc–ScpAB and thereafter isolated intact chromosomes under protein denaturing conditions. Exclusively species of Smc–ScpA, which were previously cross-linked into covalent rings, remained associated with chromosomal DNA. DNA entrapment is abolished by mutations that interfere with the Smc ATPase cycle and strongly reduced when the recruitment factor ParB is deleted, implying that most Smc–ScpAB is loaded onto the chromosome at <italic>parS</italic> sites near the replication origin. We furthermore report a physical interaction between native Smc–ScpAB and chromosomal DNA fragments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06659.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06659.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genome of any living organism holds all the genetic information that the organism needs to live and grow. This information is written in the sequence of the organism's DNA, and is often divided into sub-structures called chromosomes. Different species have different sized genomes, but even bacteria with some of the smallest genomes still contain DNA molecules that are thousand times longer than the length of their cells. DNA molecules must thus be highly compacted in order to fit inside the cells. DNA compaction is particularly important during cell division, when the DNA is being equally distributed to the newly formed cells.</p><p>In plants, animals and all other eukaryotes, large protein complexes known as condensin and cohesin play a major role in compacting, and then separating, the cell's chromosomes. Many bacteria also have condensin-like complexes. At the core of all these complexes are pairs of so-called SMC proteins. However, it is not clear how these SMC proteins direct chromosomes to become highly compacted when cells are dividing.</p><p>Wilhelm et al. have now developed two new approaches to investigate how SMC proteins associate with bacterial DNA. These approaches were then used to study how SMC proteins coordinate the compaction of chromosomes in a bacterium called <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The experiments revealed that SMC proteins are in direct physical contact with the bacterial chromosome, and that bacterial DNA fibers are physically captured within a ring structure formed by the SMC proteins.</p><p>Wilhelm et al. suggest that these new findings, and recent technological advances, have now set the stage for future studies to gain mechanistic insight into these protein complexes that organize and segregate chromosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06659.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06659.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>Smc proteins</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>chromosome condensation</kwd><kwd>ParB protein</kwd><kwd>sliding clamp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC StG 260853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilhelm</surname><given-names>Larissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Bürmann</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Minnen</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name><name><surname>Toseland</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-034955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Ho-Chul</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Byung-Ha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Smc–ScpAB complex-a prokaryotic ancestor of cohesin, condensin and Smc5/6-loads onto the bacterial chromosome by employing ATP hydrolysis to capture DNA fibers within its tripartite ring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Compaction and individualization of sister DNA molecules is a prerequisite for efficient segregation of the genetic material to daughter cells during cell division. Multi-subunit Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes—such as cohesin and condensin—are major determinants of chromosome structure and dynamics during the cell cycle in eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thadani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruber, 2014</xref>). Condensin subunits were initially identified as abundant, non-histone components of mitotic chromosomes in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>). In mitosis, condensin localizes together with topoisomerase II in punctate structures to the longitudinal core of chromatids, called the chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maeshima and Laemmli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono et al., 2004</xref>). Inactivation of condensin subunits by mutation or depletion results in severe morphological aberrations and mechanical sensitivity of metaphase chromosomes, and subsequently to defects in their segregation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ono et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>). In bacteria, Smc–ScpAB is the prevalent version of SMC protein complexes. Its distant relatives MksBEF and MukBEF can be found scarcely scattered over most of the bacterial phylogenetic tree and in isolated branches of proteobacteria, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, Smc–ScpAB is recruited to a region around the replication origin by ParB/Spo0J protein bound to <italic>parS</italic> sites, thereby forming a discrete focus—also called condensation center—on each nascent copy of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minnen et al., 2011</xref>). Inactivation of Smc–ScpAB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> under nutrient rich growth conditions blocks separation of sister replication origins and consequentially leads to lethal defects in chromosome partitioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Smc–ScpAB thus promotes the initial stages of chromosome segregation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, likely by condensing and individualizing the emerging copies of the chromosome in preparation for their segregation to opposite halves of the cell.</p><p>The canonical SMC complex in bacteria comprises five subunits: (1) two Smc proteins, which each form a 45 nm long antiparallel coiled coil that connects an ABC-type ATPase ‘head’ domain at one end of the coiled coil with a ‘hinge’ homodimerization domain at the other end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirano et al., 2001</xref>), (2) a single ScpA subunit, which belongs to the kleisin family of proteins and associates via its C-terminal winged-helix domain (WHD) with the bottom ‘cap’ surface of one Smc head and via its N-terminal helical domain with the ‘neck’ coiled coil region of the other Smc protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>), and (3) a dimer of ScpB protein, which binds to the central region of ScpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamada et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, the pentameric Smc–ScpAB complex displays a highly extended conformation harboring a central channel, which is surrounded by a closed tripartite ring formed by the Smc dimer and the ScpAB<sub>2</sub> sub-complex. The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Smc coiled coils associate with one another to form rod-shaped Smc dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the Smc head domains can interact directly with one another—via a composite interface that includes two molecules of ATP. Binding to ATP, head engagement and ATP hydrolysis likely control and drive the biochemical action of Smc–ScpAB.</p><p>Models for SMC condensation activity have been proposed based on observations made with isolated SMC dimers, SMC fragments or holo-complexes. Such protein preparations support the bridging of given DNA molecules in vitro as indicated by the re-annealing of single stranded DNA, intermolecular DNA ligation, DNA catenation and the co-purification of labeled and unlabeled DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutani and Yanagida, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losada and Hirano, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2008</xref>). Many SMC complexes bound to different segments of DNA might thus come together and anchor DNA in condensation centers or at the chromosome axis. Oligomeric assemblies of bacterial Smc proteins have indeed been observed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Electron Microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mascarenhas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuentes-Perez et al., 2012</xref>). This model provides a straightforward explanation for the compaction activity of SMC. However, it is unclear how such apparently indiscriminate DNA aggregation would promote rather than block the individualization of sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruber, 2014</xref>). Local wrapping of DNA around the SMC complex could result in well-defined lengthwise condensation of DNA. However, too little SMC protein appears to be present in chromosomes to yield decent levels of compaction by simple wrapping. A different hypothesis is based on the finding that the structurally related cohesin complex holds sister chromatids in eukaryotes together by entrapping sister DNA fibers within its ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, individual SMC complexes might entrap and expand loops of DNA, thereby driving lengthwise condensation of chromosomes with little limitations in the attainable levels of compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alipour and Marko, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate how the prokaryotic SMC–kleisin complex binds to chromosomes in vivo using a novel whole-chromosome assay.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A chromosome entrapment assay</title><p>We initially attempted to detect topological interactions between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Smc–ScpAB and plasmid DNA using pull-down assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov and Nasmyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>). However, several attempts failed to provide clear evidence for entrapment of small circular DNA by prokaryotic condensin. Conceivably, Smc–ScpAB does not interact with these artificial substrates in a physiological manner. To circumvent this possibility, we established an inverse assay by immobilizing whole chromosomes of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in agarose plugs and monitoring their association with covalently closed rings of Smc–ScpA under harsh protein denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To develop the chromosome entrapment assay we first performed experiments with the replicative sliding clamp, DnaN, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which is known to entrap DNA in a topological manner. Furthermore, most of cellular DnaN protein is maintained in the vicinity of active replication forks in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, presumably by its topological association with leading and lagging strand DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su'etsugu and Errington, 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of the chromosome entrapment assay using DnaN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for the chromosome entrapment assay.

For detection a cys-less variant of the HaloTag (‘HT’) was fused to the C-terminus of DnaN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the construct was integrated into the genome of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> via allelic replacement at the endogenous locus. The <italic>dnaN-ht</italic> genes with and without cysteine mutations supported normal growth of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, implying that they encoded functional DnaN proteins (data not shown). In vivo cross-linking of DnaN-HT resulted in two additional, slow migrating bands in SDS-PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), corresponding to single and double cross-linked species of DnaN dimers, designated as X-DnaN-HT and XX-DnaN-HT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next embedded cells in agarose plugs and disrupted their cell walls by lysozyme digestion. Agarose plugs were then subjected to an electric field in the presence of SDS to denature and remove any unattached proteins from chromosomes. Plugs were finally treated with benzonase to digest genomic DNA and to release any stably entrapped protein. DnaN-HT protein was then analysed by in-gel fluorescence. Non-crosslinkable DnaN-HT was efficiently depleted from agarose plugs during the entrapment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the double cross-linked, circular form of DnaN(N114C, V313C)-HT (XX-DnaN-HT) was retained in the agarose plug during electrophoresis with high efficiency (∼50% of input). A minor fraction of single cross-linked DnaN dimer (X-DnaN-HT) was also observed. This is likely generated from XX-DnaN-HT by spontaneous hydrolysis of thiol-malemide adducts during protein isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalia and Raines, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin and Kiick, 2013</xref>). Importantly, the presence of benzonase during cell lysis eliminated all DnaN from the plug, indicating that circular DnaN is retained in plugs via its interaction with cellular DNA. Furthermore, in the absence of the cross-linker BMOE, no DnaN-HT was detected in the eluate fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The chromosome entrapment assay thus specifically detects a topological association of intact chromosomes with DNA sliding clamps and confirms that a major fraction (at least 50%) of DnaN is loaded onto DNA in rapidly growing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prokaryotic condensin entraps chromosomal DNA</title><p>Next, we used the newly developed chromosome entrapment assay to test for an association between native chromosomes and Smc–ScpAB complexes.

These correspond to fully cross-linked Smc–ScpA–Smc rings and several intermediate cross-linking species as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>). To reveal the identity of all species, strains lacking one of six engineered cysteines were used as controls that collectively form several intermediate cross-linked species but no fully cross-linked rings of Smc–ScpAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In these control samples little or no Smc-HT protein was retained in agarose plugs under denaturing conditions as expected for any non-circular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the presence of all pairs of cysteine, however, a set of two closely migrating species was consistently detected at significant levels after the chromosome entrapment assay (∼10–20% of input material) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We argued that the two closely migrating species might correspond to Smc–ScpAB with a single or a double cross-link at the Smc hinge. Consistent with this notion we find that only a single species of Smc<sub>2</sub>–ScpA accumulated during the chromosome entrapment assay when a single cysteine residue (R643C) was used to cross-link the Smc hinge domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that Smc–ScpAB is bound to chromosomes via entrapment of chromosomal DNA. If this were indeed the case, then its retention in agarose plugs should depend on the integrity of Smc–ScpAB rings and of chromosomal DNA. Incubation of agarose plugs with the nuclease benzonase during cell lysis eliminated the Smc-HT and DnaN signal in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To disrupt covalent Smc–ScpAB rings, we inserted cleavage sites for TEV protease into the linker region preceding the C-terminal WHD of ScpA and incubated cells during lysozyme treatment with recombinant TEV protease to open any circular Smc<sub>2</sub>–ScpA species. As expected, little or no Smc-HT signal was detected in agarose plugs after TEV cleavage of ScpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To exclude any artefacts due to the presence of the HT on Smc we have repeated the chromosome entrapment assay with an untagged allele of Smc using immunoblotting with anti-Smc antibodies for the detection of cross-linked species, which yielded very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Smc<sub>2</sub>-ScpA rings are stably trapped in agarose plugs over extended periods of time in constant or alternating electric fields (data not shown). Thus, our chromosome entrapment assay specifically detects the association between intact chromosomal DNA and rings of Smc–ScpAB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, demonstrating that DNA fibers pass through the Smc ring.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prokaryotic condensin entraps the chromosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for the cross-linking of Smc-HaloTag (‘HT’) and ScpA into a covalent Smc–ScpA–Smc ring.

The intrinsic ATPase activity of cohesin has previously been implicated in stable association with chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weitzer et al., 2003</xref>). More specifically, ATP hydrolysis has been hypothesized to transiently open an entry gate for DNA in the cohesin ring during its loading onto chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). To test what steps of the ATP hydrolysis cycle in Smc–ScpAB are involved in the entrapment of chromosomal DNA, we made use of <italic>smc</italic> alleles harboring mutations that specifically prevent ATP binding (K37I), engagement of Smc head domains (S1090R) or ATP hydrolysis (E1118Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano and Hirano, 2004</xref>). The three mutant proteins are expressed at normal levels in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> being indicative of proper protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, they do not support growth on nutrient rich medium similar to <italic>smc</italic> null mutants, implying that all steps of the ATPase cycle are essential for Smc functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2014</xref>). For the chromosome entrapment assay, these Smc ATPase mutations were combined with cysteine mutations for BMOE cross-linking. To support their viability, the resulting strains as well as the wild-type controls were grown in minimal medium. The three mutant Smc proteins assembled into normal Smc–ScpAB complexes as judged by Smc–ScpA cross-linking, albeit there is a slight decrease in the fraction of ScpA proteins bridging Smc dimers and a concomitant minor increase in ScpA subunits bound to single Smc proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, species ‘e’ and ‘d’, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, the ATP binding and engagement mutants abolished the fraction of covalent ring species retained in the agarose plug during the chromosome entrapment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In case of the ATP hydrolysis mutant Smc(E1118Q) only minute amounts of cross-linked rings were recovered from SDS treated plugs. This small fraction of stably bound condensin conceivably arises as a consequence of residual levels of ATP hydrolysis activity in Smc(E1118Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano and Hirano, 2004</xref>). Thus, ATP binding and ATP dependent Smc head engagement—and most probably also ATP hydrolysis—are essential for entrapment of chromosomal DNA by condensin in bacteria, as has been supposed for cohesin in yeast. Furthermore, the strict requirement of several steps of the ATPase cycle strongly suggests that entrapment of DNA corresponds to the physiological form of association with the bacterial chromosome.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Smc ATPase is required for loading of DNA into Smc–ScpAB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme for the ATP hydrolysis cycle of Smc.

Alternatively, ParB bound to <italic>parS</italic> sites might be more directly involved in the loading reaction itself, for example, as catalytic factor, and its absence might thus affect levels of chromosomal condensin. To test this, we performed the chromosome entrapment assay with cells lacking the <italic>parB</italic> gene. Intriguingly, the levels of Smc–ScpAB entrapping chromosomal DNA were strongly reduced in the <italic>parB</italic> null mutant as judged by the limited retention of Smc–ScpA species in agarose plugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, ParB protein likely promotes the entrapment of chromosomal DNA by Smc–ScpAB. This strongly suggests that most condensin is loaded onto the chromosome at <italic>parS</italic> sites, where ParB protein is bound. In all other parts of the chromosome entrapment of DNA fibers by Smc–ScpAB might be very inefficient. The cysteine bearing <italic>smc</italic> allele causes growth defects when combined with <italic>ΔparB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the decreased loading of Smc observed in <italic>ΔparB</italic> are due to the cysteine modifications in Smc and that chromosomal loading of wild-type Smc is not or much less affected by <italic>parB</italic> deletion.</p><p>Previously, two <italic>parB</italic> point mutations (N112S and R149G), which prevent the formation of Smc-GFP foci, have been isolated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>). We found that these mutations strongly impair loading of Smc onto the chromosome in the entrapment assay similar to <italic>ΔparB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The R149G mutation is positioned on the helix-turn-helix motif of ParB and might thus directly affect binding to <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>). The N112S mutation, however, is located in another highly conserved region, which has been implicated in the ‘spreading’ of ParB protein from <italic>parS</italic> sequences into adjacent DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). The spreading of ParB along several kb of DNA is a feature conserved in plasmid and chromosome derived ParB proteins, however, the underlying mechanism is only poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>). It might possibly involve the formation of a large nucleoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>). Several other mutants of ParB (including <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB G77S and R80A) have been reported to be defective in spreading from <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, also these mutations resulted in largely reduced levels of Smc on the chromosome in our entrapment assay, being comparable to the levels found in a <italic>parB</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This implies that ParB spreading from <italic>parS</italic> sites or formation of large nucleoprotein complexes might be essential for loading of DNA into the Smc ring by ParB. These findings are consistent with the observation that formation of Smc-GFP foci near the origin of replication are affected by the G77S mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). In summary, these results demonstrate that several factors—including ScpB protein, a ParB/<italic>parS</italic> nucleoprotein complex and the Smc ATPase cycle—are required to promote efficient loading of condensin rings onto the chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Smc–ScpAB rings physically associate with chromosomal DNA fragments</title><p>Smc proteins and fragments thereof exhibit affinity for single- and double-stranded DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirano and Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). The physical contacts with DNA might occur once condensin has been successfully loaded onto chromosomes and thus be a permanent feature of chromosomal Smc–ScpAB. Alternatively, the direct association with DNA might be restricted to certain intermediates in the chromosomal loading reaction. To test for interactions between Smc–ScpAB and specific chromosomal DNA fragments, we have affinity-purified endogenous Smc–ScpAB from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell lysates using a short Avitag peptide fused to the C-terminus of the Smc protein, which gets biotinylated when the biotin ligase gene <italic>birA</italic> is co-expressed (‘Smc-Avitag’). We then examined fractions for the co-purification of fragments of chromosomal DNA—generated by restriction digest with XbaI—using quantitative PCR with primer pairs specific for different parts of the chromosome. Since we worried that Smc–ScpAB might not be sufficiently stable in diluted cell extracts, we cross-linked the three ring interfaces in Smc–ScpAB using BMOE cross-linking of engineered pairs of cysteines. A small fraction of chromosomal DNA was reproducibly co-purified with wild-type Smc-Avitag, whereas the yield of co-purified DNA was significantly improved by the presence of cross-linkable cysteine residues in Smc–ScpAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In both cases origin-proximal regions (<italic>yyaD</italic>, <italic>parS-359</italic>, <italic>dnaA</italic> and <italic>dnaN</italic>) of the chromosome were more efficiently enriched than distal regions (<italic>amyE</italic>, <italic>trnS</italic> and <italic>ter</italic>) by the co-purification with Smc implying that the observed Smc-DNA contacts are dependent on chromosomal loading of Smc–ScpAB by ParB protein at <italic>parS</italic> sites and are thus physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>). The association of DNA with wild-type and BMOE cross-linked Smc–ScpAB was highly sensitive to washes with a salt solution (2M NaCl), suggesting that it was dependent on electrostatic contacts between DNA and protein. These DNA contacts are presumably formed by the Smc–ScpAB complex itself. Alternatively, albeit less likely, other chromosomal proteins physically bound to DNA could prevent the release of condensin from DNA by blocking its sliding towards DNA ends.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A physical interaction of Smc–ScpAB rings and chromosomal DNA.</title><p>Co-purification of chromosomal DNA fragments with native Smc–ScpAB.

Beads were washed in the presence of either a 150 mM ammonium acetate buffer (‘low salt’) or a 2 M sodium chloride buffer (‘high salt’). The co-purification of DNA fragments with Smc-biotin on streptavidin beads was measured by quantitative PCR using primer pairs specific for genomic positions indicated on a representation of the circular <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome.

Here, we report the establishment of a straight-forward method to determine the physical association of ring-shaped protein complexes with whole bacterial chromosomes. Two examples, the SMC condensin complex and the sliding clamp DnaN, document the significant potential of our simple entrapment approach. In principle, similar assays should also be possible with eukaryotic cells and for many other chromosomal proteins such as for example hexameric helicases and certain transcription factors. Furthermore, analogous procedures might be useful to address biological questions related to other denaturation-resistant cellular structures such as cell wall polymers (e.g., made up of peptidoglycan, chitin or cellulose).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DNA entrapment by an ancestral SMC–kleisin complex</title><p>SMC–kleisin complexes are major governors of chromosome superstructure in most branches of the phylogenetic tree. The eukaryotic variants cohesin and condensin have been suggested to work as concatenases, which hold selected stretches of DNA together by simple embracement in their ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haering et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>). Whether DNA entrapment is an ancestral and thus fundamentally conserved function of SMC–kleisin complexes, however, remained elusive so far. Furthermore, interaction studies developed for cohesin and condensin are based on small, artificial DNA substrates and might thus not necessarily reflect the mode of binding to native chromosomes. These assays also fall short of providing an estimate for the fraction of SMC complexes involved in interlocked associations with DNA and thus leave open the possibility that DNA entrapment might be an insignificant side reaction. Finally, it has not been tested under physiological conditions, whether the ATPase cycle is required for proper loading of DNA into any SMC–kleisin complex. To provide answers to these questions, we have established the chromosome entrapment assay to determine the association of prokaryotic condensin with native chromosomes. Our results clearly demonstrate that chromosomal DNA is loaded into condensin complexes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>—in a manner that depends on the non-SMC subunit ScpB and at least one full cycle of Smc ATPase activity. The chromosome entrapment assay recovers about 10–20% of the fully cross-linked input material. This number probably understates the real proportion of chromosomally entrapped Smc complexes due to the loss of material during protein re-isolation from agarose plugs, due to possible adverse effects of cysteine mutations on Smc–ScpAB loading and because cysteine-maleimide linkages are vulnerable to hydrolytic reversal during and after the entrapment assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalia and Raines, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin and Kiick, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a recent single-molecule tracking study in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> revealed two major populations of Smc: 80% of Smc-YFP proteins are displaying highly dynamic behavior on the nucleoid, whereas the other 20% (and most ScpA-YFP protein) are immobile and constrained within a small volume of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleine Borgmann et al., 2013</xref>). This immobile fraction possibly represents Smc–ScpAB complexes embracing origin proximal DNA after loading at <italic>parS</italic> sites as observed in the entrapment assay.</p><p>Our results show that embracement of chromosomal DNA is a predominant feature of Smc–ScpAB, which has been evolutionarily retained in cohesin and likely all other SMC–kleisin complexes as well. Since the chromosome entrapment assay is based on the immobilization of intact replicating chromosomes, which possibly represent internally knotted and branched DNA structures, it is conceivable that Smc–ScpAB rings are linked to chromosomal DNA by non-topological capture of DNA loops, which themselves might be interlinked (i.e., knotted) with other parts of the chromosome. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether DNA entrapment by Smc–ScpAB is of topological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and/or non-topological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) nature.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06659.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models for entrapment of chromosomal DNA by Smc–ScpAB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Loop capture model.

(<bold>B</bold>) Loop formation model. ParB/<italic>parS</italic> might serve as a landing platform for Smc–ScpAB allowing Smc–ScpAB in its ring-like conformation to guide DNA into its central cavity.

It is tempting to speculate that ParB/<italic>parS</italic> not only enriches Smc in the vicinity of the replication origin but also sets up lengthwise compaction of chromosomes by presenting DNA of a certain topology to the Smc–ScpAB complex. Consistent with this notion, we found that several <italic>parB</italic> mutants, which are defective in the ability to form large nucleoprotein complexes and to spread from <italic>parS</italic> sites, fail to promote loading of Smc–ScpAB onto the chromosome. Thus, Smc–ScpAB might capture, stabilize and expand structures–such as DNA loops or coils–that are pre-formed within larger ParB/<italic>parS</italic> nucleoprotein assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Alternatively, ParB/<italic>parS</italic> might serve as an elaborate landing platform on the chromosome, where Smc–ScpAB initiates with the help of ParB the lengthwise compaction of chromosomes by forming and extruding loops of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Extrusion of DNA might involve the translocation of Smc–ScpAB along DNA fibers made up of naked or ParB coated DNA. These models are not mutually exclusive. A reasonable first step towards understanding the architecture of Smc/ParB/<italic>parS</italic> assemblies might be the investigation of physical interactions between ParB/<italic>parS</italic> and Smc–ScpAB and their functional interconnection with the Smc ATPase cycle. In the future, Smc/ParB/<italic>parS</italic> structures could serve as a relatively simple paradigm for chromosome organization by the more intricately regulated cohesin and condensin complexes in eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The role of ScpB and ATP hydrolysis in Smc–ScpAB loading</title><p>ParB serves a supplemental—albeit important—role in the Smc loading process. In contrast, Smc functionality and its loading onto DNA in vivo is critically dependent on the ScpB subunit and the ATPase cycle. It remains unclear though what the exact role of ScpB and ATP hydrolysis in the entrapment of DNA might be. If loading indeed depends on transient opening of a DNA entry gate, the open state would likely represent an energetically unfavorable reaction intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Timely opening would require energy input as well as tight regulation. We have recently demonstrated that the ATP dependent engagement of Smc head domains—together with DNA binding to the Smc hinge domain—can transform the configuration of the Smc coiled coil from a rod to a more open ring-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). Hydrolysis of ATP and/or ScpB binding could drive a subsequent conformational change that might open the SMC–kleisin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Alternatively, ScpB and/or ATP hydrolysis might stabilize Smc–ScpAB once loaded onto DNA or promote Smc's sliding along DNA to allow efficient extrusion of DNA loops by the Smc–ScpAB ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>How do so few Smcs organize so much DNA?</title><p>Deletion or mutation of the <italic>parB</italic> gene results in a clear drop in the levels of chromosomally bound condensin (∼5–10 fold less) in our chromosome entrapment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In addition to this loading defect, also the specific recruitment of Smc–ScpAB towards the replication origin is lost in the absence of ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, in <italic>parB</italic> mutants only a very small proportion of cellular Smc–ScpAB is bound to chromosomes within the replication origin region, where it presumably performs its essential function by promoting the separation of nascent sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, defects in chromosome segregation are rather mild in <italic>parB</italic> mutants when compared to mutants of <italic>smc</italic>. Using quantitative blotting of Smc protein and replication origin DNA from cell extracts, we have estimated the average number of Smc protein to be around 30 dimers per replication origin in a fast growing population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Assuming that all Smc complexes entrap chromosomal DNA in wild-type cells, only three to six Smc dimers (10–20% of total) are loaded onto the chromosome in <italic>parB</italic> mutants according to our measurements. Thus, a handful of Smc–ScpAB complexes, which are presumably randomly distributed over the chromosome, appears to be capable of supporting near-normal chromosome segregation under these conditions—when chromosome segregation is already compromised by the loss of the <italic>parABS</italic> system. Few Smc–ScpAB therefore seem to be able to provide enough organization to the replication origin region and the remainder of the chromosome to prevent lethal accumulation of inter-linked sister chromosomes. It is conceivable that individual Smc–ScpAB complexes are able to organize large chunks of a bacterial chromosome, possible by forming giant loops of DNA. Alternatively, Smc activity might be needed only at a limited number of defined locations on the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome and/or for very short periods of time. However, when levels of functional Smc dimers are in addition reduced for example by hypomorphic mutations in the <italic>smc</italic> gene itself, the loss of ParB protein becomes lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>).</p><p>This work reveals the mode of association of Smc–ScpAB with bacterial chromosomes, highlights its striking evolutionary conservation and demonstrates the involvement of the SMC ATPase cycle in chromosomal loading.

An extinction coefficient (51,230 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 280 nm) for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Smc protein was obtained using the ProtParam tool at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org">www.expasy.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Spike-in PCR product and Southern probe</title><p>The spike-in DNA was generated by PCR using wild-type genomic DNA preparation as template DNA and forward (‘STG246’: cttgcgatttttgcttctcc; complementary to the <italic>yyaD</italic> locus) and reverse primers (‘STH602’: ttatcgtgcgaaagcagttg; complementary to the <italic>gidA</italic> locus) producing a DNA fragment of 7238 bp in size covering the <italic>parS-359</italic> site within the <italic>parB</italic> gene. The PCR product was purified using a PCR-purification kit (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Germany) and its concentration was measured by absorption at 260 nm on a Nanodrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) photometer. The molecular weight was calculated based on the base composition of the DNA. For generation of the <italic>parS-359</italic>-specific Southern probe a PCR with primers annealing within and downstream of the <italic>parB</italic> locus (‘STG301’: acatgagaattcgttttttcatttatgattctcgttcagacaaaagctc and ‘STK534’: gcaatctgcagcatggcattcttcag) was performed on a wild-type genomic DNA preparation generating a 714 bp long PCR product.

Samples were incubated with a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml RNAse A for 10 min at 37°C. Then each sample was sonicated very gently (4× 0.1 s pulses at lowest power setting, Bandelin ‘Sonoplus’, Germany) to solubilize chromosome fragments. Cell lysates of BSG1001 and BSG2058 were mixed and purified PCR product was spiked in as given in the figure. 200 µl of ‘Protein Precipitation Solution’ (Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit, Promega) was added to each sample followed by a 10 s vortexing step and 5 min incubation on ice.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper from Gruber and colleagues presents outstanding experimental work that adds significantly to our mechanistic understanding of SMC biology. The work validates and characterizes a potentially broadly applicable assay to demonstrate topological association of protein complexes with DNA. The replisome-associated sliding clamp is used as a proof of principle and then the authors go on to show topological loading of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SMC complex onto DNA, and to demonstrate the requirements for ATP binding and hydrolysis on loading; the requirements for the accessory proteins ScpA and B and the requirement for ParB. Then the authors go on to develop an in vitro loading assay and then finally they show association of SMC complex with the ori region of the chromosome. Altogether, this is an important, impressive and extensive piece of work.</p><p>Specific comments requiring revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit, especially for the broad <italic>eLife</italic> audience, from some speculation (even brief and tentative) about how topological entrapment might result in lengthwise condensation. Do the authors imagine that entrapment at ParB/parS transitions into loops? And if so, how? Similarly, does entrapment at <italic>parB</italic>/<italic>parS</italic> lead to diffusion via bead on a string followed by a transition into loops? Some discussion about possible models would strengthen the paper.</p><p>2) The Cys mutations in SMC and ScpA are not fully functional because they are synthetic lethal with <italic>∆parB</italic> in rich medium. This complicates the <italic>∆parB</italic> data a bit. It might be worth mentioning this.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> legend could be re-written for clarity. “During step 2” is vague here.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, the legend says anti-ParB antiserum. This should be anti-SMC.</p><p>I believe this figure is trying to say: “All proteins used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> behave similarly in a standard ChIP experiment.” If yes, it would be helpful to state that explicitly.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is referred to before <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Do the authors imagine that entrapment at ParB/parS transitions into loops? And if so, how? Similarly, does entrapment at</italic> parB/parS <italic>lead to diffusion via bead on a string followed by a transition into loops? Some discussion about possible models would strengthen the paper</italic>.</p><p>To address these important points we have now included an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in the manuscript, which depicts two models for organization/lengthwise-condensation of chromosomes by Smc-ScpAB and <italic>parB/parS</italic>. In addition, we have added an extra paragraph in the Discussion called “How might entrapment of DNA at ParB/<italic>parS</italic> nucleoprotein complexes promote sister DNA segregation?” to elaborate and speculate on these models.</p><p><italic>2) The Cys mutations in SMC and ScpA are not fully functional because they are synthetic lethal with</italic> ∆parB <italic>in rich medium.

I guess this is pure recombinant nuclease that should be protease free-but it would be desirable to be assured that this is the case</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this potential issue. The benzonase preparation is indeed purchased from a commercial provider (Sigma Aldrich) and should thus be largely free of proteases. To document that this is really the case we have now included two pieces of data in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>We have earlier noticed that flagellin is co-isolated during the chromosome entrapment assay, presumable due to its resistance to denaturation by SDS. Importantly, flagellin isolation is not affected by the addition of benzonase during cell lysis, as expected for an extracellular protein. This demonstrates that flagellin is not degraded by potential protease contaminations in the benzonase solution. We have included an extra sub-panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to show normal flagellin isolation in a sample where entrapment of dnaN is lost due to benzonase treatment.</p><p>Independently, we have tested the effect of prolonged incubation of our protein extracts in the presence of benzonase. Coomassie staining and in-gel fluorescence analysis showed that the levels and migration pattern of Smc-HT species or proteins in general are not affected by excessive benzonase treatment (90 min). Please note that we have not done this experiment in the complete absence of benzonase as such protein extracts are only poorly resolved on our SDS-PAGE gels.</p><p><italic>9)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>: In panel A, why are bands 'fgh' not clear and not labeled?</italic></p><p>We have now labelled all visible bands in the gel image.
