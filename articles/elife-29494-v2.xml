The endothelial response to flow and its interactions with recruited platelets and leukocytes determine disease progression. Here, we report widespread changes in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in the flow-activated murine arterial endothelium in vivo. Alternative splicing was suppressed by depletion of platelets and macrophages recruited to the arterial endothelium under low and disturbed flow. Binding motifs for the Rbfox-family are enriched adjacent to many of the regulated exons. Endothelial deletion of <italic>Rbfox2</italic>, the only family member expressed in arterial endothelium, suppresses a subset of the changes in transcription and RNA splicing induced by low flow. Our data reveal an alternative splicing program activated by Rbfox2 in the endothelium on recruitment of platelets and macrophages and demonstrate its relevance in transcriptional responses during flow-driven vascular inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>endothelial</kwd><kwd>vascular</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>artery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-HL110484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA14051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butty</surname><given-names>Vincent L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hynes</surname><given-names>Richard O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00-HL125727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1-HL66105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM034277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharp</surname><given-names>Phillip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptome analysis reveals an alternative splicing program induced in the arterial endothelium under low-flow inflammatory conditions by platelet and macrophage recruitment and dependent upon the RNA-binding splice factor Rbfox2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposure of arterial endothelium to low and disturbed flow initiates a process of endothelial activation, resulting in increased expression of adhesion molecules and the rolling, adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gimbrone and García-Cardeña, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). The level of shear stress to which endothelium is exposed is one of the best predictors of atherosclerosis and growth and rupture of aneurysms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boussel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cicha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xiang et al., 2011</xref>). Experiments with isolated endothelial cells exposed to altered flow in vitro revealed that increased laminar flow alone was sufficient to suppress endothelial apoptosis and expression of endothelial leukocyte recruitment molecules such as Icam1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagel et al., 1994</xref>). Subsequent work revealed transcriptional programs induced by steady flow and suppressed by low and disturbed flow in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2004</xref>). Many of these programs could be recapitulated by Erk5 activation and increased expression of the transcription factor Klf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parmar et al., 2006</xref>). Interfering with these programs increased markers of endothelial dysfunction and disease progression in atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parmar et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, exposure of arterial endothelium to low flow initiates a program of endothelial dysfunction characterized by transcriptional changes and alterations in the expression of leukocyte recruitment molecules.</p><p>Most work to date has focused on the primary endothelial response to low flow, rather than the chronic interactions with immune cells under low flow in vivo. However, chronic inflammation contributes to a wide variety of dangerous cardiovascular lesions, including the erosion and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and aneurysms. Not surprisingly, inflammation is a clinical target in atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ridker et al., 2012</xref>) and aortic aneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). The adaptive immune response is also being targeted, with good efficacy in pre-clinical models of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>). Historical perspectives on inflammation have typically focused on the leukocytes recruited in large numbers from the blood to the tissues, however, the endothelial lining of arterial vessels plays a critical role as a regulator of multiple steps in the cascade, including effects on immune cell recruitment, trafficking into tissues, and local activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carman and Martinelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galkina and Ley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). The endothelium, as the interface between recruited immune cells and tissues, and as a local regulator of the inflammatory process, is an attractive target for the regulation of local inflammation, potentially avoiding complications of systemic immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>Recently, we discovered that, in a chronic in vivo model of low flow, changes in alternative splicing of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) prevented hemorrhagic rupture of the intima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy and Hynes, 2014</xref>). Through alternative splicing, a single pre-mRNA produced from a transcribed gene can be spliced in different ways to generate multiple, sometimes hundreds, of various isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Burge, 2008</xref>). These new isoforms often lend completely novel interactions to proteins, resulting in interaction profiles often as divergent from the ‘canonical’ isoform as from other unrelated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the splicing changes we observed in <italic>Fn</italic>, resulting in the incorporation of alternative exons <italic>EIIIA</italic> and <italic>EIIIB</italic>, could be blocked by the depletion of macrophages, which are recruited to the arterial endothelium under low flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy and Hynes, 2014</xref>). Our results suggested that regulation of alternative splicing might play an important role in the endothelial interaction with recruited immune cells and regulation of chronic arterial inflammation.</p><p>Here, we test the possibility that alternative splicing is broadly regulated in the arterial endothelium by low and disturbed flow, and hypothesize that alternative splicing events co-regulated with alternatively spliced <italic>Fn</italic> exons <italic>EIIIA</italic> and <italic>EIIIB</italic> may be important in coordinating the response of the arterial endothelium to low flow.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low flow induces a program of alternative splicing in the arterial intima</title><p>To determine the extent of alternative splicing changes in the arterial intima under low-flow conditions, we prepared pools of intimal RNA from the carotid arteries of mice exposed to low flow for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Control pools of RNA were prepared from mice subjected to a sham operation, or from the contralateral arteries of ligated mice, which were exposed to high flow. We detected 4766 differentially expressed genes between the low-flow carotid and the contralateral high-flow carotid (Padj &lt;0.05 by DEseq2, N = 3 per group), which overlapped and extended previous experiments in this system and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed excellent correlation in Log2 fold-change between biological replicates (Pearson correlation of 0.82 for all genes, and 0.98 for genes found to be significantly regulated by low flow). Low flow, rather than high flow in the contralateral artery, was responsible for the majority of changes in mRNA levels, relative to the normal-flow, sham-operated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The flow-responsive signature included reduction in expression of the canonical flow-responsive genes <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> and we also detected an increase in signal from innate immune cells (<italic>CD45</italic>, <italic>F4/80</italic>, <italic>CD11b</italic>, <italic>Cxcr2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that such cells are recruited as early as 48 hr after the change in flow. However, transcripts from recruited or other contaminating cells represented a small portion of the total signal. This was assessed by the amount of <italic>eGFP</italic> (endothelial) mRNA copies versus <italic>tdTomato</italic> (all other cells) in <italic>Cdh5(PAC)Cre-ERT2; mT/mG</italic> mice, in which <italic>eGFP</italic> or <italic>tdTomato</italic> are driven from the same constitutive actin promoter in a cell-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We assessed levels of alternative exon inclusion, expressed as ‘percentage spliced in’ (Psi), in each condition and their differences using the MISO Bayesian statistical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katz et al., 2010</xref>). We examined annotated events as well as novel events (see Materials and methods). Setting a threshold of significance at Bayes factor five in two biologically independent comparisons of low flow to high flow, we identified 768 regulated splicing events between known exons (skipped or mutually exclusive exons, retained introns, or alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites) and over a thousand regulated changes to the last exon or 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As with the transcript level changes, the vast majority of the splicing changes were induced by low flow, rather than high flow, in comparison with sham-operated vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Approximately, 90% of the splicing changes observed in vivo were recapitulated (at least 50% in the same direction) in purified endothelial cells in vitro, supporting the endothelial regulation of these splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). It is not clear whether the 10% of events not similarly regulated in vitro reflect differences in the in vitro system or transcript variants from the ~1.5% contaminating mRNA.</p><p>Because the mechanisms of regulation of skipped exons are best understood, and because we are interested in alternative splicing events similar to the skipped exons in <italic>Fn</italic>, we focused on this subclass of alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy and Hynes, 2014</xref>). Changes in skipped exons were consistent between completely independent biological sets, and not obviously correlated with increased or decreased abundance in the transcriptional levels of these genes between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, each point indicates a regulated splicing event, colored points indicate events in genes with altered transcript levels). The majority of the skipped exons were as strongly conserved evolutionarily as constitutive exons in placental mammals, and much more so than introns (data not shown). Genes with regulated skipped exons had annotated functions in several categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, altered flow results in changes in RNA splicing of exons coincident with, but independent of, transcriptional changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Platelets are required for regulation of a subset of flow-regulated skipped exons</title><p>We previously observed that monocyte recruitment was required for increased inclusion of <italic>Fn-EIIIA</italic> and <italic>EIIIB</italic> exons after 48 hr of low flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy and Hynes, 2014</xref>).

Co-culture with monocyte-derived macrophages, at similar stoichiometric ratios with the endothelial cells to those observed in vivo in low-flow arteries, did not further increase EIIIA inclusion. However, both platelets and plasma independently induced increased EIIIA inclusion, and exerted combinatorial effects, resulting in inclusion levels approximately 6-fold higher than in vivo levels when all three were added [<italic>EIIIA</italic> (from 15% to 80%) and <italic>EIIIB</italic> (from 11% to 60%)]. A broader examination of splicing changes, by RNA-seq, revealed that half (40 of 80) of the splicing events regulated by platelets in vivo were similarly regulated by a combination of platelets, macrophages and plasma in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B2</xref>). For this set of events, the addition of plasma, macrophages and platelets to cultured endothelial cells induced a low-flow-like change in splicing but the individual components - platelets, macrophages or plasma proteins - were unable to entirely recapitulate the potent effects of their combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B3</xref>). Thus, platelets alone were insufficient to induce low-flow regulated skipped exons, despite static in vitro conditions, and required both macrophages and plasma for maximal effect.</p><p>Together our results suggest that recruitment of both platelets and macrophages to the arterial endothelium is required for the flow-responsive splicing pattern in a large set of genes, including the <italic>Fn-EIIIA</italic> and <italic>EIIIB</italic> exons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Binding motif for the splicing factor Rbfox2 is enriched in regulated vascular splicing events</title><p>We were particularly interested in the set of skipped exons induced in the endothelium in a platelet and macrophage-dependent manner, along with <italic>Fn-EIIIA</italic> and <italic>–EIIIB</italic>, and asked whether there might be a common upstream regulatory factor.

Profiling global transcriptional changes induced in the arterial endothelium by experimentally induced low flow, we show that hundreds of transcripts are regulated by alternative splicing. Focusing on skipped exons in particular, we find that one third of those affected by altered flow are dependent on recruited hematopoietic cells in vivo, particularly platelets. Rbfox-binding motifs are significantly enriched adjacent to these exons. Mechanistically, deletion of endothelial <italic>Rbfox2</italic> reverts many of the flow-induced changes in splicing and suppresses ~10% of the flow-induced changes in transcription.

Our work reveals widespread changes in alternative splicing affecting a number of genes known to be critical in the pathways already implicated in the response to altered flow, inflammation, remodeling and flow-driven vascular disease. Examples include <italic>Pecam1</italic>, a component of the shear-sensing mechanism in the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tzima et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Yap1</italic>, a regulator of mechanical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Ikbkg (Nemo),</italic> a regulator of NFkappa-B signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 1999</xref>). In previous work, differential splicing of <italic>Vcam1</italic> was detected in IL-1-stimulated HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cybulsky et al., 1991</xref>) and of <italic>Fn</italic> in TGFβ-induced liver sinusoidal endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2004</xref>). Exon arrays have also shown differential exon usage in HUVECs in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weigand et al., 2012</xref>). However, this hypoxic response appears to be very different from the responses we have observed, and less then 2% of the genes in which we detected alternative splicing overlap with those found in the hypoxic signature of HUVECs. It is possible that this is due to methods used (exon arrays versus our sequencing approach), cell type (HUVECs versus murine aortic endothelial cells), or pathway-specific responses. The latter is likely, since we observed no consistent regulation of hypoxia-induced genes (e.g. <italic>Vegfa</italic>) in the flow-responsive signature. Alternative splicing responses are distinct, similar to transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, even within the alternative-splicing response to altered flow, we are able to detect a distinct response dependent on the recruitment of circulating hematopoietic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Biological consequences of alternative splicing programs induced by low flow</title><p>We do not yet know the function of most of the splicing changes we have observed. Unlike mice deficient in both <italic>EIIIA</italic> and <italic>EIIIB</italic>, which exhibit an increased risk of arterial rupture under low flow, <italic>Rbfox2 EC-KO</italic> mice do not. This may be due to the lesser effect of <italic>Rbfox2</italic> deletion on <italic>EIIIA</italic> than <italic>EIIIB</italic> in the <italic>Rbfox2</italic> mutant mice (<italic>EIIIA</italic> inclusion was 50% in <italic>Rbfox2 EC-KO</italic> low-flow artery, versus 60% in WT low-flow artery, compared with 20% in high flow artery; while <italic>EIIIB</italic> inclusion was absent in all <italic>Rbfox2 EC-KO</italic> conditions).

First, the alternatively spliced exons comprising this response, including <italic>Fn-EIIIA</italic> and <italic>-EIIIB</italic>, are highly conserved among all placental mammals. In fact ~80% of the flow-regulated skipped exons are as well conserved as consensus coding exons (CCDS). Conservation of sequence is not necessarily the same as conservation of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeo et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the conservation of regulatory regions, specifically the Rbfox2 motif, surrounding the skipped exons support conserved regulation as well. Second, deletion of a regulator of this splicing program, <italic>Rbfox2</italic>, affects the transcriptional response of the intima to low flow. Notably, both genes with <italic>Rbfox2</italic>-regulated transcript levels, and those with <italic>Rbfox2</italic>-regulated skipped exons were enriched in functions related to cytoskeletal remodeling, cell adhesion, and antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The particular genes regulated in each way (transcript abundance and splicing) did not directly overlap, suggesting that similar biological processes may be targeted through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in <italic>Rbfox2 EC-KO</italic> mice. Given the known activation of TLR4 signaling by EIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>), a key player in adaptive immunity, the potential impact on antigen presentation and the adaptive response warrants further research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of alternative splicing in the aortic endothelium by platelets and macrophages</title><p>Much of the work to date on flow-induced changes in gene expression in the arterial endothelium has focused on the initial response to flow, which increases the transcriptional expression of adhesion receptors and chemokines involved in the recruitment of circulating immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conway and Schwartz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). This has been a consequence of efforts to identify the first events leading to endothelial dysfunction under low flow. However, once circulating hematopoietic cells are recruited, they initiate ongoing interactions in the arterial wall likely to affect the ultimate outcome of flow-induced arterial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). Flow-driven vascular inflammation occurs as a chronic process, involving components of the innate and adaptive immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galkina and Ley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). Here, we show that recruitment of platelets and monocytes/macrophages in particular potently regulate alternative splicing in the arterial endothelium. Within this response, we observed alterations in a number of pathways that may impact ongoing interactions at the arterial wall. Thus, subsequent to the well-studied events leading to recruitment of immune cells, their interactions with the arterial endothelium appear to be affecting pathways that may help to shape the chronic inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Endothelial functions of Rbfox2</title><p>Rbfox2 is one of three Rbfox family members (Rbfox-1,-2 and -3). The Rbfox family of splice factors and the motif recognized by their RNA-binding domain are conserved throughout the vertebrates examined and also in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Underwood et al., 2005</xref>).

The Rbfox family has been shown to have important functions in heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh et al., 2014</xref>), and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>) and EMT in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>). De novo mutations in <italic>Rbfox2</italic> have also been identified in congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homsy et al., 2015</xref>), and alterations in Rbfox2 activity may be an early event in diabetes-induced heart pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nutter et al., 2016</xref>). In both heart and brain, Rbfox2 has been shown to have a requirement in maintenance of tissue functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to the other tissues mentioned, <italic>Rbfox2</italic> is the only member of the Rbfox family expressed in the arterial endothelium.</p><p>How <italic>Rbfox2</italic> modulates splicing activity in this system remains unknown. We observe modest changes in expression of Rbfox2 (&lt;20% increase in RNA in arterial endothelium exposed to low flow in vivo). Similar modest changes were observed in the in vitro system, in which we induced splicing changes with co-culture of platelets, monocytes and plasma. How else might Rbfox2 splicing activity be regulated? One possibility we examined is that upstream cues from platelet and monocyte recruitment alter sub-cellular localization of the Rbfox2 protein. However, we observed no obvious loss in nuclear Rbfox2 localization in vitro under conditions in which splicing changes are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that activity may be regulated in some other way. These data, together with the observation that deletion of <italic>Rbfox2</italic> results in splicing alterations more widespread than the low-flow response alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggest that the specificity of the endothelial splicing response is driven by other flow-responsive factors acting in an <italic>Rbfox2-</italic>dependent manner.</p><p>We have focused on the splicing functions of <italic>Rbfox2</italic>. However, in addition to affecting splicing patterns, <italic>Rbfox2</italic> has also been reported to regulate gene expression patterns by other mechanisms. Splicing of Rbfox2 targets has been shown to regulate transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jangi et al., 2014</xref>). Through recruitment of polycomb complexes to DNA, Rbfox2 may affect transcript expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Rbfox2 may also stabilize transcripts directly by binding to the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damianov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), suppressing the formation of isoforms destined for nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jangi et al., 2014</xref>). However, as we observed no enrichment of known Rbfox-binding sites in the 3’UTR of regulated transcripts and no regulation of transcript levels in vitro which were regulated in vivo, we believe that many of the transcript level changes mediated by deletion of Rbfox2 are due to downstream or non-cell autonomous effects. Future work, examining the functional effects of individual splicing events identified will be important in teasing apart splicing-dependent and -independent effects.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that hundreds of splicing changes are regulated in endothelial cells exposed to an acute reduction in blood flow, many of which were dependent on recruitment of platelets and monocytes to the arterial wall and impact key pathways in endothelial cell biology. Rbfox2 emerged as an important regulator in this system, and its depletion resulted in a partial suppression of transcriptional responses characteristic of low-flow-induced endothelial activation.

Briefly, mapped splice junctions were filtered for minimal transcript level and classified as SE, A3SS, A5SS, or MXE without reference to annotated exonic loci.

In general, the foreground events were more often poised at an intermediate Psi level (neither complete inclusion or exclusion). They also tended to be expressed at a higher level than background events. Thus, we created background sets in which we normalized each of these parameters independently (data not shown). We looked for motifs enriched either upstream (3’splice site, or 3’SS) or downstream (5’ splice site, or 5’SS) of the regulated exons. Since the direction of change in exon inclusion, increased dPsi or decreased dPsi, has been correlated with the location of splice factor binding, we further separated the foreground into exons with increased (+dPsi) or decreased (-dPsi) inclusion. Intronic sequences adjacent to the 3’SS and the 5’SS of skipped exons with increased or decreased inclusion were isolated from mm9 sequence data using Bedtools 2.16.1 (getfasta –s), and enrichment was calculated based on enrichment of 6-mer or 7-mer motifs in the foreground versus the background sets, split across 10 GC-normalized bins, iterated multiple times.</p><p>From the lists of enriched motifs we obtained, we aimed to identify the likely RNA-binding proteins.

Endothelial recruitment of inflammatory cells in response to low flow is important in a variety of vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Earlier work identified endothelial gene expression changes induced by the recruitment of platelets and additional cell types to sites of low flow and also showed that changes in the splicing of fibronectin (Fn) were important. Here the authors do a broader analysis, using carotid ligation to model low flow in the mouse and applying RNAseq to identify changes in splicing pattern across the transcriptome. This identified a large number of altered transcripts. They develop similar results in cultured endothelial cells and use antibody depletion of platelets or macrophages to identify the set of splicing changes responsive to the recruitment of these cells, which include the aforementioned Fn. Examining the cassette exons among the platelet/macrophage responsive splicing events, they find enrichment for the binding site of Rbfox family splicing regulators in the introns adjacent to the flow regulated exons. They show that Rbfox2 is expressed in the endothelium and use a conditional Rbfox2 allele to conditionally knock it out of these cells with the Cdh5-Cre driver. Examining the splicing in the knockout mice, they find that a substantial subset of the low flow responsive exons require Rbfox2 in their regulation. Finally, they find that many of the previously characterized gene expression changes in low flow conditions also require Rbfox2. These data point to a new posttranscriptional genetic regulatory program mediating endothelial responses to blood flow.</p><p>The reviewers all found this paper to be novel and interesting. Alternative splicing and the program of Rbfox regulation specifically are likely to be important for both normal and disease-altered mechanisms of vascular function. While the conclusions in the paper are supported by the data, the data are exclusively transcriptome analysis, limiting the potential mechanistic and biological insights into questions such as what signals from macrophages or platelets stimulate the transcriptome-wide effects; how Rbfox2 coordinates, through changes in activity or concentration, the low flow-induced changes in endothelial cells; or what physiologic impact the Rbfox2 knockout has on the response to low flow conditions. Addressing such questions would greatly broaden the interest of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Do the Rbfox2 ECKOs have any noticeable phenotype? For instance, do these mice exhibit an altered response to low flow when compared to littermate controls? Transcriptome-wide changes are presented but are not investigated further. The only physiologic data presented for Rbfox2 ECKOs is expression of macrophage markers. If the mutant phenotype has already been examined in more detail without finding a major difference from wildtype, this should be discussed.</p><p>2) As is alluded by the authors in the Discussion, the immune response to low flow occurs rapidly. However, the disease progression involves a chronic inflammatory response. The authors should check if the initial transcriptome changes persist in the wildtype, immune response depleted, and Rbfox2 EC-KOs over a longer time period. Another round of RNA-seq is not necessary, but additional verification by qPCR and splice assays of key events will be a valuable addition.</p><p>3) It is unclear how Rbfox2 activity responds to low flow since the authors state that Rbfox2 mRNA expression changes modestly under these conditions. Have they confirmed this at the protein level? Moreover, Rbfox proteins have both nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms, with the cytoplasmic forms regulating transcript levels through 3' UTR binding. The authors should assess how much Rbfox2 is in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells and whether this cytoplasmic Rbfox2 is causing some of the changes in gene expression observed in low flow conditions. This would yield a more complete picture of the post-transcriptional endothelial regulatory program induced by low flow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29494.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Do the Rbfox2 ECKOs have any noticeable phenotype?

We have not observed obvious phenotypes in arterial hemorrhage, neointima growth, or differences in the recruitment of Cd68+ or F4/80+ macrophages or Cxcr2+ neutrophils, based on cell-specific RNA transcripts in the intima in this model. These findings are now described in the Discussion (subsection “Biological consequences of alternative splicing programs induced by low flow”). We predict, based on the intimal transcriptional changes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), that adaptive responses could be affected. We have additional data to support this hypothesis; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, which reveals that culture on Rbfox2-ECKO endothelial cells shows differential activation of a number of genes in monocytes as compared with culture on control endothelial cells (e.g. Tmem176a, Tmem176b, Gpx3, Hpgd). Tmem176b is also known as Torid (tolerance-related and induced), and along with Tmem176a is downregulated during dendritic cell differentiation in response to LPS, poly I:C, and overexpression of Tmem176b suppresses MHCII expression on LPS-treated bone marrow derived monocytes (PMID: 20501748, 16095493). We have not included these preliminary data in the revised manuscript since they require further extension, which requires modifications to the disturbed flow model to promote the adaptive response. This work is underway, but the establishment of these models and their characterization will take more time and is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29494.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Endothelial cells deficient in Rbfox2 alter the response of co-cultured monocytes and replicate aspects of the in vivo intimal response.</title><p>Wild-type bone marrow monocytes were isolated and cultured for 5 days on Rbfox2-ECKO or control aortic endothelial cells (N=5 and N=7).

Following their suggestion, and our own interest, we have depleted platelets from the low flow artery two weeks after the induction of low flow, and found that this late depletion was insufficient to revert EIIIA splicing changes, or PAI1 expression, a marker of endothelial cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, this late-stage response is complex. In the absence of platelets, both PAI1 and EIIIA expression appeared elevated, suggesting a role at this stage which opposes the earlier acute functions of platelets. However, there are other components of this late response which also do not conform with the early response. Cd68, for example, is no longer elevated in the low flow artery. At this point, our understanding of immune-endothelial interactions during chronic disease progress is inadequate. More work will be required to determine why platelet depletion would exert different responses depending on the timing. Better, and more cost-effective models must be adapted to allow the chronic depletion of platelets in this response for several weeks, without the potential immune complications of long term antibody mediated depletion. As discussed above, ongoing work is focused on the establishment of these models, and an examination of the role of splicing changes in the chronic inflammatory response. The current paper does not directly address this, and will not be able to do so without new models and substantial additional work, so again we have not included these preliminary data in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29494.036</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Late platelet depletion in chronic low flow injury is insufficient to reverse EIIIA splicing and PAI1 expression.</title><p>Wild-type mice were subjected to partial carotid ligation, and two weeks later platelets were depleted or not.

In endothelial cells in vitro, Rbfox2 protein appears primarily nuclear by immunofluorescence, with no discernable change upon treatment with serum. These data are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and described in the Results (subsection “Endothelial-specific deletion of Rbfox2 partially reverts flow-responsive skipping of vascular skipped exons induced by low flow in vivo”, fourth paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “Endothelial functions of Rbfox2”, second paragraph). However, an important caveat to these in vitro experiments with regard to transcript regulation in the cytoplasmic pool is that, while in vivo Rbfox2-mediated splicing changes are replicated in vivo, changes in transcript levels were not. Thus, the in vitro system may not be positioned to define the contribution of cytoplasmic Rbfox2. Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, the in vivo system is not amenable to this analysis either. Nevertheless, arguing against a direct regulation of transcripts by cytoplasmic Rbfox2, we find no enrichment in Clip-Seq-defined Rbfox binding sites in the 3’UTR of transcripts whose levels (not splicing) were Rbfox2 regulated. These analyses are now described in the Results (subsection “Endothelial deletion of Rbfox2 alters the intimal response to low flow”, second paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “Endothelial functions of Rbfox2”, third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
