Curiously, two components of the MVA pathway are often absent from archaeal genomes. The search for these missing elements led to the discovery of isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), one of two activities necessary to furnish the universal five-carbon isoprenoid building block, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Unexpectedly, we now report functional IPKs also exist in Bacteria and Eukarya. Furthermore, amongst a subset of species within the bacterial phylum Chloroflexi, we identified a new enzyme catalyzing the missing decarboxylative step of the putative alternative MVA pathway. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a functioning alternative MVA pathway. Key to this pathway is the catalytic actions of a newly uncovered enzyme, mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase (MPD) and IPK. Together, these two discoveries suggest that unforeseen variation in isoprenoid metabolism may be widespread in nature.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00672.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00672.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00672.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living things make thousands of chemicals that are vital for life, and are also useful as medicines, perfumes, and food additives. The largest family of these natural chemicals is called the isoprenoids, and members of this family are found in all three domains of life: the eukaryotes (such as plants and animals), the Archaea (an ancient group of single-celled microbes), and bacteria.</p><p>The isoprenoids are made from a smaller building block called isopentenyl diphosphate, IPP for short, that contains five carbon atoms and two phosphate groups. IPP can be produced in two ways. The classical mevalonate pathway is found in most eukaryotes, including humans; statin drugs are used to inhibit this pathway to treat those with high cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The second pathway does not use the compound mevalonate and is found in many, but not all, bacteria as well as the chloroplasts of plants. Until recently, however, the enzymes needed for the last two steps of the classical mevalonate pathway appeared to be missing in the Archaea and in some bacteria.</p><p>Researchers subsequently discovered that an enzyme called isopentenyl phosphate kinase, shortened to IPK, was responsible for one of these two missing steps—the addition of IPP’s second phosphate group. The way this enzyme worked also suggested that there was an alternative mevalonate pathway in which the order of the last two steps was reversed. However, the identity of the enzyme responsible for the other step—the removal of a molecule of carbon dioxide to make the starting material needed by IPK—remained mysterious.</p><p>Now Dellas et al. have discovered the enzyme responsible for this missing step in Green non-sulphur bacteria, confirming the existence of the alternative mevalonate pathway for the first time. Previously it had been thought that this enzyme acted in the classical mevalonate pathway; but in fact this enzyme has evolved a new function and is not involved in the classical pathway at all. Moreover, Dellas et al. show that Green non-sulphur bacteria, and some eukaryotes, also have functional IPK enzymes. This means that IPK has now unexpectedly been observed in all three domains of life, and hints at another target to medically control mevalonate pathways. The discovery of the missing enzyme in the alternative pathway opens the door to the re-examination of many other living things, to find which have the new pathway and to work out why.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00672.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00672.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Mevalonate pathway</kwd><kwd>Isopentenyl diphosphate</kwd><kwd>Archaea</kwd><kwd>Mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase</kwd><kwd>Chloroflexi</kwd><kwd>Plant</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dellas</surname><given-names>Nikki</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Suzanne T</given-names></name><name><surname>Noel</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EEC0813570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dellas</surname><given-names>Nikki</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Suzanne T</given-names></name><name><surname>Noel</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB0645794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dellas</surname><given-names>Nikki</given-names></name><name><surname>Noel</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA14195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Gerard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of phylogenetic and biochemical analyses suggest that some unexpected variations in the synthesis of isoprenoids may be widespread across all three domains of life.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Isoprenoids constitute a substantial family of primary and secondary metabolites in all three domains of life. These molecules play essential and specialized roles for their hosts including modulation of membrane fluidity (cholesterol, hopanoids, squalene), chemical defense and communication (mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes), photoprotection and energy transfer (carotenoids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Li, 2008</xref>), and growth regulation (giberellins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedden and Kamiya, 1997</xref>). Additionally, isoprenoids such as quinones, chlorophyll, bacteriochlorophyll, and some cellular proteins are tethered to a polyisoprenoid chain to direct localization to membranes or to potentiate interactions with other biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nowicka and Kruk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schafer and Rine, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP, <bold>1</bold>) and its isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, <bold>2</bold>), are the five-carbon building blocks of all higher order isoprenoids. It is currently accepted that IPP is biosynthesized via one of two metabolic pathways: the mevalonate (MVA or sometimes MEV) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katsuki and Bloch, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynen, 1967</xref>) or the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway (also known as the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, MEP, or Rohmer pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arigoni et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenreich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohmer, 1999</xref>). These two metabolic systems utilize non-homologous enzymes that evolved independently to produce the same 5-carbon end product, IPP (<bold>1</bold>). Typically, a given organism uses one pathway or the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lange et al., 2000</xref>). Eukarya appear to encode the classical MVA pathway (with some exceptions, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassera et al., 2004</xref>]); plants additionally encode the DXP pathway that operates in the chloroplast. Most bacteria employ the DXP pathway with the exception of several phyla that contain full or partial MVA pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bochar et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While the domain Archaea and the bacterial class Chloroflexi do not encode gene homologs for the DXP pathway, nearly all of these species characterized genomically to date encode an incomplete classical MVA pathway. That is, many of these species lack identifiable genes encoding enzymes for one or both of the terminal steps of IPP biosynthesis through mevalonate. This observation is puzzling due to the essentiality of isoprenoid compounds in all organisms. Recent phylogenetic and experimental data suggest that Archaea (and probably also the Chloroflexi) encode an alternative MVA pathway, which bifurcates from the classical pathway following the phosphorylation of mevalonate to phosphomevalonate (MVAP, also known as mevalonate 5-phosphate, <bold>3</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grochowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miziorko, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Following MVAP biosynthesis, the classical MVA pathway uses phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) to phosphorylate MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) producing diphosphomevalonate (MVAPP, also known as mevalonate 5-diphosphate, <bold>5</bold>). MVAPP then undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent decarboxylation catalyzed by mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD, also known as MDC or DPM-DC) producing the key five-carbon isoprenoid building block, IPP (<bold>1</bold>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00672.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The classical and alternative MVA pathways.</title><p>Both branches of the MVA pathway begin with acetyl-CoA (and acetoacetyl-CoA) and proceed through a series of enzymatic reactions involving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA Synthase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA Reductase (HMGR, the presumed early rate-limiting step), and mevalonate kinase (MVK) before branching. At the bifurcation, the canonical MVA pathway, highlighted by light blue arrows, guides MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) through an additional phosphorylation reaction followed by a phosphorylation-dependent decarboxylation carried out by phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MDD), respectively. The alternative MVA pathway, highlighted with light brown arrows, hypothetically decarboxylates MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) prior to the phosphorylation reaction carried out by IPK but the former step has not been discovered until now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grochowski et al., 2006</xref>). The enzymes MVK, PMK, MDD, and IPK all consume ATP during catalysis. All enzymes are shown in green type. Statins serve as inhibitors of HMGR as highlighted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00672.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00672.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00672-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The alternative MVA pathway is posited to reverse these steps; decarboxylation of MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) followed by phosphorylation of isopentenyl phosphate (IP, <bold>4</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The first step would require a currently undetected enzyme activity, MVAP decarboxylase (MPD). The final phosphorylation activity has been characterized in Archaea and is catalyzed by isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), an ATP-dependent kinase that phosphorylates IP (<bold>4</bold>) forming IPP (<bold>1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Until now, the <italic>IPK</italic> gene has not been studied among the Chloroflexi bacteria or within eukaryotic organisms presumably encoding all the enzymes of the classical MVA pathway. We performed extensive phylogenetic analyses to reveal a spotty distribution of IPK-bearing organisms in animals, several fungi, all plants, and some bacteria (including those from the class Chloroflexi). Following heterologous expression, purification, and kinetic characterization of several proteins encoding representative <italic>IPK</italic>-like genes from each domain of life, we show that fully active and highly specific IPKs unexpectedly exist outside of Archaea.</p><p>One such fully active IPK was characterized from the Chloroflexi bacteria, <italic>Roseiflexus castenholzii</italic>. Interestingly, by classical genome annotation, the Chloroflexi bacteria, as well as certain other archaeal and bacterial groups, contain only a subset of components of the classical (PMK-, MDD-utilizing) and alternative (MPD-, IPK-utilizing) MVA pathways, resulting in what appears to be the existence of two incomplete branches of the MVA pathway in one organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, Chloroflexi bacteria appear to be missing the <italic>PMK</italic> gene from the classical pathway and the <italic>MPD</italic> gene from the alternative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</xref>). This arrangement contrasts with archaeal species, which do not appear to encode either PMK or MDD from the classical MVA pathway.</p><p>Through biochemical characterization of the enzymes encoded by the remaining MVA pathway genes (<italic>MDD</italic> and <italic>IPK</italic>) from the Chloroflexi bacterium, <italic>R. castenholzii</italic>, we unequivocally demonstrate that a functional alternative MVA pathway does exist and is encoded in a completely unexpected manner. In <italic>R. castenholzii</italic>, the putative MDD of the classical MVA pathway surprisingly is fully functional, and until now, expresses an unknown MPD activity associated with the alternative MVA pathway. Combined with our observation of a fully functional <italic>IPK</italic>-like gene from this same organism, these results provide the first definitive bioinformatic and experimental evidence for a fully operative alternative MVA pathway in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic analyses of IPK homologs</title><p>IPK is a member of the amino acid kinase (AAK) superfamily.

As photoheterotrophs, Chloroflexi use light for energy but cannot fix carbon dioxide as their primary source of carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant and Frigaard, 2006</xref>). Of the six bacterial phyla reported to contain MVA pathway-bearing organisms, only the Chloroflexi contain IPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</xref>), but lack an obvious PMK. Although it appears from genome annotations that the Chloroflexi encode two incomplete branches of the essential MVA metabolic pathway, we demonstrate in one Chlorflexi bacterium that this MDD-like enzyme in fact acts catalytically as a bona fide MPD. MPD and IPK from this Chloroflexi bacterium, <italic>R. castenholzii</italic>, complete the assembly of a hitherto unforeseen alternative MVA pathway that catalyzes sequential MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) decarboxylation and IP (<bold>4</bold>) phosphorylation resulting in the central hub metabolite of all organisms, the five-carbon isoprenoid building block IPP (<bold>1</bold>).</p><p>The consequences of the neofunctionalization of MDD to MPD are particularly noticeable in the substrate binding regions surrounding the diphosphate moiety of MVAPP (<bold>5</bold>) in canonical MDDs. The majority of the residues surrounding the diphosphate of MVAPP (<bold>5</bold>) in canonical MDDs are strictly conserved in structure- and sequence-based analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byres et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, archaeal MDDs from Haloarchaea and Thermoplasmata contain MPD-like active site residues associated with MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) binding and turnover and their protein sequences cluster with the MPD from Chloroflexi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</xref>). These MDDs belong to two archaeal classes that encode IPK but are missing PMK, suggesting that they also use this metabolic assembly of the alternative MVA pathway. The correlation between unique active site residues and alteration in substrate preference, MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) over MVAPP (<bold>5</bold>), among MPDs from Chloroflexi bacteria, reflects a lineage specific adaptation that allows for the utilization of the alternative MVA pathway; this adaptation may also apply to MPD-like MDDs of the archaeal phyla Haloarchaea and Thermoplasmata but awaits experimental verification currently in progress.</p><p>Despite key amino acid differences in the active site of the MDD-annotated <italic>R. castenholzii</italic> MPD, it nevertheless possesses high sequence similarity to canonical MDDs. Moreover, <italic>R castenholzii</italic> MPD and its closely related homologs annotated in several sequenced Chloroflexi species’ genomes including, <italic>Roseiflexus sp. RS-1</italic>, <italic>Herpetosiphon aurantiacus</italic>, <italic>Chloroflexus aggregans</italic>, <italic>Chloroflexus aurantiacus</italic>, and <italic>Chloroflexus sp.

Unexpectedly, this <italic>R. castenholzii</italic> gene, which is annotated as an ‘MDD’, catalyzes the phosphorylation-dependent decarboxylation of MVAP (<bold>3</bold>), thus serving as a long sought MPD requiring functional re-annotation in <italic>R. castenholzii</italic> and most likely the additional Chloroflexi species noted previously. It is possible that this enzyme has only recently emerged and undergone neofunctionaliation to acquire MPD activity from an MDD ancestor within the larger phylum of Chloroflexi heterotrophic photosynthetic bacteria. The emergence of this MPD activity may have also coincided with the loss of the <italic>PMK</italic> gene from species within the narrower Chloroflexi class and/or acquisition of an <italic>IPK</italic> gene. Selection for such an alternative metabolic route to the core isoprenoid building block IPP may be due, in part, to a higher demand for metabolic flux through an alternative set of enzymes associated with the Chloroflexi MVA pathway. Indeed, the Chloroflexi class of bacteria appear to possess an expanded repertoire of downstream enzymes of isoprenoid metabolism suggesting a high demand for isoprenoid metabolites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00900">http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00900</ext-link>).</p><p>While archaeal species contain an active IPK consistent with the presence of the alternative MVA pathway, most lack typical or atypical MDD genes; furthermore, a gene candidate capable of encoding an enzyme able to convert MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) to IP (<bold>4</bold>), the first postulated step of the alternative pathway, has not been identified. One candidate gene previously suggested to encode this decarboxylation activity is a gene encoding a dioxygenase-like protein that resides within the MVA operon in most Archaea (MJ0403 in <italic>M. jannaschii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grochowski et al., 2006</xref>). MJ0403 encodes a protein that is similar in sequence to subunit B of class III extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases and is also homologous to the human protein MEMO (mediator of erbB2-driven cell motility). Thus far, in vitro attempts to demonstrate decarboxylase activity for MJ0403 have failed to show any turnover of MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) to IP (<bold>4</bold>) even though the protein is quite easily produced heterologously.</p><p>While most archaea lack the MDD gene, certain species from the archaeal order Sulfolobales (including the archaeon <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>) encode a gene annotated as MDD. In our experiments, <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> PMK and MDD activities were detected in steady-state kinetic experiments and GC-MS assays, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A recent publication on the characterization of the classical MVA pathway enzymes from crude extracts of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> supports the presence of an active classical MVA pathway in the order Sulfolobales, consistent with our in vitro results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>). While our experiments demonstrate that IPK is active in an in vitro assay, their experiments involving cell-free extracts of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> indicate that IPK activity is undetectable. Nevertheless, these combined results apply to only a small set of Archaea, and the question remains as to how most archaeal species convert MVAP (<bold>3</bold>) to the essential metabolite, IPP (<bold>1</bold>).</p><p>Eukaryotic genomes examined to date appear to encode a classical MVA pathway with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassera et al., 2004</xref>). We did however identify a spotty distribution of eukaryotes that contain IPK, and from those examined thus far, corresponding IPK activity that could be associated with an alternative route to IPP (<bold>1</bold>) through the MVA pathway. Since many eukaryotes encode putative enzymes of unknown function, they may also encode a cryptic MPD that would serve in an alternative biosynthetic route to IPP (<bold>1</bold>). All IPKs tested thus far were fully functional, demonstrating that true IPKs persist across most eukaryotic lineages, while some have been lost during rare evolutionary events, probably due to partial redundancy with the MVA pathway. The unusual phylogeny of IPK coupled with its membership in a family of kinases that phosphorylate such a broad range of substrates leave open the possibility that IPK may assume varied physiological roles, including phosphorylation of an IP-like substrate, IP recycling, and/or most notably, access to a pool of IPP through IP-IPP homeostatic control.</p><p>While the IPK gene is present within a spotty distribution of eukaryotes, the gene appears to be universally retained across the green plant lineage, which suggests that it plays a more universal role within the plant kingdom. Plants are unique in that they are currently known to encode two IPP-synthesizing pathways, the DXP pathway localized to the chloroplast and the MVA pathway localized to the peroxisome and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lange et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leivar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagegowda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsieh et al., 2008</xref>). These pathways assume distinct metabolic roles within general isoprenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nes and Venkatramesh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenreich et al., 2001</xref>). It would not be surprising to identify yet another variation of the MVA pathway in the green plant lineage. In addition to IPP (<bold>1</bold>) recycling through IP (<bold>4</bold>), IPK would afford metabolic control of carbon availability from IP (<bold>4</bold>) to IPP (<bold>1</bold>). Noting that the diversity of primary and secondary isoprenoid products produced by plants often localize to subcellular compartments, organelles and specialized cell types (i.e. trichomes), an ubiquitous IPK in plants may regulate spatial and temporal control of isoprenoid diphosphate metabolism destined for a myriad of primary and specialized plant metabolites.</p><p>These results biochemically elucidate the terminal biosynthetic steps in an alternative or unconventional MVA pathway. The experiments described also definitively demonstrate metabolic routes to IPP (<bold>1</bold>) through the classical MVA pathway in previously overlooked organisms by including the kinetic characterization of IPKs, MDDs, MPDs, and PMKs taken from all three domains of life. Significantly, the studies presented provide the first experimental support for the existence of IPK catalytic activity in all three domains of life and a fully functional alternative MVA pathway in the photosynthetic heterotrophic bacterial class Chloroflexi.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of IPK homologs</title><p>Archaeal IPK genes from <italic>M. jannaschii</italic>, <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> C5, and <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> P2, in addition to MDD and PMK genes from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> P2, were cloned from genomic DNA from American Type Cell Cultures (ATCC, Manassas, VA) as previously described for <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dellas and Noel, 2010</xref>) into a pET28a(+) vector containing a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal 8-His tag.

The sequence contains a frameshift within the ORF and lacks the H60 residue, both of which may be the result of sequencing errors.</p><p>In the Eukarya domain, searches for IPK homologs were made using the non-redundant amino acid (NRAA) Genbank database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benson et al., 2010</xref>), the database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boguski et al., 1993</xref>), and a wide variety of genome databases, including those at Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birney et al., 2004</xref>), Joint Genome Institute (JGI, genome.jgi-psf.org/), Baylor College of Medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu">www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu</ext-link>), Sanger Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/">www.genedb.org/</ext-link>) and the Broad Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org">www.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>).

Representatives from each of four groups (eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria, and Chloroflexi) were modeled using Swissmodel and superimposed to identify aligning active site residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).

After a group consultation among the reviewers, the emerging consensus opinion was that the manuscript was better suited for a specialty journal in the field of biochemistry or chemical biology. We hope the following specific comments will help you to revise the paper for submission to another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Dellas and colleagues describes the characterization of an alternative mevalonate pathway in Chloroflexi bacteria that inverts the canonical order of the terminal phosphorylation and decarboxylation steps in the conversion of MVAP to IPP. The authors determine that Chloroflexi possess an enzyme originally predicted based on sequence homology to be a mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) that instead decarboxylates mevalonate 5-phosphate. This finding, combined with the existence of an isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), establishes a complete mevalonate pathway in Chloroflexi. The authors proceed to make a convincing argument for discrete changes in the active site of the Chloroflexi decarboxylase that may account for the substrate switch from MVAPP to MVAP. The results reported in this manuscript certainly enrich our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of mevalonate pathways, but this reviewer was not convinced that the findings are particularly surprising. The “enzyme repurposing“ discovered by the authors appears to reflect a rather simple tweak in substrate scope for the decarboxylase enzyme (i.e., MVAPP and MVAP only differ by a single phosphate group, so is it really unexpected that certain MDD-like enzymes might have evolved to switch substrate preference to MVAP over MVAPP?). Furthermore, as the authors note, there is already quite a bit of emerging literature on the general topic of diversification of mevalonate pathways, so this reviewer had difficulty judging the actual impact of the current manuscript. It is a solid and well-executed contribution, but appears to fall short of the high-impact study intended for a general readership journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript uses a combination of bioinformatics and three-dimensional structures to discover a “missing“ enzyme in an alternate pathway to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) in the mevalonate pathway. The “usual“ pathway involves phosphorylation of mevalonate phosphate (MVAP) to the diphosphate (MVAPP) that then undergoes decarboxylation to IPP. However, in some organisms the kinase is “missing“; instead a kinase that phosphorylates isopentenyl phosphate (IP) could be identified. This suggested that these organisms would also have MVAP decarboxylase, producing IP that then is phosphorylated.</p><p>In this manuscript Noel and coworkers report that a protein that was predicted to be MVAPP decarboxylase is, in fact, MVAP decarboxylase, thereby providing the substrate for the previously chacterized IP kinase.</p><p>The work is carefully performed, with insights from three dimensional structures used to understand the structural basis for how/why the presumed MVAPP decarboxylase has an altered substrate specificity that allows the MVAP decarboxylase activity.</p><p>This manuscript can be accepted without change.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>The authors provide evidence for the identification of isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) in archaea, as well as a novel enzyme that catalyzes MVAP decarboxylation (MPD). These findings indicate the possibility of an exciting and novel alternative mevalonate-dependent biosynthetic route to isoprenoids, through MPD and IPK, rather than PMK and MDD. The authors used bioinformatic algorithms to identify IPK homologs (with a conserved active-site histidine), scattered throughout the domains of life (including animals). The authors purified 7 of these IPKS (one previously characterized homolog and 6 new) and confirmed their predicted enzymatic activity. The authors then enzymatically characterized PMKs and MDDs from organisms that had active IPKs. They found that one of the purified MDD homologues (from <italic>R. castenholzii</italic>) does not have MDD activity, but instead possesses an MPD activity in vitro. Single-pot multi-enzyme assays confirm the ability of these enzymes to synthesize isoprenoids. Not unexpectedly, the MDD-like RcMPD has amino acid changes and predicted structural changes from canonical MDDs that may explain a change in substrate specificity.</p><p>The major conclusions of this work are that functional IPKs are widespread and that MPDs exist and are utilized for IPP production-depend on in vitro studies with purified recombinant enzymes. The biological relevance of these findings would be greatly strengthened by additional experimental evidence that these enzymes function to produce isoprenoids within living cells (using, for example, cell feeding experiments such those described by Lange and Croteau 1999). In addition, kinetic characterization of the IPKs with additional substrates (such as mevalonate-5-phosphate, dimethylallyl monophosphate, and isopentenol) would increase confidence that isopentenyl monophosphate is indeed the preferred IPK substrate. The enzymatic characterization of RcMPD is key to the existence of the novel alternative pathway; however, the catalytic efficiency of this particular enzyme preparation was very low (2 logs less than the MDD enzymes in this study). Is there additional experimental evidence (for example, differential scanning fluorometry) that confirms that the purified enzyme is not denatured, resulting in loss of the canonical MDD activity? Perhaps MVAP is not actually the preferred natural substrate, given that the K<sub>m</sub> is over 1 mM? Finally, confidence in the proposed enzymatic reactions would be increased by additional methods confirming the identity of the predicted products (for both IPKs and the RcMPD), other than linked enzymatic assays – the pyruvate kinase/LDH assays support ATP utilization and the FPS/TEAS assays support IPP production, but alternate products may be made. There are many analytical options (radiolabeled substrates/HPLC, LCMS, 31P NMR) that are typically used to confirm product identity.</p><p>[Editors' note: the following comments were sent to the authors upon evaluating the revised manuscript.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Unexpected Functional Divergence of the Mevalonate Pathway in All Three Domains of Life” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Deputy editor Detlef Weigel and 3 peer reviewers.</p><p>The Deputy editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Deputy editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Isoprenoids are essential metabolites for all living cells. Two main pathways are leading to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the universal precursors of isoprenoids: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in animals, fungi, Archaea, some eubacteria and in plant cytoplasm, and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in most eubacteria, in the plant plastids as well as in some unicellular eukaryotes phylogenetically related to photosynthetic lineages. A variant of the MVA pathway has partially characterized in some Archaea with isopentenyl monophosphate (IP) as intermediates. This alternative MVA pathway requires an IP kinase (which has been characterized) and a putative MVA phosphate decarboxylase (which has not been characterized).</p><p>The manuscript submitted by Dellas, Manning, and Noel presents decisive results on the two above-mentioned enzymes. A fully alternative MVA pathway has been characterized for the first time in Choroflexi bacteria. The MVA phosphate decarboxylase, the missing link of this pathway, has been finally identified; its sequence has been compared to those of MVA diphosphate decarboxylase; and the biochemical activity has been demonstrated, indicating that the “putative MVA diphosphate decarboxylase” is finally a MVA monophosphate decarboxylase. The same data set is available for the IP kinase from Chloroflexi.</p><p>The most exciting contribution was the finding that a bacterial MVA diphosphate decarboxylase actually catalyzes the missing decarboxylation reaction proposed for the divergent MVA pathway, the decarboxylation of MVA phosphate. This is a very significant finding and is the strongest evidence to date for the existence of a mevalonate pathway with divergent last steps. The fact that this is the first report of such a pathway in bacteria is also very significant.</p><p>One wishes the authors could have provided in vivo proof of the operation of this pathway in bacteria or Archaea, but they do supply one of the next best things by demonstrating that they can combine the heterologously expressed mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase and isopentenyl monophosphate kinase to make the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) building blocks of terpenoid metabolism.

This finding, combined with the existence of an isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), establishes a complete mevalonate pathway in Chloroflexi. The authors proceed to make a convincing argument for discrete changes in the active site of the Chloroflexi decarboxylase that may account for the substrate switch from MVAPP to MVAP. The results reported in this manuscript certainly enrich our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of mevalonate pathways, but this reviewer was not convinced that the findings are particularly surprising. The “enzyme repurposing“ discovered by the authors appears to reflect a rather simple tweak in substrate scope for the decarboxylase enzyme (i.e., MVAPP and MVAP only differ by a single phosphate group, so is it really unexpected that certain MDD-like enzymes might have evolved to switch substrate preference to MVAP over MVAPP?). Furthermore, as the authors note, there is already quite a bit of emerging literature on the general topic of diversification of mevalonate pathways, so this reviewer had difficulty judging the actual impact of the current manuscript. It is a solid and well-executed contribution, but appears to fall short of the high-impact study intended for a general readership journal like</italic> eLife<italic>.</italic></p><p>With all due respect to Reviewer 1, the repurposing of the enzyme in question, the decarboxylase of MVAPP, is totally unexpected and the simplicity of the explanation should not in any way suggest it is an obvious finding or only of incremental importance to isoprenoid metabolism. Clearly, the simplicity of the explanation strongly suggests that the decarboxylase in question, annotated as MVAPP decarboxylases (MDDs) in all available genome and transcriptome sequences requires both computational re-examination, and even more importantly, functional examination. Given the response of the audience at the recent international meeting on isoprenoid biology and metabolism where I (Noel) presented the results, many labs are already rethinking the currently accepted view of the mevalonate pathway, not only in Archaea where an alternative pathway was originally suggested to exist, but in all three domains of life. I would like to emphasize that the simplicity of this explanation of gene and enzyme neofunctionalization (or repurposing) is wholly unexpected and one of the major breakthroughs in the current submission.</p><p>Concerning the comment regarding the references we cite that review the emerging literature on the alternative mevalonate pathway, no studies to date have identified nor characterized the “missing” decarboxylase activity, enzyme or gene. I would like to again emphasize that the study described in the revised submission is the first discovery of this activity associated with an ubiquitous gene currently annotated as encoding conventional MDDs. Careful reading of these references in question demonstrate there is still much to learn.</p><p>Moreover, no one has ever suggested the presence of the IPK activity (the second major finding of the paper) in organisms outside of the Archaea (with the exception of the unfortunately erroneous paper mentioned below). We actually show convincingly in vitro that, in fact, this activity exists in all three domains of life, including throughout the green plant lineage and sporadically in metazoans including vertebrates up to the reptilians. Of course, there is much more to do particularly in vivo, and we have embarked on these experiments in plants and Chloroflexi. However, these in vivo studies are quite complex and will take time to develop the unconventional systems. We hope the reviewers and editors will agree that the in vivo work is well beyond the scope of the current manuscript. This manuscript, instead, describes for the first time the unexpected and critically important discovery of a major new metabolic route to isoprenoids in all organisms.</p><p>Finally, concerning the comment on the suitability of the paper for <italic>eLife</italic>, “It is a solid and well-executed contribution, but appears to fall short of the high-impact study intended for a general readership journal like <italic>eLife</italic>”, I again would respectfully disagree. Within the exploding field of metabolic research, the discovery of unexpected catalytic routes through essential metabolic pathways like the mevalonate pathway, that also hold incredible significance for disease (HMGR inhibition by statins), is of high-impact and general importance to many fields including metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, metabolic evolution and therapeutics.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This manuscript uses a combination of bioinformatics and three-dimensional structures to discover a “missing“ enzyme in an alternate pathway to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) in the mevalonate pathway. The “usual“ pathway involves phosphorylation of mevalonate phosphate (MVAP) to the diphosphate (MVAPP) that then undergoes decarboxylation to IPP. However, in some organisms the kinase is “missing“; instead a kinase that phosphorylates isopentenyl phosphate (IP) could be identified. This suggested that these organisms would also have MVAP decarboxylase, producing IP that then is phosphorylated</italic>.</p><p><italic>In this manuscript Noel and coworkers report that a protein that was predicted to be MVAPP decarboxylase is, in fact, MVAP decarboxylase, thereby providing the substrate for the previously chacterized IP kinase</italic>.</p><p><italic>The work is carefully performed, with insights from three dimensional structures used to understand the structural basis for how/why the presumed MVAPP decarboxylase has an altered substrate specificity that allows the MVAP decarboxylase activity</italic>.</p><p><italic>This manuscript can be accepted without change</italic>.</p><p>We respectfully concur.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The authors provide evidence for the identification of isopentenyl phosphate kinases (IPKs) in archaea, as well as a novel enzyme that catalyzes MVAP decarboxylation (MPD). These findings indicate the possibility of an exciting and novel alternative mevalonate-dependent biosynthetic route to isoprenoids, through MPD and IPK, rather than PMK and MDD. The authors used bioinformatic algorithms to identify IPK homologs (with a conserved active-site histidine), scattered throughout the domains of life (including animals). The authors purified 7 of these IPKS (one previously characterized homolog and 6 new) and confirmed their predicted enzymatic activity. The authors then enzymatically characterized PMKs and MDDs from organisms that had active IPKs. They found that one of the purified MDD homologues (from</italic> R. castenholzii<italic>) does not have MDD activity, but instead possesses an MPD activity</italic> in vitro<italic>. Single-pot multi-enzyme assays confirm the ability of these enzymes to synthesize isoprenoids. Not unexpectedly, the MDD-like RcMPD has amino acid changes and predicted structural changes from canonical MDDs that may explain a change in substrate specificity</italic>.</p><p><italic>The major conclusions of this work are that functional IPKs are widespread and that MPDs exist and are utilized for IPP production-depend on</italic> in vitro <italic>studies with purified recombinant enzymes. The biological relevance of these findings would be greatly strengthened by additional experimental evidence that these enzymes function to produce isoprenoids within living cells (using, for example, cell feeding experiments such those described by Lange and Croteau 1999). In addition, kinetic characterization of the IPKs with additional substrates (such as mevalonate-5-phosphate, dimethylallyl monophosphate, and isopentenol) would increase confidence that isopentenyl monophosphate is indeed the preferred IPK substrate. The enzymatic characterization of RcMPD is key to the existence of the novel alternative pathway; however, the catalytic efficiency of this particular enzyme preparation was very low (2 logs less than the MDD enzymes in this study). Is there additional experimental evidence (for example, differential scanning fluorometry) that confirms that the purified enzyme is not denatured, resulting in loss of the canonical MDD activity? Perhaps MVAP is not actually the preferred natural substrate, given that the K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> <italic>is over 1 mM? Finally, confidence in the proposed enzymatic reactions would be increased by additional methods confirming the identity of the predicted products (for both IPKs and the RcMPD), other than linked enzymatic assays-the pyruvate kinase/LDH assays support ATP utilization and the FPS/TEAS assays support IPP production, but alternate products may be made. There are many analytical options (radiolabeled substrates/HPLC, LCMS, 31P NMR) that are typically used to confirm product identity</italic>.</p><p>We are familiar with the paper in question. Unfortunately, Lange and Croteau had mis-identified the IPK activity. It turned out that Lange and Croteau had erroneously characterized the <italic>ychB</italic> enzyme from <italic>E. coli</italic>. This enzyme is one of the enzymes of the MEP (Rohmer) pathway of primary isoprenoid biosynthesis found in many, though not all bacteria, in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic><bold>,</bold> and in plant chloroplasts. We previously worked on this enzyme structurally and functionally. In short, while the title suggests this 1999 paper is critical to the current study and evidence of an established alternative pathway over a decade ago, the <italic>ychB</italic> enzyme does not have a role in isopentenyl phosphate phosphorylation and therefore is not relevant to our study.</p><p>As mentioned in the response to Reviewer 1, we absolutely agree that more in vivo work must be carried out, but as argued above, this future work is well beyond the scope of the current findings as described in our current manuscript. The current study is rich with functional data from a phylogenetically diverse set of organisms. This will provide starting points for many labs working on phylogenetically diverse systems to probe the significance of these findings. In fact, we are in the midst of in vivo studies in Chloroflexi (establishing growth conditions and genetic manipulations) as well as in plants (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>). In the case of plants, some transgenics have been obtained and others are being established. Preliminary transcriptomic and metabolomic data in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> show a strong correlation between IPK expression and the expression of other enzymes of downstream isoprenoid metabolism, i.e., plant steroids and sesquiterpenes as well as their small molecule products.</p><p><italic>In addition, kinetic characterization of the IPKs with additional substrates (such as mevalonate-5-phosphate, dimethylallyl monophosphate, and isopentenol) would increase confidence that isopentenyl monophosphate is indeed the preferred IPK substrate</italic>.</p><p>The kinetic parameters for the IPK homologues characterized herein are in line with those observed for the archaeal IPKs that were originally characterized. While we agree with the reviewer (and have even suggested in the paper) that perhaps some of these enzymes (especially those in the Eukarya domain) may serve additional roles in vivo or are able to turn over a different substrate of natural or synthetic origin, we would argue that detailed use of a plethora of possible substrates in IPK assays is outside the scope of this paper given the sound kinetic data already obtained. As Poulter and our lab have shown, IPKs, when given alternative and mostly non-natural substrates, will phosphorylate them, but with kinetic constants not in line with in vivo flux through a bona fide metabolic pathway. Moreover, the kinetic constants obtained and presented in the current manuscript are quite reasonable and expected for highly specific IPKs and for a neofunctionalized MDD to MPD. In short, IPK enzymes from all three domains of life are able to carry out the IPK reaction with kinetic rates and K<sub>M</sub>s that are comparable to the enzyme that was originally characterized from Archaea.</p><p><italic>The enzymatic characterization of RcMPD is key to the existence of the novel alternative pathway; however, the catalytic efficiency of this particular enzyme preparation was very low (2 logs less than the MDD enzymes in this study). Is there additional experimental evidence (for example, differential scanning fluorometry) that confirms that the purified enzyme is not denatured, resulting in loss of the canonical MDD activity? Perhaps MVAP is not actually the preferred natural substrate, given that the K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> <italic>is over 1 mM</italic>?</p><p>We acknowledge that the K<sub>M</sub> of the enzyme is somewhat high; however, we would like to emphasize that the enzyme has virtually no measurable activity with MVAPP (its “natural” substrate based on the fact that it has high sequence homology to all other MVAPP decarboxylases) and a significant activity when assayed with MVAP. The in vivo work in progress will establish whether the K<sub>M</sub> is “too” high or right in line with the steady-state concentrations of MVAP in Chloroflexi consistent with high flux through the alternative mevalonate pathway. It should be noted that smaller K<sub>M</sub>s often result in slower turnovers and that KMs for many enzymes of core metabolism are in the mM range often within 2-5-fold of the in vivo steady-state concentration of their substrates. Moreover, the existence of “metabolons” consisting of loosely associated complexes of consecutive enzymes in a metabolic pathway (such as in the purinosome) negate, to a large extent, the physical significance of steady-state KM measurements. Finally, careful examination of the Chloroflexi genomes all show the absence of the key kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), which is essential for forming MVAPP. To date, we have not found IPK or other small molecule kinases from Chloroflexi that possess the PMK activity.</p><p>We have added a third paragraph in the Discussion to address these questions:</p><p>“Despite key amino acid changes in the active site of the annotated <italic>Roseiflexus castenholzii</italic> “MDD”, it nevertheless possesses high sequence similarity to canonical MDDs…”</p><p><italic>Finally, confidence in the proposed enzymatic reactions would be increased by additional methods confirming the identity of the predicted products (for both IPKs and the RcMPD), other than linked enzymatic assays-the pyruvate kinase/LDH assays support ATP utilization and the FPS/TEAS assays support IPP production, but alternate products may be made. There are many analytical options (radiolabeled substrates/HPLC, LCMS, 31P NMR) that are typically used to confirm product identity</italic>.</p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns with regard to product identity; however, the assays are well established and can only operate with the substrates provided in vitro. Based on multi-enzyme GC-MS assays, we will only see a GC-detectable terpene product from the alternative pathway if <italic>Rc</italic>MPD is able to decarboxylate MVAP to IP, the latter of which is a substrate for IPK to make IPP. It should be noted that these are reconstituted in vitro reactions using highly purified components and not the result of using crude or even partially purified extracts possessing a mixture of other enzymes and metabolites that could lead to erroneous results. In short, if IP is not produced, IPK cannot produce IPP, and none of the downstream isoprenoids will be produced. It is also not surprising that <italic>Rc</italic>MPD performs a decarboxylation very similar to its closest homolog MDD, and the natural sequence variation in the <italic>Rc</italic>MPD active site are rationalized based on molecular mechanisms outlined in the text, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Finally, a very thorough functional study of all homologs from the entire Chloroflexi class that have genome sequences available is in progress, and product identity will be confirmed by a combination of recently obtained UPLC-MS and NMR instruments. These latter studies will provide a paper of record documenting a more detailed set of numbers for all the reactions. We feel that these studies are again beyond the scope of the current paper as this paper reports for the first time two major findings for the metabolism field: the presence of IPK-like activity across all three domains of life, and the first discovery and reconstitution of an alternative mevalonate pathway in vitro. Leaders in the field including Michel Rohmer (see above) have seen the results presented by Noel, and also have read the paper. Without bias or prejudice concerning our paper, all were shocked the original submission received a very lukewarm reception, particularly the suggestion that the combination of deep phylogenetic analyses coupled with quantitative in vitro kinetic analyses and reconstitution assays was not of high scientific impact.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>One wishes the authors could have provided</italic> in vivo <italic>proof of the operation of this pathway in bacteria or Archaea, but they do supply one of the next best things by demonstrating that they can combine the heterologously expressed mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase and isopentenyl monophosphate kinase to make the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) building blocks of terpenoid metabolism. Any additional data in this general direction that could be added in the revision would be most welcome</italic>.</p><p>To specifically address the concerns of the reviewers, we have re-assayed the enzyme after thrombin cleavage of the 3 kDa affinity purification tag and found an order of magnitude improvement in the apparent K<sub>M</sub>, from 1.1 mM to 150 μM. In addition, Thermofluor stability assays demonstrate that recombinant MPD is extremely thermostable (expected as the Chloroflexi host lives optimally in hot springs at or slightly above the boiling point of water) with midpoint melting temperatures (Tm) above 90°C. Due to the low in vitro stability of components of the pyruvate kinases/lactate dehydrogenase assay and instrument limitations, <italic>R. castenholzii</italic> MPD could not be assayed at temperatures equivalent to the optimal growth conditions of the Chloroflexi host. We fully expect that the enzyme will perform more efficiently at temperatures approaching 100°C as observed for many enzymes from thermophilic organisms compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Unfortunately, the class of Chloroflexi in which new decarboxylase activity has been found are currently recalcitrant to genetic manipulation and difficult to grow in the laboratory without specialized fermentation systems. In the current revised manuscript, we now include the revised kinetic data along with a description of the assay for thermostability.</p><p>We also note that we have downplayed the second major discovery contained in the previous version of the manuscript, namely the clear biochemical identification of a fully functional and unanticipated IPK activity in all domains of life with a particular emphasis on the green plant lineage. We still include the biochemical results of in vitro IPK activity that is on par with previously measured activities in Archaea. However, we have significantly shortened and revised the current manuscript to focus attention on the major new quantitative discovery, the first characterization of a complete alternative MVA pathway through a newly discovered neofunctionalized mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase to a mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase.</p><p>We are currently in the midst of studies of IPK's role in plant isoprenoid metabolism. Notably, using a series of knockouts and transient overexpression lines in the reference plants <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, we have accumulated preliminary evidence of a significant positive correlation between the expression of IPK activity in planta and 2-5-fold increases in plant sterol and sesquiterpene production. While these latter studies are still in progress and extend beyond the scope of the current manuscript, they lend further support for the unexpected discovery of alternative routes in plants for modulating economically important isoprenoid production through plant IPK activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
