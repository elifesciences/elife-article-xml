that selectively lose their apical processes. bRG and BG have been implicated in the expansion and folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum, respectively. Here, we analyzed the molecular characteristics and development of bRG and BG. Transcriptomic comparison revealed striking similarity of the molecular features of bRG and BG. We found that heightened ERK signaling activity in aRG is tightly linked to the temporal formation and the relative abundance of bRG in human and mouse cortices. Forced activation of an FGF-ERK-ETV axis that is crucial to BG induction specifically induced bRG with canonical human bRG features in mice. Therefore, our data point to a common mechanism of bRG and BG generation, bearing implications to the role for these basal progenitors in the evolution of cortical folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23253.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23253.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23253.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer layer of the brain of a mammal, called the cortex, helps support mental abilities such as memory, attention and thought. In rodents, the cortex is smooth whereas in primates it is organized into folds. These folds increase the surface area of the brain and thus the number of neurons it can contain, which may in turn increase its processing power. Folding occurs as the brain develops in the womb. Specialized cells called basal or outer radial glia, which are more abundant in humans than in rodents, are believed to trigger the folding process.</p><p>Another area of the brain, called the cerebellum, is intricately folded in both rodents and humans. As the brain develops, cells within the cerebellum called Bergmann glia cause the tissue to fold. Bergmann glia and basal radial glia share a number of similarities, but it was not known whether the same molecular pathway might regulate both types of cell.</p><p>Now, Heng et al. show that Bergmann glia in the cerebellums of mice and basal radial glia in human cortex contain similar sets of active genes. Moreover, the molecular pathway that gives rise to Bergmann glia in mice is also active in the cortex of both mice and humans. However, it is much more active in humans, leading Heng et al. to speculate that high levels of activity in this pathway might give rise to basal radial glia. Consistent with this prediction, artificially activating the pathway at high levels in mouse cortex triggered the formation of basal radial glia in mice too. These results thus suggest that a common mechanism generates both types of glial cells involved in brain folding.</p><p>The work of Heng et al. lays the foundations for further studies into how these cells fold the brain and thus how they contribute to more complex mental abilities. Remaining questions to address are whether other species with Bergmann glia also have folded cerebellums, and whether incorrect development of basal radial glia in humans leads to disorders in which the cortex folds abnormally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23253.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23253.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>radial glia</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>ERK signaling</kwd><kwd>FGF signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH094914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>James YH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide transcriptional profiling and genetic analyses reveal conserved mechanisms underlying the generation of neocortical basal radial glia and cerebellar Bergmann glia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary expansion and elaboration of a gyrated neocortex underlie the complex cognition and development of intellect that characterize primates, especially humans. Emerging evidence suggests that differences in the type, abundance, and mode of division of neural stem and progenitor cells contribute to the diversity in the size and shape of the mammalian neocortex across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>). At the onset of neurogenesis, neuroepithelial cells (neural stem cells) become radial glia. These more committed neural progenitor cells reside in the ventricular zone (VZ) and are referred to as apical radial glia (aRG). Their apical processes are integrated into the ventricular surface while their basal fibers extend radially to the pial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). aRG generate neurons directly or indirectly via becoming intermediate progenitor cells (IPC) that occupy the subventricular zone (SVZ). In contrast to their limited proliferation potential in lissencephalic rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>), IPC undergo multiple rounds of self-renewing division in species with enlarged and folded neocortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gertz et al., 2014</xref>). The increased proliferation of IPC expands the SVZ, which is subdivided into inner and outer compartments in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Smart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zecevic et al., 2005</xref>). The outer SVZ may be responsible for the increased number of upper-layer neurons and thus the tangential expansion of neocortical surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent advances in cell labeling and imaging have identified other basal progenitors in addition to IPC. At mid-neurogenesis, some aRG selectively lose their apical processes and move their soma to the outer SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martínez-Martínez et al., 2016</xref>). These newly generated basal radial glia (bRG, also called outer radial glia) are abundantly present in gyrencephalic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>) but are relatively rare in the lissencephalic mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). It has thus been speculated that bRG expansion is responsible for the emergence and evolution of cortical convolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geschwind and Rakic, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borrell and Götz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>). However, the direct link of bRG to cortical gyrification remains unclear because bRG abundance does not correlate with either gyrification or the phylogeny of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Moreno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hevner and Haydar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelava et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, genetic manipulations of a number of intrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ju et al., 2016b</xref>) or signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) enhance the generation of bRG as well as IPC. In some of these experiments, expansion of these basal progenitors resulted in the folding of the mouse neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the importance of bRG and IPC in cortical convolution. Yet little is known about the molecular events that specifically control the transition of aRG into bRG. This information is crucial to our understanding of the molecular basis for the greater abundance of bRG in gyrencephalic than in lissencephalic cortices. It is also important to determine the precise contribution of bRG, relative to IPC, to cortical gyrification.</p><p>In amniotes, the folding of the cerebellar cortex results in the formation of an elaborate set of folia similar to neocortical gyri. More extensive folding of the cerebellar cortex correlates with more complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iwaniuk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lisney et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). From sharks to primates, the cerebellum and neocortex grow regularly and disproportionately to the rest of the brain, with the extent of gyrification reflecting the size of these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yopak et al., 2010</xref>). These observations suggest that folding of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex is an evolutionary adaptation that allowed the enlargement of brain surface area and thereby the accommodation of more complex functions. Expansion of the granule cell precursors that reside in the external granule layer (EGL) is thought to be the primary driver of cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). However, emerging evidence suggests that the interaction between BG and basement membrane is important for cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belvindrah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mills et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). We recently discovered that the deletion of <italic>Ptpn11,</italic> which codes for the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, blocks BG formation and cerebellar foliation, whereas EGL proliferation remains relatively normal in perinatal mouse cerebella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of a constitutively active Mek1 (Map2k1), Mek1<sup>DD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowley et al., 1994</xref>), which specifically activates ERK, rescues both cerebellar foliation and BG generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2011</xref>), demonstrating the critical role of ERK signaling in BG induction and the essential role of BG in cerebellar foliation. Similar to the cytogenesis of bRG, nascent BG are derived from cerebellar aRG between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and E17.5, again by selectively losing their apical processes and relocating their soma to a basal position (but in this case to the prospective Purkinje cell layer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yuasa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yamada and Watanabe, 2002</xref>). These nascent BG continue to proliferate until postnatal day (P) seven when they exit the cell cycle and become mature BG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parmigiani et al., 2015</xref>). After their induction, BG express neural stem cell markers, such as Sox2, Sox9, and Tnc through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sottile et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock and Sottile, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koirala and Corfas, 2010</xref>). The increase and rearrangement of BG basal fibers are associated with dramatic expansion of the cerebellar cortex and fissure formation in perinatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). Several bRG-signature genes, such as <italic>TNC</italic>, <italic>FABP7,</italic> and <italic>PTPRZ1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), are also well-known BG markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yuasa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>). These observations raise the question whether the formation of bRG and BG is controlled by related mechanisms involving ERK signaling.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the hypothesis that conserved mechanisms regulate the transition of aRG to BG in the cerebellum, and to bRG in the neocortex. We first established the transcriptomic profile of nascent BG in the mouse cerebellum, and then compared the molecular features of BG to those of human bRG that were recently identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Given the crucial role of ERK signaling in the aRG-to-BG transition in the mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2014</xref>), we analyzed and compared the ERK signaling activity in cortical aRG during human and mouse corticogenesis. Finally, we tested whether activation of ERK induced bRG in the mouse neocortex. Our findings demonstrate that BG and bRG not only share similar molecular features, but also related molecular mechanisms in their generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>bRG-specific genes are enriched in BG</title><p>Using single-cell RNA-seq, two groups have independently identified specific molecular markers of bRG in human fetal neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Using a new computational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2015</xref>), we identified the consensus signatures for bRG based on the published single-cell RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our analysis confirmed most of the reported bRG markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>) and identified additional ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Inspection of in situ hybridization data of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas revealed that more than half (51.5%, n = 66) of these bRG-signature gene orthologs were specifically or highly expressed in BG of mouse cerebellum at P56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). By contrast, only 2.2% and 4.5% of two randomly selected gene groups were detected in BG (n = 44 and 46, Fisher's exact test, p&lt;0.001, see Method section for details of unbiased expression analysis). Inspection of the Allen Mouse Developmental Brain revealed that many bRG markers appeared to be expressed in BG of the mouse cerebellum at P4 when immature BG were relatively easy to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In agreement with RNA in situ hybridization data, immunofluorescence revealed that Hopx, a specific bRG marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), was co-localized with the BG marker Fabp7 (also known as BLBP) and Sox2, in the mouse cerebellum at E14.5 and E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As Hopx, Fabp7 and Sox2, like many other BG markers, are also expressed in the VZ, we define BG as those triple labeled cells that have delaminated from the VZ at E14.5 or those reside in the Purkinje cell layer with radial fibers in the molecular layer.

WGCNA can elucidate the higher-order relationships between genes based on their coexpression relationships and thus allows the delineation of modules – groups of genes with highly correlated expression patterns, which represent biologically related genes or cell-type-specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lui et al., 2014</xref>). A coexpression module that was enriched for the 117 BG-specific genes was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In agreement with our prediction, the BG-module eigengene values, which summarize the overall expression profile of genes in a module (the first principal component) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>), gradually increased from E12.5 to E14.5, was significantly lower in <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO cerebella than the control at each stage, and became comparable between <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO; <italic>Map2k1</italic> and WT cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). BG-module hub genes (those most highly connected within the module) were enriched for functions in stem cell development and Map2k1-ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in agreement with the critical role of this signaling pathway in the generation of BG as presumptive neural progenitors in the cerebellum. 98 of the 117 BG-specific genes identified by the intersection-of-list approach were included in the 334 BG-module hub genes, suggesting that WGCNA discovers additional BG-enriched genes that are missed by the intersection-of-list method. Indeed, we identified additional 29 genes that are apparently expressed in BG at P56 according to the Allen Mouse Brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).</p><p>We then compare the high-confidence BG-specific genes with bRG-signature markers with three statistical methods. Hypergeometric distribution revealed significantly overlap between BG module hub genes and bRG markers (p=1.39 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) showed that bRG marker genes were significantly down-regulated in <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO cerebella at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

Among the 21 E14.5 mouse and 13 GW13–18 human aRG samples included in these independent studies, there was a close similarity among samples of the same species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the other hand, there was a significant positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> = 0.85, p=1 × 10<sup>−200</sup>) between the mean expression levels in mouse and human aRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), demonstrating the compatibility of the mouse and human datasets. The percentages of up and down regulated genes in the human and mouse samples were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Across a panel (n = 56) of pan-aRG markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lui et al., 2014</xref>), 37.9% were up-regulated (17.3% down) in human aRG whereas 44.8% were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated the absence of systematic bias between the two species in gene expression measurements by RNA-seq. The mRNA levels of FGF-readout genes (<italic>SPRY1, SPRY2, SPRY4,</italic> and <italic>ETV5</italic>) and of all seven ERK early-response genes were significantly higher in humans than those in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), the hedgehog readout gene <italic>Gli1</italic> (but not <italic>Ptch1</italic>) was moderately increased in human versus mouse aRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To analyze pathways differentially enriched in either human or mouse aRG, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). In agreement with earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Florio et al., 2015</xref>), GSEA showed that the gene sets significantly enriched in human aRG contain genes encoding hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix components, extracellular matrix receptors, and integrin signaling, whereas those enriched in mouse aRG are involved in transcription, translation, DNA replication, and the citric acid cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4A</xref>). Among the most highly enriched genes in human aRG were early-response genes induced by ERK (NES = 2.06, FDR = 0.001) and BG-module genes (NES = 1.91, FDR = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4A</xref>).

This result demonstrated that most <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced bRG were highly proliferative. To determine whether the induced bRG were capable to undergo multiple rounds of self-renewing divisions, a hallmark of basal progenitors in primate neocortex, embryos were electroporated at E14.5 and then treated with the thymidine analogues 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and 5-ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) at E16.5 and E17.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

This method has been extensively used to analyze symmetric versus asymmetric cell division in neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). We found that in transfected cells isolated from the cortex 48 hr after electroporation most <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-expressing cells underwent symmetric division to generate two Fabp7<sup>+</sup> daughter cells (data not shown). At 72 hr after electroporation, all three possible cell division types were present among the GFP<sup>+</sup> <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-expressing doublets: bRG-bRG (Fabp7-Fabp7), bRG-neuron (Fabp7-Tubb3), and neuron-neuron (Tubb3-Tubb3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Most of the <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-expressing doublets underwent proliferative division (Fabp7-Fabp7) either from the upper (80.0%) or the lower (70.2%, including the SVZ and VZ) part of the cortex, in contrast to the predominantly neurogenic division (Tubb3-Tubb3, 64.5%) of the GFP-only-expressing doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Collectively, our data show that expression of Mek1<sup>DD</sup> induces bRG-like cells that have extensive self-renewing and neurogenic potential.</p><p>To follow the fate of the induced bRG, markers of cortical neurons were examined in P3 cortices. In brains transfected with GFP alone, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were arranged uniformly in the upper layer and expressed Satb2 (layer II-IV neurons), but not the deep-layer neuronal markers Tbr1 and Ctip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and data not shown). Many <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-transfected cells with strong GFP also expressed Satb2 but they were arranged instead in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), in agreement with the clonal expansion of the induced bRG observed at the earlier stages and the subsequent formation of Satb2<sup>+</sup> cells from the bRG. Although increased numbers of astrocytes marked by Gfap were detected in the area containing <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-transfected cells compared to non-transfected area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), GFP-labeled <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-tranfected cells in the P3 neocortex were mostly devoid of Gfap and the oligoglial markers Olig2 and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and data not shown). At P7, however, some <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-expressing cells with low-level GFP expression were positive for Gfap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that the induced bRG are multipotent. Despite the ectopic bRG induction, <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> did not cause folding of the cortex (n = 10). Together, our data show that <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced bRG have extensive proliferation capacity and give rise to both neurons and astrocytes.

With this procedure, only cerebellar aRG, which line the ventricular zone surface and contact with DNA solution injected into the fourth ventricle, are transfected. In WT cerebellar slices after 24 or 48 hr of in vitro culture, aRG transfected with GFP formed BG, which were identified by markers (Fabp7 and Sox9) and the unipolar morphology of the cells, and non-BG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Using differential gene expression and coexpression studies based on RNA-seq, we establish the molecular features of mouse nascent BG, and show the remarkably similarity between human bRG and mouse BG in their molecular characteristics. Through transcriptome analysis and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that heightened ERK signaling is associated with the timely formation of endogenous bRG in the mouse cortex, while stronger ERK activity in cortical aRG is linked to the abundance of bRG in the human compared to mouse cortex. We show that the activation of the FGF-ERK-ETV axis that is important for BG formation induces multipotent bRG, which display canonical human bRG gene markers and extensive proliferative capacity, in the mouse neocortex. Our results have revealed surprising parallels in the transition of aRG to bRG in the neocortex, and aRG to BG in the cerebellum.</p><p>By taking advantage of the specific loss of BG in <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO and the rescue of BG in <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO;<italic>Map2k1</italic> cerebella, we used RNA-seq to examine the transcriptome of the cerebella with and without BG at the stages before and after BG induction. Using conventional differential expression analysis and WGCNA, we identified putative markers for nascent BG. The validation of these markers was mostly carried out by inspection of expression data of Allen Mouse Brain. Because of the inherent difficulty to assign cell-type specific expression based on in situ hybridization, the gene expression analysis was performed by an examiner who was blinded to the gene symbol and the origin of the gene list. We showed that candidate gene lists that were produced by the two statistical methods were both significantly enriched in BG in P56 mouse cerebellum compared to randomly generated gene lists. One potential caveat is that BG gene expression may be dynamic during development. However, interrogation of BG-specific expression in the Allen Mouse Developmental Brain and GenePaint has revealed that many BG markers, such as <italic>Fabp7</italic>, <italic>Hopx</italic>, <italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Ptprz1</italic>, <italic>Slc1a3</italic> and <italic>Tnc</italic> are expressed in both nascent and mature BG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Another caveat is that our strategy would likely identify downstream targets of the Ptpn11-ERK pathway, which may also be involved in development of non-BG cells in the cerebellum. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis will help clarify the definite markers for nascent BG.</p><p><italic>Ptpn11</italic> and other components of the FGF-ERK pathway play a multifaceted roles in the progression of neural progenitors, including the timely transition from neuroepithelial cells to aRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sahara and O'Leary, 2009</xref>), from aRG to IPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kang et al., 2009</xref>), from proliferative to neurogenic self-renewing aRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dee et al., 2016</xref>), and from neurogenic to gliogenic aRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gauthier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ke et al., 2007</xref>). After their broad expression in the cerebellar primordium at E10.5, the transcripts of <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> disappear, except for the region near the mid-hindbrain junction, by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2014</xref>), but re-appear in cerebellar aRG at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), following the robust expression of pERK in these cells at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While <italic>Ptpn11</italic> deletion does not change the transcription of <italic>Etv4</italic> and <italic>Etv5</italic> at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2014</xref>), neither gene is expressed in the cerebellar anlage of <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO embryos after E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This suggests that activation of ERK-ETV in cerebellar aRG at E13.5 but not before is essential for BG induction. In the current study, we have extended our previous findings by showing that the expression of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic>, or <italic>Etv5</italic> cell-autonomously rescues BG in <italic>Ptpn11</italic>-cKO cerebella at E13.5. Coincidentally, strong ERK signaling is present in the VZ starting at E13.5 to at least E16.5, matching closely with the onset and duration of BG generation from the VZ. These results demonstrate that heightened ERK signaling activity in cerebellar aRG controls the timely aRG-to-BG transition. In parallel with the BG induction, intensified pERK in cortical aRG correlates with the formation of endogenous bRG in the mouse cortex at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–I</xref>), whereas the hyperactivation of the ERK signaling induces ectopic bRG at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Therefore, the intensification of ERK signaling controls the timely transition of aRG to BG in the cerebellum, and to bRG in the neocortex. How ERK signaling controls the formation of BG and bRG is currently unknown. Previous studies have shown that increasing the horizontal division, in which the cleavage furrow is parallel to the ventricular surface, contributes to the generation of bRG in both the human and mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">LaMonica et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martínez-Martínez et al., 2016</xref>). As it has been shown that the ERK pathway determines mitotic spindle orientation epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tang et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that ERK signaling controls the generation of BG and bRG by regulating the spindle orientation. On the other hand, the transformation of aRG into bRG resembles the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>), a developmental process that is regulated by the FGF-ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lamouille et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies will be needed to determine whether FGF-ERK signaling promotes the transition from aRG to BG or bRG similarly to the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and/or by regulating spindle orientation.</p><p>A previous study showed that <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> or <italic>Etv5</italic> in E15.5 mouse neocortex enhances the generation of proliferative Fabp7<sup>+</sup> cells, but no other bRG markers were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2012</xref>). The authors concluded that these Fabp7<sup>+</sup> cells are astrocyte precursors because 20–25% of the transfectants become astrocytes at P22 and P60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Although we detected supernumerary Gfap+ cells in cortical region with <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> transfection, many of the Gfap+ astrocytes were not colocalized with EGFP, which marked <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> transfection, at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because EGFP expression was rapidly diminished during the successive division of the induced bRG, we were uncertain whether the transfection of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cell autonomously or non-autonomously induced astrocytes. In the current study, we showed that forced expression of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> induced neurogenic progenitor with remarkably high proliferation and self-renewing potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, these progenitors express many canonical human bRG markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Importantly, Pax6, which is not linked to astroglial lineage, was maintained in <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced bRG at least to E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In basal progenitors (including IPCs and bRG), persistent Pax6 expression is a hallmark of the primate neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mo and Zecevic, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, sustained Pax6 expression is sufficient to expand IPC and bRG-like cells in the mouse neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, we show that the expression of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> primarily induced bRG, whereas IPC marker Eomes was mostly absent from <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although the expansion of bRG-like cells and IPC through various genetic manipulations has previously been reported, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the specific induction of primate-like bRG in the mouse neocortex. Together, our data strongly suggest that activation of the FGF-ERK-ETV cascade is involved in the induction of bRG in the mouse neocortex.</p><p>In any given species, the relative abundance of bRG can be attributed, at least partially, to the bRG-forming competence of aRG and/or to the self-expansion potential of bRG. We demonstrated that FGF-ERK-ETV activity is lower in the mouse than in the human neocortical aRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), and that activation of this axis is sufficient to induce bRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). These observations indicate that a higher level of FGF-ERK-ETV activity in aRG contributes to the greater abundance of bRG in humans than in mice. Comparative epigenetic profiling of human, rhesus macaque, and mouse corticogenesis has shown that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements with activity in humans are enriched in the modules of coexpressed genes belonging to the FGF and TGFβ pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reilly et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with these findings, our coexpression network analysis revealed significant divergence in FGF-ERK and BMP signaling pathways in human and mouse corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, gene regulation changes that are specific to the human lineage modify corticogenesis in humans, in part by enhancing FGF-ERR signaling activity in aRG leading to expansion of bRG. Gain-of-function mutations of <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>FGFR3</italic> cause Apert syndrome and thanatophoric dysplasia, which are characterized by unique and complex malformation of the cortex, including megalencephaly and polymicrogyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hevner, 2005</xref>). Moreover, mutations of the genes of the ERK signaling cascade have been implicated in neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous (NCFC) syndromes that include an abnormal size and gyrification of the neocortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Samuels et al., 2009</xref>). Our new findings imply that abnormal bRG development may contribute to the pathologies of the human neocortex that are caused by aberrant FGF-ERK function.</p><p>Despite the similarity in their generation, BG do not produce neurons during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parmigiani et al., 2015</xref>), unlike bRG in the human cortex. Although the <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced bRG possess extensive proliferative self-renewing potential, no dramatic increase in cortical neurons was observed in neocortex transfected with <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>. Furthermore, both the endogenous and Mek1<sup>DD</sup>-induced bRG are distributed in both the SVZ and the cortical plate in the mouse cortex rather than being restricted to the outer SVZ as described in the primate cortex. Therefore, additional intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors may be required for the neurogenic potential and localization of human bRG. Comparative studies in human, ferret, and mouse have shown that the neocortical basal progenitors of humans exhibit a greater neuronal lineage commitment and degree of differentiation, partially through the activity of proneural genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the forced expression of proneural genes, such as <italic>Ascl1</italic>, <italic>Neurog2</italic>, and <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, can reprogram glial cells to neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Masserdotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Further studies are required to determine whether the expression of proneural genes enhances the neurogenic potential of BG in the cerebellum or <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic>-induced bRG in the mouse neocortex.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Mek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> specifically expands bRG but fails to induce folding of the mouse neocortex. These findings are in agreement with the notion that an abundance of bRG is necessary, but insufficient, for gyrencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hevner and Haydar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kelava et al., 2012</xref>). Rather, increased neuronal output through the expansion of other basal progenitors together with bRG may be necessary for folding of the neocortex. A notable parallel may be cerebellar foliation, in which the important role played by the proliferation of granule cell precursors has been well documented. For example, functional alterations of Shh, which promotes granule cell precursor proliferation in the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahmane and Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999</xref>), have been linked to the extent of cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corrales et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>). Interestingly, hedgehog signaling also promotes the development of BG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahmane and Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleming et al., 2013</xref>) and bRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest that the hedgehog and FGF-ERK signaling pathways act in concert to promote neuronal output via IPC or granule cell precursors as well as to expand bRG and BG populations in the evolution of a convoluted neocortical and cerebellar cortex, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse and tissue preparation</title><p>Husbandry of mice was carried out according to guidelines approved by the University of Connecticut.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Robb Krumlauf as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study from Victor Li's group has been thoroughly reviewed by three experts in the field. The study is appreciated for both the comprehensive analysis of gene expression and the analysis of the function of the ERK pathway in genesis of bRG cells. However, there are major concerns regarding the validity of some of the markers, due to method of presentation of the validation data and/or the way in which the validation experiments were done. Since it is the use of these markers that is fundamental to much of the interpretations and the major conclusions, the authors need to address the major concerns regarding the markers. They must also address the other major criticisms raised by the reviewers, several of which cite common concerns. In addition to validation of the markers, they need to show better images of electroporated cells so that one can interpret their morphology and identity, to cite the appropriate ages for each RNA sample and age for validation, to justify use of markers that are expressed more broadly than e.g. only in bRG, etc. In addition, the authors should address the issues raised regarding proper citations throughout the manuscript, and comment more substantively regarding previous and conflicting studies, e.g. the last two major comments by reviewer #3. Many comments can be addressed by rewriting parts of the manuscript, but others might require additional experiments, depending upon whether e.g. tissue can be re-imaged and/or restained for better presentation of marker validation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting paper that explores the gene expression signatures and signaling pathways shared between Bergmann glia in the cerebellum and basal or outer radial glia in the neocortex. Both cell types are glial-like, and BG have been shown by the authors to be critical for folding of the cerebellum, and bRG have been suggested to regulate gyrification in the primate cortex. Thus, although BG do not produce neurons, the comparison is highly relevant. The authors indeed find that many bRG-specific genes also appear to be expressed in BG, and that ERK signaling regulates bRG, as they had previously shown for BG. The results are highly relevant the data in general is of high quality.</p><p>I nevertheless have several concerns that need to be addressed, mainly related to interpretation of the data and lack of clarity. One general point is that the authors use the term BG very loosely to mean what is likely a population of several cell types, some being dividing precursors and some being mature postmitotic BG, and each might be distinct at different stages. The second is that throughout the paper the authors do not clarify what age the gene expression analysis is from, and discuss whether it is relevant to mix and match early embryonic and postnatal stages. Finally, it is not clear how the authors assign their number system for expression in the BG layer, in what they think are BG cells alone, or BG and Purkinje cells. Double labeling for critical markers would be very valuable. Also, the authors should determine whether the cells in the BG layer that express the markers are dividing precursors, and whether the markers are expressed at all stages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Heng and colleagues use previously published RNA-Seq data and novel bioinformatics to describe the gene expression typifying neocortical basal radial glia (bRG) and cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG). This study shows quite clearly that a set of genes highly enriched in nascent BG are also present in bRG and furthermore that their apical RG and EGC precursors likely share gene expression profiles. In addition, through comparative studies between mouse and human datasets, the authors demonstrate that ERK signaling is particularly enriched in aRG during their transition to bRG and BG in both mouse and human, but that ERK expression is much more highly expressed in human development. Their studies where forced higher ERK signaling in mouse aRG lead to higher production of bRG clearly support the biological significance of their findings. The study reaches some important conclusions alongside this important gene expression profiling, including that increased bRG are not sufficient to induce folding or gyrification in the mouse neocortex, as has previously been suggested. Overall, the manuscript is very well written, save for a few typographical errors that I am sure the editorial staff can identify. In fact, this is the best-crafted study I have reviewed all year, and I mean to include 2016 with that as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Heng and colleagues identifies molecular commonalities between bRG cells in the embryonic cerebral cortex, important for cortical folding, and Bergman Glia cells in the developing cerebellum, important for cerebellar folding. They identify the ERK pathway as potentially important to regulate the formation of these two cell types, and then perform functional experiments and additional transcriptomic meta-analyses to test their hypothesis. They conclude that activation of the FGF-ERK-Etv pathway is important for the formation of bRG and BG cells, and hence for the expansion and folding of these two tissues. The hypothesis is fascinating and the topic timely, the experiments well planned and executed, and the results nicely explained.
