Genomic approaches like family studies or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can help in this quest for causal processes by exposing genes that are mutated before disease onset. For finding causal processes, studying the genome is advantageous because the chronology from genomic variant to disease is unambiguous, providing a stronger argument for causality than when studying the transcriptome or epigenome. In theory, all we need to do after a genomic study is follow the thread from each gene to the biological process in which it is involved. We know from the genomic study that this process increased or reduced risk when it was altered by mutations in the gene, so modulating more forcefully the process with a drug may unlock a larger therapeutic benefit. In practice, the path from genomic variant to druggable process is far from straightforward.</p><p>Research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exemplifies well both the challenge and benefit of translating genomic studies into druggable biological processes. Family studies of early-onset AD in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schellenberg et al., 1992</xref>) identified causal mutations in amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Levy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Van Broeckhoven et al., 1990</xref>), presenilin 1 (<italic>PSEN1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campion et al., 1995</xref>), and presenilin 2 (<italic>PSEN2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rogaev et al., 1995</xref>). Subsequent work demonstrated that amyloid beta (Aβ), a small peptide which forms aggregates in the brains of AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glenner and Wong, 1984</xref>), was generated by cleavage of APP by γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haass and Selkoe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shoji et al., 1992</xref>), of which the catalytic subunit is PSEN1 or PSEN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Strooper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, the field naturally converged on the amyloid hypothesis of AD, which posits that the disease is caused by toxic aggregates of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</xref>). Today, antibodies against Aβ such as lecanemab show promise in slowing down disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">van Dyck et al., 2023</xref>). This story shows that, although a great challenge, genomic studies (family studies of early-onset AD) can be successfully translated into a causal process (Aβ aggregation) that is now targeted by disease-modifying drugs (lecanemab).</p><p>However, the beneficial effects from targeting Aβ aggregation currently remain modest despite substantial reductions in brain amyloid burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">van Dyck et al., 2023</xref>). To completely stop disease progression, anti-amyloid therapy will likely need to be combined with drugs modulating other processes that contribute to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardy and Mummery, 2023</xref>). GWAS have identified tens of genomic loci where sequence variation is associated with late-onset AD, offering an opportunity to discover new causal processes of AD that potentially go beyond the amyloid hypothesis. For example, analysis of cell types enriched for open chromatin at AD-associated loci pointed to a possible critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and microglia in AD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tansey et al., 2018</xref>). Although GWAS are designed to generate new hypotheses, AD-associated loci have rarely been exploited to find new causal processes in an unbiased, systematic manner. Given the challenges inherent to linking genomic variants to causal biological events, new genomic associations are often first more narrowly interpreted in the context of the amyloid hypothesis. While this interpretation may be correct, it tends to create a self-fulfilling prophecy which leaves little room for the discovery of new causal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellenguez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kroll, 2022a</xref>).</p><p>As AD is primarily a disease of old age, research often focuses on patients or animal models after disease onset. However, this approach hinders the discovery of new <italic>causal</italic> processes from genomic studies because it largely annuls the advantage of unambiguous chronology—since genomic variants were unambiguously present before disease onset, they must have modulated a process which contributed causally to disease initiation. In patients or animals after disease onset, many biological processes are disrupted, but only a small proportion may be genuinely causal for future disease progression and therefore make suitable targets for disease-modifying therapies. For example, one may find that dopamine is lacking in the basal ganglia of patients and animal models of Parkinson’s disease. Treatment with levodopa, a dopamine precursor, temporarily relieves motor symptoms, but does not slow down disease progression, so dopamine deficiency is not in fact a causal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Verschuur et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, perhaps counterintuitively, studying the consequences of AD-associated mutations <italic>early</italic> in life seems more likely to identify processes that are genuinely causal to disease, as any disrupted process is less likely to be a secondary disease consequence.</p><p>In practice, how can we quickly follow the thread from a disease-associated gene to a (druggable) biological process in which it is involved? In this work, we describe a behavioural pharmacology approach using zebrafish larvae. Our strategy compares the behavioural profile of knockout zebrafish to a behavioural dataset of wild-type animals exposed to thousands of small molecules to predict causal processes and potential compounds that rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref>). In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>), we introduced the use of zebrafish F0 knockouts to study complex traits such as behaviour. In this study, we demonstrate how the F0 knockout method renders this behavioural pharmacology approach fast and scalable to the parallel study of tens of disease-associated genes, rather than one at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashlin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoffman et al., 2016</xref>). As genomic studies of AD can likely be further exploited to find causal processes, we used Alzheimer’s risk genes as a case study for our strategy. The strategy is not specific to any one disease or set of genes. In theory, any measurable change in behaviour could be used to predict the underlying causal pathways and small molecules that normalise this change.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Most Alzheimer’s risk genes are present in zebrafish and expressed early in development</title><p>GWAS point to small portions of the genome where variation in sequence is associated with variation in disease risk but do not readily specify the genes whose altered function are responsible for this association. Therefore, as a starting point, we used a meta-analysis of GWAS on AD that found 37 significant loci and annotated each with the most likely causal gene using mainly statistical colocalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schwartzentruber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giambartolomei et al., 2014</xref>). To add confidence to these calls, we cross-referenced these causal gene predictions with a transcription-wide association study and risk gene transcripts that undergo differential splicing in AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we included the three genes that can cause early-onset AD when mutated: <italic>PSEN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campion et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>PSEN2 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rogaev et al., 1995</xref>), and <italic>APP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Levy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Van Broeckhoven et al., 1990</xref>), yielding a list of 40 genes associated with AD risk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Of these 40 Alzheimer’s risk genes, 30 (75%) had at least one annotated orthologue in the zebrafish genome (source: Ensembl).

These parameters capture both behaviours that unfold over multiple minutes or hours, such as sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and actions at smaller time scales (&lt;1 s), such as individual swimming bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The parameters are grouped into three categories: activity parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), which describe the overall activity of each larva during a complete day or night; active bout parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which describe the structure of individual swimming bouts; and sleep parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) such as sleep latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). In zebrafish larvae, sleep is defined as any period of inactivity (Δ pixel = 0) lasting longer than 1 min, a definition based on increases in arousal threshold and homeostatic rebound following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rihel et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). This frame-by-frame analysis has several advantages over previous methods that analysed activity data at the 1-min resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rihel et al., 2010b</xref>). First, individual swimming bouts could not be resolved by these methods as single bouts last ~0.2 s on average. Second, the 1-min methods missed around one third of all sleep bouts because of how the Δ pixel data is binned in 1-min epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). At the frame-by-frame resolution, the start and end frame of each sleep bout can be precisely determined, which also improves the measurement accuracy of sleep bout duration and sleep latency, the delay from lights-off to first sleep bout. For example, during a sample 10 hr night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), the frame-by-frame analysis detected 35 ± 14 more sleep bouts, longer average sleep bout lengths (+0.2 ± 0.2 min), and shorter sleep latencies (1.6 ± 2.3 min earlier), resulting in a 42% increase in total sleep time (+2.3 ± 0.4 hr). During the day, the FramebyFrame analysis also detected more sleep and more sleep bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>).

It also performs the last cleavage of APP to release Aβ, which aggregates in the brains of patients with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haass and Selkoe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Strooper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kang et al., 1987</xref>). Do presenilins also cleave zebrafish Appa/Appb into Aβ? Using a sensitive ELISA-based assay, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detectable in control (uninjected and scrambled-injected) larvae but not in two clutches of <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), confirming that zebrafish Psen1 is required for the cleavage of Appa/Appb into Aβ. In contrast, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detectable in <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts, suggesting that most Aβ is generated by Psen1 in zebrafish and that Psen2 alone cannot compensate. This result extends previous findings that Aβ production in zebrafish is blocked by the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Özcan et al., 2022</xref>) and matches closely observations in mice, in which loss of PSEN2 had no measurable effect on Aβ40/42 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frånberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herreman et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In mice, knockout of <italic>Psen1</italic>, but not of <italic>Psen2</italic>, causes severe skeletal malformations and brain haemorrhages, likely because of impaired Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herreman et al., 1999</xref>).

Morphologically, our <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockout larvae developed normally (tested up to 16 dpf) and were indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings, as observed in a <italic>psen1</italic> stable knockout line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sundvik et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae had a mild pigmentation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>), which has been previously reported in a <italic>psen2</italic> stable knockout line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). This difference suggests a specific function of Psen2 in melanophore development or function which cannot be fulfilled by Psen1. We also generated <italic>psen1</italic>/<italic>psen2</italic> double F0 knockouts but most were lethal early in development (~5 dpf) with severe defects in eye development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), in which the retinal pigment epithelium appeared patchy and some larvae developed oedema around the eye. The tail was severely curved outwards, in exactly the same way as larvae treated with a high dose of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Incidentally, <italic>Psen1</italic> knockout mice also display defects in the axial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shen et al., 1997</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that zebrafish presenilins are more readily capable of compensating each other during development than in mice, as only double <italic>psen1</italic>/<italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae showed a severe morphological phenotype.</p><p>We next video-tracked two clutches of <italic>psen1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae over multiple day-night cycles and applied our frame-by-frame analysis to detect behavioural phenotypes over long and short timescales. The loss of Psen1 only had mild effects on behaviour. At night, <italic>psen1</italic> F0 knockout larvae slept slightly less (−8% vs. scrambled, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and instead spent more time active than control injected siblings (+22%), mainly because they performed more swimming bouts (+20%). The <italic>psen1</italic> knockouts also showed a slightly reduced startle response at lights-off (−4%), in line with some data obtained from stable <italic>psen1</italic> knockout larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sundvik et al., 2013</xref>). Behaviour during the day was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts of both clutches were substantially less active than controls during the day (total activity: −26% vs. scrambled, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>), performing both fewer (−17%) and more subdued swimming bouts (active bout mean: −12%). <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts also slept more during the day than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>), both spending more time asleep (+178%) and initiating more frequent sleep bouts (+150%). Loss of Psen2 did not strongly affect night-time behaviour. In summary, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae were substantially less active and sleeping more than controls during the day.</p><p>Since <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were less pigmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>), we tested whether the reduction in activity could be an artefact due to fainter detection by the camera. We extracted the maximum Δ pixel value each larva reached during the startle response at lights off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). These vigorous swimming bouts can displace the whole larva in a tenth of a second, providing a measure of how many dark pixels are detectable for each larva. <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae indeed displaced fewer pixels during the startle response than scrambled-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>, clutch 1: <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts displaced 78 ± 10 pixels vs. 82 ± 8 pixels for scrambled-injected controls, clutch 2: 71 ± 8 pixels vs 80 ± 8 pixels). We then downscaled the Δ pixel values of the scrambled-injected larvae proportionally to the ratio of the startle response means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c,d</xref>), akin to artificially making the scrambled-injected larvae appear less dark. Even after this adjustment, <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts were measurably less active and sleeping more during the day, although the parameter effect sizes were somewhat reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e</xref>). In summary, the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype reflects a genuine difference in behaviour.</p><p>Finally, we examined the impact of loss of both Appa and Appb. While overexpression of APP causes AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sleegers et al., 2006</xref>), knockout could point to roles of APP during brain development. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Özcan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Musa et al., 2001</xref>), zebrafish Appa and Appb are highly similar to human APP (64–68% identical amino acid sequence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>). We generated <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double F0 knockout larvae by mutating each gene at two loci, rather than three, to limit unviability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>). The CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs were highly mutagenic (across all four loci: 95.8 ± 7.0% mutated reads, 76.5 ± 21.7 of all reads had a frameshift mutation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c,d</xref>). The <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double F0 knockout larvae looked morphologically normal. Behaviourally, <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> double knockouts were less active during the day than control siblings (–14% vs. scrambled, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4e</xref>) and showed shorter swimming bouts across the day/night cycle (active bout duration during the day: –4%; at night: –3%). Sleep was not consistently affected by the loss of <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4f</xref>).</p><p>In summary, knockout larvae for the three genes associated with early-onset AD had distinct morphological and behavioural phenotypes, with the strongest behavioural changes observed for <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts. Since both presenilins are broadly expressed in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c,d</xref>), these results indicate that zebrafish Psen1- and Psen2-γ-secretases likely cleave different substrates, such as Appa/Appb which is primarily cleaved into Aβ by Psen1-γ-secretase. Moreover, the behavioural phenotypes of <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> and <italic>psen1</italic> knockout larvae had little overlap while they presumably both resulted in the loss of Aβ. The <italic>appa</italic>/<italic>appb</italic> day phenotype could be primarily caused by loss of some Appa/Appb cleavage product not relying on γ-secretase. Alternatively, the net effect of loss of all other Psen1-γ-secretase products could have masked the effect of loss of Aβ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Knockouts in all four tested late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes sleep less at night</title><p>To test whether knockout of genes associated with late-onset AD also impacted behaviour in larvae, we then generated F0 knockouts for the zebrafish orthologues of <italic>APOE</italic> (<italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic>), <italic>CD2AP</italic> (<italic>cd2ap</italic>), <italic>CLU</italic> (<italic>clu</italic>), and <italic>SORL1</italic> (<italic>sorl1</italic>).</p><p>APOE shares 22–25% amino acid identity with its two zebrafish orthologues, Apoea and Apoeb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

This slight hypoactivity is unlikely to reflect a motor defect because at night, <italic>apoea</italic>/<italic>apoeb</italic> knockouts performed more swimming bouts (+31%) and had less sleep (−7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>) than controls.</p><p>Knockout of other late-onset AD risk genes also impacted behaviour, especially at night.

While the two clutches of <italic>cd2ap</italic> F0 knockouts gave generally inconsistent results, knockout larvae of both clutches were more active (time active: +38%; total activity: +44% vs. scrambled) and slept less at night than control siblings (−13%), mainly because they performed more swimming bouts (+34%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Similarly, knockout of <italic>clu</italic> (39% identical amino acid sequence vs. human CLU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>) did not strongly affect behaviour during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c</xref>), despite a particularly high rate of frameshift mutations at all three targeted loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

At night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4d</xref>), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts spent more time active than control siblings (+20%), largely because their swimming bouts tended to last longer (+6%).

First, we used information from the Therapeutic Target Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) to annotate each compound with its indications (e.g. triprolidine is used to treat hay fever), targets (e.g. triprolidine targets the histamine H1 receptor), and the pathways it affects through its targets (e.g. triprolidine affects the ‘inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels’). Second, we converted the frame-by-frame behavioural fingerprint of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to the 1-min format used by the database. We then compared the mean <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout fingerprint with each small molecule behavioural fingerprint, creating a ranked list from the small molecule fingerprint most similar to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (SU6656: cosine similarity = 0.83) to the small molecule fingerprint most opposite to the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint (nitrocaramiphen HCl: cos = −0.78). Third, we tested using a custom permutation test whether specific indication, target, or pathway annotations were significantly enriched at the top and/or the bottom of the ranked list. More present among the small molecules most correlating and/or anti-correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint were drugs used to treat depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.049), targeting the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.015), and affecting the ‘serotonergic synapse’ pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>, simulated p-value = 0.027).

To test this hypothesis, we treated <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and controls with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2009</xref>). Citalopram binds the serotonin transporter SLC6A4, preventing the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. At a low dose of citalopram (1 µM, added directly to the fish water), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts and scrambled-injected controls reacted similarly, sleeping about 1.1 hr more during both day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast, at a higher dose of citalopram (10 µM), <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had a stronger reaction than their control siblings. For example, sleep during the day increased 2.5× in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts, while it only increased 2.2× in controls. The heightened sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to citalopram was also apparent when taking all parameters into account by measuring each larva’s Euclidean distance from the average H<sub>2</sub>O-treated sibling of same genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Indeed, 10 μM citalopram displaced the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae further from their behavioural baseline than it pushed controls from theirs. In a second experiment, we treated knockouts and controls with fluvoxamine maleate (10 µM), another commonly prescribed SSRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Omori et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had a weaker reaction to fluvoxamine than their control siblings, the opposite effect than for citalopram. For example, fluvoxamine doubled (2.1×) sleep bout length at night in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts but tripled it (3.4×) in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Measuring each larva’s Euclidean distance from its H<sub>2</sub>O-treated siblings confirmed the reduced sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to fluvoxamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). While it is surprising that the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae reacted oppositely to the two SSRIs, they reacted differently than control larvae in both cases, demonstrating that our behavioural pharmacology approach correctly predicted from behaviour alone that serotonin signalling was in some way altered in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts.</p><p>There are at least two ways <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could react differently to SSRIs. First, compared to wild types, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts could undergo a smaller or larger spike of serotonin in the synaptic cleft when reuptake is blocked. This may be because <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts synthesise serotonin at a different rate, either because they have a different number of serotonergic neurons or a different expression of the enzymes required to make serotonin; or because they do not produce the same amount of serotonin transporter, which would change their sensitivity to SSRIs as a given dose would inhibit a smaller or larger proportion of the transporter than in wild-type animals. Second, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts may have a different sensitivity to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have different densities of serotonin receptors.</p><p>To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we used HCR to label serotonergic neurons by tagging mRNA coding for tryptophan hydroxylases (in zebrafish: <italic>tph1a</italic>, <italic>tph1b</italic>, <italic>tph2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), an enzyme required for the synthesis of serotonin, and serotonin transporters by tagging <italic>slc6a4a</italic> and <italic>slc6a4b</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lillesaar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We registered the brain stacks to a common atlas (Zebrafish Brain Browser) and segmented them into 168 anatomical regions. In each region with expression, we counted the number of positive voxels and measured the total signal intensity in each channel (channel 1: <italic>tph1a + tph1b + tph2</italic>; channel 2: <italic>slc6a4a + slc6a4b</italic>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had slightly more (+2%) <italic>slc6a4a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> positive voxels than controls across regions, but this difference was not definite for any one region and not replicated when looking at total signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1f</xref>). <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts had on average 18% lower <italic>tph1a</italic>/<italic>1b</italic>/<italic>2</italic> signal intensities across regions, particularly in the hypothalamus (hypothalamus – caudal zone 1: –24%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). Incidentally, of 94 clusters from the 5-dpf scRNA-seq dataset, <italic>sorl1</italic> expression was highest in hypothalamic neurons enriched for <italic>tph1a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These small differences can help explain the reduced sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts to fluvoxamine, but do not explain the heightened sensitivity to citalopram. Additionally, at least one study did not find significant changes in serotonin levels in the striatum of <italic>SORL1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glerup et al., 2013</xref>), and we did not find genes related to serotonin signalling to be differentially expressed in a bulk RNA-seq dataset of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout zebrafish brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barthelson et al., 2020</xref>). Support for our first hypothesis is therefore not overwhelming. Alternatively, different levels of serotonin receptors on the post-synaptic neurons could also contribute.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>From behavioural fingerprint to candidate therapeutic: betamethasone rescues the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype</title><p>In addition to pointing to the disrupted pathways, behavioural pharmacology can also predict small molecules that may normalise mutant behavioural phenotypes by pointing to compounds that generate the opposite behavioural fingerprint in wild-type larvae.</p><p>Using this approach, we sought to identify compounds capable of normalising the behavioural alterations of <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts, such as the increased day-time sleep.

It rescued the swimming bout alterations (active bout parameters) during the day but not at night. Overall, the compound barely caused any side effects but only rescued a small aspect of the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout phenotype (9/18 altered parameters rescued). Fenoprofen performed worse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> middle, 8/18 altered parameters rescued), rescuing some of the swimming bout alterations during the day but aggravating them at night. Furthermore, fenoprofen worsened the day-time hypoactivity of <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae, causing sleep to increase further and activity to decrease. Strikingly, betamethasone completely resolved the excess day-time sleep without causing hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Betamethasone rescued most, but not all, of the swimming bout alterations during both the day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> right, 14/18 altered parameters rescued). Betamethasone did cause a few side effects, likely by making <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae overly aroused at the start of the night, extending sleep latency, steepening the slope in activity, and decreasing the startle response. Therefore, of the three drugs we selected using behavioural pharmacology, one almost completely normalised the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout phenotype, albeit with a few side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The F0 knockout and behavioural pharmacology approach successfully predicted the different sensitivity of <italic>sorl1</italic> mutants to serotonin drugs and identified a drug capable of normalising the <italic>psen2</italic> knockout behavioural phenotype.

Could disrupted sleep itself be a causal process in AD? AD patients often take longer to fall asleep, have higher sleep fragmentation, and spend sharply less time in NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Atri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Prinz et al., 1982</xref>). Sleep disruption can be present before the onset of cognitive deficits. For example, very high sleep fragmentation in elderly people is associated with subsequent diagnosis of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments on humans and animal models also point to disrupted sleep being a causal process in some cases. In healthy adults, one night of sleep deprivation was sufficient to cause a 25–30% increase in Aβ signal on PET scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018</xref>), a ~30% increase in CSF concentrations of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lucey et al., 2018</xref>), and a ~50% increase in CSF concentrations of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holth et al., 2019</xref>). In wild-type rats and in mice overexpressing mutated human <italic>APP</italic> and <italic>PSEN1</italic>, restricting sleep for 21 days increased Aβ deposits in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, pharmaceutically or chemogenetically consolidating sleep in AD mouse models for 1–2 months delayed Aβ plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jagirdar et al., 2021</xref>). Disrupted sleep is therefore likely to be a causal process in AD. Can it become a therapeutic target? An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04629547) is underway to test whether suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist that increases sleep, can reduce Aβ accumulation by consolidating sleep in older adults without dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herring et al., 2020</xref>). Our observation that disruption of genes associated with AD diagnosis after 65 years reduces sleep in 7-day zebrafish larvae suggest that disrupted sleep may be a common mechanism through which these genes exert an effect on risk. Impaired sleep early in life may be especially deleterious as it is likely essential for brain development: infants spend most of their time asleep during the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ednick et al., 2009</xref>). Incidentally, infants who carry the risk allele of <italic>APOE, ε4</italic>, show differences in grey matter volume and myelin content in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2014</xref>). Differences are also present in children 9–17 years old who carry the disease-causing <italic>PSEN1</italic> E280A mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Quiroz et al., 2015</xref>). In adults without dementia, higher genetic risk of AD correlate with some sleep phenotypes, sometimes as early as their early twenties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Muto et al., 2021</xref>). Future work should directly assess whether sleep is impaired in infants at higher genetic risk of AD and whether it is related to these brain structural differences.</p><p>Our behavioural pharmacology approach also predicted that loss of Sorl1 impaired serotonin signalling. <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts did respond differently to SSRIs, but the exact mechanism is unclear. SORL1 acts as an adaptor protein between retromer and several cargo proteins, such as APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jensen et al., 2023</xref>), GDNF receptor α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glerup et al., 2013</xref>), and glutamate receptor 1 (GLUA1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>). Retromer is a large protein complex which ‘rescues’ proteins from endosomes, targeting them to recycling instead of lysosomal digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burd and Cullen, 2014</xref>). By disrupting retromer function, mutations in SORL1 disrupt endosomal recycling, which appears as swelling of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mishra et al., 2023</xref>). As a result, APP remains in endosomes for longer, where it is more likely to be cleaved by β-secretase, the first step towards production of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Small and Petsko, 2015</xref>). Similarly, retromer dysfunction also lowers the level of GLUA1 receptors on the neuron membrane, likely because endocytosed receptors are not recycled back to the membrane, which can result in both increased or decreased firing rates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>). We speculate that some serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors are also recycled via retromer and SORL1. Consequently, <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts would react differently to a large spike in serotonin (SSRI treatment) as they have different levels of 5-HT receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. In support for this idea, both 5-HT type 4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joubert et al., 2004</xref>) and SORL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) interact with sorting nexin 27, a subunit of retromer. Incidentally, the 5-HT receptor type 4 was also an enriched target for <italic>sorl1</italic> (simulated p-value = 0.016). Other observations are consistent with serotonin signalling being a causal process of AD. For example, treatment of an AD mouse model with citalopram caused a rapid decrease in Aβ concentrations in the ISF and eventually reduced amyloid plaque load. Additionally, humans treated with SSRIs within the past 5 years had significantly lower cortical amyloid plaque load on PET scans, suggesting a causal relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cirrito et al., 2011</xref>). While much work remains to be done, SSRIs can generally be used safely for many years, so modulating serotonin signalling may be an attractive approach to reduce Aβ levels years before the onset of cognitive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cirrito et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations and future directions for predictive behavioural pharmacology</title><p>Currently, the hypotheses that our behavioural pharmacology approach can test are limited by the small molecule screen dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref>), which was biased towards specific themes and targets. For example, of 1552 compounds with an annotated target, 60 (3.9%) target the dopamine D2 receptor but only 1 (0.06%) targets mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP1, 2, 3). Consequently, the approach presumably has high sensitivity for disruptions in dopamine signalling, while some hypotheses, such as impairment in mitochondrial coupling, are never formally tested. Broadly, this means that a negative (non-significant) result may not be meaningful if the biological process in question is underrepresented. Additionally, about 30% of the annotated compounds in the database have more than one target. While this is not necessarily an issue when the goal is to find any small molecule which rescues the phenotype, this lack of specificity likely blurs the signal from modulation of a specific target to effect on behaviour. For example, all five compounds which target the histamine H4 receptor also target the histamine H3 receptor, so if the H3 receptor is detected as significantly enriched, the H4 receptor is certain to be significant too, regardless of whether the H4 receptor is indeed specifically disrupted. To develop the biological process prediction, future work should focus on selecting specific agonists and antagonists for a set list of targets, such as the compound VUF-6002 to selectively target the histamine H4 receptor without also activating H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Terzioglu et al., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, ZOLTAR could weigh the evidence for a target based on the compound’s affinity constant, such that a weak inhibitor (high Ki) could only contribute proportionally weak evidence for its target in the analysis.</p><p>A way to improve the specificity of the approach is to enhance the resolution of the behaviour tracking so that targets which give similar but unique effects on behaviour can be distinguished. We introduced the FramebyFrame R package to enable analysis at sub-second resolution, but the original small molecule screen dataset was collected at the 1-min resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref>), so comparing a new behavioural profile to the small molecule database first involves losing resolution to make the fingerprints comparable. During a new small molecule screen, one could use SLEAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pereira et al., 2022</xref>) or DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) to extract additional behavioural parameters from video recordings such as speed or position in the well. A faster and higher definition camera could be introduced to allow fine tracking of tail and eye movements. Exposing the larvae to various stimuli is also a way to increase the number of parameters while avoiding redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Myers-Turnbull et al., 2020</xref>). With more behavioural parameters, the prediction of therapeutics using behavioural pharmacology would also be more precise and the detection of possible behavioural side effects more thorough. Analytically, an improvement could be to represent larval behaviour as a sequence of movements, rather than parameter averages. For example, the Δ pixel time course from our experiments can be encoded as a sequence of bout types termed modules, themselves organised in motifs which are 2–20-module long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh and Rihel, 2020</xref>). Alternatively, behaviour could be represented as sequences of known types of swimming bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marques et al., 2018</xref>) or automatically discovered ‘syllables’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>). In mouse, this sequence representation was better than a fingerprint at differentiating similar compounds or even doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>), so should also improve the predictive power of the behavioural pharmacology approach.</p><p>This leads to a thought experiment: assuming absolute resolution in behaviour tracking, does every knockout give a unique effect on behaviour? In other words, are there ~26,000 distinct knockout fingerprints or do multiple genes converge on a smaller set of possible fingerprints? How much resolution is required to distinguish every possible fingerprint?</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we present a behavioural pharmacology approach which uses the sleep/wake behaviour of zebrafish larvae as a tool to translate genomic findings into druggable biological processes and candidate therapeutics.

The embryos were then raised in 10 cm Petri dishes filled with fish water (0.3 g/L Instant Ocean) in a 28.5 ºC incubator on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle. Debris and dead or dysmorphic embryos were removed every other day with a Pasteur pipette under a bright-field microscope and the fish water replaced.

Cas9 Nuclease V3). The crRNA and tracrRNA were received as pellets, which were individually resuspended in Duplex buffer (IDT, received with the tracrRNA) to form 200 μM stocks. Stocks of crRNA and tracrRNA were stored at −70 ºC before use. Cas9 was stored at –20 ºC before use. Each crRNA was annealed separately with the tracrRNA by mixing 1 μL crRNA 200 μM; 1 μL tracrRNA 200 μM; 1.28 μL Duplex buffer. The mix was heated to 95 ºC for 5 min, then cooled on ice, to obtain a 61 μM gRNA solution. The gRNA solutions were then mixed in equal volumes with Cas9 (1 μL gRNA 61 μM; 1 μL Cas9 61 μM directly from the IDT vial), incubated at 37 ºC for 5 min then cooled on ice, generating three 30.5 μM RNP solutions. The three RNP solutions were pooled; the final concentration of each RNP in the pool was thus 10.2 μM and the total RNP concentration 30.5 μM.</p><p>The RNPs were usually kept overnight in a 4 ºC fridge on ice before injections the following day.

While mutating two loci instead of three is predicted to reduce rates of complete biallelic knockout animals, given the high rate of frameshift mutations achieved with the RNPs that were used, ~90% of injected animals were still expected to be complete biallelic knockouts. Across loci that were mutated during double F0 knockout experiments, 97.5 ± 7.0% of the reads were mutated, and 78.9 ± 24.0% of all reads had a frameshift mutation; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/">francoiskroll.shinyapps.io/frameshiftmodel/</ext-link> for the theoretical knockout rate prediction.

Individual larvae were sequenced at the three or four mutated loci.</p><p>The larvae were anaesthetised and their genomic DNA extracted by HotSHOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meeker et al., 2007</xref>) as follows. Individual larvae were transferred to a 96-well PCR plate or strips of 12 tubes. Excess liquid was removed from each well before adding 50 μL of 1× base solution (25 mM KOH, 0.2 mM EDTA in water). Plates were sealed and incubated at 95 ºC for 30 min then cooled to room temperature before the addition of 50 μL of 1× neutralisation solution (40 mM Tris-HCl in water). Genomic DNA was then stored at –20 ºC.</p><p>PCR primers were designed for each target locus using Primer-BLAST (NCBI) to amplify a window of 150–200 bp with at least 30 bp between each primer binding site and the predicted double-strand break site, as this is where most deletions are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>).

The PCR product’s concentration was quantified with Qubit (dsDNA High Sensitivity or Broad Range Assay) and its length was verified on a 2.5% agarose gel with GelRed (Biotium). Excess primers and dNTPs were removed by ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were then sent for Illumina MiSeq, which used MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit v2 (300 Cycles).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Illumina MiSeq data analysis</title><p>Illumina MiSeq data was received as two fastq files for each well, one forward and one reverse. The paired-end reads were aligned to the reference amplicon with bwa v0.7.17 and the resulting bam alignment file was sorted and indexed with samtools v1.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Alignments were then filtered to keep only reads with less than 20% of its length soft-clipped and spanning at least 20 bp on each side of the predicted Cas9 double-strand break site, 4 bp upstream of the ‘N’ of the NGG protospacer adjacent motif. Whenever necessary, bam alignment files were visualised with IGV v2.16.0. The resulting filtered bam file was converted back to a forward and a reverse fastq file using bedtools v2.30.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). The filtered fastq files were used as input to the R package ampliCan v1.20.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Labun et al., 2019b</xref>), together with a csv configuration file containing metadata information about the samples. AmpliCan was run with settings min_freq = 0.005 (any mutation at a frequency below this threshold was considered as a sequencing error), cut_buffer = 12 (any insertion/deletion starting within ±12 bp of the PAM may be Cas9-generated), and event_filter = FALSE (no filtering of reads), as the reads were already filtered. AmpliCan can normalise mutation counts by ignoring any insertion/deletion found in control samples. On rare occasions, this could artefactually decrease mutation counts in F0 knockout samples because of low-level contamination in control samples (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, locus 1, sample scr1) so we turned this feature off. Instead, we manually checked the scrambled-injected samples in IGV to confirm that there were no insertions or deletions already present in the wild-type background. AmpliCan detected and counted mutations in the reads and wrote results files that were used for subsequent analysis. Any sample with less than 20× paired end (40× single read) coverage were excluded from plots and subsequent analysis, which is why some samples are missing from plots (e.g. locus2, ko5 is missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Figures like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref> plot the proportion of mutated reads and the proportion of reads with a frameshift mutation at each locus, as computed by ampliCan. A read was counted as mutated if it contained one or more insertions or deletions (indels), base substitutions were not considered. If a read contained multiple indels, ampliCan summed them to conclude whether the read had a frameshift mutation or not.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>3D-printed 96-well mesh-bottom plate</title><p>The 96-square well mesh-bottom plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) was designed using Fusion 360 and PrusaSlicer.

Each clutch was from a unique pair of parents allowed to mate for 7–10 min. For each clutch, about half of the embryos were injected with non-targeting ‘scrambled’ RNPs to generate control siblings. Clutch-to-clutch variability in locomotor activity is substantial in zebrafish larvae, even between wild-type clutches of the same strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joo et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, keeping clutches from different parents/mating events separate is predicted to increase sensitivity of the assay by reducing variability. More generally, it is crucial never to perform comparisons where treatment larvae (e.g. mutant, transgenic, drug-treated) are from one clutch and the control larvae are from another (i.e. controls are not siblings), as any difference discovered with such an experimental design could be caused by clutch-to-clutch variability.</p><p>At 5 dpf, individual larvae were transferred to the wells of 3D-printed mesh-bottom plates (see <italic>3D-printed 96-well mesh-bottom plate</italic>), each sitting in the water bath of a Zebrabox (ViewPoint Behavior Technology). To avoid any potential localisation bias during the tracking, F0 knockout and scrambled-injected larvae were plated in alternating columns of the 96-well plate. From each well, the video-tracking software (ZebraLab, ViewPoint Behavior Technology) recorded the number of pixels that changed intensity between successive frames. To be counted, a pixel must have changed grey value above a sensitivity threshold, which was set at 20. The metric, termed Δ pixel, describes each animal’s behaviour over time as a sequence of zeros and positive values, denoting if the larva was still or moving. In ZebraLab, the <italic>freeze</italic> setting was set to 3 and the <italic>burst</italic> setting was set to 200. However, note that these settings determine how the Δ pixel data is summarised into number of seconds active per minute by the software (<italic>middur</italic> parameter, see <italic>One-minute vs. frame-by-frame</italic>); therefore, their values are irrelevant when analysing the data using the FramebyFrame package. Tracking was performed at 25 frames per second on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle for ~65 hr, generating sequences of roughly 5,850,000 Δ pixel values per animal. During the experiment, a pump on a timer (Kollea Automatic Watering System, Amazon UK) injected fish water from a reservoir to the bath every morning around 9 AM (lights on) to counteract water evaporation. Water could overflow through an exit pipe, whose height was adjusted to set the water level in the bath. The day light level was calibrated at 555 lux with a RS PRO RS-92 light meter (RS Components). Night was in complete darkness with infrared lighting for video recording. Temperature and light transitions were recorded with a HOBO Pendant (Onset Data Loggers) immersed in the water bath. Temperature throughout the experiment was 23–26ºC.</p><p>At the end of the tracking, we inspected the larvae under a bright-field microscope and excluded from analysis any larva that did not appear healthy or was not responsive to a light touch with a P10 tip. We then randomly selected 2–3 scrambled-injected and 5–6 F0 knockout larvae for sequencing of the targeted loci (see <italic>Preparation of samples for Illumina MiSeq</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioural video-tracking with drug treatment</title><p>This refers to the experiments treating <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockouts with citalopram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>) or fluvoxamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>) and the experiment treating <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts with tinidazole, fenoprofen, and betamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Each Petri dish was then topped-up with fish water to 50 mL final volume, which effectively diluted each drug to the final treatment concentration (100 µL 500×stock in 50 mL fish water). The final DMSO concentration was 0.2% (100 µL 100% DMSO in 50 mL fish water). Using a P1000 pipet with a tip whose end was cut-off, individual larvae were then transferred in 650 µL to the 96-square well plates. This process was to avoid adding drug in DMSO directly to the well as the solution sinks in water and may not mix properly.</p><p>Video-tracking was then performed with the same settings as above (see <italic>Behavioural video-tracking</italic>). Both mornings shortly after 9 AM (lights on), the wells were manually topped-up with fish water (no drug), which assumes that the drug does not evaporate and was stable in fish water at 23–26ºC for a few days.</p><p>A protocol for behavioural video-tracking with drug treatment is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.4r3l27p6pg1y/v1">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.4r3l27p6pg1y/v1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioural data analysis</title><p>Behavioural data analysis was performed using the FramebyFrame R package v0.11.0. A tutorial and documentation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kroll, 2025a</xref>). The important steps of the analysis are summarised below.</p><p>The raw file generated by the ZebraLab software was exported into hundreds of xls files each containing 1 million rows of data. Each row of data represented the Δ pixel of one larva at one frame transition. Using the vpSorter(…) function, these data were re-organised in a large csv file where each column was a well, each row was a frame transition, and each cell a Δ pixel value. To visualise activity over time, we smoothed the Δ pixel time course for each larva with a 60-min (~90,000 rows) rolling average then binned the data by summing Δ pixels in 10-min epochs. We generated the activity trace of individual larvae using ggActivityTraceGrid(…) and excluded from subsequent analysis any larva that had an obviously aberrant behaviour, defined as having missed entirely a day-night transition (no jump/drop in the activity trace) or having shown activity during a day lower than the previous night. Each well was assigned to a group using a metadata file generated by genotypeGenerator(…). For each 10-min epoch, we calculated the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) across larvae in each group to build the activity traces (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> left).</p><p>Sleep was measured on the large csv file containing all the frame-by-frame Δ pixel data. A 60 s (~1500 rows) rolling sum was applied on the Δ pixel time course of each larva, so that any data point that became zero indicated that the previous 60 s of Δ pixels were all zeros, that is, a sleep bout started exactly 60 s ago. The data after the rolling sum was converted into a series of Booleans: <italic>true</italic> if the data point was 0 (i.e. that frame was part of a sleep bout); <italic>false</italic> if the data point was positive (i.e. that frame was not part of a sleep bout, as the larva moved at some point in the preceding 60 s). At this stage, the first 0 of each sleep bout marked the frame at the 60th second of each sleep bout. Therefore, a correction was then applied to extend each sleep bout 60 s in the past by switching the ~1500 frames of <italic>false</italic> before each sleep bout start to <italic>true</italic>. The time spent asleep in 10 min epochs (~15,000 rows) was calculated by counting the number of <italic>true</italic> frames in each epoch and multiplying the counts by 1/frame rate (typically 1/25 frames per second), which was converted into minutes for the sleep trace. For example, if larva #3 had 5000 out of 15,000 frames marked <italic>true</italic> (i.e. these frames are part of a sleep bout) from minute 20–30 of tracking, that represented <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5000</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>25</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>60</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.33</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for that epoch. As for the activity trace, the mean and SEM across larvae in each group were calculated for each 10min epoch to build the sleep traces (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> right).</p><p>15 behavioural parameters were then calculated for each larva and day/night. Two additional parameters, startle response at sunset and sleep latency, were only defined for nights, for a total of 32 unique parameters (15 day parameters and 17 night parameters). Full days/nights during the experiment were: night0, day1, night1, day2, night2. Larvae were 5 dpf during night0, 6 dpf during day1/night1, 7 dpf during day2/night2, and the experiment was stopped in the morning of 8 dpf. Night0 (5 dpf) was excluded from the analysis as a habituation period; therefore, two day data points and two night data points were calculated for each larva and behavioural parameter. Definitions of the behavioural parameters can be found in the documentation of the FramebyFrame package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame">github.com/francoiskroll/FramebyFrame</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kroll, 2025a</xref>).</p><p>To build the behavioural fingerprints, a z-score was calculated for each day/night, each larva, and each unique parameter. For example, to calculate the z-score for parameter active bout length of larva #5 for day1, we first calculated the mean and standard deviation of all active bout length data points for control larvae during day1. These were then used to calculate larva #5’s z-score as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was larva #5’s day1 data point, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> was the mean of control day1 data points, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> was the standard deviation of control day1 data points. The calculation was repeated for day2. The day1 and day2 z-scores were then averaged to produce a common day z-score for active bout length of larva #5. The process was repeated for each unique parameter, producing 32 z-scores for each larva, which we term each larva’s behavioural fingerprint. To draw the fingerprint plots (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), the mean and SEM of all z-scores were calculated for each unique parameter and group of larvae. By definition of the z-score, the mean z-score for the control larvae was always 0 and the SEM constant for each experiment (dependent on the number of control larvae), so the controls’ fingerprint was omitted from the plot.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, for each parameter, the mean and SEM of all z-scores from each clutch were calculated separately. The two z-score means and SEMs were then averaged to draw each bar.

The data were parameter values per larva per time window, for example larva #3 slept 4 hr during night2. We always tracked one unique clutch in each ZebraBox run; therefore, the replicate experiment(s) provided both technical and biological replication. The data collected during nights or during days were analysed separately. The fixed effect was the group assignment (genotype or treatment). Random effects were intercepts for clutch assignment (experiment), larva number, and the larva’s age (dpf). Random effects of clutch assignment and larva number were modelled as nested, as data points between larvae of the same clutch were expected to be more similar than between larvae of different clutches; and within each clutch, the day1 (or night1) data point of one larva was expected to be similar to its day2 (or night2) data point.

The other larvae were raised until 16 dpf to increase the amount of tissue available for the assay. Larvae were euthanised by an overdose of tricaine then decapitated with a scalpel. Heads were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen then homogenized using a mechanical homogenizer in 100 μL TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1:200 protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem).

Meso Scale returned concentrations of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42 in pg/mL. All Aβ38 measurements were below the detection limit. We converted the Aβ concentrations to pg Aβ/µg total protein using the total protein content measured with the Bradford assay. The limit of detection (LOD) for each Aβ species was the concentration of the most diluted standard in pg/mL. We calculated a sample-specific LOD by calculating the Aβ concentration (pg Aβ/µg total protein) that would have given exactly the LOD in pg/mL. For example, the LOD for Aβ40 was 39.79 pg/mL. Therefore, for a sample whose total protein content was 3788 µg/mL, Aβ40 concentration should have been 0.0105 pg Aβ40/g total protein to give exactly the LOD (39.79 pg/mL). Each data point represents the mean of the four technical replicates, except if both diluted replicates were below the sample-specific LOD, in which case the data point represents the mean of the two undiluted technical replicates. If one undiluted sample was below the LOD but not the other, we replaced the below-LOD measurement by the sample-specific LOD itself.

The same compound could have alternate database names (e.g. ‘Dopamine hydrochloride’ and ‘Dopamine HCl’), and could vary by its stereochemistry or salts (e.g. atropine sulfate vs. atropine methyl nitrate). Therefore, we first simplified as much as possible each compound name by removing various stereochemistry and salt information. This reduced the number of unique compound names from 5149 to 4731. We then used the webchem R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Szöcs et al., 2020</xref>) to automatically search each name in the PubChem database and return the PubChem CID. CID could be retrieved automatically for 4365 (92%) of the names. We manually searched the remaining 366 compound names, eventually leaving only 8 of 4731 compound names without a CID. The final number of unique CIDs was 3677. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) uses a custom TTD Drug ID but provided a file for cross-matching PubChem CIDs to TTD Drug IDs (<italic>P1-03-TTD_crossmatching.txt</italic>). We found a TTD Drug ID for 1740 of the 3677 CIDs (47%). Using each TTD Drug ID as query, we then extracted indications and target proteins from databases provided by the TTD using TTD Drug IDs as queries (<italic>P1-05-Drug_disease.txt</italic> and <italic>P1-01-TTD_target_download.txt</italic>). Proteins are given a target ID by the TTD, which we then used as query to extract the KEGG pathways each protein was associated with (<italic>P4-01-Target-KEGGpathway_all.txt</italic>).</p><p>As TTD Drug IDs were used to extract annotations but that only 47% of compounds were assigned one, the ZOLTAR app currently uses less than half of the dataset by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref> for prediction of disrupted pathways. In the future, other sources could be used to enrich the annotations, for example using machine learning to predict target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatterjee et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Behavioural pharmacology from <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockout’s fingerprint</title><p>We first simplified the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref> behavioural database so that each compound (unique PubChem CID) would be present as a single average fingerprint. Without this adjustment, a single compound could in theory drive a significant enrichment because it is present as several replicate fingerprints (e.g. propranolol has 10 fingerprints) all positively or negatively correlating with the query fingerprint. We then measured the cosine similarity (range −1.0–1.0) between the mean fingerprint of the two <italic>sorl1</italic> F0 knockout clutches and each of the 3677 average small molecule fingerprints (one per PubChem CID) from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref> database, ranking them from the small molecule fingerprint with the most positive cosine (SU6656: cos = 0.83) to the one with the most negative cosine (nitrocaramiphen HCl: cos = −0.78).</p><p>At this stage, the general goal of the analysis is to detect whether compounds with a given annotation (indication, target, or KEGG pathway) are found more towards the top and/or bottom of the ranked list than expected by chance. For example, two cases suggest that inhibition of a pathway is what causes the knockout behavioural phenotype: all compounds <italic>inhibiting</italic> this pathway are found towards the top of the list (positive cosines); or all compounds <italic>activating</italic> this pathway are found towards the bottom of the list (negative cosines). The database may include both agonists and antagonists for a given pathway, so we also want to detect cases where compounds interacting with the pathway are found both towards the top <italic>and</italic> towards the bottom of the ranked list. Therefore, the null hypothesis for a given annotation is specifically that fingerprints with this annotation are found across the ranked list in a pattern that can be explained by chance, or that they are mostly found around the centre of the list (cos ~0 position).</p><p>We swapped each compound in the ranked list for its annotations, for example its target(s), keeping for each the original cosine of the compound. If a compound had no annotated target (or indication or KEGG pathway), it was simply deleted. If a compound had multiple annotated targets (or indications or KEGG pathways), all targets received the compound’s cosine. For example, aspirin had cos = −0.41 and two annotated targets: HMG-CoA reductase and prostaglandin G/H synthase. Therefore, swapping aspirin for its targets generated two rows with the same cosine −0.41.</p><p>To measure enrichment of a given annotation towards the top and/or bottom of the list, we summed the absolute cosines of all its instances. For example, 18 compounds in the database are annotated as binding the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4). In the ranked list of fingerprints for <italic>sorl1</italic>, the sum of those 18 cosines was 6.07. Was this sum of cosines surprising or could it be explained by chance? To test this, we randomly drew 18 positions and measured the sum of cosines 100,000 times to generate a null distribution of sum of cosines (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We counted how many random draws gave a larger sum of cosines than the observed sum of cosines (6.07) to calculate a simulated p-value. In the case of SLC6A4, 1470 random draws gave a larger sum of cosines; therefore, the probability that a sum of cosines as high as 6.07 was obtained by chance was estimated at 1470/100,000 = 0.0147, which we reported as the simulated p-value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Behavioural pharmacology from psen2 F0 knockout’s fingerprint</title><p>We measured the cosine similarity between the mean fingerprint of the two <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout clutches and each of the 5756 small molecule fingerprints from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rihel et al., 2010a</xref> database.

The authors make a set of potentially important findings vis-à-vis the relationship between AD-associated genes and sleep. First, they find that loss-of-function in late-onset AD genes universally result in nighttime sleep loss, consistent with the well-supported hypothesis that sleep disruption contributes to Alzheimer's-related pathologies. psen-1, an early-onset associated AD gene, which the authors find is principally responsible for the generation of AB40 and AB42 in zebrafish, also shows a slight increase in activity at night and slight decreases in nighttime sleep. Conversely, psen-2 mutations increase daytime sleep, while appa/appb mutations have no impact on sleep.

This could provide exciting / more convincing mechanistic support for the assertion that serotonin signaling is disrupted upon loss of AD-associated genes. Despite these important considerations, this study provides a valuable platform for high-throughput analysis of sleep phenotypes and correlation with small-molecule induced sleep phenotypes. The platform could also be expanded to facilitate comparison of other behavioral phenotypes, including stimulus-evoked behaviors.

Most concerns are sufficiently addressed in the revised manuscript or response to reviewers.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The overarching concept of the work is that comparing behavioral fingerprints can align genes and molecules with similarly disrupted molecular pathways. While the recovery of the psen2 phenotypes by one molecule with the opposite phenotype is interesting, as are previous studies that show similar behaviorally-based recoveries, the underlying assumption that normalizing the larval movement normalizes the mechanism still lacks substantial support. While I agree with the authors detailed response that rescuing most behavioral parameters is a good indication that the underlying mechanism is normalized, I disagree that high-throughput larval behavior kinematics is a sufficient enough representation of most behavioral parameters to be indicative of molecular mechanism normalization. There are many instances of mutants with completely normal kinetics at baseline, but a behavioral difference that emerges during stimulation or in a new paradigm such as hunting. Without testing far more behavioral paradigms than are possible in the multi-well plate format, as well as possibly multiple life stages, I remain unconvinced that this approach will yield valuable therapeutic insights. I do agree that it can yield insight for future investigation, such as in the case of cntnap2a/cntnap2b and GABA receptor agonists, but even in that instance is it not clear that such an agonist would rescue abnormalities in a meaningful way. In the case of a disorder such as autism, the early locomotor phenotypes may be disconnected from the molecular mechanisms underlying later social deficits, and it is far more challenging to screen on juvenile behaviors that would be a more appropriate target for a behavior-first approach. The added experiment of testing fluvoxamine, a second SSRI, yielded very different behavioral responses to the SSRI citalopram, supporting my assertion that this approach and the disrupted underlying mechanisms are more complicated than suggested by the authors. I disagree that the connection between sorl1 and serotonin is strengthened by this experiment. The authors suggest that since the knockout larvae react differently than control siblings to both SSRIs, it indicates that serotonin is disrupted. There is no negative control included, where a pathway that is clearly not indicated to be important is pharmacologically manipulated. It is possible that the mutants would also behave differently compared to siblings when other pathways are perturbed. The authors acknowledge in the reviewers that they may not have identified the underlying molecular disruption in this mutant, but they did not substantially alter the Discussion section on this point. I agree with the authors that using a different wild-type strain in a different lab could lead to discrepancies, but these issues could have been experimentally mitigated or more clearly highlighted in the manuscript itself.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96839.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kroll</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Donnelly</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ozcan</surname><given-names>Guliz Gurel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mackay</surname><given-names>Eirinn</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Kroll et al. conduct an in-depth behavioral analysis of F0 knockouts of 4 genes associated with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), together with 3 genes associated with early-onset AD.

We selected the four late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes (<italic>APOE</italic>, <italic>CD2AP</italic>, <italic>CLU</italic>, <italic>SORL1</italic>) based on human genetics data and brain expression in zebrafish larvae, not based on their likelihood to modify sleep behaviour, which we could have tried by searching for overlaps with GWAS of sleep phenotypes, for example. Consequently, we find it remarkable that all four of these genes caused a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated. We also find it reassuring that knockout of <italic>appa/appb</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> did not cause a night-time sleep phenotype, which largely excludes the possibility that the phenotype is a technical artefact (e.g. caused by the F0 knockout method) or a property of every gene expressed in the larval brain.</p><p>Having said that, it could still be a coincidence, rather than a special property of genes associated with late-onset AD. In addition to testing additional late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes, the ideal way to answer this question would be to test in parallel a random set of genes expressed in the brain at this stage of development. From this random set, one could estimate the proportion of genes that cause a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated. One could then use that information to test whether late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes are indeed enriched for genes that cause a night-time sleep phenotype when mutated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For those mutants that cause night-time sleep disturbances, do these phenotypes share a common underlying pathway? e.g. Do 5-HT reuptake inhibitors promote sleep across all 4 late-onset genes in addition to psen1? Can 5-HT reuptake inhibitors reverse other AD-related pathologies in zebrafish? Can compounds be identified that have a common behavioral fingerprint across all or multiple AD risk genes? Do these modify sleep phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>To attempt to answer these questions, we used ZOLTAR to generate predictions for all the knockout behavioural fingerprints presented in the study, in the same way as for <italic>sorl1</italic> in Fig. 5 and Fig. 5–supplement 1.

Indication “depression” is only significant for <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts; target “serotonin transporter” is also significant for <italic>appa/appb</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts; and KEGG pathway “serotonergic synapse” is also significant for <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts. ZOLTAR therefore does not predict serotonin signalling to be a major theme common to all mutants with a night-time sleep loss phenotype.</p><p>Particularly interesting is cholinergic signalling appearing in the most common targets and KEGG pathways. Acetylcholine signalling is a major theme in research on AD. For example, the first four drugs ever approved by the FDA to treat AD were acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which increase acetylcholine signalling by preventing its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase. These drugs are generally considered only to treat symptoms and not modify disease course, but this view has been called into question (Munoz-Torrero, 2008; Relkin, 2007). If, as ZOLTAR suggests, mutations in several Alzheimer’s risk genes affect cholinergic signalling early in development, this would point to a potential causal role of cholinergic disruption in AD.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Common predictions from ZOLTAR for the seven Alzheimer’s risk genes tested.</title><p>Predictions from ZOLTAR which are shared by multiple knockout behavioural fingerprints presented in the study.

To provide some context, we and collaborators have occasionally used the dataset by Rihel et al. (2010) to generate hypotheses or find candidate drugs that reverse a behavioural phenotype measured in the sleep/wake assay (Ashlin et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2016).

If the connection to serotonin in the sorl1 was more complete, for example, the overarching idea would be more compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this cogent criticism.</p><p>On the first point, we were careful not to claim that betamethasone normalises the molecular/cellular mechanism that causes the <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype. Having said that, yes, to a certain extent that would be the hope of the approach. As you say, every compound which normalises the behavioural fingerprint will not normalise the underlying mechanism, but the opposite seems true: every compound that normalises the underlying mechanism should also normalise the behavioural fingerprint. We think this logic makes the “behaviour-first” approach innovative and interesting. The logic is to discover compounds that normalise the behavioural phenotype first, only subsequently test whether they also normalise the molecular mechanism, akin to testing first whether a drug resolves the symptoms before testing whether it actually modifies disease course. While in practice testing thousands of drugs in sufficient sample sizes and replicates on a mutant line is challenging, the dataset queried through ZOLTAR provides a potential shortcut by shortlisting <italic>in silico</italic> compounds that have the opposite effect on behaviour.</p><p>You mention a “reduction in movement bouts” but note here that the number of behavioural parameters tested is key to our argument. To take the two extremes, say the only behavioural parameter we measured in <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae was time active during the day, then, yes, any stimulant used at the right concentration could probably normalise the phenotype. In this situation, claiming that the stimulant is likely to also normalise the underlying mechanism, or even that it is a genuine “phenotypic rescue”, would not be convincing. Conversely, say we were measuring thousands of behavioural parameters under various stimuli, such as swimming speed, position in the well, bout usage, tail movements, and eye angles, it seems almost impossible for a compound to rescue most parameters without also normalising the underlying mechanism. The present approach is somewhere inbetween: ZOLTAR uses six behavioural parameters for prediction (e.g. Fig 6a), but all 17 parameters calculated by FramebyFrame can be used to assess rescue during a subsequent experiment (Fig. 6c). For both, splitting each parameter in day and night increases the resolution of the approach, which partly answers your criticism. For example, betamethasone rescued the day-time hypoactivity without causing night-time hyperactivity, so we are not making the “straw man argument” explained above of using any broad stimulant to rescue the hypoactivity phenotype.</p><p>Furthermore, for diseases where the behavioural defect is the primary concern, such as autism or bipolar disorder, perhaps this behaviour-first approach is all that is needed, and whether or not the compound precisely rescues the underlying mechanism is somewhat secondary. The use of lithium to prevent manic episodes in bipolar disorder is a good example. It was initially tested because mania was thought to be caused by excess uric acid and lithium can dissolve uric acid (Mitchell and Hadzi-Pavlovic, 2000). The theory is now discredited, but lithium continues to be used without a precise understanding of its mode of action. In this example, behavioural rescue alone, assuming the secondary effects are tolerable, is sufficient to be beneficial to patients, and whether it modulates the correct causal pathway is secondary.</p><p>On the second point, we agree that testing first ZOLTAR on a mutant for which we have a fairly good understanding of the mechanism causing the behavioural phenotype could have been a productive approach. Note, however, that examples already exist in the literature (Ashlin et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2016). The example from Hoffman et al. (2016) is especially convincing. Drugs generating behavioural fingerprints that positively correlate with the <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> double knockout fingerprint were enriched with NMDA and GABA receptor antagonists. In experiments analogous to our citalopram and fluvoxamine treatments (Fig. 5c,d and Fig. 5–supplement 1c,d), <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> knockout larvae were overly sensitive to the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Among other drugs tested, zolpidem, a GABAA receptor agonist, caused opposite effects on wild-type and <italic>cntnap2a/cntnap2b</italic> knockout larvae. Knockout larvae were found to have fewer GABAergic neurons in the forebrain. While these studies did not use precisely the same analysis that ZOLTAR runs, they used the same rationale and behavioural dataset to make these predictions (Rihel et al., 2010), which shows that approaches like ZOLTAR can point to causal processes.</p><p>On your last point, we hope our experiment testing fluvoxamine, another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), makes the connection between Sorl1 and serotonin signalling more convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram is based on a small number of animals. The KO Euclidean distance measure is also more spread out than for the other datasets, and it looks like only five or so fish are driving the group difference. It also appears as though the numbers were also from two injection series. While there is nothing obviously wrong with the data, I would feel more comfortable if such a strong statement of a result from a relatively subtle phenotype were backed up by a higher N or a stable line. It is not impossible that the observed difference is an experimental fluke. If something obvious had emerged through the HCR, that would have also supported the conclusions. As it stands, if no more experiments are done to bolster the claim, the confidence in the strength of the link to serotonin should be reduced (possibly putting the entire section in the supplement and modifying the discussion). The discussion section about serotonin and AD is interesting, but I think that it is excessive without additional evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We mostly agree with this criticism. One could interpret the larger spread of the data for <italic>sorl1</italic> KO larvae treated with 10 µM citalopram as evidence that the knockout larvae do indeed react differently to the drug at this dose, regardless of being driven by a subset of the animals. The result indeed does not survive removing the top 5 (p = 0.87) or top 3 (p = 0.18) <italic>sorl1</italic> KO + 10 µM larvae, but this amounts to excluding 20 (3/14) or 35 (5/14) % of the datapoints as potential outliers, which is unreasonable. In fact, excluding the top 5 <italic>sorl1</italic> KO + 10 µM is equivalent to calling any datapoint with z-score &gt; 0.2 an outlier (z-scores of the top 5 datapoints are 0.2–1.8). Applying consistently the same criterion to the scrambled + 10 µM group would remove the top 6 datapoints (z-scores = 0.5–3.9). Comparing the resulting two distributions again gives the <italic>sorl1</italic> KO + 10 µM distribution as significantly higher (p = 0.0015). We would also mention that Euclidean distance, as a summary metric for distance between behavioural fingerprints, has limitations. For example, the measure will be more sensitive to changes in some parameters but not others, depending on how much room there is for a given parameter to change. We included this metric to lend support to the observation one can draw from the fingerprint plot (Fig. 5c) that <italic>sorl1</italic> mutants respond in an exaggerated way to citalopram across many parameters, while being agnostic to which parameter might matter most.</p><p>Given that the HCR did not reveal anything striking, we agree with you that too much of our argument relied on this result being robust. As you and Reviewer #3 suggested, we repeated this experiment with a different SSRI, fluvoxamine (Fig. 5–supplement 1). We cannot readily explain why the result was opposite to what we found with citalopram, but in both cases <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae reacted differently than their control siblings, which adds an argument to our claim that ZOLTAR correctly predicted serotonin signalling as a disrupted pathway from the behavioural fingerprint. Accordingly, we mostly kept the Discussion on Sorl1 the same, although we concede that we may not have identified the molecular mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors suggest two hypotheses for the behavioral difference between the sorl1 KO and scrambled at the higher dose of the citalopram. While the first is tested, and found to not be supported, the second is not tested at all (&quot;Ruling out the first hypothesis, sorl1 knockouts may react excessively to a given spike in serotonin.&quot; and &quot;Second, sorl1 knockouts may be overly sensitive to serotonin itself because post-synaptic neurons have higher levels of serotonin receptors.&quot;). Assuming that the finding is robust, there are probably other reasons why the mutants could have a different sensitivity to this molecule. However, if this particular one is going to be mentioned, it is surprising that it was not tested alongside the first hypothesis. This work could proceed without a complete explanation, but additional discussion of the possibilities would be helpful or why the second hypothesis was not tested.</p></disp-quote><p>There are no strong scientific reasons why this hypothesis was not tested. The lead author (F Kroll) moved to a different lab and country so the project was finalised at that time. We do not plan on testing this hypothesis at this stage. However, we adapted the wording to make it clear this is one possible alternative hypothesis which could be tested in the future. The small differences found by HCR are actually more in line with the new results from the fluvoxamine experiment, so it may also be that both hypotheses (pre-synaptic neurons releasing less serotonin when reuptake is blocked; or post-synaptic neurons being less sensitive) contribute. The fluvoxamine experiment was performed in a different lab (ICM, Paris; all other experiments were done in UCL, London) in a different wild-type strain (TL in ICM, AB x Tup LF in UCL), which complicates how one interprets this discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors claim that &quot;all four genes produced a fairly consistent phenotype at night&quot;. While it is interesting that this result arose in the different lines, the second clutch for some genes did not replicate as well as others. I think the findings are compelling, regardless, but the sometimes missing replicability should be discussed. I wonder if the F0 strategy adds noise to the results and if clean null lines would yield stronger phenotypes. Please discuss this possibility, or others, in regard to the variability in some phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>For the first part of this point, please see below our answer to Reviewer #3, point (2) c.</p><p>Regarding the F0 strategy potentially adding variability, it is an interesting question which we tested in a larger dataset of behavioural recordings from F0 and stable knockouts for the same genes (unpublished). In summary, the F0 knockout method does not increase clutch-to-clutch or larva-to-larva variability in the assay. F0 knockout experiments found many more significant parameters and larger effect sizes than stable knockout experiments, but this difference could largely be explained by the larger sample sizes of F0 knockout experiments. In fact, larger sample sizes within individual clutches appears to be a major advantage of the F0 knockout approach over in-cross of heterozygous knockout animals as it increases sensitivity of the assay without causing substantial variability. We plan to report in more detail on this analysis in a separate paper as we think it would dilute the focus of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In this work, the knockout of appa/appb is included. While APP is a well-known risk gene, there is no clear justification for making a knockout model. It is well known that the upregulation of app is the driver of Alzheimer's, not downregulation. The authors even indicate an expectation that it could be similar to the other knockouts (&quot;Moreover, the behavioural phenotypes of appa/appb and psen1 knockout larvae had little overlap while they presumably both resulted in the loss of Aβ.&quot; and &quot;Comparing with early-onset genes, psen1 knockouts had similar night-time phenotypes, but loss of psen2 or appa/appb had no effect on night-time sleep.&quot;). There is no reason to expect similarity between appa/appb and psen1/2. I understand that the app knockouts could unveil interesting early neurodevelopmental roles, but the manuscript needs to be clarified that any findings could be the opposite of expectation in AD.</p></disp-quote><p>On “there is no reason to expect similarity […]”, we disagree. Knockout of <italic>appa/appb</italic> and knockout of <italic>psen1</italic> will both result in loss of Aβ (<italic>appa/appb</italic> encode Aβ and <italic>psen1</italic> cleaves Appa/Appb to release Aβ, cf. Fig. 3e). Consequently, a phenotype caused by the loss of Aβ, or possibly other Appa/Appb cleavage products, should logically be found in both <italic>appa/appb</italic> and <italic>psen1</italic> knockouts.</p><p>On “it is well known that the upregulation of <italic>APP</italic> is the driver of Alzheimer’s, not downregulation”; we of course agree. Among others, the examples of Down syndrome, <italic>APP</italic> duplication (Sleegers et al., 2006), or mouse models overexpressing human <italic>APP</italic> show definitely that overexpression of <italic>APP</italic> is sufficient to cause AD. Having said that, we would not be so quick in dismissing <italic>APP</italic> knockout as potentially relevant to understanding of AD.</p><p>Loss of soluble Aβ due to aggregation could contribute to pathology (Espay et al., 2023). Without getting too much into this intricate debate, links between levels of Aβ and risk of disease are often counter-intuitive too. For example, out of 138 PSEN1 mutations screened in vitro, 104 reduced total Aβ production and 11 even seemingly abolished the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Sun et al., 2017). In short, loss of soluble Aβ occurs in both AD and in our <italic>appa/appb</italic> knockout larvae.</p><p>We added a sentence in Results (section <italic>psen2 knockouts […]</italic>) to briefly justify our <italic>appa/appb</italic> knockout approach. To be clear, we do not want to imply, for example, that the absence of a night-time sleep phenotype for <italic>appa/appb</italic> is contradictory to the body of literature showing links between Aβ and sleep, including in zebrafish (Özcan et al., 2020). As you say, our experiment tested loss of App, including Aβ, while the literature typically reports on overexpression of <italic>APP</italic>, as in <italic>APP/PSEN1</italic>-overexpressing mice (Jagirdar et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript by Kroll and colleagues, the authors describe combining behavioral pharmacology with sleep profiling to predict disease and potential treatment pathways at play in AD. AD is used here as a case study, but the approaches detailed can be used for other genetic screens related to normal or pathological states for which sleep/arousal is relevant. The data are for the most part convincing, although generally the phenotypes are relatively small and there are no major new mechanistic insights. Nonetheless, the approaches are certainly of broad interest and the data are comprehensive and detailed. A notable weakness is the introduction, which overly generalizes numerous concepts and fails to provide the necessary background to set the stage for the data.</p><p>Major points</p><p>(1) The authors should spend more time explaining what they see as the meaning of the large number of behavioral parameters assayed and specifically what they tell readers about the biology of the animal. Many are hard to understand--e.g. a &quot;slope&quot; parameter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some parameters do not tell something intuitive about the biology of the animal. It would be easy to speculate. For example, the “activity slope” parameter may indicate how quickly the animal becomes tired over the course of the day. On the other hand, fractal dimension describes the “roughness/smoothness” of the larva’s activity trace (Fig. 2–supplement 1a); but it is not obvious how to translate this into information about the physiology of the animal. We do not see this as an issue though. While some parameters do provide intuitive information about the animal’s behaviour (e.g. sleep duration or sunset startle as a measure of startle response), the benefit of having a large number of behavioural parameters is to compare behavioural fingerprints and assess rescue of the behavioural phenotype by small molecules (Fig. 6c). For this purpose, the more parameters the better. The “MoSeq” approach from Wiltschko et al., 2020 is a good example from literature that inspired our own Fig. 6c. While some of the “behavioural syllables” may be intuitive (e.g. running or grooming), it is probably pointless to try to explain the ‘meaning’ of the “small left turn in place with head motion” syllable (Wiltschko et al., 2020). Nonetheless, this syllable was useful to assess whether a drug specifically treats the behavioural phenotype under study without causing too many side effects. Unfortunately, ZOLTAR has to reduce the FramebyFrame fingerprint (17 parameters) to just six parameters to compare it to the behavioural dataset from Rihel et al., 2010, but here, more parameters would almost certainly translate into better predictions too, regardless of their intuitiveness.</p><p>It is true however that we did not give much information on how some of the less intuitive parameters, such as activity slope or fractal dimension, are calculated or what they describe about the dataset (e.g. roughness/smoothness for fractal dimension). We added a few sentences in the legend of Fig. 2–supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Because in the end the authors did not screen that many lines, it would increase confidence in the phenotypes to provide more validation of KO specificity.

Do they phenocopy F0 KO larvae?</p></disp-quote><p>We unfortunately do not have those lines.

The authors should present more compelling evidence that animals are truly functionally null. Without this, how do we interpret their phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that there should be significant doubt about these mutants being truly functionally null, given the high mutation rate and presence of the expected pigmentation phenotype (Jiang et al., 2018, Fig. 3f and Fig. 3–supplement 3a). The <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts were virtually 100% mutated at three exons across the gene (mutation rates were locus 1: 100 ± 0%; locus 2: 99.99 ± 0.06%; locus 3: 99.85 ± 0.24%). Additionally, two of the three mutated exons had particularly high rates of frameshift mutations (locus 1: 97 ± 5%; locus 2: 88 ± 17% frameshift mutation rate). It is virtually impossible that a functional protein is translated given this burden of frameshift mutations. Phenotypically, in addition to the pigmentation defect, double <italic>psen1/psen2</italic> F0 knockout larvae had curved tails, the same phenotype as caused by a high dose of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Yang et al., 2008). These double F0 knockouts were lethal, while knockout of <italic>psen1</italic> or <italic>psen2</italic> alone did not cause obvious morphological defects. Evidently, most larvae must have been <italic>psen2</italic> null mutants in this experiment, otherwise functional Psen2 would have prevented early lethality.</p><p>Translation of zebrafish <italic>psen2</italic> can start at downstream start codons if the first exon has a frameshift mutation, generating a seemingly functional Psen2 missing the N-terminus (Jiang et al., 2020). Zebrafish homozygous for this early frameshift mutation had normal pigmentation, showing it is a reliable marker of Psen2 function even when it is mutated. This mechanism is not a concern here as the alternative start codons are still upstream of two of the three mutated exons (the alternative start codons discovered by Jiang et al., 2020 are in exon 2 and 3, but we targeted exon 3, exon 4, and exon 6).</p><p>We understand that the zebrafish community may be cautious about F0 phenotyping compared to stably generated mutants. As mentioned to Reviewer #2, we are planning to assemble a paper that expressly compares behavioural phenotypes measured in F0 vs. stable mutants to allay some of these concerns.

Related to the above, for <italic>cd2ap</italic> and <italic>sorl1</italic> KO, some of the effect sizes seem to be driven by one clutch and not the other. In other words, great clutch-to-clutch variability. Should the authors increase the number of clutches assayed?</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, there is substantial clutch-to-clutch variability in this behavioural assay. This is not specific to our experiments. Even within the same strain, wild-type larvae from different clutches (i.e. non-siblings) behave differently (Joo et al., 2021). This is why it is essential to compare behavioural phenotypes within individual clutches (i.e. from a single pair of parents, one male and one female), as we explain in Methods (section <italic>Behavioural video-tracking</italic>) and in the documentation of the FramebyFrame package. We often see two different experimental designs in literature: comparing non-sibling wild-type and mutant larvae, or pooling different clutches which include all genotypes (e.g. pooling multiple clutches from heterozygous in-crosses or pooling wild-type clutches before injecting them). The first experimental design causes false positive findings (Joo et al., 2021), as the clutch-to-clutch variability we and others observe gets interpreted as a behavioural phenotype. The second experimental design should not cause false positives but likely decreases the sensitivity of the assay by increasing the spread within genotypes. In both cases, the clutch-to-clutch variability is hidden, either by interpreting it as a phenotype (first case) or by adding it to animal-to-animal variability (second case). Our experimental design is technically more challenging as it requires obtaining large clutches from unique pairs of parents. However, this approach is better as it clearly separates the different sources of variability (clutch-to-clutch or animal-to-animal). As for every experiment, yes, a larger number of replicates would be better, but we do not plan to assay additional clutches at this time. Our work heavily focuses on the <italic>sorl1</italic> and <italic>psen2</italic> knockout behavioural phenotypes. The key aspects of these phenotypes were effectively tested in four experiments (five to six clutches) as <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae were also tracked in the citalopram and fluvoxamine experiments (Fig. 5 and Fig. 5–supplement 1), and <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were also tracked in the small molecule rescue experiment (Fig. 6 and Fig. 6–supplement 1).</p><p>The <italic>psen2</italic> behavioural phenotype replicated well across the six clutches tested (pairwise cosine similarities: 0.62 ± 0.15; Author response image 2a). 5/6 clutches were less active and initiating more sleep bouts during the day, as we claimed in Fig. 3.</p><p>In the citalopram experiment, the H<sub>2</sub>O-treated <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout fingerprint replicated fairly well the baseline recordings in Fig. 4, despite the smaller sample size (cos = 0.30 and 0.78; Author response image 2b, see “KO Fig. 5”). 5/6 of the significant parameters presented in Fig. 4–supplement 4 moved in the same direction, and knockout larvae were also hypoactive during the day but hyperactive at night. Note that two clutches were tracked on the same 96-well plate in this experiment. We calculated each larva’s z-score using the average of its control siblings, then we averaged all the z-scores to generate the fingerprint. The H<sub>2</sub>O treated <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout clutch from the fluvoxamine experiment did not replicate well the baseline recordings (cos = 0.08 and 0.11; Author response image 2b, see “KO Fig. 5–suppl. 1”). Knockout larvae were hypoactive during the day as expected, but behaviour at night was not as robustly affected. As mentioned above, knockouts were made in a different genetic background (TL, instead of AB x Tup LF used for all other experiments), which could explain the discrepancy.</p><p>We also took the opportunity to check whether our SSRI treatments replicated well the data from Rihel et al., 2010.

Just because the genes are expressed early does not at all mean that early-life dysfunction is related to future AD (though this could be the case, of course). Genes with exclusive developmental expression would be strong candidates for such an early-life role, however.

After all, every gene that plays a role in brain development must be expressed during development, so this wording seemed reasonable. Nevertheless, we adapted the wording to address this point and Reviewer #2’s complaint below. As noted, the primary goal was to check that the genes we selected were indeed expressed in zebrafish larvae before performing knockout experiments. Our discussion does raise the hypothesis that mutations in Alzheimer’s risk genes impact brain development and sleep early in life, but this argument primarily relies on our observation that knockout of late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes causes sleep phenotypes in 7-day old zebrafish larvae and from previous work showing brain structural differences in children at high genetic risk of AD (Dean et al., 2014; Quiroz et al., 2015), not solely on gene expression early in life.</p><p>Please also see our answer to a similar point raised by Reviewer #2 below (cf. Author response image 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A common quandary with defining sleep behaviorally is how to rectify sleep and activity changes that influence one another. With <italic>psen2</italic> KOs, the authors describe reduced activity and increased sleep during the day. But how do we know if the reduced activity drives increased behavioral quiescence that is incorrectly defined as sleep? In instances where sleep is increased but activity during periods during wake are normal or elevated, this is not an issue. But here, the animals might very well be unhealthy, and less active, so naturally they stop moving more for prolonged periods, but the main conclusion is not sleep per se. This is an area where more experiments should be added if the authors do not wish to change/temper the conclusions they draw. Are <italic>psen2</italic> KOs responsive to startling stimuli like controls when awake? Do they respond normally when quiescent? Great care must be taken in all models using inactivity as a proxy for sleep, and it can harm the field when there is no acknowledgment that overall health/activity changes could be a confound. Particularly worrisome is the betamethasone data in Figure 6, where activity and sleep are once again coordinately modified by the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair criticism. We agree it is a concern, especially in the case of <italic>psen2</italic> as we claim that <italic>day-time</italic> sleep is increased while zebrafish are diurnal. We do not rely heavily on the day-time inactivity being sleep (the ZOLTAR predictions or the small molecule rescue do not change whether the parameter is called sleep or inactivity), but our choice of labelling can fairly be challenged.</p><p>To address “are <italic>psen2</italic> KO responsive to startling stimuli like controls when awake/when quiescent”, we looked at the larvae’s behaviour immediately after lights abruptly switched on in the mornings. Almost every larva, regardless of genotype, responded strongly to every lights-<italic>off</italic> transition during the experiment. Instead, we chose the lights-<italic>on</italic> transition for this analysis because it is a weaker startling stimulus for the larvae than the lights-off transition (Fig. 3–supplement 3), potentially exposing differences between genotypes or behavioural states (quiescent or awake). We defined a larva as having reacted to the lights switching on if it made a swimming bout during the second (25 frames) after the lights-on transition. Across two clutches and two lights-on transitions, an average of 65% (range 52–73%) of all larvae reacted to the stimulus. <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were similarly likely, if not <italic>more</italic> likely, to respond (in average 69% responded, range 60–76%) than controls (60% average, range 44– 75%). When the lights switched on, about half of the larvae (39–51%) would have been classified as asleep according to the one-minute inactivity definition (i.e. the larva did not move in the minute preceding the lights transition). This allowed us to also compare behavioural states, as suggested by the reviewer. For three of the four light transitions, larvae which were awake when lights switched on were more likely to react than asleep larvae, but this difference was not striking (overall, awake larvae were only 1.1× more likely to react; Author response image 3). Awake <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were 1.1× (range 1.04–1.11×) more likely to react than awake control larvae, so, yes, <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae respond normally when awake. Asleep <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were 1.4× (range 0.63–2.19×) more likely to react than asleep control larvae, so <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts are also more or equally likely to react than control larvae when asleep. In summary, the overall health of <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts did not seem to be a significant confound in the experiment. As the reviewer suggested, if <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae were seriously unhealthy, they would not be as responsive as control larvae to a startling stimulus.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title><italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts react normally to lights switching on, indicating they are largely healthy.</title><p>At each lights-on transition (9 AM), each larva was categorised as awake if it had moved in the preceding one minute or asleep if it had been inactive for at least one minute.

The total count of each waffle plot was normalised to 25 so plots can be compared to each other. The real count is indicated in the corner of each plot.

If <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae indeed sleep more during the day compared to controls, we may predict inactive periods longer than one minute to increase disproportionately compared to the increase in shorter inactive periods. This broadly appeared to be the case, especially for one of the two clutches (Author response image 4). In clutch 1, inactive periods lasting 1–60 sec were equally frequent in both <italic>psen2</italic> and control larvae (fold change 1.0× during both days), while inactive periods lasting 1–2 min were 1.5× (day 1) and 2.5× (day 2) more frequent in <italic>psen2</italic> larvae compared to control larvae. In clutch 2, 1–60 sec inactive periods were also equally frequent in both <italic>psen2</italic> and control larvae, while inactive periods lasting 1–2 min were 3.4× (day 1) and 1.5× (day 2) more frequent in <italic>psen2</italic> larvae compared to control larvae. Therefore, <italic>psen2</italic> knockouts disproportionately increased the frequency of inactive periods longer than one minute, suggesting they genuinely slept more during the day.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title><italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockouts increased preferentially the frequency of longer inactive bouts.</title><p>For each day and clutch, we calculated the mean distribution of inactive bout lengths across larvae of same genotype (<italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout or scrambled-injected), then compared the frequency of inactive bouts of different lengths between the two genotypes.

A possible approach could be to use a closed-loop system which, after one minute of inactivity, triggers a stimulus that is sufficient to startle an awake larva but not an asleep larva. If <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae indeed sleep more during the day, the stimulus should usually not be sufficient to startle them. Nevertheless, we believe the two analyses presented here are consistent with <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae genuinely sleeping more during the day, so we decided to keep this label. We agree with the reviewer that the one-minute inactivity definition has limitations, especially for day-time inactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The conclusions for the serotonin section are overstated. Behavioural pharmacology purports to predict a signaling pathway disrupted with <italic>sorl1</italic> KO. But is it not just possible that the drug acts in parallel to the true disrupted pathway in these fish? There is no direct evidence for serotonin dysfunction - that conclusion is based on response to the drug. Moreover, it is just one drug - is the same phenotype present with another SSRI? Likewise, language should be toned down in the discussion, as this hypothesis is not &quot;confirmed&quot; by the results (consider &quot;supported&quot;). The lack of measured serotonin differences further raises concern that this is not the true pathway. This is another major point that deserves further experimental evidence, because without it, the entire approach (behavioral pharm screen) seems more shaky as a way to identify mechanisms. There are any number of testable hypotheses to pursue such as (a) Using transient transgenesis to visualize 5HT neuron morphology (is development perturbed: cell number, neurite morphology, synapse formation); (b) Using transgenic Ca reporters to assay 5HT neuron activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the comment, “is it not just possible that the drug acts in parallel to the true disrupted pathway”, we think no, assuming we understand correctly the question. Key to our argument is the fact that <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae react differently to the drug(s) than control larvae. As an example, take night-time sleep bout length, which was not affected by knockout of <italic>sorl1</italic> (Fig. 4–supplement 4). For the sake of the argument, say only dopamine signalling (the “true disrupted pathway”) was affected in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts and that serotonin signalling was intact. Assuming that citalopram specifically alters serotonin signalling, then treatment should cause the same increase in sleep bout length in both knockouts and controls as serotonin signalling is intact in both. This is not what we see, however. Citalopram caused a <italic>greater</italic> increase in sleep bout length in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts than in scrambled-injected larvae. In other words, the effect is non-additive, in the sense that citalopram did not add the same number of z-scores to <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts or controls. We think this shows that serotonin signalling is somehow different in <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts. Nonetheless, we concede that the experiment does not necessarily say much about the importance of the serotonin disruption caused by loss of Sorl1. It could be, for example, that the most salient consequence of loss of Sorl1 is cholinergic disruption (see reply to Reviewer #1 above) and that serotonin signalling is a minor theme.</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with the reviewer and Reviewer #2 that the conclusions were overly confident. As suggested, we decided to repeat this experiment with another SSRI, fluvoxamine. Please find the results of this experiment in Fig. 5–supplement 1. The suggestions to further test the serotonin system in the <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts are excellent as well, however we do not plan to pursue them at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>- Data are presented in a variety of different ways, occasionally making comparisons across figures difficult.

In many cases, detailed phenotypic data is provided for one example mutant in the main figures, and then additional mutants are described in detail in the supplement. Again, to facilitate comparisons between mutants, fingerprints could be provided for all mutants in a main figure, with detailed analyses moved to the supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>The logic was to dedicate one main figure to <italic>psen2</italic> (Fig. 3) as an example of an early-onset Alzheimer’s risk gene, and one to <italic>sorl1</italic> (previously Fig. 4) as an example of a late-onset Alzheimer’s risk gene. We focused on them in main figures as they are both tested again later (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Having said that, we agree that the fingerprints may be a better use of main figure space than the parameters plots. In addition to the above (fingerprints of late-onset Alzheimer’s risk genes in main figure), we rearranged the figures in the early-onset AD section to have the <italic>psen2</italic> F0 knockout fingerprint in main.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The explication of the utility of behavioral fingerprinting on page 35 is somewhat confusing. The authors describe drugs used to treat depression as enriched among small molecules anti-correlating with the sorl1 fingerprint. However, in Figure 5 - Supplementary Figure 1, drugs used to treat depression are biased toward positive cosines, which are indicated as having a more similar fingerprint to sorl1. These drugs should be described as more present among compounds positively correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry, the confusion is about “(anti-)correlating”. Precisely, we meant “correlating and/or anti-correlating”, not just anti-correlating. We changed to that wording. In short, the analysis is by design agnostic to whether compounds with a given annotation are found more on the positive cosines side (left side in Fig. 5–supplement 1a) or the negative cosines side (right side). This is because the dataset often includes both agonists and antagonists to a given pathway but these are difficult to annotate. For example, say 10 compounds in the dataset target the dopamine D4 receptor, but these are an unknown mix of agonists and antagonists. In this case, we want ZOLTAR to generate a low p-value when all 10 compounds are found at extreme ends of the list, regardless of which end(s) that is (e.g. top 8 and bottom 2 should give an extremely low p-value). Initially, we were splitting the list, for each annotation, into positive-cosine fingerprints and negative-cosine fingerprints and testing enrichment on both separately, but we think the current approach is better as it reflects better the cases we want to detect and considers all available examples for a given annotation in one test. In sum, yes, in this case drugs used to treat depression were mostly in the positive-cosine side, but the other drugs on the negative-cosine side also contributed to what the p-value is, so it reflects better the analysis to say “correlating and/or anticorrelating”. You can read more about our logic for the analysis in Methods (section <italic>Behavioural pharmacology from</italic> sorl1 <italic>F0 knockout’s fingerprint</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors conclude the above-described section by stating: &quot;<italic>sorl1</italic> knockout larvae behaved similarly to larvae treated with small molecules targeting serotonin signaling, suggesting that the loss of Sorl1 disrupted serotonin signaling.&quot; Directionality here may be important. Are all of the drugs targeting the serotonin transporter SSRIs or similar? If so, then a correct statement would be that loss of Sorl1 causes similar phenotypes to drugs enhancing serotonin signaling. Finally, based on the correlation between serotonin transporter inhibitor trazodone and the <italic>sorl1</italic> crispant phenotype, it is potentially surprising that the SSRI citalopram caused the opposite phenotype from <italic>sorl1</italic>, that is, increased sleep during the day and night. It is potentially interesting that this result was enhanced in mutants, and suggests dysfunction of serotonin signaling, but the statement that &quot;our behavioral pharmacology approach correctly predicted from behaviour alone that serotonin signaling was disrupted&quot; is too strong a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand “disrupt” as potentially going either way, but this may not be the common usage. We changed to “altered”.</p><p>The point regarding directionality is excellent, however. We tested the proportion of serotonin transporter agonists and antagonists (SSRIs) on each side of the ranked list of small molecule fingerprints. We used the STITCH database for this analysis as it has more drug–target interactions, but likely less curated, than the Therapeutic Target Database (Szklarczyk et al., 2016). As with the Therapeutic Target Database, most fingerprints of compounds interacting with the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 were found on the side of positive cosines (p ~ 0.005 using the custom permutation test), which replicates Fig. 5a with a different source for the drug–target annotations (Author response image 5). On the side of positive cosines (small molecules which generate behavioural fingerprints correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint), there were 2 agonists and 26 antagonists. On the side of negative cosines (small molecules which generate behavioural fingerprints anti-correlating with the <italic>sorl1</italic> fingerprint), there were 3 agonists and 2 antagonists. Using a Chi-squared test, this suggests a significant (p = 0.002) over-representation of antagonists (SSRIs) on the positive side (expected count = 24, vs. 26 observed) and agonists on the negative side (expected count = 1, vs. 3 observed). If SLC6A4 antagonists, i.e. SSRIs, indeed tend to cause a similar behavioural phenotype than knockout of <italic>sorl1</italic>, this would point in the direction of our original interpretation of the citalopram experiment; which was that excessive serotonin signalling is what causes the <italic>sorl1</italic> behavioural phenotype.</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Using the STITCH database as source of annotations also predicts SLC6A4 as an enriched target for the <italic>sorl1</italic> behavioural fingerprint.</title><p>Same figures as Fig. 5a,b but using the STITCH database (Szklarczyk et al., 2016) as source for the drug targets.

However, we do not think that focusing on the significant behavioural parameters necessarily make sense here. Rather, one should take all parameters into account to conclude whether knockouts react differently to the drug than wild types (also see answer to Reviewer #3, (7) on this). For example, citalopram increased <italic>more</italic> the night-time sleep bout length of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts than the one of controls (Fig. 5), but this parameter was not modified by knockout of <italic>sorl1</italic> (Fig. 4).

It is not a zero-sum game, and there is plenty to learn from proteomics, metabolomics, etc. I suspect nobody will argue with the authors saying they leveraged the strength of their system and focused on key AD genes of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>From your point below, we understand the following quote is the source of the issue: “For finding causal processes, studying the genome, rather than the transcriptome or epigenome, is advantageous because the chronology from genomic variant to disease is unambiguous […]”. We did not want to suggest it is a zero-sum game, but we now understand how it can be read this way. We adapted slightly the wording. What we want to do is highlight the causality argument as the advantage of the genomics approach. We feel we do not read this argument often enough, while it remains a ‘magic power’ of genomics. One essentially does not have to worry about causality when studying a pathogenic germline variant, while it is a constant concern when studying the transcriptome or epigenome (i.e. did the change in this transcript’s level cause disease, or vice-versa?). To take an example in the context of AD, arguments based on genomics (e.g. Down syndrome or <italic>APP</italic> duplication) are often the definite arbiters when debating the amyloid hypothesis, exactly because their causality cannot be doubted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>(1) The opening of the introduction is perhaps overly broad, spending an entire paragraph on genome vs transcriptome, etc and making the claim that a gene-first approach is the best path. It isn't zero-sum, and the authors could just get right into AD and study genes of interest. Similar issues occur throughout the manuscript, with sentences/paragraphs that are not necessarily needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our answer to your previous point. On the introduction being overly broad, we perfectly agree it is broad, but related to your point about presenting sleep and AD in the Introduction, we wish to talk about finding causal processes from genomics findings using behavioural pharmacology. We purposefully present research on AD as one instance of this broader goal, not the primary topic of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example are these sentences, which could be totally removed as the following paragraph starts off making the same point much more succinctly. &quot;From genomic studies of AD, we know that mutations in genes such as SORL1 modify risk by disrupting some biological processes. Presumably, the same processes are disrupted in zebrafish sorl1 knockouts, and some caused the behavioural alterations we observed. Can we now follow the thread backwards and predict some of the biological processes in which Sorl1 is involved based on the behavioural profile of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, but we think these sentences are useful to place back this Results section in the context of the Introduction. Think of the paper as mainly about the behavioural pharmacology approach, not on Alzheimer’s risk genes. The function of the paragraph here is not simply to explain the method by which we decided to study <italic>sorl1</italic>; it is to reiterate the rationale behind the behavioural pharmacology approach so that the reader understands where this Results section fits in the overall structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to the above, the authors use lecanemab as an example to support their approach, but there has been a great deal of controversy regarding this drug. I don't think such extensive justification is needed. This study uses AD risk genes as a case study in a newly developed behavioral pharm pipeline. A great deal of the rest of the intro seems to just fill space and could be more focused on the study at hand. Interestingly, after gene selection, the next step in their pipeline is sleep/wake analysis yet nothing is covered about AD and sleep in the intro. Some justification of that approach (why focus on sleep/wake as a starting point for behavioral pharm rather than learning and memory?) would be a better use of intro space.</p></disp-quote><p>There has indeed been controversy about lecanemab, but even the harshest critiques of the amyloid hypothesis concede that it slows down cognitive decline (Espay et al., 2023). That is all that is needed to support our argument, which is that research on AD started primarily from genomics and thereby yielded a disease-modifying drug. The controversy seems mostly focused on whether this effect size is clinically significant, and we think we correctly represent this uncertainty (e.g. “antibodies against Aβ such as lecanemab show promise in slowing down disease progression” and “the beneficial effects from targeting Aβ aggregaRon currently remain modest”).</p><p>Your next point is entirely fair. We mostly answered it above. To explain further, the primary reason why we measured sleep/wake behaviour is to match the behavioural dataset from Rihel et al., 2010 so we can use it to make predictions, not to study sleep in the context of AD <italic>per se</italic>. Sure, perhaps learning and memory would have been interesting, but we do not know of any study testing thousands of small molecules on zebrafish larvae during a memory task. We understand it can be slightly confusing though, as we then spend a paragraph of Discussion on sleep as a causal process in AD, but we obviously need to discuss this topic given the findings. However, to reiterate, we purposefully designed FramebyFrame and ZOLTAR to be useful beyond studying sleep/wake behaviour. For example, FramebyFrame would not calculate 17 behavioural parameters if the only goal was to measure sleep. We now mention the Rihel et al., 2010 study in the Introduction as you suggested above (“Far more detail on the behavioral pharm screen […]”), as that is the real reason why sleep/wake behaviour was measured in the first place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Also related to the above, another more relevant point that could be talked about in the intro is the need for more refined approaches to analyze sleep in zebrafish, given the effort that went into the new analysis system described here. Again, I think the context for why the authors developed this system would be more meaningful than the current content.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we think we answered this point above (especially below Limitations of current zebrafish sleep/arousal assays […]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) GWAS can stand for Genome-wide associate studies (plural) so I do not think the extra &quot;s&quot; is needed (GWASs) .</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, that seems to be the common usage. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) AD candidate risk genes were determined from loci using &quot;mainly statistic colocalization&quot;. Can the authors add a few more details about what was done and what the &quot;mainly&quot; caveat refers to?</p></disp-quote><p>“Mainly” simply refers to the fact that other methods were used by Schwartzentruber et al. (2021) to annotate the GWAS loci with likely causal genes, but that most calls were ultimately made from statistic colocalisation. Readers can refer to this work to learn more about the methods used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors write &quot;The loss of psen1 only had mild effects on behaviour&quot; but I think they mean &quot;sleep behaviors&quot; as there could be many other behaviors that are disrupted but were not assessed. The same issue a few sentences later with &quot;Behaviour during the day was not affected&quot; and at the end of the following paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that would be more precise, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) For the Sorl1 pharmacology data, it is very hard to understand what is being measured behaviorally. Are the authors measuring sleep +/- citalopram, or something else, and why the change to Euclidean distance rather than all the measures we were just introduced to earlier in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand these plots (Fig. 5c,d) are less intuitive, but it is important that we show the difference in behaviour compared to H<sub>2</sub>O-treated larvae of same genotype. The claim is that citalopram has a larger effect on knockouts than on controls, so the reader needs to focus on the effect of the drug on each genotype, not on the effect of <italic>sorl1</italic> knockout. We added the standard fingerprints (i.e. setting controls to z-score = 0) here in Author response figures.</p><p>Euclidean distance takes as input all the measures we introduced. The point is precisely not to select a single measure. For example, say we were only plotting active bout number during the day, we would conclude that 10 µM citalopram has the same effect on knockouts and controls. Conversely, if we had taken sleep bout length at night, we would conclude 10 µM has a stronger effect on knockouts. What is the correct parameter to select? Using Euclidean distance resolves this by taking all parameters into account, rather than arbitrarily choosing one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And what exactly is a &quot;given spike in serotonin&quot;? and how is this hypothesis the conclusion based on the lack of evidence for the second hypothesis? As the authors say, there could be other ways <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts are more sensitive to citalopram, so the absence of evidence for one hypothesis certainly does not support the other hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We mean a given release of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. We have fixed this wording.</p><p>We tend to disagree on the second point. We can think of two ways that <italic>sorl1</italic> knockouts are more sensitive to citalopram: (1) they produce more serotonin, so blocking reuptake causes a larger spike in knockouts; or (2) blocking reuptake causes the same increase in both knockouts and wild-types but knockouts react more strongly to serotonin. We cannot in fact think of another way to explain the citalopram results. Not finding overwhelming evidence for (1) surely supports (2) somewhat, even if we do not have direct evidence for it. As an analogy, if two diagnoses are possible for a patient, testing negative for the first one supports the other one, even before it is directly tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Again some language is used without enough care. Fish are referred to as &quot;drowsier&quot; under some drug conditions. How do the authors know the animal is drowsy? The phenotype is more specific - more sleep, less activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we switched to “Furthermore, fenoprofen worsened the day-time hypoactivity of <italic>psen2</italic> knockout larvae […]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) This sentence is misleading as it gives the impression that results in this manuscript suggest the conclusion: &quot;Our observation that disruption of genes associated with AD diagnosis after 65 years reduces sleep in 7-day zebrafish larvae suggest that disrupted sleep may be a common mechanism through which these genes exert an effect on risk.&quot; That idea is widely held in the field, and numerous other previous manuscripts/reviews should be cited for clarity of where this hypothesis came from.</p></disp-quote><p>This idea is not widely held in the field. You likely read this point as “disrupted sleep is a risk factor for AD”, which, yes, is widely discussed in the field, but is not precisely what we are saying. We hypothesise that mutations in some of the Alzheimer’s risk genes <italic>cause</italic> disrupted sleep, possibly from a very early age, which then causes AD decades later. Studies and reviews on sleep and AD rarely make this hypothesis, at least not explicitly. The closest we know of are a few recent human genetics studies, typically using Mendelian Randomisation, finding that higher genetic risk of AD correlates with some sleep phenotypes, such as sleep duration (Chen et al., 2022; Leng et al., 2021). The work of Muto et al. (2021) is particularly interesting as it found correlations between higher genetic risk of AD and some sleep phenotypes in men in their early twenties, which seems unlikely to be a consequence of early pathology (Muto et al., 2021). Note, however, that even these studies do not mention sleep possibly being disrupted early in development, which is what our findings in zebrafish larvae support. As we mention, we think a team should test whether sleep is different in infants at higher genetic risk of AD, essentially performing an analogous, but obviously much more difficult, experiment as we did in zebrafish larvae. We do not know of any study testing this or even raising this idea, so evidently it is not widely held. Having said that, the studies we mention here were not referenced in the Discussion paragraph. We have now corrected this.</p><p>Ashlin TG, Blunsom NJ, Ghosh M, Cockcroft S, Rihel J. 2018.
