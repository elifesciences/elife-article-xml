signaling interface with the host cell. Here, we show that the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu) 1 localizes in the inclusion membrane and faces the cytosol with the active deubiquitinating enzyme domain. The structure of this domain revealed high similarity to mammalian deubiquitinases with a unique α-helix close to the substrate-binding pocket. We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> for IFNγ and impaired infection in mice. Thus, the chlamydial inclusion serves as an enriched site for a deubiquitinating activity exerting a function in selective stabilization of host proteins and protection from host defense.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21465.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21465.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></kwd><kwd>deubiquitinase</kwd><kwd>Mcl-1</kwd><kwd>cell-autonomous defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI125929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Kelly S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dimond</surname><given-names>Zoe</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott Hefty</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Kelly S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 630, project B9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kisker</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Rudel</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudel</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Obligate intracellular Chlamydia secrete a deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu1) into the membrane of the Chlamydia-containing vacuole to deubiquitinate selected host proteins and support the survival of the bacteria during genital infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is an obligate intracellular, gram-negative human pathogen that infects hundreds of millions of people every year to cause trachoma and blindness or sexually transmitted diseases (STD), which can lead to ectopic pregnancy and infertility. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has a biphasic life-cycle starting with the infection of the host cell by the non-replicating elementary body (EB). Once the EB entered the cell, it differentiates into the metabolic active reticulate body (RB) and replicates inside a vacuole, the so-called chlamydial inclusion. To complete the developmental cycle, the RBs re-differentiate into the infectious EBs, which are released by host cell lysis or extrusion. During replication, the bacteria secrete several effector proteins through type two- (T2SS) or three-secretion systems (T3SS) to intrude in cellular processes for their benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subtil et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valdivia, 2008</xref>). Proteins secreted via the T3SS may reside in the inclusion membrane (so-called Inc proteins) or other cellular compartments. Inc proteins in general interact with numerous different host proteins thereby orchestrating processes like vesicular trafficking and signaling cascades essential for inclusion formation and bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the full dependence on the host cell for replication, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> established strategies to prevent apoptosis to sustain their favored environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharma and Rudel, 2009</xref>). During bacterial entry into the host cell, the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT survival signaling pathways are activated that in turn mediate the transcriptional up-regulation and stabilization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajalingam et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-mediated apoptosis resistance in human cells, Mcl-1 is crucial because depletion of Mcl-1 sensitizes infected cells to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajalingam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rödel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many cellular processes, including apoptosis, are orchestrated by the regulated stabilization and destabilization of proteins. For example, in order to induce apoptosis, various members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family have to be degraded to alter the ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. A major pathway for regulating protein stability is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that recognizes proteins modified with ubiquitin, an evolutionary conserved protein. Attachment of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a highly conserved enzymatic cascade in which the E3 ligase mediates substrate specificity. The most prominent K48-linked poly-ubiquitination is a signal for proteasomal degradation, whereas other forms of ubiquitination alter protein function or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vucic et al., 2011</xref>). Ubiquitination is a strictly regulated but reversible process catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can be categorized in five classes and are either cysteine proteases or metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nijman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ha and Kim, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 protein family regulating mitochondrial apoptosis signaling is adjusted by the UPS, too. Generally, the anti-apoptotic feature of Mcl-1 is based on its abundance in the cell and its degradation is an important step in the switch from survival to apoptosis. Here, the ubiquitin ligases MULE and the SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> complex as well as the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X mainly control the protein turnover of Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inuzuka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwickart et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is so far unknown by which mechanism <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> stabilize Mcl-1 upon infection.</p><p>Due to the fact that the UPS is such a powerful instrument to regulate cellular processes like the cell cycle, immune response or apoptosis, pathogens evolved several strategies to manipulate the UPS for their benefits. Many pathogens encode for effectors hijacking cellular components of the UPS or that possess ubiquitin ligase or deubiquitinase activity to interfere with ubiquitination or deubiquitination processes of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelmann and Kessler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribet and Cossart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furtado et al., 2013</xref>). The chlamydial effector proteins ChlaDUB1 (CTL0247) and ChlaDUB2 (CTL0246), in the following termed Cdu1 and Cdu2, were demonstrated to have in vitro deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). One of the Cdu1 targets was suggested to be IκBα, which may prevent NFκB signaling and immune response to ensure survival inside the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Negrate et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, Cdu1 enzyme was shown to localize to the inclusion membrane and stabilize Mcl-1 by deubiquitination. However, Mcl-1 protein levels decline only marginally in cells infected with a Cdu1 mutant strain of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> suggesting that keeping high Mcl-1 levels is regulated at multiple levels. Interestingly, the Cdu1 mutant was severely affected in its development upon IFNγ challenge in vitro and survival in mouse genital infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mcl-1 stabilization during chlamydial infection is related to altered ubiquitination</title><p>The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 has been identified in an RNA interference screen as a host cell protein important for apoptosis resistance in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Mcl-1 protein levels strongly increase upon 16 hr post infection (hpi) and remain high until the end of the chlamydial developmental cycle. Augmented Mcl-1 levels are the result of increased protein expression initially triggered by the Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajalingam et al., 2008</xref>). However, preventing Mcl-1 de novo protein synthesis by treatment of the cells with cycloheximide (CHX) or decreasing MCL1 gene transcription by blocking MEK/ERK signaling with the inhibitor UO126 revealed extended stabilization of Mcl-1 in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The mechanism of prolonged Mcl-1 stabilization during the replicative stages of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection is unknown.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms of Mcl-1 stabilization during <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection, protein ubiquitination patterns were examined during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection. HeLa cells were infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> at a MOI of 1 and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added 20 hpi to avoid degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. One hour later, an apoptosis stimulus was given using TNFα/CHX and the cell lysate or precipitated Mcl-1 was analyzed for ubiquitination by immunoblotting. Compared to non-stimulated control cells, a mild increase in ubiquitination as a result of apoptosis signaling was detected after TNFα/CHX treatment in uninfected, but not in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Interestingly, Mcl-1 ubiquitination was reduced in infected cells independently of the TNFα/CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Reduced ubiquitination protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation and may lead to Mcl-1 accumulation, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajalingam et al., 2008</xref>). Since even the mild increase in Mcl-1 levels causes protection from apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), this stabilized Mcl-1 will interfere with apoptosis induction in infected cells. The anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1 depends on its interaction with pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to block apoptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Bim is known to interact with Mcl-1 and both could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) suggesting that Mcl-1 is active in sequestering Bim in infected cells. Many cancer cells have increased levels of Mcl-1 protein due to the misregulation of cellular UPS factors like MULE, USP9X and components of the SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwickart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inuzuka et al., 2011</xref>) which promotes apoptosis resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cooper, 2007</xref>). However, all these ubiquitin-modifying proteins were present at similar levels in control and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). The ubiquitin ligase activity of SCF E3 ligase complexes can be altered by neddylation of the Cullin subunit, but no difference in the protein level of Cullin 1 or its modification by Nedd8 was observed in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells compared to uninfected control cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21465.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mcl-1 is deubiquitinated during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<italic>Ctr</italic>) (MOI 1) and 20 hpi the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 µM) was added and apoptosis was induced by treatment with TNFα/CHX for 2.5 hr.

The Cdu1 (155-401) fragment crystallized in space group P2<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and at a resolution of 1.7 Å.

The catalytic cysteine, Cys345, is located at the N-terminus of α-helix F, which is ‘sandwiched’ in between a set of three anti-parallel β-strands (1,2,3) and two extra α-helices, A and G, which are perpendicular to each other. β-strands 2 and 3 also contain the two other residues of the catalytic triad, His275 and Asp292.

The crystal structure of Ulp1 in complex with the ubiquitin like protein SMT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) reveals the direction in which the C-terminal glycine of SMT3 approaches the active site cysteine. This path seems to be conserved between the two enzymes. Remarkably, however, a small loop between β-strands 1 and 2 (shown in yellow) in Ulp1 contrasts with the much bigger α-helix D in Cdu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in between the equivalent β-strands of both structures. The same phenomenon can also be observed when comparing Cdu1 with the human SENP8 protein in complex with a Nedd8 aldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reverter et al., 2005</xref>), with whom Cdu1 shares 11% identity within 208 amino acids. Although larger than in Ulp1, the loop between β-strands 1 and 2 fails to adopt the helical architecture observed in Cdu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast to this difference, the residues within the active site are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), further supporting the notion that Cdu1 forms a complex with ubiquitin in a similar way as observed between SENP8 and Nedd8 or Ulp1 and SMT3, respectively. The additional α-helix D in Cdu1, a feature not observed in the other structures, however, may play a regulatory role in substrate binding or recognition. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the analysis of Pruneda et al. where deletion of this region (residues 250 to 272) prevented Cdu1 from binding ubiquitin/Nedd8 suicide probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, an insertion of identical length as observed in Cdu1 seems to be present in the Cdu1 proteins encoded by the genomes of <italic>C. suis, C. muridarum, C. psittaci, C. gallinaceai</italic> and Cdu2 from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> suggesting that it is a conserved feature across the chlamydial deubiquitinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cdu1 and Mcl-1 interact with each other</title><p>To investigate if Mcl-1 is a substrate of Cdu1 and whether these two proteins interact in infected cells, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed to co-localize both proteins in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against recombinant Cdu1 detected Cdu1 inside the inclusion 24 hpi co-localizing with bacterial particles. Major amounts of Cdu1 were also detected at the surface of the inclusion co-localizing with the inclusion membrane protein IncA, where it might be anchored by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, Cdu1 could not be detected in the host cell cytoplasm as it had been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Negrate et al., 2008</xref>). To obtain further proof for a localization of Cdu1 around the inclusion, recombinant <italic>Chlamydia</italic> were generated which express a FLAG-tagged version of Cdu1 that could be detected by an anti-FLAG antibody. Since Cdu1 is subjected to a tight transcriptional regulation during the chlamydial developmental cycle, the expression of the recombinant gene under the control of the original <italic>cdu1</italic> promoter was established. In a first approach, the plasmid pAH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was designed, which cannot replicate in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> but can integrate in part into the genome by homologous recombination.

Mcl-1 but not p53, another high turnover protein constantly targeted for ubiquitination, precipitated together with Cdu1 confirming Cdu1 substrate specificity for Mcl-1.

The direct binding of both proteins to each other was addressed using recombinant purified proteins in in vitro binding assays.

GST-Mcl-1 bound exclusively to His-Cdu1, demonstrating a direct interaction of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cdu1 reduces ubiquitinated forms of Mcl-1 in cell culture</title><p>Since Mcl-1 and Cdu1 interact with each other and share the same subcellular localization during infection, Cdu1 expression should stabilize Mcl-1 even in the absence of infection. HEK-293T cells were transfected with Cdu1-FLAG or an inactive mutated form of the enzyme that carried an amino acid exchange of the catalytically active cysteine 345 to alanine (Cdu1(C345A)). Overexpression of Cdu1-FLAG led to a specific stabilization of Mcl-1 since Bcl-2, another anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and several <underline>i</underline>nhibitor of <underline>a</underline>poptosis <underline>p</underline>roteins (IAPs) were not affected by Cdu1-FLAG overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Overexpression of the mutant Cdu1(C345A) could not stabilize Mcl-1 to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), suggesting that chlamydial Cdu1 alone is able to stabilize Mcl-1, very likely by deubiquitination. To confirm Mcl-1 deubiquitination by Cdu1 expression, Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated by its myc-tag under denaturing conditions from HEK-293T cells expressing HA-ubiquitin, myc-Mcl-1 and Cdu1-FLAG, Cdu1(C345A)-FLAG or empty vector control. The degree of poly-ubiquitination was higher if Mcl-1 was precipitated from cells co-transfected with the empty vector or inactive Cdu1(C345A)-FLAG compared to cells co-expressing Cdu1-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). The final proof that Cdu1 directly deubiquitinates Mcl-1 was provided in an in vitro deubiquitination assay. Purified recombinant Mcl-1 was poly-ubiquitinated in vitro and was subsequently used as substrate for purified recombinant Cdu1, its mutant Cdu1(C345A) or the unrelated deubiquitinase UCH-L3. Cdu1, but not the control enzyme UCH-L3 strongly deubiquitinated Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Deubiquitination of Mcl-1 was dependent on its enzymatic activity, since neither the Cdu1(C345A) mutant nor the wild-type enzyme blocked with the universal cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) deubiquitinated Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, poly-ubiquitinated proteins were isolated by TUBE pull down and incubated with Cdu1 or the control DUB USP28. Cdu1 specifically deubiquitinated Mcl-1 but not the control protein p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This in vitro deubiquitination assays confirms that Mcl-1 is a substrate of Cdu1. It has already been demonstrated in vitro that Cdu1 is a deubiquitinase and deneddylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>).

In another approach, transposon mutagenesis using a <italic>Himar1</italic> transposon system was established in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. One of the resulting mutant strains (<italic>Ctr cdu1</italic>::Tn <italic>bla</italic>), termed <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1,</italic> had a transposon inserted in the active site of Cdu1, resulting in a truncated version with 297 amino acids and an apparent molecular weight of 33 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To confirm the transposon insertion site and discover any other potential genetic differences that may contribute the phenotypes observed between <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> parental and Tn<italic>-cdu1</italic> mutant clones, genomic sequencing and analysis was performed. Comparison of the parental clone to the reference LGV 434/Bu genome revealed two mutations. One mutation (base 946,499) was in the coding region for CTL0818 (helicase) that resulted in an amino acid substitution (N1115H). The other was in CTL0817 (<italic>brnQ</italic>) and also resulted in a substitution (R275H). Interestingly, the reads for these mutations indicated a mixed population with 37% (CTL0818) and 65% (CTL0817) matching the reference strain sequence. Comparison of the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> genome to the parental clone verified that the transposon is located as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and introduces a Y298* non-sense mutation in <italic>cdu1</italic>. Both sites in CTL0818 and CTL0817 that have mixed sequence in the parental strain, uniformly matched the reference strain; however, two new mutations were incurred in the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> strain. One mutation (base 929,586) occurred in the intergenic region between two diverging genes (CTL0805; <italic>hisS</italic> and CTL0806; <italic>uhpC</italic>) and a missense mutation (base 11,738) was found in the gene encoding for RecC (CTL0008) and results in an amino acid substitution (S638Y). Taken together, this analysis reveals that the genomes of the parent and Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> strain are almost identical with the exception of the transposon insertions. While there are two distinct mutations in the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> clone relative to the parent clone, the only modification to a coding region was in RecC (S638Y). These data support that the phenotypes observed of the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> insertional mutant clone are almost definitively due to the functional disruption of the Cdu1 deubiquitinase.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21465.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Cdu1 truncated mutant affects Mcl-1 stabilization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the Cdu1 protein in wild-type (WT) <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and the transposon mutant (Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>) lacking the catalytically active cysteine 345.

Mcl-1 is still recruited to the inclusion of Tn-<italic>cdu1 Chlamydia</italic>, however, the amount of inclusion-associated Mcl-1 is decreased in <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected cells compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Furthermore, chlamydial overexpression of Cdu1 resulted in a slight increase in Mcl-1 accumulation around the inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of the ubiquitination pattern of Mcl-1 isolated from cells infected with wild-type or Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> mutant <italic>Chlamydia</italic> clearly showed that Mcl-1 isolated from cells infected with the mutant bacteria is more ubiquitinated, in particular K48-linked ubiquitinated, compared to the <italic>Ctr</italic> wild-type-infected sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, Mcl-1 still shows reduced ubiquitination in comparison to the uninfected control, which could be a result of the sequestration of Mcl-1 to the inclusion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). It is unclear if Mcl-1 is actively recruited to the inclusion or if it is accumulating by interaction with Cdu1. However, it would be expected that Mcl-1 present at the inclusion surface is more ubiquitinated in the mutant than in the wild-type. Indeed, immunofluorescence staining for ubiquitin or K48-linked ubiquitin and Mcl-1 in <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected cells shows that ubiquitin is accumulating around the inclusion in part co-localizing with Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we show that the inclusion-associated Mcl-1 is strongly ubiquitinated in <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected cells in comparison to cells infected with wild-type <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.

Numerous secreted chlamydial proteins decorate the inclusion surface and function as scaffolds that recruit host trafficking and signaling molecules to the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrate here the localization of the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme Cdu1 to the inclusion surface and its essential role for chlamydial development in IFNγ-challenged cultured cells and in a mouse infection model. This is the first report on a functionally and structurally eukaryotic-like enzyme encoded and secreted by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> that is required for the adaptation and survival of these bacteria. We further show that Cdu1 specifically deubiquitinates the major apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 at the surface of the inclusion.</p><p>Due to the high turn-over rate of Mcl-1, actively growing <italic>Chlamydia</italic> have to interfere with a very well-balanced cellular system consisting of several Mcl-1-specific ubiquitin ligases and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwickart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>) that constantly tune the levels of Mcl-1. Early in infection, expression of Mcl-1 is increased by the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK and the MAPK/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajalingam et al., 2008</xref>). Maintenance of increased Mcl-1 levels in the mid and late phases of infection, however, required in addition stabilization of the protein. We show here that Mcl-1 stabilization is a result of reduced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation induced by the chlamydial Cdu1 that is independent of the known major host UPS factors regulating Mcl-1 stability.</p><p>Mcl-1 may be just one of several Cdu1 targets that are deubiquitinated in infected cells. Furthermore, with the exception of Cdu2, Cdu1 is the only known bacterial DUB that possesses both deubiquitinating and deneddylating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Misaghi et al., 2006</xref>) indicating that also Cdus’ deneddylating activity may be relevant for the intracellular adaptation of the pathogen. The structural similarity between Cdu1, Ulp1 and SENP8 with respect to the position of the catalytic triad suggests that Cdu1 should bind ubiquitin and Nedd8 in a similar way as observed for the Ulp1-SMT3 and SENP8-Nedd8 complexes. A major structural difference, however, is the additional α-helix D in Cdu1, which is not present in the other enzymes, and its proximity to the Ub/Nedd8 C-terminus. We speculate that this helix could act like a ‘lid’ that plays a role in substrate binding and/or recognition and assumes a different orientation when the substrate is bound.</p><p>Defining precisely the intracellular localization of Cdu1 in infected cells surrounding the inclusion was of major importance to understand the mechanism of Mcl-1 stabilization. Although it was not possible to detect secreted Cdu1 in the cytosol, it cannot be excluded that a minor fraction of Cdu1 that escaped detection in the here described approaches is also present in the cytosol of infected host cells, as has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Negrate et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the localization of a major fraction of Cdu1 in the inclusion membrane of cells infected with wild-type and to a lesser extend with <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> coincides with the high enrichment of Mcl-1 in the immediate vicinity of the Cdu1-containing compartment. Enrichment of high amounts of Mcl-1 around the inclusion may result from protein stabilization by Cdu1 in this defined area. However, Mcl-1 may also be actively recruited to the inclusion since the interaction of Cdu1 with endogenous Mcl-1 was shown in living cells. Additionally, the purified recombinant proteins bound to each other in in vitro binding assays suggesting that they interact directly and no additional host factors are required for their interaction outside the inclusion. Since previous work on the cellular Mcl-1 deubiquitinase USP9X demonstrated that deubiquitinase and target do not have to reside in the same cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwickart et al., 2010</xref>) it can be speculated, that inclusion-associated Cdu1 constantly increases the pool of cytosolic Mcl-1 and thereby also the amount of effective anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 at the mitochondria. Our co-localization analysis using SIM clearly demonstrated reduced ubiquitinated Mcl-1 at the inclusion surface of wild-type <italic>Chlamydia</italic> compared to inclusions of the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Here, the targeted recombination into the chlamydial genome based on a newly established protocol for the transformation of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> with a suicide plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) is described. Although the integration of a FLAG-tagged version of Cdu1 into the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> genome replacing the wild-type gene was effective, generating a knock-out by deleting or interrupting the <italic>cdu1</italic> gene close to the N-terminus was not successful. The isolation of Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> demonstrated that at least the catalytic activity of Cdu1 is not essential for chlamydial growth in cultured cells.</p><p>Mouse infection investigations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) support that Cdu1 is important to mammalian infection. While the systems for genetic manipulation have been in development recently, this mouse challenge study presented herein is among the only animal challenge study that has been performed with genetically manipulated <italic>Chlamydia</italic> strains. Moreover, the genetic disruption resulted in a substantial and significant effect on infection with over a log-fold decrease in bacterial burden. While it is unknown what specific aspect of infection is affected by this genetic disruption, a polar effect of the transposon insertion on genes downstream of the Cdu1 coding gene is unlikely, since <italic>cdu2</italic> (Cdu2) is directly downstream of <italic>cdu1</italic> and has been shown to have its own transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albrecht et al., 2010</xref>). Further, Cdu2 does not appear to play a role with Mcl-1 function since it failed to interact with Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>) and Mcl-1 still localizes to the inclusion in the <italic>cdu1</italic> allelic replacement strain (<italic>Ctr</italic> Cdu1-FLAG). Therefore, the loss of Mcl-1 interaction with the chlamydial inclusion and functional effect due to higher ubiquination levels is likely maintained during mammalian infection by the Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> mutant strain. It is important to appreciate that these observations support that <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-directed deubiquitination activities appear to have a substantial effect on mammalian infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa229 (ATCC Cat# CCL-2.1, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1276">CVCL_1276</ext-link>; tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR), HEp-2 (ATCC Cat# CCL-23, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1906">CVCL_1906</ext-link>; tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR), McCoy (ATCC Cat# CRL-1696, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_3742">CVCL_3742</ext-link>; tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR) and primary Fimb (primary cells of human fimbriae obtained from biopsies of patients undergoing medically indicated surgery.

The DNA was transferred to a Nylon-XL membrane (Amersham Hybond-XL, GE Healthcare) by capillary transfer using the denaturation buffer for transfer. After transfer, the membrane was washed with neutralization buffer (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Tri-sodium citrate, 0.5 M Tris, pH 8.0) for 15 min and was subsequently pre-incubated in hybridization buffer (ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridisation Buffer, Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 1 hr of pre-incubation, random primed probes were added to the hybridization buffer and incubated overnight at 42°C. Membranes were washed and exposed over night to phosphor storage screens (Fujifilm), which were then scanned by the Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare). The membrane was stripped with 0.2 M NaOH for 15 min at 42°C every time before a subsequent hybridization with a new probe.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of Cdu1 (155-401)</title><p>The Cdu1 gene (155-401) was amplified and cloned into a pETM-14 vector by the SLIC method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Elledge, 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mads Gyrd-Hansen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript seeks to address the role that a de-ubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu1) made by the bacterial pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> plays in infection of epithelial cells. The premise of the work is that Cdu1 localizes to the surface of the pathogenic vacuole (inclusions) where it recruits the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl1 and stabilizes it by de-ubiquitination, and that this activity contributes to the strong anti-apoptotic state that has been ascribed to cells infected with this pathogen. The mechanism is novel and the premise is appealing. In fact, much of the in vitro binding and deUb activity shown is robust and consistent with what others have reported for ChlaDub, which the authors renamed Cdu1 in this study.</p><p>The study addresses an important aspect of infection biology; how pathogens subvert host responses to ensure efficient infection. The study provides convincing evidence that Cdu1 has DUB activity (this is reported previously by other groups) and that Cdu1 inserts into the <italic>Ctr</italic> vacuole. Importantly, the study provides functional evidence that the DUB activity contributes to the infectious capacity of the pathogen in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main point that needs to be strengthened is the specificity of the role played by Cdu1 in Mcl1 turnover in infected cells including the evidence that Cdu1 exerts its effector function by deubiquitinating and stabilizing MCl-1 and thereby increases cell survival. Overexpression of Cdu1 in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> leading to increased stabilization of Mcl1 in infected cells would be beneficial to demonstrate that Cdu1 plays the key role they propose during infection.</p><p>Also better controls are needed and improvement of quantification methods – true source data to review (i.e. raw densitometry reads, including background reads as opposed to the normalized percentages that were the basis for the bar graphs, and quantification of co-localization patterns).</p><p>Specific points to be addressed by the authors:</p><p>– While ectopic expression of FLAG-Cdu1 (WT and C345A) suggest that Cdu1 can stabilize, MCl-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the MCl-1 levels were largely similar in <italic>Ctr</italic> Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> infected cells (cell type is missing in legend) as in WT Ctr-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Irrespective of this, there also appears to be less mutant Ctr than WT Ctr as judged by the level of cHSP60, which might explain the reduced MCl-1 levels. The biochemical assays to show MCl-1 ubiquitylation are performed by IP of MCl-1 followed by immunoblotting for Ub. The problem with this is that although a &quot;denaturing step&quot; is introduced before the IP, the actual IP is carried out under native conditions and other ubiquitin-modified proteins might therefore be co-purified (specifically or non-specifically). Instead, the authors should purify ubiquitin (by anti-Ub IP or TUBE pulldowns) and immunoblot for MCl-1. Also, ubiquitin IP/pulldown samples should be treated with recombinant DUB (e.g. Cdu1 or another DUB such as USP2 or USP21) to definitely establish that MCl-1 is ubiquitinated.</p><p>– The degree of Mcl1 stabilization varies among experiment shown and the timing for analysis chosen for most experiments is odd: the greatest stabilization is seen at 36h, yet most experiments are performed at 20 or 24h, when stabilization is not very impressive. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> at same time point looks very different from what is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> – very minor difference.</p><p>The quantification methods used for immunoblots. From the Materials and methods section it appears that they are all performed by chemilumiscence followed by densitometry. Such an approach is highly unreliable without appropriate controls showing that quantification is performed in the linear range of the immunodetection assay.</p><p>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows global down-regulation of TNF-induced Ub of host proteins in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infected cells. This suggests low specificity of this de-Ub activity and is inconsistent with the premise that Cdu is selective. Are other known targets of Ub (e.g. IKB) similarly affected?</p><p>– The experiments showing Cdu1 expression and localization are different in different figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> looks different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E &amp; F</xref>, and very different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3E</xref>. In some, it looks like Cdu1 is at the inclusion surface but in other it looks like its on bacteria attached to the inside of the inclusion or within the inclusion- does this localization change over time? Is the FLAG-tagged version behaving like wt? Why is Cdu1 and FLAG not completely co-localized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> make it look like a lot more Cdu1 is present inside the inclusion (bacterial associated?) by 20h.</p><p>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref> represent the exact experiments (different bacterial markers) but the differences in Mcl1-EGFP recruitment are stark. How representative are these images? What is the quantification? If Cdu is over expressed from a plasmid in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is more Mcl1 recruited on the inclusion? The staining with Mcl1 antibodies looks strange. It seems like the images were taken on a high focal plane. Quantification?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Chlamydia-containing vacuole serves as deubiquitination platform to stabilize MCl-1 and to interfere with host defense&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Irrespective of this, there also appears to be less mutant Ctr than WT Ctr as judged by the level of cHSP60, which might explain the reduced MCl-1 levels. The biochemical assays to show MCl-1 ubiquitylation are performed by IP of MCl-1 followed by immunoblotting for Ub. The problem with this is that although a &quot;denaturing step&quot; is introduced before the IP, the actual IP is carried out under native conditions and other ubiquitin-modified proteins might therefore be co-purified (specifically or non-specifically). Instead, the authors should purify ubiquitin (by anti-Ub IP or TUBE pulldowns) and immunoblot for MCl-1. Also, ubiquitin IP/pulldown samples should be treated with recombinant DUB (e.g. Cdu1 or another DUB such as USP2 or USP21) to definitely establish that MCl-1 is ubiquitinated.</italic> </p><p>The ectopic overexpression of Cdu1 in HEK cells demonstrates that Cdu1 alone is responsible for the accumulation of MCl-1 in these cells and this is dependent on the enzymatic activity. However, these experiment were performed under overexpression of Cdu1 in the absence of potential regulation by the bacteria. Therefore, we see a strong MCl-1 accumulation and a clear difference between cells expressing either wildtype of mutated Cdu1 enzyme. On the other hand, Chlamydia use several mechanisms to ensure intracellular survival until the developmental cycle is completed. Among them, Chlamydia activate pro-survival signaling pathways which can also result in increased expression of the <italic>MCl-1</italic> gene. It is very likely, that if one pathways contributing to high MCl-1 levels is blocked, for instance Cdu1 dependent stabilization, Chlamydia are able to compensate via other pathways. This might explain why we do not see a strong difference of MCl-1 levels in cells infected with WT or Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> mutant Chlamydia comparable to the overexpression experiments.</p><p>However, a difference in MCl-1 accumulation between Ctr WT and Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> infected cells is more pronounced if we reduce the intensity of MCl-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. To confirm these results with equal bacterial load, we repeated the infection experiments with Ctr WT and Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> and performed the readout for MCl-1 stabilization at 24 and 30 hpi. The quantification revealed a clear difference in MCl-1 stabilization in Wt and mutant-infected cells (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The results show that MCl-1 stabilization increases with infection progression.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed TUBE pull down of ubiquitinated proteins and probed the pull down for MCl-1 in immunoblot. As already shown in the denaturing IP of MCl-1, there is less ubiquitinated MCl-1 in Ctr WT-infected cells compared to Ctr Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected HeLa cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As suggested by the reviewers, we probed the TUBE-PD for p53, another known ubiquitin-target. However, we do not see any difference in p53-ubiquitination in cells infected with Ctr WT or Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> in TUBE-PD samples.</p><p>Furthermore, we isolated ubiquitinated proteins by TUBE pull down out of uninfected HeLa cells and incubated the eluted proteins with recombinant 20 nM Cdu1 or 50 nM USP28 protein. Subsequently, the reduction on MCl-1 ubiquitination was analyzed by immunoblot. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, only incubation with recombinant Cdu1 but not with USP28 leads to deubiquitination of MCl-1.</p><p>We have described the TUBE pull down and treatment with DUBs in the Materials and method section.</p><p><italic>– The degree of Mcl1 stabilization varies among experiment shown and the timing for analysis chosen for most experiments is odd: the greatest stabilization is seen at 36h, yet most experiments are performed at 20 or 24h, when stabilization is not very impressive. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> at same time point looks very different from what is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> – very minor difference.</italic></p><p><italic>The quantification methods used for immunoblots.

Such an approach is highly unreliable without appropriate controls showing that quantification is performed in the linear range of the immunodetection assay.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the poor description of the experiment in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The infected cells were treated with CHX 24/26/28 h after infection and all samples were lysed at 30 hpi resulting in the different duration of CHX treatment but the same infection time. Therefore, the amount of MCl-1 seen in the untreated sample resembles 30 hpi and not 24 hpi. Furthermore, minor variations in MCl-1 can result from differences in the basal MCl-1 level of the cells.</p><p>As already indicated above, we analyzed MCl-1 stabilization at 24 and 30 hpi in Ctr-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). And in accordance with the reviewers’ statement, there is more MCl-1 stabilization at later time points of infection.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers in one of the following points, we also performed timeframe experiments to monitor Cdu1 secretion by the different <italic>Chlamydia</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). As seen in the pictures, upon 30 or 36 hours of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection the inclusion expands to fill large parts of the cell.</p><p>Performing immunofluorescence experiments to analyze protein recruitment at 30 or 36 hpi would possibly give false positive results. Furthermore, during the late phase of infection, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> secrete multiple proteases into the inclusion lumen which make experiments like immunoprecipitation or TUBE pull down experiments difficult due to protein degradation. We therefore chose the 24 hpi time point as suitable for all experiments (MCl-1 expression, immunofluorescence, IP). However, the TUBE-pull down experiments were now performed at 27 hpi.</p><p>Other as suspected by the reviewers, the quantification of the immunoblots was not performed by densitometry but by quantitative chemiluminescence with the help of an INTAS imaging system as it was stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows global down-regulation of TNF-induced Ub of host proteins in Chlamydia infected cells. This suggests low specificity of this de-Ub activity and is inconsistent with the premise that Cdu is selective. Are other known targets of Ub (e.g. IKB) similarly affected?</italic> </p><p>We don’t see strong global down-regulation of protein ubiquitination upon <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection and TNFα treatment (see quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We included the TNFα treatment in this experiment to induce MCl-1 ubiquitination by the cell. However, we do not see any difference in MCl-1 ubiquitination between uninduced and TNFα-induced samples but there is less MCl-1 ubiquitinated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells independent of TNFα-stimuli which is the major finding of this experiment. Furthermore, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, there is no difference in the global amount of ubiquitinated proteins in uninfected and Chlamydia WT- as well as Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected cells.</p><p>In addition, an overexpression of Cdu1 in cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) does not reduce the global amount of ubiquitinated proteins which strengthens the hypothesis of Cdu1 being selective. Till now, we did not identify all substrates of Cdu1, but we believe that besides MCl-1 there are additional proteins targeted by Cdu1.</p><p>Moreover, the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were obtained from <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells and even if there is a minor global downregulation of protein ubiquitination after TNFα-treatment in infected cells it could still be the result of any other chlamydial strategy to manipulate the host cell. It is also known that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> manipulate multiple signaling pathways which are often dependent on protein ubiquitination or deubiquitination and just by blocking or activating these pathways (independent of Cdu1-activity) small changes in protein ubiquitination would be detectable.</p><p>To address the specificity of Cdu1, we included p53 as a high turnover protein which is involved in apoptosis signaling as an additional control in the TUBE experiments. The results are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>– The experiments showing Cdu1 expression and localization are different in different Figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> looks different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E &amp; F</xref>, and very different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3E</xref>. In some, it looks like Cdu1 is at the inclusion surface but in other it looks like its on bacteria attached to the inside of the inclusion or within the inclusion- does this localization change over time? Is the FLAG-tagged version behaving like wt? Why is Cdu1 and FLAG not completely co-localized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> make it look like a lot more Cdu1 is present inside the inclusion (bacterial associated?) by 20h.</italic> </p><p>To monitor the dynamics of Cdu1 secretion, we performed timeframe experiments and detected <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and Cdu1 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Upon 20 h of infection, Cdu1 starts to be secreted to the inclusion surface but is also present within the bacterial particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Already 24 hpi, major amounts of Cdu1 are present on the inclusion surface. At 30 hpi, there is even more Cdu1 secreted, but almost the whole cytoplasm of the cell is now filled up by the inclusion (see the nucleus which is visible as a background staining of the Cdu1 antibody). Working with cells infected for 30 h is quite challenging and proper analysis of MCl-1 recruitment to the inclusion by immunofluorescence staining is almost impossible. Therefore, we chose the time point of 24 to 26 hpi for all performed experiments to be able to compare the results of the different experiments.</p><p>We now changed the infection protocol to a reduced volume of infection media and a media exchange 1 hpi to reduce the variations in developmental cycle progression.</p><p><italic>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref> represent the exact experiments (different bacterial markers) but the differences in Mcl1-EGFP recruitment are stark. How representative are these images? What is the quantification? If Cdu is over expressed from a plasmid in Chlamydia is more Mcl1 recruited on the inclusion? The staining with Mcl1 antibodies looks strange. It seems like the images were taken on a high focal plane. Quantification?</italic> </p><p>The GFP-expression in the two representative cells is very different and therefore the GFP-Mcl1 recruitment in the background of the strong expression is not that visible. We exchanged the representative pictures with equal GFP-protein expression. See new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>The transfection rate to obtain GFP-MCl-1 positive was relatively low. Therefore, we quantified MCl-1-decorated inclusions from fixed cells stained for MCl-1, cHSP60 (<italic>Chlamydia</italic>) and DAPI and analyzed them by confocal microscopy (see representative pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>+B). The quantification of rings was done using the cell counter plugin (FIJI) followed by automated counting of the cell nucleus (stained with DAPI) and the number of chlamydial inclusions (stained against HSP60) using the object count plugin form (FIJI). The percentage of chlamydial inclusions decorated with rings was calculated by diving the number of rings by the total number of chlamydial inclusions observed in each picture. Details are described in the Materials and methods section starting in subsection “Immunolourescence microscopy and image processing”. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> shows the relative number of MCl-1-decorated chlamydial inclusions of WT and Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>-infected cells with a significant lower number in case of mutant inclusions.</p><p>To address, if inactivation of Cdu1 reduces or Cdu1 overexpression increases amounts of MCl-1, we analyzed area and intensity of MCl-1 rings around the chlamydial inclusions. For comparison of Ctr WT vs. Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic> the above described pictures were analyzed. In addition, HeLa cells infected with Ctr pTet/Cdu1-FLAG and induced for Cdu1 overexpression by addition of AHT were fixed 24 hpi and stained for MCl-1, cHSP60 and DAPI. Intensity of the MCl-1 rings decorating chlamydial inclusions in WT, Tn-<italic>Cdu1</italic>, pTET Cdu1 <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (with and without AHT treatment) were calculated using FIJI after appropriate thresholding for background. Samples were measure for area and intensity of the MCl-1 ring. The absolute intensity was calculated by dividing the observed arbitrary intensity value by the area of the ring which was then plotted to produce the graphs. Results of MCl-1 ring intensity upon Cdu1 inactivation (WT vs. Tn-<italic>cdu1</italic>) or overexpression (pTet/Cdu1 -/+ AHT) are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, respectively. The quantification of these experiments showed a correlation of Cdu1 quantities and MCl-1 stabilization.</p><p>During confocal microscopy of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells we set the focal plane to the inclusion and not the nucleus or basal part of the cell.</p></body></sub-article></article>
