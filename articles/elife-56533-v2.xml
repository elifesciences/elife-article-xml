bacteria predominantly colonize their hosts as multicellular structures called biofilms. A common assumption is that biofilms exclusively interact with their hosts biochemically. However, the contributions of mechanics, while being central to the process of biofilm formation, have been overlooked as a factor influencing host physiology. Specifically, how biofilms form on soft, tissue-like materials remains unknown. Here, we show that biofilms of the pathogens <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> can induce large deformations of soft synthetic hydrogels. Biofilms buildup internal mechanical stress as single cells grow within the elastic matrix. By combining mechanical measurements and mutations in matrix components, we found that biofilms deform by buckling, and that adhesion transmits these forces to their substrates.

Biofilms form when bacteria attach onto a solid surface and divide while embedding themselves in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Toole et al., 2000</xref>). The biofilm matrix is a viscoelastic material generally composed of a mixture of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and cellular debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>). EPS maintains cell-cell cohesion throughout the lifecycle of a biofilm, also making the resident cells more resilient to selective pressures. The biofilm lifestyle provides resident cells with fitness advantages compared to their planktonic counterpart, for example by increasing their tolerance to external chemical stressors such as antimicrobials and host immune effectors. In addition, its mechanical strength and cohesion promotes biofilm integrity against physical challenge such as flow and grazing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mah and O'Toole, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria often colonize the tissues of their host in the form of biofilms. For example, they are a common contributor of infections, as in cystic fibrosis patients who are chronically infected by biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donlan and Costerton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjarnsholt et al., 2013</xref>). Biofilms are also widespread in microbiota, for example as commensals seek to stably associate with host intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Weirdt and Van de Wiele, 2015</xref>). As they grow on or within a host, biofilms must cope with a battery of chemical and physical stressors. In particular, they must inevitably form at the surface of soft biological material composed of host cells or extracellular matrix (ECM). Multiple biophysical explorations have demonstrated the importance of biofilm internal mechanics in morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douarche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). However, and despite host-associated biofilms ubiquitously forming on soft surface, we still lack a rigorous understanding of how the mechanical properties of a substrate impacts the physiology of a biofilm, and reciprocally how biofilms impact the mechanics of soft biological surfaces.</p><p>The growth of single cells embedded within self-secreted EPS drives biofilm formation. During this process, cells locally stretch or compress the elastic matrix, thereby exerting mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douarche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rivera-Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). This local action at the level of single cells collectively generates mechanical stress across the whole biofilm structure. Thus, the combination of biofilm growth and matrix elastic properties imposes buildup of internal mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dufrêne and Persat, 2020</xref>). As a consequence of this stress, bacterial colony biofilms form folds and wrinkles when growing on agar plates or at an air-liquid interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trejo et al., 2013</xref>). These mechanics also influences the spatial organization of single cells within <italic>V. cholerae</italic> immersed biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beroz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drescher et al., 2016</xref>). Internal mechanical stress can also arise by a combination of cell-surface adhesion and growth, influencing the architecture of submerged biofilms and microcolonies. Friction force between the microcolony and the surface opposes biofilm expansion, generating an inward internal stress that leads to a buckling instability verticalizing or reorienting contiguous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beroz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvernoy et al., 2018</xref>). These studies demonstrate the importance of mechanics in biofilm morphogenesis and spatial organization, but their function in the context of host colonization remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigate how biofilms form at the surface of soft material whose mechanical properties replicate the ones encountered in vivo. We show that biofilms from the model pathogens <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can deform soft synthetic hydrogel substrates they grow on. By spatially and quantitatively measuring substrate morphology, we propose a model where biofilms buckle to initiate deformations. By comparing wild-type, EPS matrix hypersecreting and mutant strains, we demonstrate that matrix components maintaining cell-cell cohesion and cell-surface adhesion contribute to the mechanism of substrate deformation. The magnitude of the deformations depends on the stiffness of the material in a range that is physiologically-relevant. Using traction force microscopy, we show that biofilms can generate large mechanical stress reaching up to 100 kPa. Finally, we demonstrate that biofilms can deform and even damage tissue-engineered soft epithelia whose mechanics reproduce the ones of a host tissue. These insights suggest that forces generated by growing biofilms could play a role not only in their morphogenesis, but also in mechanically compromising the physiology of their host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biofilms deform soft substrates</title><p>To understand how biofilms interact with soft surfaces, we first explored their formation on synthetic hydrogel substrates. We generated polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel films via photoinitiated polymerization of PEG diacrylate precursors at the bottom surface of microfluidic channels. These polymeric films are covalently bound to the glass surface to avoid drift and delamination. By using a ‘sandwich’ method for polymerization, we could fabricate flat ~100-µm-thin PEG films that allowed us to perform high resolution live confocal imaging of biofilm formation under flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first used a rugose variant of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> A1152 strain (referred to as <italic>V. cholerae Rg</italic>) which constitutively secretes EPS matrix, thereby forming robust and reproducible biofilms. On soft hydrogels, <italic>V. cholerae Rg</italic> formed biofilms whose bottom surfaces appeared bell-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in striking difference with the typically flat-bottom biofilms that form on hard surfaces such as glass and plastic. To distinguish whether this shape was a result of the deformation of the hydrogel or of the detachment of the biofilm from the surface, we embedded fluorescent tracer particles within the hydrogel film by mixing them with the pre-polymer solution before the cross-linking step. We could observe that the fluorescent tracer particles filled the apparent bell-shaped void at the biofilm core and that the hydrogel surface and the biofilm remained in contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This demonstrates that the soft hydrogel substrate deforms under <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biofilms deform soft substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of experimental setup where we generate thin hydrogel films at the bottom surface of microchannels.

We thus tested whether <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms could deform soft hydrogels. We found that biofilms of <italic>P. aeruginosa wspF<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant (<italic>P. aeruginosa Rg</italic>), which constitutively produces EPS matrix and robustly forms biofilms, could similarly deform soft PEG hydrogels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In summary, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, two model biofilm-forming species with distinct EPS composition are both able to deform soft substrates. This is consistent with a mechanism where biofilms generate mechanical stress on the material they grow on.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Biofilms deform soft substrates after reaching a critical diameter</title><p>How do biofilms mechanically deform hydrogel films? Given the influence of growth-induced internal mechanical stress on biofilm morphology and architecture, we hypothesized that biofilms could deform soft substrates by transmission of internal stresses to the substrate they grow on. To test this hypothesis, we performed dynamic visualizations of the deformations of hydrogel films as biofilms grew. To obtain an accurate deformation profile, we performed a radial re-slicing and averaging around the biofilm center. We could thus extract the deformation profile <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, its maximum deformation amplitude <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and full-width at half maximum <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In these visualizations, we noticed that there was a lag between the increase in biofilm diameter and the onset of deformation, with a finite deformation only appearing after 7 hr of growth. This was further confirmed by following the deformations generated by many biofilms.

To achieve this, we tracked the displacements of the fluorescent tracer particles embedded within the hydrogel in 3D using a digital volume correlation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toyjanova et al., 2014</xref>). At the early stages of hydrogel deformation, we found that in the plane defined by the initial surface at rest, the particles under the biofilm move in the direction of growth. Thus, the strain field shows that the biofilm stretches its substrate radially in the outward direction in addition to vertical deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In other words, a biofilm applies an in-plane stress on the substrate in its growth direction, which is most likely generated by a friction between the biofilm and the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beroz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvernoy et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, the elastic biofilm experiences a force in the opposite direction, toward its center.

To test how biofilms can mechanically perturb host tissue during colonization, we engineered epithelial cell monolayers at the surface of a soft extracellular matrix (ECM). This system replicates the mechanical properties of host epithelia including tissue stiffness and adhesion to underlying ECM. As a result, it constitutes a more realistic host-like environment compared to cell monolayers grown on plastic or glass. We thus engineered epithelial monolayers of enterocyte-like CMT-93 cells on a soft extracellular matrix composed of Matrigel and collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We observed that both <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> generate these deformations, suggesting that it is a feature of biofilm growth and is not species-dependent. We identified key physical and biological components that enable these deformations. In particular, our measurements of hydrogel deformations provide evidence consistent with a mechanism where the biofilm buckles as it grows. This mechanism is reminiscent of Euler buckling where the internal compressive stress in a beam triggers an instability that induces transverse deformations. In our case, we found that the onset of the buckling instability depends on growth under mechanical constraint which generates a buildup of compressive stress. The EPS matrix is a major contributor of the buildup of internal stresses. Indeed, when we compared the rugose variants (matrix overproducer) with the smooth WT strains of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, we observed a decrease or a complete loss of deformation when grown in LB. In fact, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not robustly form biofilms in LB, likely due to poor matrix secretion, making it an unpopular growth medium for flow cell biofilms. In contrast, WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms growing in M9 generated deformations comparable to the ones caused by the rugose variant, suggesting an important link with matrix production. The larger variability in deformation amplitudes in WT compared to <italic>Rg</italic> likely originates from heterogeneity in biofilm matrix secretion and regulation.</p><p>In-plane hydrogel strain measurements indicate a friction between the surface and the expanding biofilm, which promotes buildup of internal stress. Also, the fact that biofilms of the <italic>V. cholerae rbmA</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> EPS genes deletion mutants have reduced or abolished ability to buckle or to deform the surface indicates that cell-cell cohesion in the biofilm may also participate in mechanical constraint. Without cell-cell cohesion and matrix elastic property, the viscous biofilm would flow, dissipating mechanical stress and eluding the elastic instability.</p><p>These two contributions, biofilm-surface friction and matrix elasticity, induce a buildup of compressive stress within the biofilm, ultimately causing buckling. Biofilm adhesion transmits buckling-induced stresses to the substrate, generating deformations. While a full description of the physical deformation mechanism is a complex problem involving biofilm and substrate mechanics, we can already highlight important features from our observations. First, the facts that the onset of deformation occurs at a finite critical biofilm diameter and that the width of the deformation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> scales linearly with this diameter are consistent with an Euler-type buckling instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timoshenko and Gere, 2019</xref>). Also, the slight negative deformations (recess) observed near the edge of larger biofilms is reminiscent of higher order buckling modes. Then, the power-law relationship between deformation and substrate stiffness is qualitatively consistent with the theory of buckling of plates coupled to an elastic foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang, 2005</xref>). The delamination of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> mutants and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on stiff substrates highlight the importance of the balance between adhesion and substrate elasticity in force transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Zhao, 2015</xref>). At the time of delamination, elastic deformation and adhesion energies balance. Thus, biofilm delamination could help estimate the adhesive strengths of specific matrix components. Overall, biofilms mechanically shape their environment via a buckling-adhesion mechanism, reminiscent of the buckling and wrinkling of plates and films on elastic foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang, 2005</xref>). A comprehensive understanding of force generation in biofilms and of substrate response will require further development of mechanical models along with measurements of biofilm internal stresses.</p><p>Internal stress generated by bacterial expansion under physical constrains influences the morphologies of colony biofilms, forming wrinkles, folds, and blisters. The shapes of these colonies are also caused by a buckling/wrinkling-like instability which depends on the mechanical properties of the matrix. These mechanically generated shapes have been observed in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic> and have been instrumental as an obvious phenotype to identify components and regulators of the biofilm matrix and to characterize the mechanics driving multicellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yildiz and Schoolnik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Starkey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilking et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gloag et al., 2018</xref>). However, the impact of these macroscale morphological changes and internal mechanics on the physiology of resident microbes have yet to be identified. Immersed, micrometer scale biofilms that are commonly found in natural microbial niches also undergo architectural transitions due to the emergence of internal mechanical stress. Cell-cell cohesion and cell-substrate adhesion can favor the alignment of single cells within the multicellular structure during biofilm growth. For example, a buckling instability causes <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cell verticalization in the initial step of biofilm formation, in a mechanism that depends on friction of single cells with their glass substrate, generating compressive mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beroz et al., 2018</xref>). Single cells in <italic>E. coli</italic> microcolonies reorient through a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvernoy et al., 2018</xref>). The physiological functions of these cellular rearrangements have however not yet been identified. The buckling-adhesion model we here propose is consistent with the mechanics of immersed and colony biofilms. Our observations suggest that internal mechanical stress can have a function in the interaction between the biofilm and its surrounding environment, influence the morphology and mechanics of its material substrate. This may result in fouling of abiotic surfaces, in damaging competing biofilms or even host tissues.</p><p>Despite being widespread in the environments of microbes, the influence of substrate rigidity is often overlooked in studies of surface attachment and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lichter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolewe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song and Ren, 2014</xref>). Using a materials approach aimed at reproducing a host-like environment, we found that substrate mechanical properties have a strong impact on biofilm development. Biofilm-induced deformations are particularly relevant when considering their growth at the surface of soft biological tissues. We demonstrated that biofilms generate large forces, and that these forces can be transmitted to underlying epithelia. In response, we observed that epithelial monolayers delaminate from their ECM and subsequently bend. The biofilm-generated forces also disrupt epithelial monolayers. Consistent with this, traction force microscopy measurements show that biofilms can generate 100 kPa surface stress, which is larger than the strength of epithelial cell-cell junctions that typically rupture under the kPa stress range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the biofilm opened cell-cell junctions increasing epithelial permeability. Biofilms caused epithelial cell death when removed from the monolayer. These observations suggest that mechanical forces generated by biofilms can impact epithelial integrity, in addition to other well-known chemical factors such as toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2014</xref>). We note that a more realistic epithelium would be protected by a layer of mucus of very low elasticity, which could also be strongly deformed by biofilms. Pathogen like <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can however swim through the mucus layer to reach the epithelium surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartlett et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our visualizations in tissue-engineered epithelia and on hydrogel films suggest that biofilms could mechanically damage host tissues when growing in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, biofilms can cause tissue lesions. For example, the urine of vaginosis patients contains desquamated epithelial cells covered with biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swidsinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardy et al., 2016</xref>). Commensal biofilms form scabs at the epithelial surface of honeybee’s gut, triggering immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engel et al., 2015</xref>). Epithelial integrity is also compromised in intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease in a process that highly depends on the composition of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelakkot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tremaroli and Bäckhed, 2012</xref>). Finally, hyper-biofilm forming clinical variants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cause significant damage to the surrounding host tissue despite its reduced virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pestrak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Most studies of biofilm formation have so far focused on their internal organization and mechanics, and on the genetic regulation of matrix production. How biofilms physically interact with their natural environments has been however vastly unexplored, but could vastly contribute to a holistic understanding of host-microbe interactions. Mechanical interactions between bacterial collectives and their host may thus represent an overlooked contributor of infections, colonization, and dysbiosis. Non-pathogenic biofilm-forming species, including commensals, could thus very well induce epithelial damage and in fact contribute to chronic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Hydrogel solutions were prepared on ice to avoid premature gelation by mixing 750 µl of neutralized collagen with 250 µl of growth-factor reduced Matrigel matrix (Corning, 356231). The neutralized collagen was obtained by mixing 800 µl of native type I collagen isolated from the bovine dermis (5 mg/ml, Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.) with 10 µl of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (1 M), 100 µl of DMEM-FBS and 100 µl of DMEM 10X. We then spread 100 µl of the hydrogel solution in glass bottom dishes (P35G-1.5–20 C, MatTek), which were kept on ice. Excess solution was removed from the sides of the well to avoid the formation of a meniscus. To promote collagen adhesion, the wells were previously functionalized with a 2% polyethyleneimine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and a 0.4% glutaraldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Science) for 30 min.

This ensured that biofilms growing on epithelia formed from single cells. We loaded 200 µL of diluted culture on top of mammalian cells that were cultured for 1 to 7 days post-confluence on collagen/Matrigel gels.

We then glued it to the rim of the dish, where no cells are present. We then connected the inlet port to a disposable syringe (BD Plastipak) filled with culture medium using a 1.09 mm outer diameter polyethylene tube (Instech) and a 27G blunt needle (Instech). The syringes were mounted onto a syringe pump (KD Scientific) positioned inside a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. The volume flow rate was set to 50 µL·min<sup>−1</sup>.

We covered the wells with a coverslip and we let them polymerize in a UV transilluminator (Bio-Rad Universal Hood II) for 5 min. The resulting hydrogel cylinders were immersed in M9 overnight and tested with a rheometer (TA instruments) in compression mode, at a deformation rate of 10 µm/s. Beforehand, the diameter of the cylinders was measured with a digital caliper, while the height of the cylinder was defined as the gap distance at which the force starts differing from zero. The elastic modulus corresponds to the slope of the linear fit of the stress-strain curves in the range of 15% strain. The final modulus is the average modulus of three replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fabrication of thin PEG hydrogel layers and implementation with PDMS microfluidic chip</title><p>We fabricated microfluidic chips following standard soft lithography techniques. More specifically, we designed 2 cm-long, 2 mm-wide channels in Autodesk AutoCAD and printed them on a soft plastic photomask. We then coated silicon wafers with photoresist (SU8 2150, Microchem), with a thickness of 350 µm. The wafer was exposed to UV light through the mask and developed in PGMEA (Sigma-Aldrich) in order to produce a mold. PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was subsequently casted on the mold and cured at 70°C overnight. After cutting out the chips, we punched 1 mm inlet and outlet ports. We finally punched a 3 mm hole right downstream of the inlet port. This hole, after being covered with a PDMS piece, acts as a bubble trap.</p><p>To obtain thin and flat hydrogel layers, a drop of about 80 µL of the hydrogel solution was sandwiched between two coverslips and incubated in the UV transilluminator for 5 min to allow gelation. The bottom coverslip (25 × 60 mm Menzel Gläser) was cleaned with isopropanol and MilliQ water, while the upper one (22 × 40 mm Marienfeld) was functionalized with 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (Sigma-Aldrich) following the standard procedure. In short, cleaned coverslips were immersed in a 200 mL solution of ethanol containing 1 mL of the reagent and 6 ml of dilute acetic acid (1:10 glacial acetic acid:water) for 5 min. They were subsequently rinsed in ethanol and dried. This functionalization enables the covalent linkage of the hydrogel to the coverslip.</p><p>Right after polymerization, the coverslips were separated using a scalpel and thus exposing the hydrogel film surface. We then positioned the PDMS microfluidic chip on top of the hydrogel film. This results in a reversible, but sufficiently strong bond between the hydrogel and the PDMS, allowing us to use the chips under flow without leakage for several days.

For timelapse experiments, biofilms were imaged as soon as the flow was started, while for all the other experiments biofilms were imaged between 10 and 48 hr post-seeding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis and computation of deformation profiles</title><p>Starting from confocal imaging pictures of the microparticle-containing hydrogel, we aimed at identifying the gel surface and extracting quantitative information about its deformation induced by the biofilms. In most cases, we used an automated data analysis pipeline as described below. To get an average profile of the deformation caused by the biofilms, we performed a radial reslice in Fiji over 180 degrees around the center of the deformation (one degree per slice). We then performed an average intensity projection of the obtained stack. To calculate the diameter of the biofilm, we averaged 4 measurements of the biofilm diameter taken at different angles. The resliced images were then imported in Matlab R2017a (Mathworks) as two-dimensional (x-y) matrices of intensities. In these images, the surface was consistently brighter than the rest of the gel. Therefore, we identified the surface profile as the pixels having the maximal intensity in each column of the matrix. Note that the bottom of the gel sometimes also comprised bright pixels that introduced noise in the profile. To reduce this problem, we thus excluded 20 rows at the bottom of each image (~3.7 µm). We then calculated the baseline position of our gel – namely, the height of the non-deformed portion of the gel. In our pictures, this corresponds to the height at the left and right extremities of the profile. Therefore, we defined the baseline as the average of the first 50 and last 50 pixels of the profile (~9 µm on each side of the profile). We then offset the whole picture so that the baseline position corresponded to y = 0. We undersampled the extracted surface profiles to further reduce noise, by keeping only the maximal y value over windows of 40 pixels. Finally, we fitted a smoothing spline to the undersampled profile using the built-in <italic>fit</italic> function in Matlab, with a smoothing parameter value of 0.9999.</p><p>To quantify the deformation that biofilms induced on the hydrogel, we measured the amplitude (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the deformed peak and its full width at half maximum (λ). First, we evaluated the fitted profile described above at a range of points spanning the whole width of the picture and spaced by 0.0005 µm. We identified the maximal value of the profile at these points, which corresponds to the amplitude of the peak <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (with respect to the baseline, which is defined as y = 0). We then split the profile in two: one part on the left of the maximum, and one part on its right. On each side, we found the point on the profile whose y value was the closest to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> using the Matlab function <italic>knnsearch</italic>. We then calculated the distance between their respective x values, which corresponds to the λ of the deformed peak. Our data analysis program also included a quality control feature, which prompted the user to accept or reject the computed parameters. When imaging quality was insufficient to ensure proper quantification with our automated pipeline, we measured the deformation manually in Fiji. Graphs were plotted with OriginPro.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Digital volume correlation and traction force microscopy</title><p>We performed particle tracking to measure local deformations and ultimately compute stress and traction forces within hydrogels as biofilms grew. To do this, we performed timelapse visualizations of the hydrogel during the formation of a biofilm at high spatial resolution with a 60X, NA 0.95 water immersion objective. We thus generated 200 µm x 200 µm x 25 µm (50 stacks of 1200 × 1200 pixels) volumes at 14 different time points. These images were subsequently registered to eliminate drift using the Correct 3D Drift function in Fiji. To compute local material deformations which we anticipated to generate large strains, we used an iterative Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toyjanova et al., 2014</xref>). These were performed with 128 × 128×64 voxel size in cumulative mode, meaning deformations are calculated by iterations between each time point over the whole 4D timelapse, rather than directly from the reference initial image. The DVC code computes material deformation fields in 3D which we subsequently use as input for the associated large deformation traction force microscopy (TFM) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toyjanova et al., 2014</xref>). The TFM calculates stress and strain fields given the material’s Young modulus (<italic>E</italic> = 38 kPa in our case) and Poisson ratio (0.459 taken from measurements for polyacrylamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takigawa et al., 1996</xref>]) to ultimately generate a traction force map at the hydrogel surface.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

They then show that the associated stresses, in the MPa range, can disrupt epithelial monolayers, which is a model system consistent with physiological materials. I am familiar with some of the (mostly recent) literature on deformation associated with biofilms on soft substrates, but I am not aware of any controlled studies of biofilms growing and deforming soft, tissue-like materials consisting of mammalian cells, as the authors do here, where they document the magnitude of the stress and the disruption of soft epithelial cell monolayers (enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells). They then highlight this as a potential means for a mechanical mode of infection. I think the work is very good and very well illustrated. Whereas some of the results and conclusions overlap thematically with recent studies on biofilms deforming soft substrates (e.g. Yan et al., 2019), it goes beyond existing studies with very informative 3D imaging of the deformed shapes, stress measurements, and mechanical damage of the underlying soft materials, and as noted above offers the first evidence that the stresses associated with biofilms growth can disrupt epithelial monolayers, which I do not believe has been recognized, or documented, as a mechanical route to damage of tissues. I think the paper provides valuable new ideas, conclusions, and implications. I did not have any substantial concerns. Admittedly, the most important original conclusion on demonstrating disruption of model epithelial monolayers would be enhanced if some more direct connection was possible to even qualitative observations in clinical medicine or tissue engineering.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that investigates the consequences of mechanical force generated by biofilm communities on its surrounding environment and the intrinsic factors that contribute to generating mechanical forces by these communities. They use two of the paradigm species for studying biofilms in the laboratory: <italic>Pseudomonasaeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. They find that these species generate significant mechanical force that can perturb and deform the surrounding environment. They do so in a biofilm matrix-dependent manner and these forces have the potential to influence a eukaryotic host, suggesting that they may contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p>Overall, I really liked this manuscript.

The data are promising, but fairly qualitative. Characteristics of the monolayer can be measured- such as membrane integrity. What happens in terms of eukaryotic cell survival?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In most cases, the mechanisms by which biofilms impact bacterial pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Research into biofilm-associated pathogenesis has largely focused on either; the coordination of virulence factor and/or toxin production associated with biofilms, or biofilm-associated invasion of the host immune response. Here Cont et al., artfully demonstrate that simple mechanical forces resulting from the process of biofilm formation are strong enough to deform soft hydrogel surfaces and invoke damage to host epithelium. This work is particularly insightful given the established importance of biofilms to the lifecycles and pathogenesis of the two model organisms studied. This work in highly impactful, and offers significant new insights into the impact of biofilms on bacterial infection and pathogenesis.</p><p>One major point of consideration, is that the authors focus on <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonasaeruginosa</italic> strains that over produce biofilm matrix components. What would be the effect of strains that aren't EPS over producers? Would they generate similar forces to EPS over producers, or lower forces that are still enough force to disrupt soft surfaces and/or epithelial cells? Or is part of the force generated due to the overabundance of matrix components? Perhaps further analysis of impacts of a wildtype strain on deformation of hydrogel surfaces would enhance the impact of this work, and further demonstrate the impact of these findings.</p><p>For analysis of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> impacts on soft surfaces in vitro, the experimental setup utilizes a very low flow rate of 10μL/min. The flowrate of fluid through the small intestine where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> establishes infection can vary widely, but averages 2.5mL/min in fasting individuals, and can exceed 20mL/min in individuals after meals [Fine et al., 1995]. Can the authors comment on how increasing the flow rate impact the forces exerted by the biofilms on soft surfaces?</p><p>The authors utilize <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> interactions with Caco-2 as a model for biofilm interactions with host epithelial cells. These experiments nicely show that the forces generated by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms can interfere with epithelial cell-cell interactions to disrupt their integrity. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> largely colonizes portions of the small intestines, where cells are covered by a thick layer of mucin which at physiologic pH can range in stiffness from 11-163 Pa [Sotres et al., 2017]. Given that this is much below the stiffness of the weakest hydrogel tested (12 kPa), can the authors comment on the ability of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to form biofilms on such a weak substrate. Would it serve to provide access to the underlying epithelial layers?</p><p>References:</p><p>Fine KD, Santa Ana CA, Porter JL, Fordtran JS. 1995; Effect of changing intestinal flow rate on a measurement of intestinal permeability.

We provide the responses to the specific comments below. However, we would like to first comment here on the main comment on the effect of EPS overproduction and its comparison with WT strains.</p><p>To address this critical point, we performed extensive experimental characterizations of the differences in substrate deformation behaviors between WT and rugose <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These results are now shown in two new figures: Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The first important conclusion of these additional experiments is that WT strains are also able to deform soft substrates. Second, we observed quantitative differences between WT and rugose variants which we attribute to their distinct abilities to secrete EPS. More specifically, in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, WT formed smaller biofilms which deformed the substrate to a lesser extent than the rugose mutant (Figure 3A). In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, WT cells had the ability to deform the substrate when grown in media conditions allowing for biofilms to form robustly. WT could deform the substrate as much as the rugose, but with more heterogeneity between biofilms (Figure 3C). We went even further as to test the deformation ability of multiple <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain backgrounds which have known differences in their ability to form biofilms. These strains showed distinct ability to deform hydrogels. In particular, N16961 and C6706 deform the substrate more dramatically than A1552 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Altogether, these experiments allow us to demonstrate that deformations are not an artefact from matrix hyper-secretion and is therefore relevant to WT biofilms. The additional experiments also help us better comprehend the contributions of matrix production in the onset of deformations. In addition to the new figures, we modified the manuscript text to discuss these results in subsection “Wild-type and rugose biofilms deform soft-substrates” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that investigates the consequences of mechanical force generated by biofilm communities on its surrounding environment and the intrinsic factors that contribute to generating mechanical forces by these communities.

First, we performed a detailed investigation of the effect of matrix expression levels on the magnitude of substrate deformations. We refer to the response to the Summary for more information. In summary, we show that WT strains have the potential to deform the substrates as much as overproducing strains. Second, we tested a <italic>vpsL</italic> mutant lacking the ability to secret Vps polysaccharide. Consistent with previous reports, this mutant could not form biofilms and we could not observe any substrate deformation as now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A. Our attempts at generating a <italic>rbmC</italic> deletion mutant were not fruitful for reasons we could not control. We however predict that it would produce a similar phenotype as the <italic>bap1</italic> deletion mutant given the similarity of their function in substrate adhesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Other surface relevant appendages influence deformation strength/kinetics- MSHA pili for Vc or type IV pili for Pa? Does rhamnolipid surfactant influence deformation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that pili might play a role in substrate attachment. This is true for single cells in the initial steps of surface colonization. However, little is known about the function of pili within a biofilm in subsequent stages of its formation. Still, we visualized deformation generated by the strain PAO1 <italic>ΔpilA</italic>. We observed that its biofilms can still deform the substrate but to a lower extent compared to PAO1 WT. We show the results below. We however decided to not include this result in the main text as we cannot interpret this data precisely. In fact, the contribution of type IV pili in biofilm mechanics remains undefined as do rhamnolipids and are future research directions for us and others. Similarly, we anticipate that the MSHA pili are only involved in initial adhesion events and do not contribute to biofilm adhesion at later stages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Teschler%20JK%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=25895940">J.

What happens in terms of eukaryotic cell survival?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his/their feedback and agree that further characterization of the tissue would be informative to understand the impact of biofilms on the epithelium. As a result, we performed complementary experiments that further demonstrate the impact of disruptions on the monolayer. We focused on measuring epithelial cell viability and epithelial permeability. We performed viability measurements with the fluorescent indicator Calcein-AM. These visualizations showed that epithelial cells in the biofilms were dead, but cells remaining in the monolayer stayed alive. We performed permeability measurement using a fluorescent Dextran assay. These visualizations show a dramatic increase in permeability upon disruption by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms. We now include these results in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and discuss them in the main text in subsection “Biofilms deform and disrupt epithelial cell monolayers” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In most cases, the mechanisms by which biofilms impact bacterial pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Research into biofilm-associated pathogenesis has largely focused on either; the coordination of virulence factor and/or toxin production associated with biofilms, or biofilm-associated invasion of the host immune response. Here Cont et al., artfully demonstrate that simple mechanical forces resulting from the process of biofilm formation are strong enough to deform soft hydrogel surfaces and invoke damage to host epithelium. This work is particularly insightful given the established importance of biofilms to the lifecycles and pathogenesis of the two model organisms studied. This work in highly impactful, and offers significant new insights into the impact of biofilms on bacterial infection and pathogenesis.</p><p>One major point of consideration, is that the authors focus on <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains that over produce biofilm matrix components. What would be the effect of strains that aren't EPS over producers? Would they generate similar forces to EPS over producers, or lower forces that are still enough force to disrupt soft surfaces and/or epithelial cells? Or is part of the force generated due to the overabundance of matrix components? Perhaps further analysis of impacts of a wildtype strain on deformation of hydrogel surfaces would enhance the impact of this work, and further demonstrate the impact of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback and suggestions which we think make our conclusions stronger. We commented on this point in the Summary. In summary, our new results demonstrate that WT cells can also deform soft substrates, and that the amplitude of deformation likely depends on the amount of matrix production. In particular, we observe that WT has the ability to deform soft substrates as much as the rugose strain, demonstrating their similar abilities to generate force. We however notice that the deformations are less consistent between WT biofilms. The new results are in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and in the text in subsection “Wild-type and rugose biofilms deform soft-substrates” and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For analysis of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> impacts on soft surfaces in vitro, the experimental setup utilizes a very low flow rate of 10μL/min. The flowrate of fluid through the small intestine where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> establishes infection can vary widely, but averages 2.5mL/min in fasting individuals, and can exceed 20mL/min in individuals after meals [1]. Can the authors comment on how increasing the flow rate impact the forces exerted by the biofilms on soft surfaces?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We would like to clarify that the biofilm experiences forces generated by flow near the wall. The magnitude of the flow rate across the entire section of the fluidic system does not capture this shear force. To demonstrate this, we can calculate the shear stress at the surface of our microchannel and at the intestinal epithelium (for a discussion of flow forces on biofilms, see Persat et al., 2015 and Dufrene and Persat, 2020). The flow rates yield shear stress values of maximum 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa in the microchannel and 10<sup>-4</sup> in the intestine. These stresses are at least seven orders of magnitude smaller than the ones we are considering in this work (100 kPa). They therefore generate negligible forces acting on the biofilm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors utilize <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> interactions with Caco-2 as a model for biofilm interactions with host epithelial cells. These experiments nicely show that the forces generated by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilms can interfere with epithelial cell-cell interactions to disrupt their integrity. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> largely colonizes portions of the small intestines, where cells are covered by a thick layer of mucin which at physiologic pH can range in stiffness from 11-163 Pa [2]. Given that this is much below the stiffness of the weakest hydrogel tested (12 kPa), can the authors comment on the ability of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to form biofilms on such a weak substrate. Would it serve to provide access to the underlying epithelial layers?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In fact, we are convinced that the mucus layer is an important aspect that we were unfortunately not able to incorporate in our study. This is mainly due to the current lack of experimental cellular systems producing mucus. However, we predict that biofilms would even more strongly deform the mucus layer due to their very low elasticity. However, the mucus hydrogel is a viscoelastic material which is highly structured and heterogeneous with pore sizes above 500 nm. Previous explorations of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>-mucus interactions suggest that single bacteria can easily penetrate the mucus layer by swimming (Teschler et al., 2015 and Bartlett et al., 2017). Therefore, single cells could not attach on the mucus surface but would rapidly reach the epithelium. To specifically address this point, we modified the manuscript in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
