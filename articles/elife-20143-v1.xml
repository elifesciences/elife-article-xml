pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.001</object-id><p>p97/VCP is an essential, abundant AAA+ ATPase that is conserved throughout eukaryotes, with central functions in diverse processes ranging from protein degradation to DNA damage repair and membrane fusion. p97 has been implicated in the etiology of degenerative diseases and in cancer. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy we reveal how disease-causing mutations in p97 deregulate dynamics of the N-terminal domain that binds adaptor proteins involved in controlling p97 function. Our results provide a molecular basis for understanding how malfunction occurs whereby mutations shift the ADP-bound form of the enzyme towards an ATP-like state in a manner that correlates with disease severity. This deregulation interferes with the two-pronged binding of an adaptor that affects p97 function in lysosomal degradation of substrates. Subtle structural changes propagate from mutation sites to regions distal in space, defining allosteric networks that facilitate inter-domain communication, with potential implications for modulation of enzyme activity by drug molecules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20143.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20143.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>methyl-TROSY NMR</kwd><kwd>p97/VCP</kwd><kwd>IBMPFD disease mutations</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics, thermodynamics, equilibrium</kwd><kwd>p97 adaptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 100-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuetz</surname><given-names>Anne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2EZP2_148754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuetz</surname><given-names>Anne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RN203972 - 310401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Point mutations in a ubiquitous human ATPase called p97/VCP deregulate inter-domain communication, resulting in impaired binding of an adaptor that recruits p97 to endosomal pathways and leading to a degenerative disease of bone, muscle and neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The valosin containing protein (VCP) or p97 is a highly conserved enzyme in mammalian cells, with orthologues in yeast (Cdc48), in flies (TER94) and in archaea (VAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rabouille et al., 1995</xref>).

The involvement of p97 in all major proteolysis pathways makes it a central player in cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). p97 is a 540 kDa homo-hexamer (6x89 kDa) with each monomer comprising an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a pair of ATPase domains, D1 and D2, arranged in primary sequence as NTD-D1-D2. Both D1 and D2 are organized as rings that stack coaxially, with the NTD located at the periphery of the D1 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). p97 converts the energy obtained via ATP hydrolysis to remove substrates from complexes or membranes and to structurally remodel or unfold them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthelme and Sauer, 2016</xref>). Its diverse activities result from various cofactors that recruit it to specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>), with more than 40 adaptors discovered in mammalian cells. Many of these contain highly conserved p97 binding domains such as UBX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchberger et al., 2001</xref>) and VIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stapf et al., 2011</xref>). Given its prominent role in the eukaryotic cell, p97 misfunction is associated with human disease. While p97 deletion results in early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2007</xref>), a series of missense mutations lead to very specific malfunctions in protein homeostasis linked to degenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watts et al., 2004</xref>), among them Inclusion Body Myopathy associated with Paget disease of the bone and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD), a lethal autosomal dominant disorder with onset in midlife.

NTDs are the major binding sites for cofactors along with substrates and cross-linking NTD to D1 via disulfides abrogates all ATPase activity (both in D1 and in D2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>). Crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>) conducted on a truncated form of p97 comprising NTD and D1 show that NTD is coplanar relative to D1 in both wild-type (wt) and disease mutants of p97-ADP (referred to in what follows as the down state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and elevated relative to D1 in p97-ATPγS disease mutants (up state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Complementary static pictures recently obtained from electron microscopy on full-length wt p97 (22) confirm that the nucleotide state in D1, but not in D2, determines the NTD up/down conformation and establish that the up-conformation in the ATPγS state is not an anomaly of the disease mutants but also found in wt protein. Thus, a picture emerges whereby NTDs of wt or mutant p97 exist in one of two conformations, controlled by the nucleotide state of D1 and not by mutation. A structural understanding of how disease mutations deregulate the ATP cycle and modulate p97 function is, therefore, lacking from the available static models. Herein this is addressed by using methyl-TROSY Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, that is sensitive to protein dynamics, to show that IBMPFD disease mutations deregulate the up/down NTD equilibrium, leading to impaired binding of an adaptor involved in the lysosomal degradation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methyl-TROSY NMR of p97</title><p>We have used methyl-TROSY NMR spectroscopy that is optimized for studies of high molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tugarinov et al., 2003</xref>) to study a 320 kDa construct of p97 containing the NTD, D1 and the linker between D1-D2 (ND1Lp97, 6*53 kDa, residues 1–480) that has been used previously for crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>).

Notably, some peaks in spectra of full-length p97 are missing in the comparison that reflects the slower tumbling of the larger complex, leading to inferior spectra relative to the 320 kDa construct. Substantial changes in spectra are noted for ND1Lp97 as a function of nucleotide (ADP or ATPγS) that are detected across the entire protein, consistent with a major rearrangement of the NTD from up to down as ATP is converted to ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</xref> Having established that high quality NMR spectra of ND1Lp97 could be recorded, we next assigned methyl cross-peaks to specific sites using a combination of mutagenesis and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wüthrich, 1986</xref>), taking advantage of the X-ray structures of this construct, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sprangers and Kay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ruschak and Kay, 2012</xref>).

Moreover, the sites chosen for analysis are very close in space to the majority of the other disease causing mutations and thus are likely to be good reporters for these as well, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>The ATPγS state, ND1Lp97-ATPγS, is little affected by the mutations considered, beyond the immediate site of substitution, as can be seen in a comparison of spectra recorded on wt and R95G ND1Lp97 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because chemical shifts are sensitive probes of structure this result strongly suggests that the disease mutants sample similar conformations as the wt protein in the ATPγS-bound form. In contrast, substantial changes are observed for many methyl probes in ND1Lp97-ADP, including those in the NTD, N-D1 linker and D1 regions. These changes in chemical shifts generally titrate with mutation in a linear fashion, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), not withstanding the methyl groups close to the sites of mutation or nucleotide binding whose positions can be perturbed simply by the substitution or the presence of ADP/ATP, respectively. Deviations from linearity, observed for a fraction of the probes, likely reflect small structural perturbations beyond the principal effect of the mutation (see below). In this context, it is noteworthy that in the general case non-linear changes in shifts can be observed even in the case of two-site exchange when the chemical shift time-scales for <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H nuclei are different, that can arise from large chemical shift differences for one nuclei and smaller changes for the other. Thus, although mutations are localized to different domains and can be distant in space from each other, their impact on the structure and dynamics of ND1Lp97-ADP can be described in terms of a simple, unifying model whereby mutations lead to a gradual conversion to a more ATP-like conformation (red to black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, despite the absence of ATP), consistent with a gradual upward movement of the NTD. This conversion is readily apparent for I189, for example, located in the NTD-D1 linker, that is sensitive to a loop to helix conformational change that accompanies the down to up NTD conformation and has the largest chemical shift perturbation (CSP) between ADP- (red) and ATPγS- (black) bound states. The chemical shifts in each of these states provide the limiting values from which the fraction of NTDs that are up/down can be readily calculated for the different mutants, as described below.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A dynamic NTD equilibrium between up/down states is affected by mutations in ND1Lp97-ADP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Similar spectra are obtained for wt (black, single contour) and R95G (blue, multiple contours) ND1Lp97-ATPγS.

It is clear that the CSPs for both ND1Lp97 and full-length p97 are identical so that the upwards movement of the NTD upon introduction of disease mutations, characterized in ND1Lp97-ADP, is also observed in the intact molecule. Thus, unlike the picture from X-ray studies of disease mutants, our NMR results establish that the NTD is not static in p97-ADP, but rather exchanges rapidly between up/down states, with the relative mixture of each state changing with mutation. The exchange rate is estimated to be greater than 2000 s<sup>−1</sup>, based on the chemical shift differences between ADP and ATPγS-bound states, as measured for the I189 Cδ1 that has the largest CSPs. Moreover, less severe mutations (see below), such as R155H, have a relatively small effect on the NTD equilibrium (orange peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which is skewed to the down state, but the severe R95G mutation (blue) shifts the relative up/down populations to approximately equal.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows all ILVM methyl groups that have been used as probes superimposed on the structure of ND1Lp97, with each methyl indicated by a sphere that is color-coded by the difference in chemical shifts in spectra recorded of R95G ND1Lp97-ADP and wt ND1Lp97-ADP constructs.

The R95G mutant has been chosen for cross-linking because it is effectively in a ‘50% up’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) so that in the limit of a static structure a disulfide bond connecting C155 and C387 would not be formed and CSPs would not be observed upon oxidation of the sample.

Taken together our data indicate that the disease mutants affect the up/down equilibrium in p97-ADP, with the NTD almost entirely up in the R95G/T262A double mutant, similar to the ATPγS-conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Binding of UBXD1-N causes small shifts to I146 and I189 of the wt protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) that are consistent with locking the NTD in the down conformation, as observed upon chemical cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

We therefore sought to establish that the mutants considered here would not disturb complex formation with p47, one of the best-characterized adaptors and known inhibitors of p97, that is involved in regrowth of Golgi from membrane fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>). As a first test we studied the p47 UBX domain exclusively, which bound to wt and R95G ND1Lp97-ADP identically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), in agreement with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Sáiz and Buchberger, 2010</xref>). Very similar CSPs were further obtained for wt and R95G proteins upon binding full-length p47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which interacts as a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beuron et al., 2006</xref>).

For example, addition of p47 leads to shifts in I189 that are predominantly horizontal (solid arrows), compared with near vertical shifts (dashed arrows) that are observed as the NTDs become progressively detached from the D1 domain. Significant differences in CSPs are also observed between the I146 response to p47 binding and to changes in the up/down equilibrium as reported by I146 (compare dashed and solid arrows for I146). This suggests a different binding mechanism for p47 relative to UBXD1-N, that is made clear when methyl probes showing CSPs from p47 binding are highlighted on the ND1Lp97 structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. Binding occurs at two sites, with one region corresponding to the canonical UBX binding site of the NTD (yellow), as observed for the binding of the VIM domain of UBXD1-N.

Unlike the second site for UBXD1-N binding that bridges the NTD and D1 domains, the site of engagement of SHP does not, so that it is not surprising that the p47-p97 interaction is not significantly perturbed by disease mutations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> illustrates schematically the binding of p47 SHP and UBX domains to p97.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Binding of p47 is not impaired by disease mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of selected regions of <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>1</sup>H HMQC spectra focusing on I146 and I189 of wt ND1Lp97-ADP and R95G ND1Lp97-ADP without (red for wt, blue for R95G) and with (grey for wt, black for R95G) 1.25 fold excess p47.

From our dynamics studies a picture emerges whereby the NTDs of p97-ADP interconvert between up/down conformations that can be modulated by IBMPFD disease mutations. X-ray and cryo-EM studies have established that for the wt protein the up/down NTD equilibrium is highly skewed to the down state in the ADP bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>), and our NMR results show that this arrangement facilitates the two-pronged binding of UBXD1 to the enzyme. Our NMR studies further show that IBMPFD disease mutations perturb this equilibrium in the direction of the up state, leading to an impaired biological ‘readout’, namely UBXD1 adaptor binding.</p><p>A key strength of NMR in studies of proteins lies in the fact that the easiest parameter to measure – the chemical shift – is also amongst the most powerful in detecting subtle conformational changes of the sort that can give rise to allosteric pathways of communication, for example. Detailed crystallographic studies of p97 have established that the NTD/D1 interface and the conformation of the linker between NTD and D1 are coupled to the nucleotide state in D1 (20, 50). Notably, in the wt protein the nucleotide state in D1 determines the NTD up/down conformation and, conversely, perturbing the NTD down state by the introduction of disease mutations in the interface region propagates to the nucleotide-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). CSPs from the R95G mutation are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; these provide some insight into the communication between distal regions of p97 at the level of individual amino acids, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9.</xref> Here we show a number of pathways (<bold>I</bold>-<bold>III</bold>) defined by CSPs that arise upon perturbing the up/down equilibrium. A first pathway (<bold>I</bold>) includes residues in the linker connecting NTD with D1, with large CSPs observed for I189 and L198 at opposite ends of the linker; CSPs are also observed for I206 and L213 proximal to the nucleotide binding site. The arginine finger (R359) and Walker B (E305) residues, at the opposite face of the nucleotide binding site, sense the up/down equilibrium (in the case of the wt protein, ADP versus ATP) leading to CSPs close to the central pore, as observed for I274. Pathway <bold>II</bold> involves residues from an extensive interface between NTD and D1, including numerous disease mutation sites such as R155 and N387, and perturbations to the up/down equilibrium lead to changes far into the D1 domain. Finally, the NTD conformational change is communicated to the adjacent protomer at the I27/L429 interface via pathway <bold>III</bold> and this network eventually connects to the same cluster of residues as in pathway <bold>II</bold>.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Putative allosteric networks illustrating ‘pathways of communication’ (I-III) from the site of the R95G disease mutation to regions distal in the structure.</title><p>R95 is highlighted in yellow.

An important result from this study is the strong correlation between disease severity and the extent to which the up/down equilibrium is skewed in the ND1Lp97-ADP state with more severe mutants unable to engage the H1/H2 region of UBXD1 that is required to lock the NTD conformation in the down state, illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>. Because a complex of UBXD1-p97 is required for recruitment of ubiquitylated caveolin-1 to the lysosome for degradation this pathway becomes impaired in the disease mutants, leading to the accumulation of caveolin-1 positive endolysosomes in IBMPFD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, significantly impaired binding to IBMPFD disease mutants of p97 is not observed for all adaptors. For example, we have shown that binding of p47 is not perturbed by mutation (see below), consistent with the location of observed CSPs showing that p47-p97 interactions only engage the NTD and do not include the NTD-D1 interface, as for UBXD1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Correlation between disease severity and up/down equilibrium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Disease (PDB=Paget disease of bone, IBM=inclusion body myopathy, FTD=frontotemporal dementia) onset and elevation of biochemical markers relative to normal (ALP=alkaline phosphatase, PYD=pyridinoline, DPD=deoxypyridinoline) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mehta et al., 2013</xref>), is correlated with the extent of perturbation of the NTD up/down equilibrium.

The answer partly lies in the fact that the mild disease mutants introduce only subtle changes to the equilibrium, with R155H and N387H mutations shifting the NTD equilibrium from 0% up to ~15% up in p97-ADP, for example. Moreover the differences in free energies between the up and down conformations are relatively small, with <italic>△G<sub>up/down</sub></italic>(R155H) ~ 1200 cal/mol and <italic>△G<sub>up/down</sub></italic>(R95G) ~ 200 cal/mol based on the measured <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The equilibrium may well be affected by the liquid nitrogen temperatures used in x-ray and cryo-EM studies and by crystal packing forces that could skew populations. The significant conformational dynamics associated with the up/down interconversion may also make it difficult to observe this effect by crystallography. For example, while crystal structures of weak disease mutants in the ADP state (R155H, L198W) have been published and all show the down NTD conformation, as for the wt, structures of strong mutants such as R95G, R155C/P in the ADP state (<italic>△G<sub>up/down</sub></italic>~0 cal/mol) have not been reported. On an atomic scale, only localized changes were observed in the crystal structures of mutants of p97-ADP relative to the wt conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang and Xia, 2016</xref>). For example, the sidechain of R359, which serves as a sensor of the nucleotide state of an adjacent protomer, is slightly shifted and this shift is thought to lead to a destabilization of the ADP state in mutants. Moreover, the sidechain orientation of F360 differs between ADP states of wt and disease mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>). Together, these structural differences are thought to result in defective communication between subunits in mutant p97 molcules.</p><p>The effects of IBMPFD disease mutations on p97 adaptor interactions, nucleotide binding, and nucleotide hydrolysis rates have been extensively investigated in a series of papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Sáiz and Buchberger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulfer et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond the primary defect in UBXD1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>), altered cofactor interactions have been reported in a number of studies, including those of p47, p37, Ufd1-Npl4, E4B and ataxin-3 (41, 53, 54). Due to the NTD conformational equilibrium shift in disease mutants, changes in interactions are expected whenever adaptors bind differentially to the up and down conformations of the NTD, which are characteristic of ATP and ADP states of wt p97, respectively. Our experiments, that do not detect differences in p47 interactions with wt or disease mutants of p97, are consistent with biochemical studies of p47 binding to both wt and mutant variants of p97, for which affinities in the nM range are obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulfer et al., 2016</xref>). In these studies intact or even increased p47 binding of mutants has been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Sáiz and Buchberger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulfer et al., 2016</xref>) and no differences in ATP hydrolysis kinetics between wt and disease mutant p97-p47 complexes in the limit of saturated binding have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Our NMR experiments are not sensitive to affinity differences for p47 and wt or mutant p97 since dissociation constants (nano-molar range) are below the threshold for which differences can be detected. They do establish, however, that the p97-p47 complex is formed analogously in wt and disease mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), and, unique to the NMR, that the skewed NTD conformational equilibrium found in disease mutants of p97-ADP is conserved in the p47 bound complex.</p><p>Several biochemical studies have reported altered nucleotide binding properties for disease mutants in terms of affinity and the amount of prebound nucleotide along with elevated ATPase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>). In general, the literature consensus is that disease mutations slightly decrease the affinity of D1 for ADP (by factors between 2–4) but not for ATP, while increasing the ADP release rate from D1 by approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulfer et al., 2016</xref>). We have observed no simple correlation between biophysical properties of various disease mutants and either perturbation of the NTD conformational equilibrium or empirical disease severity in patients. As an example, ATPase activities of disease mutants were reported to be normal in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Sáiz and Buchberger, 2010</xref>) and elevated in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niwa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>) but not in a manner that correlates with disease severity. Further, R155H is a weak disease mutation in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mehta et al., 2013</xref>), with only a modest impact on the NTD up/down equilibrium, yet R155H p97 has been reported to have a particularly high ATPase activity and a low affinity for ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang and Xia, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to understand presently how altered nucleotide interactions can be the prevalent cause of disease, especially since it becomes hard to explain why only a subset of p97 functions would then be affected. In contrast, our results provide strong support for a model whereby perturbation of the up/down NTD equilibrium in the p97-ADP state due to mutation couples to disease by impairing p97 binding to the UBXD1 adaptor. Stronger perturbations lead to more acute disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The binding of other adaptors, such as p47, that are involved in processes distinct from that of UBXD1, are much less affected, if at all, by the IBMPFD mutations.</p><p>In summary, this work provides a further demonstration of the utility of methyl-TROSY NMR in studies of high molecular weight complexes where dynamics play a critical role in both function and misfunction. While we report near-complete methyl group assignments for both ADP and ATP states of ND1Lp97 it is worth mentioning that the key conclusions about the disease mutants can be obtained without extensive assignment, by recording simple 2D <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>1</sup>H HMQC spectra of the IBMPFD mutant series, with quantification of the NTD up/down populations from the CSPs of only a few key reporter residues. Our NMR results paint a picture whereby the primary effect of disease causing mutations is a change in NTD dynamics accompanied by more subtle structural changes that propagate to regions distal from the sites of mutation. Perturbations to the up/down NTD equilibrium are observed in the form of CSPs that extend across the NTD/D1 interface and include the linker region, which in turn connects to the nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Residues showing large CSPs comprise a network that mediates communication between the NTD and D1 in wt p97 that extends to the central pore. Indeed, many of the 22 mutation sites reported to date in ND1Lp97 are localized to regions with large CSPs, suggesting that these loci serve as ‘hot-spots’ for propagation of conformational changes. Such sites may well serve as starting points for the rational design of drug molecules that modulate NTD-D1 interactions, potentially reversing the effects of the disease mutations or inhibiting the wt protein, a strategy currently explored in clinical cancer studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and constructs</title><p>DNA encoding the p97 protein from <italic>Homo sapiens/Mus musculus</italic> (which are identical, Uniprot entry P55072 versus Q01853) was obtained from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) with an N-terminal 6xHis tag and TEV cleavage site, sub-cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET29b+ (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA).

In the case of wt ND1Lp97-ADP small shifts of I146/I189 occur (as well as for other residues, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) that are similar to those observed upon locking the down state via disulfide bond formation. For moderate disease mutants such as R155H and N387H where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf74"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> ~ 15% in the free state, the observed I146/I189 CSPs correspond to a slight shift in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> to ~10% that reflects binding of H1/H2 (although the calculated shift is larger for I146 than for I189 based on CSPs), with no CSPs, and hence effectively no H1/H2 binding for the R95G mutant. We consider below a simple model in which the disease mutants are assumed to have little effect on the <italic>microscopic</italic> binding of the VIM domain to the NTD (equilibrium defined by <italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic> below) but where H1/H2 binding becomes increasingly impaired with severity of mutation. In this manner UBXD1 binding locks the NTD in the down state for wt ND1Lp97-ADP, while for moderate mutants (R155H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; N387H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>) an incomplete fraction of the down state is locked (both VIM and H1/H2 bound). In contrast, the binding affinity for H1/H2 becomes sufficiently weak in the case of strong disease mutants (R95G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; R155P, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>) so that the up/down equilibrium cannot be shifted to the down, locked state at all. The binding model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> can be used to quantify this further, providing a picture that is consistent with experiment.<fig id="S1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.022</object-id><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20143.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20143.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20143-fig11-v1"/></fig></p><p>Here <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> correspond to NTD in the up(down) states, either free (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) or bound (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf79"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) to the VIM motif of UBXD1-N, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf80"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> denote the down state that is bound to UBXD1-N via the H1/H2 motif (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf81"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) or via both VIM and H1/H2 motifs (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Schuetz and Kay describes the effect of disease mutations on the conformational dynamics of the AAA-ATPase p97. This molecular machine is a subject of much research because of its central role in proteolysis that occurs during the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways. Inhibition of p97 is the subject of much research, and there are compounds in clinical trials for treatment of cancer, making this topic of broad interest.</p><p>Recent crystallographic and cryoEM studies document a nucleotide dependent conformational change in p97. This AAA-ATPase consists of two hexameric rings that are coaxially stacked. One ring contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and first ATPase domain (D1) which is linked to the other ring containing a second ATPase domain (D2). In the wild-type ATPase, the NTD undergoes conformational changes from a co-planer (or down) to up position upon exchange of ADP with ATP in the D1 domain. In a tour de force effort, Schuetz and Kay provide evidence that there is a fast, preexisting equilibrium in this down/up transition of the NTD, with disease mutations shifting the equilibrium from the ADP-down state to an ADP-up state. The ADP-up state may be considered aberrant because the authors observe a correlation between the fraction of the ADP-up state for various patient derived mutations and severity of disease. Moreover the authors provide evidence that binding of p97 to the UBXD family is sensitive to the up/down equilibrium whereas other adaptors, such as p47, are not affected.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are 22 disease causing mutation sites known, of which 6 were selected for this study. What was the criterion for selecting exactly these 6 and can the other sites also be explained with the results obtained with the 6 sites investigated?</p><p>2) The authors state that the dissociation constants for p97 and UBXD1-N studied are in the low nanomolar range. Is this also true for the patient derived mutants? If this information is known from prior studies, it would be useful to tabulate it in the supplement. Without this information, it is difficult to interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. i.e. – are the CSP effects in mutants from a reduced fraction bound or is p97 fully bound by UBXD1-N but in a different mode/orientation for mutations studied?</p><p>3) Related, it seems that the binding of H1/H2 of UBXD1-N would be thermodynamically (and structurally) coupled to formation of the down state since the interface of D1/NTD might be a binding site for this region of UBXD1. If p97 is not completely bound by UBXD1-N for some of the mutants tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, then increasing the concentration of UBXD1-N in the NMR studies might fully restore the down state of the NTD, which would reflect a more complete return of chemical shifts to those of ADP state of WT. Have the authors tested this?</p><p>4) The authors may wish to comment on why some cross-peaks of the p97D1L construct are completely missing in the context of full-length p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Is this from increased tumbling or from additional ms-μsec dynamics in full-length p97?</p><p>5) Does the affinity for ADP change for the mutants studied. This seems plausible given the allostery network the authors observe in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Though it seems likely the nucleotide binding site is fully occupied at concentrations of p97 and nucleotide used for NMR, the authors ought to address this point.</p><p>6) Why do of the chemical shift change trajectories deviate slightly from linearity?</p><p>7) The authors speculate about allosteric networks that are responsible for the different orientation of the N-terminal domain. Can this be further analyzed and be explained with concrete interactions between amino acids that are changed in the mutants?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20143.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There are 22 disease causing mutation sites known, of which 6 were selected for this study. What was the criterion for selecting exactly these 6 and can the other sites also be explained with the results obtained with the 6 sites investigated?</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text to include the following:</p><p>“The selected sites span the complete NTD-D1 interface (7800 Å<sup>2</sup>) and NTD-D1 linker region over which the disease mutations are localized. Moreover, the sites chosen for analysis are very close in space to the majority of the other disease causing mutations and thus are likely to be representative of these as well, Table 1.”</p><p>We have also included an additional section to a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that includes a summary both of the mutants used and other disease mutations that are proximal to each of the mutations that are considered in the present manuscript. This highlights the excellent coverage with the mutations considered. Moreover, we have also included an additional site in our analysis, A232, that is involved in moderate disease.</p><p><italic>2) The authors state that the dissociation constants for p97 and UBXD1-N studied are in the low nanomolar range. Is this also true for the patient derived mutants? If this information is known from prior studies, it would be useful to tabulate it in the supplement. Without this information, it is difficult to interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. i.e. are the CSP effects in mutants from a reduced fraction bound or is p97 fully bound by UBXD1-N but in a different mode/orientation for mutations studied?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is not correct regarding this statement. The dissociation constants for wt-p97 and UBXD1-N are in the µM range. In contrast, the dissociation constants for p97 and p47 (a different adaptor) are indeed in the nM range and perhaps this is what was confusing. We have done additional experiments to verify the affinities of UBXD1-N for wt and disease mutants and have added the following to the text:</p><p>“Larger shifts are observed for V68 and I175 that report on VIM binding, from which a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>value of 22 ± 2 µM for the VIM-NTD interaction is calculated (see Materials and methods <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). This value is in good agreement with affinities measured for the binding of full-length wt p97 to full length UBXD1, 3.5 µM (36), and for the binding of the isolated NTD with UBXD1-N, 9 µM (35), especially considering that the latter pair of studies were carried out at 25<sup>°</sup>C in comparison to 50<sup>°</sup>C for the NMR results reported here.”</p><p>“Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the similar trajectories of CSPs as a function of added UBXD1-N observed for wt and all disease mutants (note the collinearity of dashed and solid arrows) provides strong evidence that the mechanism of binding is identical in all cases, with the differences in the extent of shift changes reflecting differing affinities, as calculated in the present study.”</p><p>In addition we have added an extra supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7 —figure supplement 3</xref>) illustrating the titration of wt p97-ADP with UBXD1-N. We must emphasize, as we have now done in the text, that the similar trajectories of CSPs observed for wt and disease mutants argues very strongly in favor of the same binding mechanism, with the differences in shifts reflecting differences in affinities. Finally, as discussed in the subsection “Implications of mutations on UBXD1 binding”, in addition to measuring the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>for the UBXD1-N / wt ND1Lp97-ADP interaction (22 µM), we have also obtained the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for the weak disease mutant R115H (80 µM) along with the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for the strong disease mutant R95G (200 µM).</p><p><italic>3) Related, it seems that the binding of H1/H2 of UBXD1-N would be thermodynamically (and structurally) coupled to formation of the down state since the interface of D1/NTD might be a binding site for this region of UBXD1. If p97 is not completely bound by UBXD1-N for some of the mutants tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, then increasing the concentration of UBXD1-N in the NMR studies might fully restore the down state of the NTD, which would reflect a more complete return of chemical shifts to those of ADP state of WT. Have the authors tested this?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is indeed correct in that, in general, it should be possible to push the equilibrium through the addition of increasing amounts of UBXD1-N. As discussed in the text, binding is two-pronged and the microscopic affinity for prong 1 (VIM domain) is low (200 µM) but higher than for the second prong (H1/H2). We have carried out studies at a 3:1 excess of UBXD1-N over p97 (protomer) and would require a significantly higher excess, especially for the R95G mutant of interest (where no binding of prong 2 is observed), to push the equilibrium substantially given these affinities. Because the 3:1 experiment required 3L of D<sub>2</sub>O growth to obtain enough of UBXD1-N we are reluctant to pursue this further. However, we present a binding model where we show that even at a 6:1 excess there would essentially be no measurable change to the locked, down conformation in the severe disease mutants (see ‘Analysis of UBXD1-N adaptor titration’ in Materials and methods).</p><p><italic>4) The authors may wish to comment on why some cross-peaks of the p97D1L construct are completely missing in the context of full-length p97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Is this from increased tumbling or from additional ms-μsec dynamics in full-length p97?</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text:</p><p>“Well-resolved resonances in <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>1</sup>H HMQC spectra of ILVM-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-ND1Lp97 and full length p97 (6*89 kDa) labeled in the same manner are superimposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), establishing that ND1Lp97 is a good model system for structural studies. Notably, some peaks in spectra of full-length p97 are missing in the comparison that reflects the slower tumbling of the larger complex, leading to inferior spectra relative to the 320 kDa construct.”</p><p><italic>5) Does the affinity for ADP change for the mutants studied. This seems plausible given the allostery network the authors observe in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Though it seems likely the nucleotide binding site is fully occupied at concentrations of p97 and nucleotide used for NMR, the authors ought to address this point.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the affinities do change, but quite subtly. In our studies the nucleotide binding site is, however, fully occupied. We now state this in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“It is worth emphasizing that under the conditions of our NMR experiments samples are fully nucleotide bound. For example, reported <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values for ADP binding to wt and disease mutants range from 0.1 µM – 5 µM, with the lower affinities associated with the disease mutants (20, 50). Interestingly there is not a correlation between lower ADP affinity and disease severity as <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>(wt) = 0.88 ± 0.18 µM &lt; <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>(R95G) = 2.3 ± 0.1 µM &lt; <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>(R155H) = 4.3 ± 0.5 µM. Assuming <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 5 µM, a concentration of p97 monomer of 600 µM (highest used) and [ADP]= 10 mM the amount of apo-p97 would be on the order of 0.01% of the nucleotide bound species.”</p><p><italic>6) Why do of the chemical shift change trajectories deviate slightly from linearity?</italic> </p><p>We address this as follows:</p><p>“Deviations from linearity, observed for a fraction of the probes, likely reflect small structural perturbations beyond the principal effect of the mutation (see below). In this context, it is noteworthy that in the general case non-linear changes in shifts can be observed even in the case of two-site exchange when the chemical shift time-scales for <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H nuclei are different, that can arise from large chemical shift differences for one nuclei and smaller changes for the other.”</p><p><italic>7) The authors speculate about allosteric networks that are responsible for the different orientation of the N-terminal domain. Can this be further analyzed and be explained with concrete interactions between amino acids that are changed in the mutants?</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript we include a new section:</p><p>“A key strength of NMR in studies of proteins lies in the fact that the easiest parameter to measure – the chemical shift – is also amongst the most powerful in detecting subtle conformational changes of the sort that can give rise to allosteric pathways of communication, for example. […] Finally, the NTD conformational change is communicated to the adjacent protomer at the I27/L429 interface via pathway III and this network eventually connects to the same cluster of residues as in pathway II.”</p><p>Additionally, we have added a new main text figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) that highlights the allosteric paths as quantified by the chemical shift changes that we observe in the R95G disease mutant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
