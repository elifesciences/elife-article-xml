Large numbers of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes are found in plant genomes and are required for disease resistance. However, NLRs can trigger autoimmunity, disrupt beneficial microbiota or reduce fitness. It is therefore crucial to understand how NLRs are controlled. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein FPA mediates widespread premature cleavage and polyadenylation of NLR transcripts, thereby controlling their functional expression and impacting immunity. Using long-read Nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we resolved the complexity of NLR transcript processing and gene annotation. Our results uncover a co-transcriptional layer of NLR control with implications for understanding the regulatory and evolutionary dynamics of NLRs in the immune responses of plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NLR</kwd><kwd>nanopore</kwd><kwd>direct RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>spen</kwd><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>alternative

leucine-rich repeat) proteins function to detect the presence and activity of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barragan and Weigel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tamborski and Krasileva, 2020</xref>). Plant genomes can encode large numbers of NLR genes, which often occur in physical clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiao and Schneeberger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Powerful selective pressure drives the rapid birth and death of NLR genes, resulting in intraspecific diversity in NLR alleles and gene number. Consequently, the near-complete repertoire of Arabidopsis NLR genes was only recently revealed using long-read DNA sequencing of diverse Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van de Weyer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In plants, NLR proteins generally comprise an N-terminal Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR), coiled-coil (CC) or RPW8 domain that facilitates signalling; a central nucleotide-binding NB-ARC domain that acts as a molecular switch; and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that interact with target proteins. NLRs can recognise pathogen effectors either directly by binding to them through LRR domains or indirectly by detecting modifications to host proteins caused by effector action. In some cases, domains of host proteins targeted by pathogen effectors have been incorporated into NLRs as integrated domains (or decoys) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Roux et al., 2015</xref>). NLRs that interact directly with effectors are under high levels of diversifying selection to modify their recognition specificities, resulting in significant allelic polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prigozhin and Krasileva, 2021</xref>). Genomic variation also yields diversity in NLR protein organisation, through domain swapping or truncating mutations, and NLR isoforms that lack NB-ARC or LRR domains can function in plant immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Swiderski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang and Gassmann, 2007</xref>). The consequence of this diversity is that there is no one-size-fits-all explanation of how NLR proteins function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barragan and Weigel, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The benefit of NLRs to the host is disease resistance, but the costs of increased NLR diversity or activity can include detrimental autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>), reduced association with beneficial microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and a general reduction in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tian et al., 2003</xref>). In some cases, autoimmunity caused by epistatic interactions involving NLRs can cause hybrid necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chae et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a key question is how NLRs are regulated to enable limited expression for pathogen surveillance but enhanced expression during defence responses. This problem is compounded by the evolutionary dynamics of NLRs because regulatory processes must keep pace with the emergence of new NLR genes and gain or loss of function in others. Consequently, the regulation of NLRs is one of the most important and difficult challenges faced by plants.</p><p>NLR control measures occur at different stages of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lai and Eulgem, 2018</xref>). For example, microRNAs limit the expression of many NLRs by targeting conserved regions encoded in NLR mRNAs and triggering cascades of phased siRNAs that broadly suppress NLR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Canto-Pastor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shivaprasad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>). Alternative splicing, which promotes the simultaneous expression of more than one NLR isoform, is required for the functions of both the <italic>N</italic> gene which provides resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dinesh-Kumar and Baker, 2000</xref>), and <italic>RECOGNITION OF PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE 4</italic> (<italic>RPS4</italic>), which confers resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> DC3000 in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang and Gassmann, 2007</xref>). Alternative polyadenylation at intragenic heterochromatin controls the expression of Arabidopsis <italic>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7</italic> (<italic>RPP7</italic>), with functional consequences for immunity against the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsuchiya and Eulgem, 2013</xref>). Finally, RNA surveillance pathways control NLRs. For example, null mutants defective in nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) are lethal in Arabidopsis because they trigger NLR <italic>RPS6</italic>-dependent autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gloggnitzer et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, mutations in the RNA exosome, which degrades RNAs in a 3′ to 5′ direction, suppress <italic>RPS6</italic>-dependent autoimmune phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takagi et al., 2020</xref>). Fine tuning of different levels of NLR control may be integrated to produce quantitative patterns of disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corwin and Kliebenstein, 2017</xref>), but our understanding of how this occurs globally is fragmentary and incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The RNA-binding protein FPA was first identified as a factor required for the control of Arabidopsis flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koornneef et al., 1991</xref>). Loss-of-function <italic>fpa</italic> mutants flower late due to elevated levels of the floral repressor, FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schomburg et al., 2001</xref>). However, this cannot be the only function of FPA because it is much more widely conserved than <italic>FLC</italic>. FPA is a member of the spen family of proteins, which are defined by three N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal protein interaction SPOC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ariyoshi and Schwabe, 2003</xref>). We previously showed that FPA controls the site of cleavage and polyadenylation in some mRNAs, including autoregulation of <italic>FPA</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hornyik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>). These findings were extended to show that FPA can affect poly(A) site choice at genes with intronic heterochromatin, including <italic>RPP7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deremetz et al., 2019</xref>). The poly(A) site selection mechanism used by FPA remains unclear. FPA might mediate poly(A) site choice either directly by recruiting the RNA 3′ end processing machinery to sensitive sites or indirectly, for example by influencing splicing, chromatin modifications or the rate of transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). We previously used Helicos Biosciences direct RNA sequencing (Helicos DRS) to map the 3′ ends of Arabidopsis polyadenylated transcripts and identify genes affected by transcriptome-wide loss of FPA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sherstnev et al., 2012</xref>). A limitation of this approach was that it could only identify RNA 3′ end positions, and so could not resolve other potential roles of FPA in gene expression.</p><p>In this study, we used two approaches to gain a clearer understanding of how FPA functions. We first investigated which proteins FPA associates with inside living plant cells. Next, we analysed the global impact of different levels of FPA activity on gene expression. For this, we combined Helicos DRS with short-read Illumina RNA-Seq and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Nanopore) DRS, which can reveal the authentic processing and modification of full-length mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Using these combined data together with new computational approaches to study RNA processing, we found that the predominant role of FPA is to promote poly(A) site choice. In addition, we uncovered an unusual degree of complexity in the processing of NLR mRNAs, which is sensitive to FPA. The finding that premature transcription termination functions as an additional layer of NLR expression control has implications for understanding the dynamics of NLR regulation and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FPA co-purifies with proteins that mediate mRNA 3′ end processing</title><p>In order to understand how FPA controls the site of mRNA 3′ end formation, we used in vivo interaction proteomics–mass spectrometry (<italic>IVI-MS</italic>) to identify which proteins FPA associates with inside living plant cells. First, we fixed molecular interactions using formaldehyde infiltration of Arabidopsis seedlings expressing FPA fused to YFP (<italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>). Wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) seedlings treated in the same way were used as a negative control. We then purified nuclei and performed GFP-trap immunopurification followed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify FPA-associated proteins. By comparing the proteins detected in three biological replicates of <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> and Col-0, we identified 203 FPA co-purifying proteins with a median log<sub>2</sub> fold change in adundance of greater than two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At least 56% (113) of the enriched proteins are poly(A)+mRNA binding proteins as established by orthogonal RNA-binding proteome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bach-Pages et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reichel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with FPA control of mRNA 3′ end formation, 14 highly conserved cleavage and polyadenylation factors (CPFs) co-purified with FPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These include members of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, cleavage stimulating factor (CstF) complex, and cleavage factor I and II (CFIm/CFIIm) complexes. The U2AF and U2 spliceosome components that interact with CFIm–CPSF to mediate terminal exon definition were also detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kyburz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We additionally detected both subunits of Pol II. Characteristically, Serine<sup>5</sup> of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) heptad repeat is phosphorylated when Pol II is at the 5′ end of genes, and Ser<sup>2</sup> is phosphorylated when Pol II is at the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komarnitsky et al., 2000</xref>). The position-specific phosphorylation of these sites alters the RNA processing factors which are recruited to the CTD at the different stages of transcription.

We then measured how changes in FPA expression altered the 3′ end distribution at each locus using the earth mover’s distance (EMD; also known as the Wasserstein distance). EMD indicates the ‘work’ required to transform one normalised distribution into another based on the proportion of 3′ ends that would have to be moved and by what distance.

Of the 222 loci identified with shifts to distal poly(A) sites in <italic>fpa-8</italic> using Nanopore DRS, 39.6% (88) were also detected using Helicos DRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likewise, 44.0% of loci (73) with proximal polyadenylation detected in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> using Nanopore DRS were also detected using Helicos DRS.

Segmented regions were grouped into transcriptional loci using the annotations generated from Nanopore DRS datasets. Differential usage of regions within each locus was then tested using DEXSeq. Using this approach, we identified 2535 loci with differential RNA processing events in <italic>fpa-8</italic>: 1792 were upregulated, 390 were downregulated, and 353 had both upregulated and downregulated regions (FDR &lt; 0.05, absolute logFC &gt;1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left panel). A total of 1747 loci with differential RNA processing events were identified in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>: 997 were upregulated, 532 were downregulated, and 218 had both upregulated and downregulated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right panel). The median effect size for differentially processed regions was greater for upregulated regions than for downregulated regions in <italic>fpa-8</italic>. This is consistent with an increase in transcriptional readthrough events and elevated expression of intergenic regions and downstream genes. In contrast, the median effect size for differentially processed regions was similar for up- and downregulated regions in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>. This is consistent with an increase in the relative expression of proximal exonic and intronic regions, and loss of expression of distal exonic regions caused by preferential selection of proximal poly(A) sites. Similar results were seen for differential splice junction usage analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that changes in splicing are the indirect effects of altered 3′ end processing in <italic>fpa-8</italic>, rather than direct effects of FPA on splice site choice.

We used LC-MS/MS to analyse the m<sup>6</sup>A/A (adenosine) ratio in mRNA purified from Col-0, <italic>fpa-8</italic>, <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> and a mutant defective in the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex component VIR (<italic>vir-1</italic>). Consistent with previous reports, the level of mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A in the hypomorphic <italic>vir-1</italic> allele was reduced to approximately 10% of wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Růžička et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we detected no differences in the m<sup>6</sup>A level between genotypes with altered FPA activity. Therefore, we conclude that FPA does not influence global levels of mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the FPA-dependent global changes in alternative polyadenylation result from an indirect effect on chromatin state. We previously showed that FPA controls the expression of histone demethylase IBM1 by promoting proximal polyadenylation within <italic>IBM1</italic> intron 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duc et al., 2013</xref>). IBM1 functions to restrict H3K9me<sup>2</sup> levels, and <italic>ibm1</italic> mutants accumulate ectopic heterochromatic marks in gene bodies, which affects RNA processing at certain loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saze et al., 2008</xref>). When we analysed two independent ChIP-Seq datasets of H3K9me<sup>2</sup> in <italic>ibm1–4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inagaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai et al., 2020</xref>), we found that only 10.6% of loci with altered poly(A) site choice in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> have altered H3K9me<sup>2</sup> in <italic>ibm1</italic> mutants compared with 14.2% of all loci tested (hypergeometric p=0.97; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result suggests that FPA-dependent poly(A) site choice is not an indirect consequence of FPA control of <italic>IBM1</italic>.</p><p>Overall, these analyses reveal that the primary function of FPA is to control poly(A) site choice. FPA predominantly promotes poly(A) site selection; hence, <italic>fpa</italic> loss-of-function backgrounds exhibit readthrough at sites used in the wild type, whereas FPA overexpression results in increased selection of proximal poly(A) sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NLRs are major targets of FPA-sensitive alternative poly(A) site selection</title><p>We next asked which groups of genes are sensitive to FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation.

In general, these can be grouped according to their encoded N-terminal domain as TIR (TNLs), CC (CNLs), or RPW8 (RNLs) genes. We manually examined these NLR genes to identify those with alternative polyadenylation. Reannotation of some loci was required to interpret the effects of FPA activity. For example, we found that the TNL gene <italic>AT5G46490,</italic> located in the RPS6 cluster, is incorrectly annotated as two loci, <italic>AT5G46490</italic> and <italic>AT5G46500</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nanopore DRS evidence indicates that this is actually a single locus with a previously unrecognised 2.7 kb intron containing a proximal poly(A) site, the use of which is controlled by FPA. This interpretation is supported by nanoPARE data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schon et al., 2018</xref>), which showed no evidence of capped 5′ ends originating from the annotated downstream gene. Use of the distal poly(A) site introduces an additional ~400 amino acids to the C-terminus of the protein. This C-terminal region has homology to other NLRs in the <italic>RPS6</italic> cluster and is predicted to introduce additional LRR repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we could also reannotate the chromosomal region around <italic>RPS6</italic> itself. The extreme autoimmunity phenotypes of NMD mutants and mitogen-activated kinase pathway mutants require RPS6 but the mechanisms involved are not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gloggnitzer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takagi et al., 2020</xref>). Nanopore DRS indicates that the 3′UTR of <italic>RPS6</italic> is complex, with multiple splicing events and poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also detected transcripts expressed from this region that do not appear to be contiguous with <italic>RPS6</italic> 3′UTR reads. Instead, these reads correspond to an independent unannotated gene that overlaps the <italic>RPS6</italic> 3′UTR. This interpretation is supported by capped RNA 5′ ends detected in this region by nanoPARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schon et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, Nanopore DRS analysis of the RNA exosome mutant <italic>hen2-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parker et al., 2021</xref>) revealed that this unannotated gene is expressed at relatively high levels, but that the transcripts are subject to degradation. Consequently, steady-state levels of RNA expressed from this locus are relatively low in Col-0. The gene encodes a TIR domain similar to that of RPS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, use of the distal <italic>RPS6</italic> poly(A) site constitutes readthrough into the downstream TIR-domain-only NLR. Based on these analyses, we conclude that long-read Nanopore DRS data have the potential to correct NLR gene annotation at complex loci that cannot be resolved by genome annotation software or short-read Illumina RNA-Seq.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Widespread premature transcription termination of NLRs includes frequent selection of poly(A) sites in protein-coding exons</title><p>Of the 206 NLR genes examined, 124 had a sufficient level of expression to identify alternative polyadenylation in the Nanopore DRS data; of these 124, 62 (50.0%) were found to have FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>).

Of these, four contained poly(A) sites in 5′UTR introns (which would result in non-coding transcripts) and three contained alternative poly(A) sites after the stop codon (which could alter potential regulatory sequences contained in 3′UTRs). The remainder contained poly(A) sites in introns between protein-coding exons. Selection of these poly(A) sites introduce premature stop codons that result in truncated open reading frames (ORFs). For example, we identified a proximal poly(A) site within the third intron of <italic>AT1G69550</italic>, which encodes a TNL-type singleton NLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Use of this poly(A) site results in mRNAs with a premature stop codon; the encoded protein lacks most of the predicted LRR domain. In <italic>fpa-8</italic>, readthrough at this poly(A) site is increased (Helicos EMD = 1271, FDR = 1.2 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), resulting in an increase in the relative number of full-length transcripts.</p><p>The most common form of FPA-dependent NLR regulation was premature termination within exons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We identified 45 NLRs controlled in this way: at 44 of these loci, termination occurred within protein-coding exons. In most cases, this results in stop-codonless transcripts that are predicted targets of non-stop decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Szádeczky-Kardoss et al., 2018</xref>). Many of these proximal exonic poly(A) sites could be identified at lower levels in Col-0. For example, at <italic>RPP28</italic> (AT2G14080), which encodes a TNL-class singleton NLR, we detected multiple exonic poly(A) sites located within the second and fourth exons, which encode the NB-ARC and LRR domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Selection of these exonic poly(A) sites was increased in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> (Helicos EMD = 859, FDR = 5.4 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and decreased in <italic>fpa-8</italic> (Helicos EMD = 912, FDR = 7.6 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). FPA was also found to promote premature termination in the protein-coding sequence of single-exon, intronless NLR genes. For example, at <italic>RPP13</italic> (AT3G46530), which encodes a CNL-class NLR protein, FPA overexpression causes selection of proximal poly(A) sites located within the region encoding the LRR domain (Helicos EMD = 228, FDR = 1.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Although the most frequent consequence of FPA selection of exonic poly(A) sites was stop-codonless transcripts, we also identified examples where the protein-coding potential was altered. For example, <italic>AT5G40060</italic> encodes a TNL-class NLR but has a premature stop codon between the TIR and NB-ARC domains. Consequently, full-length transcription results in an mRNA with an upstream ORF (uORF) encoding the TIR domain and a larger downstream ORF encoding NB-ARC and LRR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, transcripts with such large uORFs are targets of NMD in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nyikó et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, FPA-dependent proximal polyadenylation in the region encoding the NB-ARC domain results in a transcript containing only the uORF, which is not a predicted NMD target and may be more efficiently translated into a TIR-only protein.</p><p>In seven of the identified genes, exonic proximal polyadenylation is associated with retention of an upstream intron (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). As a result, premature stop codons are introduced, resulting in a truncated coding region. For example, the TNL-type NLR <italic>RPS4</italic> was previously shown to be regulated by alternative splicing induced by the effector AvrRps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang and Gassmann, 2007</xref>). We identified an increase in <italic>RPS4</italic> intron 3 retention in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> compared with Col-0 that was associated with proximal polyadenylation events in exon 4 (Helicos EMD = 34, not significant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, inter-dependence between splicing and poly(A) site choice may explain <italic>RPS4</italic> control.</p><p>FPA controlled NLR poly(A) site selection at 16 complex loci with combinations of intronic, exonic, and readthrough sites. One example is <italic>RPP4</italic> (AT4G16860), a TNL-class NLR known to mediate Arabidopsis resistance to <italic>Hpa</italic> isolate Emoy2 (<italic>Hpa</italic>-Emoy2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">van der Biezen et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>RPP4</italic> is part of the <italic>RPP5</italic> cluster, comprising seven TNL-class NLRs. In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Warren, 2010</xref>), we found that in wild-type Col-0, <italic>RPP4</italic> can be transcribed as a chimeric RNA together with the downstream <italic>AtCOPIA4</italic> TE (AT4G16870) through selection of one of the two distal poly(A) sites located within the TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Warren, 2010</xref>) or selection of a third poly(A) site in the downstream gene <italic>AT4G16857</italic>. Use of the proximal poly(A) site within the TE is associated with an approximately 8 kb cryptic splicing event between the 5′ splice site of the first exon of <italic>RPP4</italic> and a 3′ splice site located within the TE. Both Nanopore DRS and Illumina RNA-Seq data provide evidence for this cryptic splicing event, which skips all <italic>RPP4</italic> exons downstream of exon 1, removing most of the <italic>RPP4</italic> coding sequence and introducing a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Inset 1). The resulting transcript is predicted to encode a TIR-domain-only protein. Loss of FPA function decreases chimeric RNA formation by shifting poly(A) site selection towards a proximal poly(A) site located within the protein-coding region of the final exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This results in the production of <italic>RPP4</italic> transcripts lacking in-frame stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Inset 2). Furthermore, in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>, we observed increased selection of a proximal poly(A) site located within the first intron of <italic>RPP4</italic>, which would also encode a truncated RPP4 protein. We conclude that FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation at <italic>RPP4</italic> produces transcripts with unusually long 3′UTRs, alternative protein isoforms and transcripts that cannot be efficiently translated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Complex FPA-dependent patterns of alternative polyadenylation at <italic>RPP4</italic>.</title><p>FPA-dependent intronic, exonic and readthrough poly(A) site selection in <italic>RPP4.</italic> (Inset 1) A magnified view of TIR-domain-only <italic>RPP4</italic> transcripts detected in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> caused by proximal polyadenylation in intron 1, and distal polyadenylation within the TE associated with cryptic splicing.

These poly(A) sites were identified in both Helicos and Nanopore DRS data, indicating that they are unlikely to be caused by alignment errors. The relative selection of exon 6 poly(A) sites depends on FPA expression: in Col-0, 25% of <italic>RPP7</italic> Nanopore DRS reads terminate at one of these exon 6 poly(A) sites; and when FPA is overexpressed, this figure increases to 63%.

Four days after inoculation, we checked susceptibility by counting the number of sporangiophores. With the exception of Ksk-1, all of the lines we tested were in a Col-0 background.

Using <italic>IVI-MS</italic> proteomics and ChIP-Seq, we showed that FPA is closely associated with proteins involved in RNA 3′ processing and co-localises with Ser<sup>2</sup> phosphorylated Pol II at the 3′ ends of genes. Integrative analysis using three RNA sequencing technologies confirmed that the major effect of modulating FPA activity is to alter poly(A) site selection. An unexpected finding was that half of expressed NLR loci were sensitive to FPA activity. In most cases, FPA promoted the use of poly(A) sites within protein-coding exons of NLR genes. At <italic>RPP7</italic>, an increase in exonic polyadenylation caused by FPA overexpression was shown to compromise immunity to <italic>Hpa</italic>-Hiks1.

PCF11 was previously shown to have functionally separable roles in transcription termination and cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sadowski et al., 2003</xref>): the N-terminal PCF11 CID is required for transcription termination, whereas the C-terminal domains are required for cleavage and polyadenylation. The specific interaction of FPA with CID-containing PCF11 paralogs suggests that FPA controls alternative polyadenylation by altering Pol II speed and transcription termination. The human SPOC domain protein PHF3 can bind to two adjacent Ser<sup>2</sup> phosphorylated heptads of the CTD of Pol II via two electropositive patches on the surface of its SPOC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Appel et al., 2020</xref>). One of these patches, and the key amino acid residues within it, is conserved in the structure of the FPA SPOC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, FPA might also interact with the CTD, possibly in conjunction with CID domains of PCFS2 and PCFS4. Such interactions could account for the global correlation between FPA and Pol II Ser<sup>2</sup> occupancy and explain how FPA is able to associate with terminating Pol II at the 3’ ends of most expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Widespread control of NLR transcription termination by FPA</title><p>An unanticipated finding of this study is that Arabidopsis NLR genes were enriched amongst loci with FPA-sensitive poly(A) sites.

In addition, mutations in <italic>HEN2</italic> were recently identified as suppressors of RPS6-dependent autoimmune phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takagi et al., 2020</xref>). It is clear that accurate annotation of complex NLR loci facilitates the interpretation of basic features of NLR function.</p><p>Of the 124 NLRs with detectable expression in Nanopore DRS data, 62 were sensitive to FPA activity. FPA controls 3′ end formation of NLR genes in three different transcript locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): (i) 3′UTRs, where it can prevent readthrough and chimeric RNA formation; (ii) introns, where it promotes proximal polyadenylation; and (iii) protein-coding exons, where it promotes stop-codonless transcript formation. The consequences of such complex control of RNA 3′ end formation are wide-ranging and likely to be context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mayr, 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Functional consequences of FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation at NLR loci.</title><p>Model diagram showing how FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation at NLR loci might affect the regulatory and evolutionary dynamics of plant disease resistance.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65537-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Where FPA controls readthrough and chimeric RNA formation, it affects 3′UTR length, sequence composition and cryptic splice site usage. Long or intron-containing 3′UTRs are targeted by NMD, leading to RNA decay or suppressed translatability. Long, unstructured 3′UTRs influence intermolecular RNA interactions and phase separation, changing the subcellular localisation of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The close proximity of mRNAs in the resulting granules may enable co-translational protein complex formation. Readthrough transcription may also disrupt the expression of downstream genes by transcription interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Proudfoot, 1986</xref>).</p><p>FPA-dependent premature transcription termination at intronic poly(A) sites can introduce novel stop codons, resulting in transcripts that encode truncated NLR proteins with altered functions. For example, some TIR domain-only proteins are known to be active in NLR regulation, resulting in constitutive signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>) or act as competitive inhibitors by titrating full-length NLR protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). In other cases, TIR-domain-only proteins are sufficient for pathogen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>). The TE-containing 3′UTR of <italic>RPP4</italic> appears to be required for resistance to the pathogen <italic>Hpa</italic>-Emoy2, although the mechanism involved is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Warren, 2010</xref>). We discovered that cryptic splicing of <italic>RPP4</italic> exon 1 to a novel 3′ splice site within the TE can produce a unique transcript that encodes only the RPP4 TIR domain. It will be interesting to examine whether the TIR-only RPP4 isoform is required for full pathogen resistance. We also found that intron retention at <italic>RPS4,</italic> which is essential for RPS4-dependent resistance against <italic>P. syringae</italic> DC3000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang and Gassmann, 2007</xref>), is linked to exonic proximal polyadenylation. Intron retention without accompanying proximal polyadenylation will result in transcripts with long 3′UTRs that are likely to be sensitive to NMD, whereas proximally polyadenylated transcripts could be translated into truncated protein. Therefore, a combination of alternative polyadenylation and splicing probably underpins <italic>RPS4</italic> control. In future, sensitive proteomic analyses will be important to determine the impact of alternative polyadenylation on NLR protein isoform expression.</p><p>A remarkable finding was that FPA mostly targets the protein-coding exons of NLR genes and, even controls premature transcription termination within the ORF of single-exon NLR genes such as <italic>RPP13</italic>. Premature transcription termination in protein-coding exons results in the production of stop-codonless transcripts that cannot be efficiently translated into protein. These truncated transcripts may be subject to decay by RNA surveillance mechanisms (e.g. the non-stop decay pathway) or act as non-coding RNA decoys to titrate the levels of regulatory microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shivaprasad et al., 2012</xref>). Increased rates of NLR transcription in plants under pathogen attack could promote elongation through such ‘regulatory’ poly(A) sites. In this way, the expression of NLR proteins might be restricted during pathogen surveillance but kept poised for rapid activation during infection.</p><p>Since the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements controlling poly(A) site choice within introns or 3′UTRs is free from the constraints of protein-coding functionality, why should protein-coding exons be targeted so frequently? One possibility is that this enables the expression of newly created NLR genes to be kept under tight control, thereby facilitating rapid evolution whilst reducing the chances of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This hypothesis is strengthened by the finding that many NLRs with high allelic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prigozhin and Krasileva, 2021</xref>) are sensitive to FPA activity. Alternative polyadenylation might also function to hide NLR genes from negative selection and contribute to cryptic genetic variation in a similar way to the mechanism proposed for NMD- and microRNA-mediated NLR control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raxwal and Riha, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shivaprasad et al., 2012</xref>). Cryptically spliced chimeric RNAs, with subsequent retrotransposition, can be a source of new genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiva et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the control of transcription termination could directly facilitate the neofunctionalisation of NLRs. In the future, it will be important to compare patterns of transcription termination at NLRs across Arabidopsis accessions. For example, analysis of transcriptomic data will determine whether proximal polyadenylation is conserved in NLRs with high allelic diversity, whilst an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and genomic data will establish whether chimeric NLR transcripts identified in some accessions are found as retrotransposed genes in others.</p><p>At least two distinct patterns of alternative polyadenylation mediate <italic>RPP7</italic> regulation, one involving intronic heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsuchiya and Eulgem, 2013</xref>) and another involving FPA-dependent termination in exon 6. The latter mechanism is conserved across all NLR genes of the Col-0 <italic>RPP7</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Alleles of these RPP7-like NLR genes have been identified as the causes of specific cases of hybrid necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barragan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chae et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In these cases, autoimmunity is explained by allele-specific physical interactions between RPP7 protein and the RPW8-only protein HR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We found that not only are <italic>RPP7-</italic>like genes targeted by FPA-dependent premature transcript termination, but so too is <italic>HR4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This raises the possibility that FPA could rescue hybrid necrosis by limiting the expression of these proteins. FPA also appears to control the proximal polyadenylation of <italic>DANGEROUS MIX 10 (DM10)</italic>, producing transcripts that could encode a protein with truncated LRR repeats. <italic>DM10</italic> alleles with LRR truncations have been demonstrated to cause autoimmunity in specific crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barragan et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that in other cases FPA overexpression could trigger or enhance autoimmune phenotypes. Consequently, modulation of transcription termination may shift the balance of costs and benefits associated with NLR gene expression. This phenomenon is not likely to be restricted to FPA because mutations in the RNA 3′ processing factor CPSF30 can also suppress autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruggeman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The impact of FPA overexpression on gene expression and immunity revealed here derives from artificial transgene expression. However, pathogens could similarly modulate NLR activity by evolving effectors that target the expression or activity of factors controlling NLR poly(A) site choice. Consistent with this idea, the HopU1 effector of <italic>P. syringae</italic> targets the RNA-binding protein AtGRP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu et al., 2007</xref>), which co-purified with FPA. In addition, the Pi4089 effector of the oomycete pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestan</italic>s targets the KH-domain RNA-binding protein StKRBP1 in potato; as a result, the abundance of StKRBP1 increases and infection by <italic>P. infestans</italic> is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This precedent reveals that effector-mediated increases in RNA-binding protein abundance can transform host RNA-binding proteins into susceptibility factors. Phylogenetic analysis of StKRBP1 suggests that a direct homolog is absent in Brassicaceae. However, the most closely related Arabidopsis proteins are FLK and PEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>), both of which co-purify with FPA and have been shown to regulate poly(A) site choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rodríguez-Cazorla et al., 2015</xref>). FPA, GRP7, FLK and PEP, along with other RNA-binding proteins, act in concert to fine-tune the timing of flowering through the regulation of <italic>FLC</italic>. In a similar way, RNA-binding protein-dependent modulation of NLR expression might explain how quantitative disease resistance occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corwin and Kliebenstein, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>New ways to analyse RNA processing</title><p>An essential feature of our study was the introduction of new approaches to study RNA processing and 3′ end formation. The use of long-read Nanopore DRS transformed our understanding of the complexity of NLR gene expression by providing insight that short-read Illumina RNA-Seq and Helicos DRS could not. We recently showed that Nanopore DRS mapping of RNA 3′ ends closely agrees with short-read Helicos DRS, and that Nanopore DRS is not compromised by internal priming artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, we used Nanopore DRS to quantify alternative patterns of cleavage and polyadenylation. We also introduced a new approach to analyse alternative polyadenylation by applying the EMD metric. EMD incorporates information on the both the relative abundance and the genomic distance between alternative poly(A) sites. This is valuable because large distances between poly(A) sites are more likely to impact the mRNA coding potential or trigger mRNA surveillance compared with subtle changes in 3′UTR length.</p><p>A limitation of short-read analyses of RNA processing is their dependence upon reference transcript annotations because these may be incomplete. For example, in disease or mutant conditions, RNA processing often occurs at novel sites that are not present in reference transcriptomes (as was the case here for NLR genes). For this reason, using long-read sequencing data to generate bespoke reference transcriptomes for the genotypes under analysis can increase the value of short-read sequencing data. Until the throughput of long-read sequencing matches that of short-read technologies, a combined approach is likely to be generally useful in interpreting transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>It is difficult to identify alternative polyadenylation from conventional short-read RNA-Seq data. As a result, the impact of alternative polyadenylation is probably under-reported. Here we show that premature transcription termination of NLR genes is widespread. Using Nanopore DRS, we could improve the accuracy of NLR annotation and revealed a layer of NLR gene regulation that may also influence the dynamics of NLR evolution. The continued development of approaches that reveal full-length native RNA molecules is likely to provide new insight into other important, but previously unrecognised, aspects of biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Columbia (Col-0)</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ABRC: CS22625</td><td valign="top">Country of Origin: USA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Keswick (Ksk-1)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lai and Eulgem, 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">ABRC: CS1634</td><td valign="top">Country of Origin: UK</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>FPA</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">TAIR/ABRC: AT2G43410</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>RPP7</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">TAIR/ABRC: AT1G58602</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fpa-7</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duc et al., 2013</xref></td><td valign="top">ABRC: SALK_021959C</td><td valign="top">T-DNA insertion mutant in Col-0 background.

global impact on gene expression using a combined approaches of Nanopore DRS, Helicos DRS, and short-read Illumina RNA-Seq. The combined datasets and new computational approaches developed by the authors showed a predominant role of FPA in promoting poly(A) site choice. The authors further revealed that FPA mediates widespread premature cleavage and polyadenylation of the transcripts of NLR genes, which act as important plant immune regulators. Overall, this study suggests that control of transcription termination processes mediated by FPA provides an additional layer of the regulatory dynamics of NLRs in plant immune responses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article “Widespread premature transcriptiontermination of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NLR genes by the spen protein FPA” for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hao Yu as the Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chae Eunyoung (Reviewer #1); Blake C Meyers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>While there was agreement that the topic is timely and the findings relevant, there were some concerns regarding manuscript structure, inconsistency among some results, and interpretation of biological relevance of the data, as listed below, that need to be addressed to support the conclusions.</p><p>1. The manuscript presents an extensive body of studies in analyzing FPA interacting proteins and its potential RNA targets including NLRs. Although the overall results cover a series of observations, many of them are descriptive and divert the audience's attention from understanding the novelty and significance of the findings. Thus, we suggest that the authors re-organize the manuscript into a more coherent story and focus on the most important data pertaining to NLR control as shown in the title and the abstract.</p><p>2. The authors should address or explain some inconsistencies in the results as mentioned by reviewers. For example, the authors found that at least for some pathogens, &quot;loss of FPA function does not reduce plant resistance&quot;. This is not consistent with the hypothesis that FPA is important for regulating NLR immune response genes, and the observation that premature exonic termination of RPP7 caused by FPA has a functional consequence for Arabidopsis immunity against Hpa-Hiks1.</p><p>3. The significance of this study will be strengthened by analysis of the biological relevancy of the alternative polyadenylation events mediated by FPA pertaining to NLR functions. We suggest that the authors consider either providing new experimental data or clearly interpreting existing results, such as those relevant to regulation of RPP7, to provide better insights into biological significance of the data presented in this manuscript.</p><p>Please also take into consideration the other specific comments from the reviewers below to revise the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Parker and colleagues presents an extensive body of work on characterizing the role of FPA in the choice of polyadenylation sites in transcripts of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Investigation on the mechanistic details that FPA engages on the mRNA processing was first initiated with the in vivo pull-down followed by LC-MS/MS, which revealed the its protein interactome relevant for 3'-end processing. The main dataset pertaining to the manuscript title comes from the comparative transcriptome analysis of Col-0, fpa-8 mutant and the overexpressor of FPA, 35S:FPA:YFP. The strength of this work lies in the use of nanopore DRS by demonstrating the layers of FPA-dependent transcripts, including its own, and its comparison to datasets by Illumina RNA-Seq and Helicos DRS. The systematic analysis uncovered unexpected complexity in the A. thaliana NLR transcriptome under the control of FPA and thus delivers a new insight on NLR biology. Several studies anecdotally have reported the importance of using genomic DNA, but not a single cDNA species, for addressing full functionality of NLR genes. Recent advances in NLRome sequencing from multiple genomes of a species and NLR structure/function studies also highlight the importance of understanding modular nature of NLR. As alluded with the modular diversity of NLRs kept in the genomes of a species in recent studies, NLR genes are prone to reshuffle in the genome to generate different variants, including partial entities with the loss of some parts of the proteins or even chimeras, supposedly maximizing the repertoire for defense. This work adds the level of transcript diversity on that of genomic diversity; FPA, an essential factor for transcription termination determinant, targets numerous NLRs to control the layers of NLR transcriptome of an individual plant. Although it is yet to be clarified for the regulatory significance of FPA-mediated NLR transcript changes under biotic or abiotic conditions, the authors succeeded in employing fine genetic schemes utilizing FPA-defective vs. -overexpressing lines along with long-read nanopore DRS technology for the first time to uncover the breadth of differential transcript generation focused on 3'-end choices. This work is timely and impactful for NLR research owing to the above-mentioned recent advances in NLR field.</p><p>As this work is the first of its kind in utilizing nanopore DRS to address NLR transcriptome, several technical concerns can be addressed to corroborate the claims made in the manuscript, which authors can find in the following section (1-8). Regarding the organization of the manuscript, the authors may consider to rebalance the two parts: FPA interactome vs. FPA targets and NLRs. Overall, the manuscript can be seen as combining two stories; first to characterize FPA function in 3'-end processing of transcripts inferred by interacting proteomes and meta-analysis of ChIP-seq data; second part includes detailed analysis of NLR transcripts and others. Although the first half of the analysis is a necessary prelude to the following NLR analysis, the current title and academic novelty mainly lies, or were intended by the authors, on the NLR analysis. However, current manuscript has relatively enlarged section of the first with NLR analysis packed into a series of supplementary dataset. If authors wishes to opt for highlighting NLR analysis, the following suggestions would help (9-14).</p><p>1) Earth mover distance (EMD) has been applied to identify a locus with alternative polyadenylation. What is the basis of using EMD value of 25 as a cutoff? According to Figure 4 B,D, EMD can range from 0-4000. One would also wonder if the distance unit equals bp.</p><p>In addition, EMD values of some genes (e.g. FPA and representative NLRs) can be specified in the main dataset so that significance of the cut-off values shall be appreciated.</p><p>2) Regarding the manual annotation of alternatively polyadenylated NLR genes (L1160-):</p><p>Genes with alternative polyadenylation were identified and the ending location was supported when there were minimum four DRS reads. It would be relevant to provide the significance of &quot;the four&quot; based on read coverage statistics, for example, with average read number covering an annotated NLR transcript with the specification of an average size.</p><p>3) Figure 4E shows that Ilumina-RNAseq dataset detects the number of loci with a different order of magnitude compared with the other two methods. Reference-agonistic pipeline shall be appreciated, however, the method engaged might have elevated the counting of paralogous reads mapped to different locations than they should be. Along with paralogous read collapsing, this is always a problem with tandemly repeated genes, such as NLRs by and large. For example, NLR paralogs in a complex cluster with conserved TIR/NBS but diversified LRRs would have higher coverage in the first two domains but drop in the diversified parts. The authors need to specify their bioinformatic consideration to avoid such problems.</p><p>Although the tone of the Illumina read section was careful and the main 3'-end processing conclusion was made by nanopore DRS, the authors are also advised to clearly state the limitation of using Illumina-RNAseq to address alternative polyadenylating sites at the beginning of the section, for example what to be maximally taken out from Figure 4 E and 4F. This will give relative weights to each dataset generated by different methods. One advantage of using Illumina data would be that the expression level changes can be associated with changes in processing, it seems.</p><p>4) At the RPP7 locus, At1g58848 is identical in sequences with At1g59218 as is At1g58807 with At1g59214 (two twins in the RPP7 cluster by tandem duplication). It would be good to check whether the TE At1g58889 readthrough indeed occurs in the sister duplicate with a potential TE in the downstream of At1g59218. If not, it can be used as an example of duplication and neofunctionalization through an alternative polyadenylation site choices.</p><p>5) HMM search shall be revisited to confirm if they are to detect the TIR domain. Given that a large proportion of NLRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> carry TIR at their N-terminal ends and the specified examples included TIR-NLR, it is surprising to see no TIR domain in Figure 5.</p><p>6) L659-668: how does the new data relate to the previously TAIR annotated At1g58602.1 vs At1g58602.2 (Figure 6, Inset 1)? It would be good to see these clearly stated in the main text as compared to newly identified ones. From the nanopore profiling, At1g58602.2 appears to be the dominant form.</p><p>7) One thing to note is that in the overexpressor of which Hiks1 R is suppressed, there was hardly any At1g58602.1 produced in addition to the large reduction of At1g58602.2. Thus, relative functional importance of the two transcripts shall be discussed in line with the Hpa resistance data. Accordingly, L740-741 phrasing shall be revised to include the possibility of absolute or relative &quot;depletion&quot; of functional transcript(s) contributing to the compromise in Hpa resistance.</p><p>8) It would be necessary to state in the main text the implication of phosphorylation on the two Ser residues on Pol II at L245. A clear description distinguishing the effect of the two phosphorylation and the specificity of the antibodies is desirable, as the data was interpreted as if the two sites made differences, such that Ser2 was heavily emphasized (e.g. subtitle). Albeit low level, Ser5 data also shows an overlap with FPA ChIP-seq coverage at the 3' end. If there is a statistical significance to be taken account to interpret the coverage, please state it. Given that elongation occurs progressively, I wonder how much should be taken out from the distinction.</p><p>9) Figures presentation for RPP4 and RPP7 are great in detailing the FPA-dependent NLR transcript complexity. To make the functional link more evident, the authors may consider bringing up parts of the Figure 5-supplement to a main Figure to detail the revised annotation of NLRs. Given recent advances in NLR structure and function studies, extra domain fusion, fission and truncated versions of NLRs require a great deal of attention. For example, potential functional link to the NMD-mediated autoimmunity and revised annotation of At5g46470 (RPS6) needs a clear visual guidance preferably with a main figure (Figure 5-Sup3).</p><p>10) The section &quot;FPA controls the processing of NLR transcripts&quot; includes dense information and can be broken down to several categories. To this end, Supplement File 3 (NLR list) shall be revised to deliver the categorical classes and further details and converted to a main table.</p><p>For NLR audience, for example, it would be important to associate the information to raw reads to assess where the premature termination would occur. At least, the ways to retrieve dataset or to curate the termination sites shall be guided.</p><p>On the contrary, there is no need to include other genes in Figure 4-Figure Supplement 4-8 under this section. They are not NLRs.</p><p>11) Figure 7 and IBM1 section can be spared to supplement.</p><p>12) The list of &quot;truncated NLR transcripts&quot; in particular, either by premature termination within protein-coding or with intronic polyadenylation, should be made as a main table. The table can be preferably carrying details in which degree the truncation is predicted to be made. With current sup excel files, it is difficult to assess the breadth of the FPA effect on the repertoire of NLRs and their function. This way, functional implication of differential NLRs transcriptome can be better emphasized.</p><p>13) FPA-mediated NLR transcript controls, as to promote transcript diversity, is expected to exert its maximum effect if FPA level or activity is subject to the environmental stresses, such as biotic or abiotic stresses. The discussion on effectors targeting RNA-binding proteins (L909-918) is a great attempt in broadening the impact of this research. In addition, if anything is known to modulate FPA activity, such as biotic or abiotic stresses or environmental conditions, please include in the discussion.</p><p>14) NLR transcript diversity as source of cryptic variation contributing to NLR &quot;evolution&quot; is an interesting concept, however, evolutionary changes require processes of genic changes affecting transcript layers or stabilizing transcriptome diversity. In the authors' proposition in looking into accessions, potential evolutionary processes can be further clarified.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Parker et al attempted to show that the FPA protein functions to regulate the widespread premature transcription termination of the Arabidopsis NLR genes. Using in vivo interaction proteomic-mass spectrometry, FPA was shown to co-purified with the mRNA 3' end processing machinery. Metagene analysis was used to show that FPA co-localized with Pol II phosphorylated at Ser2 of the CTD heptad repeat at the 3' end of Arabidopsis genes. Using a combination of Illumina RNA-Seq, Helicos, and nanopore DRS technologies, FPA was found to affect RNA processing by promoting poly(A) site choice, and hence controls the processing of NLR transcripts whereas such process is independent of IBM1.</p><p>Overall, it is a potentially important research. The data is rich and could be useful. However, the biological stories described are not thoroughly supported by the data presented, especially when the authors tried to touch on several aspects without some important validations and strong connections among different parts. Some special comments are provided below:</p><p>(1) The title of this manuscript is &quot;The expression of Arabidopsis NLR immune response genes is modulated by premature transcription termination and this has implications for understanding NLR evolutionary dynamics&quot;. Therefore, the readers will expect some functional connections between the FPA and the novel NLR isoforms due to premature transcription termination. However, the transcript levels of plant NLR genes are under strict regulation (e.g. Mol. Plant Pathol. 19:1267). Since the functions of NLR genes are related to effector-triggered immunity, it is more important to study the function of FPA on premature transcription termination when the plants are challenged with pathogens. In this manuscript, most transcript analyses are based on samples under normal growth conditions. It is therefore a weak link between the genomic studies and the functional aspects. For instance, it is more important to identify unique NLR isoforms produced upon pathogen challenges that are regulated by FPA. The authors will need to provide some of these data to fill this gap.</p><p>(2) Since the function of FPA is to regulate NLR immune response genes, we should expect a change in plant defense phenotype in FPA loss-of-function mutants. Could the authors provide more information on this? On the contrary, in line 728 of this manuscript, the authors found that at least for some pathogens, &quot;loss of FPA function does not reduce plant resistance&quot;. It is not consistent with the hypothesis that FPA is important to regulate NLR immune response genes.</p><p>(3) Furthermore, the authors mentioned in lines 729-731 &quot;Greater variability in pathogen susceptibility was observed in the fpa-8 mutant and was not restored by complementation with pFPA::FPA, possibly indicating background EMS mutations affecting susceptibility.&quot; Does it mean that fpa-8 contains other mutations? Will these additional mutations complicate the results of the RNA processing? Could the authors outcross the fpa-8 mutation to a clean background?</p><p>(4) In line 318, the authors found 285 and 293 APA events in the fpa-8 mutant and the 35S::FPA:YFP construct respectively, but only 59 loci (line 347) exhibited opposite APA events (about one fifth). The low overlapping frequency suggests that some results could be false positive.</p><p>(5) In line 732-736: &quot;In contrast, 35S::FPA:YFP plants exhibited a similar level of sporulation to the pathogen-sensitive Ksk-1 accession (median 3 sporangiophores per plant). This suggests that the premature exonic termination of RPP7 caused by FPA has a functional consequence for Arabidopsis immunity against Hpa-Hiks1.&quot; It is contradictory to the statement in line 728 that &quot;loss of FPA function does not reduce plant resistance&quot;. Is it possible that overexpression of FPA:YFP had generated an artificial condition that is not related to the natural function of FPA?</p><p>(6) The fpa-8 mutant has a delayed flower phenotype (Plant Cell 13:1427). Could the 35S::FPA:YFP fusion protein construct reverse this phenotype and the plant defense response phenotype? It is important to interpret the data when the 35S::FPA:YFP construct was used to represent the overexpression of FPA.</p><p>(7) Under the subheading &quot;FPA co-purifies with the mRNA 3' end processing machinery&quot;. The results were based on in vivo interaction proteomics-mass spectrometry. MS prompts to false positives and will need proper controls and validations. Have the authors added the control of 35S:YFP instead of just the untransformed Col-0? At least for the putative interacting partners in Figure 1A, could the authors perform validations of some important targets, using techniques such as reverse co-IP, or to show direct protein-protein interaction between FPA to a few of the important targets by in vitro pull-down, BiFC, or FRET, etc.</p><p>(8) In Fig. 3, the data show that the last exon of the FPA gene is missing in the FPA transcripts generated from the 35S::FPA:YFP construct. Will the missing of this exon affect the function of the transcript and the encoded protein?</p><p>(9) The function of FPA is still ambiguous. There was a quantitative shift toward the selection of distal poly(A) sites in the loss-of-function fpa-8 mutant and a strong shift to proximal poly(A) site selection when FPA is overexpressed (35S::FPA:YFP) in some cases (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. 8). But the situation could be kind of reversed in other cases (Fig. 6). What is the mechanism behind it?</p><p>(10) Under the subheading: &quot;The impact of FPA on NLR gene regulation is independent of its role in controlling IBM1 expression&quot;. IBM1 is a common target of FPA and IBM2. Indeed, FPA and IBM2 share several common targets (Plant Physiol. 180:392). It may be more meaningful to compare the impact of FPA and IBM2 on NLR gene instead.</p><p>(11) In lines 423-425, the authors described &quot;Consistent with previous reports, the level of mRNA m6A in the hypomorphic vir-1 allele was reduced to approximately 10% of wild-type levels (Parker et al., 2020b; Ruzicka et al., 2017) (Figure 4-figure supplement 3).&quot; This data could not be found.</p><p>(12) In line 426: &quot;However, we did not detect any differences in the m6A level between genotypes with altered FPA activity.&quot; Which data this statement is referring to?</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>In the article &quot;Widespread premature transcription termination of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NLR genes by the spen protein FPA&quot;, the authors describe the function of FPA as a mediator of premature cleavage and polyadenylation of transcripts.

Since the title of this manuscript is &quot;Widespread premature transcription termination of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NLR genes by the spen protein FPA&quot; and some NLR gene expressions are responsive to pathogen attack, the readers may be interested to know the changes in NLR genes under pathogen attack conditions that are regulated by FPA.

The manuscript presents an extensive body of studies in analyzing FPA interacting proteins and its potential RNA targets including NLRs. Although the overall results cover a series of observations, many of them are descriptive and divert the audience's attention from understanding the novelty and significance of the findings. Thus, we suggest that the authors re-organize the manuscript into a more coherent story and focus on the most important data pertaining to NLR control as shown in the title and the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restructured the manuscript to address this concern. Following the specific comments of the reviewers we have:</p><p>– Carried out a major-re-write of the Results section.</p><p>– Reduced the detailed descriptions in the proteomics and Illumina RNA-seq sections, so as to reach the NLR focus of the study more quickly.</p><p>– Created a new main text Figure explaining RNA processing around RPS6.</p><p>– Summarized the different FPA-dependent effects on NLRs into 3 new tables to provide a broader view that complements the examples detailed in the text and the detailed data provided as supplementary materials.</p><p>– We have removed non-NLR examples of FPA regulation from the manuscript, to focus on the NLR aspect.</p><p>– We have changed the text-based descriptions of FPA-NLR control, to rationalize the logic and focus of illustrated examples.</p><p>– We have moved the Figure on <italic>IBM1</italic> from the main text to a Supplementary Figure.</p><p>– We have edited the section on RPP7-dependent pathogen testing, to clarify apparent misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should address or explain some inconsistencies in the results as mentioned by reviewers. For example, the authors found that at least for some pathogens, &quot;loss of FPA function does not reduce plant resistance&quot;. This is not consistent with the hypothesis that FPA is important for regulating NLR immune response genes, and the observation that premature exonic termination of RPP7 caused by FPA has a functional consequence for Arabidopsis immunity against Hpa-Hiks1.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a straightforward misunderstanding here, possibly because our text in the relevant section was not sufficiently clear.</p><p>We tested the impact of different activity levels of Arabidopsis FPA on NLR function by investigating the NLR, RPP7. We chose RPP7 because features of its function and regulation are relatively well characterised. RPP7 provides disease resistance to the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arbidopsidis (Hpa)</italic> strain Hiks1. The reference Arabidopsis accession, Col-0, encodes a functional RPP7 gene and hence is resistant to <italic>Hpa-Hiks1</italic> infection. Not all Arabidopsis accessions are resistant to all <italic>Hpa</italic> strains. For example, the Duc-1 and Ksk-1 accessions have been reported as having susceptibility to <italic>Hpa</italic>-Hiks1 infection, likely due to the lack of a functional RPP7 gene (Lai et al., 2019). It was for this reason that we incorporated the Ksk accession as an infectionsensitive positive control accession in our pathogen tests.</p><p>The question we were addressing was: Does FPA-dependent premature cleavage and polyadenylation in RPP7 exon 6 compromise RPP7 function? To address this question, we therefore applied <italic>Hpa</italic>-Hiks to our different genetic lines. Neither Col-0 nor the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant (which is in the Col-0 genetic background) were sensitive to infection. This is consistent with our hypothesis because the poly(A) site used in exon 6 in Col-0, is used significantly less in <italic>fpa-8</italic>. Hence, there is no compromise in the expression of full-length RPP7 in <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutants. As Col-0 is already resistant to <italic>Hpa</italic>-Hiks1, we would therefore expect <italic>fpa-8</italic> to also be resistant and indeed, this is what we found.</p><p>This was also true when we tested an independent allele, <italic>fpa-7,</italic> that is also in the Col-0 background. However, when we tested the line that was over-expressing FPA, which was introduced into an <italic>fpa-8</italic> background (and hence, ultimately Col-0), we found that resistance was lost and <italic>Hpa</italic>-Hiks1 was able to infect these plants.</p><p>Therefore, the findings from this experiment are completely consistent “with the hypothesis that FPA is important for regulating NLR immune response genes, and the observation that premature exonic termination of RPP7 caused by FPA has a functional consequence for Arabidopsis immunity against Hpa-Hiks1.” We have clarified the text in this section to make our hypothesis and findings clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The significance of this study will be strengthened by analysis of the biological relevancy of the alternative polyadenylation events mediated by FPA pertaining to NLR functions. We suggest that the authors consider either providing new experimental data or clearly interpreting existing results, such as those relevant to regulation of RPP7, to provide better insights into biological significance of the data presented in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To more clearly address the predicted consequences of FPA regulated alternative polyadenylation, we have added tables for the three classes of FPA-regulated alternative polyadenylation events to the main text and made predictions of the functional consequences for intronic and exonic polyadenylation events. Since there are several documented examples of TIR-only or LRR-truncated NLRs regulating resistance and cell death, we have also changed some of the example genes used to focus on those proximal polyadenylation events which can alter protein coding potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also take into consideration the other specific comments from the reviewers below to revise the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>[...] If authors wishes to opt for highlighting NLR analysis, the following suggestions would help (9-14).</p><p>1. Earth mover distance (EMD) has been applied to identify a locus with alternative polyadenylation. What is the basis of using EMD value of 25 as a cutoff? According to Figure 4 B,D, EMD can range from 0-4000. One would also wonder if the distance unit equals bp. In addition, EMD values of some genes (e.g. FPA and representative NLRs) can be specified in the main dataset so that significance of the cut-off values shall be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that for some very highly expressed loci, we were able to detect statistically significant changes in poly(A) site usage with very small effect sizes which were unlikely to represent functionally important changes. An EMD threshold was therefore required for removing these small effect size loci. The EMD is informally described as the minimum amount of “work” required to turn one distribution into another – it represents the percentage of the distribution moved multiplied by the distance moved. For example, an EMD of 25 could describe a situation where 10% of the transcripts have shifted by 250 nt, or 50% of the transcripts have shifted by 50 nt. A threshold of 25 gives a good trade-off between the percentage of proximal/distal site switching, and the distances between sites (since larger changes in distance are more likely to result in functional changes). We have included EMD values for example NLRs in the main text to give an idea of effect sizes of these genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Regarding the manual annotation of alternatively polyadenylated NLR genes (L1160-): Genes with alternative polyadenylation were identified and the ending location was supported when there were minimum four DRS reads. It would be relevant to provide the significance of &quot;the four&quot; based on read coverage statistics, for example, with average read number covering an annotated NLR transcript with the specification of an average size.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously demonstrated that both Helicos and Nanopore DRS reads are able to capture the true 3’ ends of single RNA molecules. However, both techniques have some technical limitations which may result in artefacts – for example, the over-splitting of nanopore signal from a single molecule into multiple reads, or the incorrect alignment of low-quality basecalls at the ends of reads. For this reason, and also to standardise our approach to manually identifying FPA-regulated NLRs, we developed a standard operating procedure. We chose to identify poly(A) sites using a minimum of four nanopore read alignments, as a trade-off between sensitively detecting genuine alternative polyadenylation events, and ignoring events caused by poor alignment of low-quality reads or over-splitting. We also looked for evidence of events seen in nanopore data in other sequencing datasets, particularly the Helicos DRS alignments, to corroborate our findings. We have improved the language of the relevant methods section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4E shows that Ilumina-RNAseq dataset detects the number of loci with a different order of magnitude compared with the other two methods. Reference-agonistic pipeline shall be appreciated, however, the method engaged might have elevated the counting of paralogous reads mapped to different locations than they should be. Along with paralogous read collapsing, this is always a problem with tandemly repeated genes, such as NLRs by and large. For example, NLR paralogs in a complex cluster with conserved TIR/NBS but diversified LRRs would have higher coverage in the first two domains but drop in the diversified parts. The authors need to specify their bioinformatic consideration to avoid such problems.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the tone of the Illumina read section was careful and the main 3'-end processing conclusion was made by nanopore DRS, the authors are also advised to clearly state the limitation of using Illumina-RNAseq to address alternative polyadenylating sites at the beginning of the section, for example what to be maximally taken out from Figure 4 E and 4F. This will give relative weights to each dataset generated by different methods. One advantage of using Illumina data would be that the expression level changes can be associated with changes in processing, it seems.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that multimapping reads are an issue at NLR genes and may lead to uneven coverage of uniquely and multi-mapped reads when some regions of a gene are divergent, and others are not. Although it is the relative change in coverage of exons or expressed regions which is important in DEXSeq analysis (rather than absolute coverage), it is possible that changes in processing that cause relative expression changes at one NLR locus may have impacts on the relative expression of multimapping regions at other paralogous NLR loci. We addressed this issue when quantifying the expression of expressed regions by running featureCounts using the –primary option that only counts primary alignments, but we failed to mention this in the methods. We have updated the methods to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. At the RPP7 locus, At1g58848 is identical in sequences with At1g59218 as is At1g58807 with At1g59214 (two twins in the RPP7 cluster by tandem duplication). It would be good to check whether the TE At1g58889 readthrough indeed occurs in the sister duplicate with a potential TE in the downstream of At1g59218. If not, it can be used as an example of duplication and neofunctionalization through an alternative polyadenylation site choices.</p></disp-quote><p>The tandem duplication of AT1G58848 and AT1G58807 in Col-0 makes the <italic>RPP7</italic> locus complex to analyse even with long read sequencing data. We find that even with nanopore DRS data, nearly all reads mapping to AT1G58807 multimap at AT1G59124. There is clear evidence of exonic proximal polyadenylation in these transcripts, but the locus of origin is not determinable. In the case of AT1G58848 and AT1G59218, we find a mixture of uniquely mapping and multimapping reads at both genes, and both genes have uniquely mapped reads indicating exonic proximal polyadenylation in <italic>35S::FPA</italic>, and chimeric RNA formation in <italic>fpa-8</italic>. This suggests that RNA processing of these loci is very similar, and so we opted only to show AT1G58848 as an example. Due to the much shorter length of Helicos DRS reads, we applied much more stringent filtering to remove incorrectly mapping or multimapping reads, meaning that there were not enough uniquely mapped reads at the AT1G58848 and AT1G58807 loci to perform Helicos EMD tests. We have updated the text to explain this more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. HMM search shall be revisited to confirm if they are to detect the TIR domain. Given that a large proportion of NLRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> carry TIR at their N-terminal ends and the specified examples included TIR-NLR, it is surprising to see no TIR domain in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>The absence of the Interpro annotation from Figure 5C (now Figure 4A in the revised manuscript) is a mistake on our part rather than due to its absence from the Interpro annotation. We have now corrected the figure and all other gene tracks to make sure that all Interpro annotations are shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. L659-668: how does the new data relate to the previously TAIR annotated At1g58602.1 vs At1g58602.2 (Figure 6, Inset 1)? It would be good to see these clearly stated in the main text as compared to newly identified ones. From the nanopore profiling, At1g58602.2 appears to be the dominant form.</p></disp-quote><p>AT1G58602.2 from the Araport11 annotation contains the most distal annotated isoform of <italic>RPP7</italic>, whilst AT1G58602.1 contains a slightly more proximal 3’UTR. The reviewer is correct that AT1G58602.2 is the more dominant isoform in our Col-0 data. We have added a sentence that acknowledges this to the section on <italic>RPP7</italic> 3’UTR isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. One thing to note is that in the overexpressor of which Hiks1 R is suppressed, there was hardly any At1g58602.1 produced in addition to the large reduction of At1g58602.2. Thus, relative functional importance of the two transcripts shall be discussed in line with the Hpa resistance data. Accordingly, L740-741 phrasing shall be revised to include the possibility of absolute or relative &quot;depletion&quot; of functional transcript(s) contributing to the compromise in Hpa resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that, in principle, the change in relative expression of the two annotated distal isoforms of <italic>RPP7</italic> could have functional consequences, given that both of these isoforms can encode a protein, the functional impact of this relative change is much less likely to be the cause of the loss of Hpa resistance in FPA overexpressing plants, compared to the larger change in exonic proximal polyadenylation, which produces transcripts which are unlikely to express protein. Given that we have not demonstrated conclusively that it is the increase in exonic polyadenylation of <italic>RPP7</italic> that causes reduced immunity in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>, we have made the language of our conclusions in the section “FPA modulates RPP7-dependent, race-specific pathogen susceptibility” more careful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It would be necessary to state in the main text the implication of phosphorylation on the two Ser residues on Pol II at L245. A clear description distinguishing the effect of the two phosphorylation and the specificity of the antibodies is desirable, as the data was interpreted as if the two sites made differences, such that Ser2 was heavily emphasized (e.g. subtitle). Albeit low level, Ser5 data also shows an overlap with FPA ChIP-seq coverage at the 3' end. If there is a statistical significance to be taken account to interpret the coverage, please state it. Given that elongation occurs progressively, I wonder how much should be taken out from the distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established in the literature that Pol II phosphorylated at Ser<sup>5</sup> of the C-terminal domain is a hallmark of initiating and elongating Pol II, whilst Ser<sup>2</sup> is a hallmark of terminating Pol II (Phatnani and Greenleaf, 2006). This was first established in yeast, where it was shown that Ser5 phosphorylation is necessary for the recruitment of the mRNA capping machinery (Cho et al., 1997; Ho and Shuman, 1999). The yeast homolog of 5’-to-3’ exonuclease which is required for termination (West et al., 2004), was also shown to interact specifically with Pol II phosphorylated at Ser<sup>2</sup> via an accessory protein (Kim et al., 2004). Therefore, comparing FPA occupancy to relative levels of Ser<sup>2</sup> and Ser<sup>5</sup> phosphorylated Pol II is an important validation of the location of FPA binding. We have added a sentence to the relevant Results section describing why CTD phosphorylation varies through the gene body. Arabidopsis ChIP-seq experiments from the literature which profile all Pol II (not just phosphorylated versions) indicate that in Arabidopsis, the highest occupancy is over the terminator (Yu et al., 2019). This may explain why there is also a peak of Ser<sup>5</sup> at the terminator (i.e. if there are low levels of Ser<sup>5</sup> in a region of higher occupancy, or if there is cross-reactivity of the antibody with Ser<sup>52</sup> or unphosphorylated Pol II).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figures presentation for RPP4 and RPP7 are great in detailing the FPA-dependent NLR transcript complexity. To make the functional link more evident, the authors may consider bringing up parts of the Figure 5-supplement to a main Figure to detail the revised annotation of NLRs. Given recent advances in NLR structure and function studies, extra domain fusion, fission and truncated versions of NLRs require a great deal of attention. For example, potential functional link to the NMD-mediated autoimmunity and revised annotation of At5g46470 (RPS6) needs a clear visual guidance preferably with a main figure (Figure 5-Figure Supplement 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we agree that these figures deserve to be made more visible. This is one of the reasons that we have chosen to submit our manuscript to eLife, since supplementary figures are displayed alongside linked main text figures in an image slider which allows easy access to each gene track. We believe that this will also make it much easier to examine individual gene tracks, without having to compress them to fit them into a single figure panel. However, we do agree that RPS6 is particularly interesting and deserves to be a main figure. We have therefore split the NLR figure into two new figures and incorporated <italic>RPS6</italic> gene tracks into the first of these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The section &quot;FPA controls the processing of NLR transcripts&quot; includes dense information and can be broken down to several categories. To this end, Supplement File 3 (NLR list) shall be revised to deliver the categorical classes and further details and converted to a main table.</p><p>For NLR audience, for example, it would be important to associate the information to raw reads to assess where the premature termination would occur. At least, the ways to retrieve dataset or to curate the termination sites shall be guided.</p><p>On the contrary, there is no need to include other genes in Figure 4-Figure Supplement 4-8 under this section. They are not NLRs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created main-text tables for each of the three classes of FPA-regulated NLR genes, as suggested by the reviewer.

Figure 7 and IBM1 section can be spared to the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and this figure now appears as Figure 2 supplement 4.

The list of &quot;truncated NLR transcripts&quot; in particular, either by premature termination within protein-coding or with intronic polyadenylation, should be made as a main table. The table can be preferably carrying details in which degree the truncation is predicted to be made. With current sup excel files, it is difficult to assess the breadth of the FPA effect on the repertoire of NLRs and their function. This way, functional implication of differential NLRs transcriptome can be better emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion here and prepared this information into main-text tables 1-3, including predictions of the functional consequences for intronic/exonic poly(A) site choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. FPA-mediated NLR transcript controls, as to promote transcript diversity, is expected to exert its maximum effect if FPA level or activity is subject to the environmental stresses, such as biotic or abiotic stresses. The discussion on effectors targeting RNA-binding proteins (L909-918) is a great attempt in broadening the impact of this research. In addition, if anything is known to modulate FPA activity, such as biotic or abiotic stresses or environmental conditions, please include in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any literature reporting the modulation of FPA activity by biotic or abiotic stresses. This is certainly an interesting question which we would like to examine. However, the analysis of FPA activity is complicated by a number of factors. RNA-level expression is often used as a proxy for overall activity. The RNA-level expression of FPA is not necessarily indicative of FPA activity, however, since the proximally polyadenylated isoform of FPA does not produce functional FPA protein. To get a clear picture of FPA activity during infection will therefore require high-depth Illumina RNA-Seq, nanopore direct RNA sequencing or proteomics analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. NLR transcript diversity as source of cryptic variation contributing to NLR &quot;evolution&quot; is an interesting concept, however, evolutionary changes require processes of genic changes affecting transcript layers or stabilizing transcriptome diversity. In the authors' proposition in looking into accessions, potential evolutionary processes can be further clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a species-wide transcriptome analysis would provide an invaluable insight into how transcription can affect evolutionary changes. For example, we find that NLRs with high levels of allelic diversity are more likely to be regulated by proximal polyadenylation in Col-0, and so a species-wide approach will reveal whether this regulation is conserved or tailored to environmental conditions. An integrative analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data will also help to identify whether chimeric RNAs present in some accessions are found as retrotransposed genes in others. We have added these specific example experiments to the relevant discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>[...] Overall, it is a potentially important research. The data is rich and could be useful. However, the biological stories described are not thoroughly supported by the data presented, especially when the authors tried to touch on several aspects without some important validations and strong connections among different parts. Some special comments are provided below:</p><p>1. The title of this manuscript is &quot;The expression of Arabidopsis NLR immune response genes is modulated by premature transcription termination and this has implications for understanding NLR evolutionary dynamics&quot;. Therefore, the readers will expect some functional connections between the FPA and the novel NLR isoforms due to premature transcription termination. However, the transcript levels of plant NLR genes are under strict regulation (e.g. Mol. Plant Pathol. 19:1267). Since the functions of NLR genes are related to effector-triggered immunity, it is more important to study the function of FPA on premature transcription termination when the plants are challenged with pathogens. In this manuscript, most transcript analyses are based on samples under normal growth conditions. It is therefore a weak link between the genomic studies and the functional aspects. For instance, it is more important to identify unique NLR isoforms produced upon pathogen challenges that are regulated by FPA. The authors will need to provide some of these data to fill this gap.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, the title of this manuscript is not as stated here by the reviewer but is “Widespread premature transcription termination of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NLR genes by the spen protein FPA”. We do indeed describe a functional pathogen test to examine the functional impact of FPA. We show that overexpression of FPA reduces the functional expression of RPP7 transcripts, and that this impacts upon the ability of plants to resist Hpa-hiks1. We agree with the referee that it will be very interesting to investigate, not just FPA, but changes in 3’ processing during infection by different pathogens. However, key questions on NLRs extend to how they function, how they evolve, how they trigger hyperimmunity and how they are controlled to limit impact on fitness, all of which may be impacted by the control of RNA 3’ processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since the function of FPA is to regulate NLR immune response genes, we should expect a change in plant defense phenotype in FPA loss-of-function mutants. Could the authors provide more information on this? On the contrary, in line 728 of this manuscript, the authors found that at least for some pathogens, &quot;loss of FPA function does not reduce plant resistance&quot;. It is not consistent with the hypothesis that FPA is important to regulate NLR immune response genes.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding here, which we clarify in response to Essential Revisions 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Furthermore, the authors mentioned in lines 729-731 &quot;Greater variability in pathogen susceptibility was observed in the fpa-8 mutant and was not restored by complementation with pFPA::FPA, possibly indicating background EMS mutations affecting susceptibility.&quot; Does it mean that fpa-8 contains other mutations? Will these additional mutations complicate the results of the RNA processing? Could the authors outcross the fpa-8 mutation to a clean background?</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant was generated using EMS treatment, it is probable that it does contain other mutations besides the one that removes FPA function (this is likely to be the case with most mutants – whether they are generated with EMS or T-DNA insertions). These mutations are likely to be the source of the slightly greater variability in susceptibility to <italic>Hpa-hiks1</italic> in <italic>fpa-8</italic> compared to the <italic>fpa-7</italic> T-DNA mutant. These potential off-target mutations are unlikely to be the cause of the RNA 3’ processing changes seen in the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant, however, for three reasons: (i) we have previously published Helicos DRS data from <italic>fpa-7</italic> mutants which shows that they have the same RNA 3’ processing defects as <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutants, for example at <italic>PIF5</italic> and <italic>IBM1</italic> (Duc et al., 2013) indicating that changes in 3’ processing in <italic>fpa-8</italic> and <italic>fpa-7</italic> are caused by the common loss of FPA function; (ii) our Illumina RNA-Seq data for the FPA complementing line shows that an FPA transgene restores 3’ processing effects seen in the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant, for example at <italic>PIF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but does not restore the variability in susceptibility of <italic>fpa-8</italic> to Hpa-hiks1 (Figure 6C) (iii) many of the genes with altered poly (A) site choice in <italic>fpa-8</italic>, including <italic>RPP7</italic>, show reciprocal changes in processing in the FPA overexpressing line. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that the loss of FPA is what causes altered poly (A) site choice in an <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A <italic>pFPA::FPA</italic> transgene complements chimeric RNA formation found in the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant at <italic>PIF5</italic>.</title><p>Illumina RNA-Seq data showing the expression of <italic>PIF5</italic> (AT3G59060) - <italic>PAO3</italic> (AT3G59050) chimeric RNAs in <italic>fpa-8</italic> is lost in <italic>pFPA::FPAfpa-8</italic> complemented lines.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65537-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The low overlapping frequency suggests that some results could be false positive.</p></disp-quote><p>The level of reciprocal alternative polyadenylation cannot be used to determine false positive rate. For a gene to show reciprocal effects, when comparing the results of <italic>fpa-8</italic> vs Col-0, and <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> vs Col-0, requires at least two poly(A) sites to be used at high levels in Col-0. For example, at <italic>RPP7</italic>, high levels of proximal exonic polyadenylation are detectable in Col-0, meaning that a shift to distal site usage is detectable in <italic>fpa-8</italic>, as well as the shift to proximal site selection in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic>. However, there are many loci where this is not the case. For example, the abundant chimeric RNAs found at the <italic>PIF5</italic> locus in <italic>fpa-8</italic> are undetectable in Col-0, meaning that overexpression of FPA has no effect on PIF5 when compared to Col-0.

Is it possible that overexpression of FPA:YFP had generated an artificial condition that is not related to the natural function of FPA?</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding here that may be due to the wording that we used in this section and we explain this above. Col-0 is resistant to <italic>Hpa-Hiks1</italic> because it has a functional <italic>RPP7</italic> gene. In <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutants, the expression of full-length RPP7 transcripts is not compromised relative to Col-0 and hence it is as resistant to <italic>Hpa-Hiks1</italic> as Col-0. In contrast, <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> promotes the use of a poly(A) site within exon 6, reducing the amount of full-length RPP7 detected. This poly(A) site is used in the Col-0 wildtype line but is not detectably selected in the loss-of-function <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant line. Together, these findings reveal that this poly(A) site is chosen in the Col-0 reference strain and that this requires FPA. Therefore, the selection of this site is the natural function of FPA and not simply generated by an artificial condition. We have re-worded the text in this section to clarify this misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The fpa-8 mutant has a delayed flower phenotype (Plant Cell 13:1427). Could the 35S::FPA:YFP fusion protein construct reverse this phenotype and the plant defense response phenotype?

Under the subheading &quot;FPA co-purifies with the mRNA 3' end processing machinery&quot;. The results were based on in vivo interaction proteomics-mass spectrometry.

At least for the putative interacting partners in Figure 1A, could the authors perform validations of some important targets, using techniques such as reverse co-IP, or to show direct protein-protein interaction between FPA to a few of the important targets by in vitro pull-down, BiFC, or FRET, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>FP fusions are widely used in IP experiments, but we are not aware of any study that reports 3’ processing factors to be recurrent contaminants in such experiments. We had anticipated submitting an additional proteomics study at around the same time as this study but aspects of this additional work were disrupted by control measures associated with Covid-19. What we do show here, is that an orthogonal approach (ChIP) with different antibodies (anti-FPA) also localises FPA to the 3’ end of Arabidopsis genes together with Pol II phosphorylated on Ser2 of the CTD. These orthogonal datasets are therefore consistent with our interpretation that FPA co-purifies with Pol II and multiple factors involved in the processing of RNA 3’ ends and are also supported by our transcriptomic analyses of <italic>fpa</italic> mutants and overexpressors which have altered 3’ processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Fig. 3, the data show that the last exon of the FPA gene is missing in the FPA transcripts generated from the 35S::FPA:YFP construct. Will the missing of this exon affect the function of the transcript and the encoded protein?</p></disp-quote><p>As we state in the Materials &amp; Methods section, this line was obtained from Caroline Dean and the details of its construction were previously described (Baurle et al., 2007). The transgene construct has a different promoter (CaMV 35S) and associated 5’UTR sequence and the sequence downstream of the stop codon is replaced by a transgene-derived 3’UTR. Consequently, these regions of the transgene-derived <italic>FPA</italic> do not align to the Col-0 reference. We have added new text to the Figure legend to clarify this point. Given that the <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> transgene complements the flowering time phenotype of <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutants, and causes widespread changes in 3’ processing, there is no evidence that the lack of the canonical 3’UTR has a deleterious impact on the function of the FPA protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The function of FPA is still ambiguous. There was a quantitative shift toward the selection of distal poly(A) sites in the loss-of-function fpa-8 mutant and a strong shift to proximal poly(A) site selection when FPA is overexpressed (35S::FPA:YFP) in some cases (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. 8). But the situation could be kind of reversed in other cases (Fig. 6). What is the mechanism behind it?</p></disp-quote><p>Using different sequencing technologies, we clearly show that the predominant effect of FPA is to promote proximal poly(A) site selection and indeed that these cases are associated with the largest effect sizes. The mechanism involved is not studied here. One possibility is that genes which display an increase in distal polyadenylation when FPA is overexpressed are indirect targets of FPA. This would be unsurprising given that FPA regulates the alternative polyadenylation of a number of other factors involved in 3’ processing. Another possibility is that FPA can associate with different complexes of 3’ processing factors at different locations, resulting in opposing effects on 3’ processing. A future goal for us, in dissecting the mechanism by which FPA mediates NLR transcription termination will be to relate poly(A) site choice to direct RNA binding site interactions mapped by iCLIP, for example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Under the subheading: &quot;The impact of FPA on NLR gene regulation is independent of its role in controlling IBM1 expression&quot;. IBM1 is a common target of FPA and IBM2.

Since the title of this manuscript is &quot;Widespread premature transcription termination of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> NLR genes by the spen protein FPA&quot; and some NLR gene expressions are responsive to pathogen attack, the readers may be interested to know the changes in NLR genes under pathogen attack conditions that are regulated by FPA. If the authors have these data, it will be great to share.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of whether FPA (or other RNA binding proteins) alter the 3’ processing of NLR transcripts during infection is something that we would like to explore. Whilst some microarray and RNA sequencing datasets collected during infection conditions are available, these are generally designed for analysing expression changes at the gene level. As a result, they are underpowered for the analysis of RNA processing, which generally requires higher sequencing depth and longer reads – for example 50-100 million 2 x 150bp reads per replicate, with 6 or more biological replicates, as was used in our Illumina experiment. As far as we are aware, no experiments using nanopore direct RNA sequencing to identify RNA processing changes during infection have yet been generated or published. It is clear that the absence of detailed analyses of <italic>NLR</italic> transcript processing and fate during pathogen infection represents a gap in understanding for the immunity field as a whole, and so generating these data is a goal for our future enquiries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have therefore reworded our conclusions in the relevant Results section. We now state: “We conclude that FPA control of poly(A) site selection can modulate NLR function, with a functional consequence for immunity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In relation to my original Question 4. Is it possible to make a comparison directly between the 35S::FPA:YFP line versus the fpa-8 mutant to investigate see whether all disappeared pre-mature transcriptional terminations have returned to the level of Col-0 or even more?</p></disp-quote><p>We compared <italic>fpa-8</italic> and <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> nanopore DRS data directly using the Earth mover distance (EMD) method, as suggested by the reviewer.

In relation to my original Question 6. The authors showed that overexpression FPA will decrease the overall FLC transcripts. Is the FPA acting on the pre-mature transcriptional termination of FLC too? Any data to support this?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no evidence that sense <italic>FLC</italic> transcripts are targeted by FPA-dependent proximal polyadenylation (Duc et al., 2013; Hornyik et al., 2010).

The ratio of proximal to distal antisense RNAs correlates negatively with sense <italic>FLC</italic> expression (Duc et al., 2013; Hornyik et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In relation to my original Question 7. Does the anti-FPA chip data match well with the proximal APA in Col-0?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether there was an overlap between the sites of FPA-associated chromatin and loci with FPA-sensitive poly(A) site choice, we called peaks from the FPA ChIP-seq data using MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008). This resulted in the identification of 1120 unstranded peaks. We then assigned peaks to loci by identifying the closest (or overlapping) transcribed locus in an upstream orientation to each peak, using bedtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Where there were multiple tied loci that could be assigned to a single peak (e.g. at convergent terminators or overlapping loci), peaks were assigned to all tied loci. We then compared the loci with identified FPA peaks to those loci with FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation, identified using Nanopore DRS sequencing. We found that of the 222 loci with increased distal polyadenylation in <italic>fpa-8,</italic> 38 were also associated with an FPA ChIP-seq peak (hypergeometric <italic>p</italic> = 3.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>). Of the 166 loci with increased proximal polyadenylation in <italic>35S::FPA:YFP,</italic> 27 were also associated with an FPA ChIP-seq peak (hypergeometric <italic>p</italic> = 3.3´10<sup>-3</sup>). The lack of FPA ChIP-seq peaks on many genes with FPA-dependent RNA processing may be explained by low Pol II occupancy. In agreement with this, loci with FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation, which did not have an associated FPA peak, were more weakly expressed than those that did have an FPA peak (Mann-Whitney U <italic>p=</italic>7.2 x 10<sup>-4</sup>). Notably, 95.6% of genes which were associated with FPA ChIP-seq peaks did not have FPA-sensitive alternative polyadenylation under our experimental conditions, and global FPA ChIP-seq signal at 3’ ends was well correlated with Pol II Ser<sup>2</sup> signal (Spearman’s ρ = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2´10<sup>-308</sup>, 95% CIs [0.66, 0.68]). This suggests that FPA is able to associate with terminating Pol II at most loci but is necessary for poly(A) site choice at a relatively smaller number of loci in our experimental conditions. We have added our findings on the correlation of FPA and Pol II ChIP-seq signal to the relevant Results section and updated the Discussion section “<italic>Uncovering protein assemblies that mediate 3ʹ end processing in living plant cells</italic>”. We now state:</p><p>“Such interactions [between FPA and Pol II Ser<sup>2</sup>] could account for the global correlation between FPA and Pol II Ser<sup>2</sup> occupancy and explain how FPA is able to associate with terminating Pol II at the 3’ ends of most expressed genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In relation to my original Question 9 and Question 10. IBM1 is a common target of FPA and EDM2, indicating the possible coordination of the FPA and EDM2 functions. There have been several studies on EDM2, could the authors compare the target of FPA and EDM2, and also address whether FPA also targets TEs in introns of function genes similar to that of EDM2?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have indicated that FPA and the EDM2/IBM2/AIPP1 complex act antagonistically to regulate the expression of IBM1 (Deremetz et al., 2019). As a result, mutations disrupting FPA were identified in a genetic screen to isolate suppressors of the <italic>ibm2</italic> mutation, the phenotype of which is caused by dysregulation of <italic>IBM1</italic>. This finding is consistent with our previous discovery that FPA controls the proximal polyadenylation of <italic>IBM1</italic> (Duc et al., 2013). Other genes regulated by EDM2/IBM2/AIPP1 include <italic>RPP7</italic>, <italic>RPP4</italic>, <italic>AT3G05410</italic>, and <italic>AT1G11270</italic> (Lai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2013). We have shown in this manuscript that FPA-dependent alternative polyadenylation of <italic>RPP7</italic> occurs via an independent exon 6 poly(A) site to the one regulated by EDM2 (which is in intron 1). At <italic>AT3G05410,</italic> loss of EDM2 function causes proximal polyadenylation near the 5’ splice site of intron 3, resulting in complete loss of expression of the distal exon. We find that loss of FPA causes a slight increase in distal polyadenylation of <italic>AT3G05410,</italic> including at a poly(A) site in a cryptic final exon in intron 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This may explain the findings of Deremetz et al., who showed that loss of FPA function partially rescued the proximal polyadenylation of <italic>AT3G05410</italic> in <italic>ibm2</italic> mutants (Deremetz et al., 2019). At <italic>AT1G11270</italic>, loss of EDM2 function causes proximal polyadenylation near the 5’ splice site of intron 3, also resulting in complete loss of expression of the distal exon (Duan et al., 2017). In comparison, loss of FPA function does not have a strong effect on <italic>AT1G11270,</italic> though it may cause a slight increase in intronic proximal polyadenylation at a cryptic final exon in intron 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This suggests that any control of <italic>AT1G11270</italic> by FPA occurs via an independent mechanism to the regulation by EDM2/IBM2/AIPP1. Finally, at <italic>RPP4,</italic> loss of EDM2 function suppresses readthrough into the downstream COPIA retrotransposon (Lai et al., 2020). Similar suppression of readthrough is seen in the <italic>fpa-8</italic> mutant (Figure 5) indicating that at <italic>RPP4</italic>, EDM2 and FPA do not act antagonistically. FPA also controls poly(A) site choice a large number of genes which have no evidence of intronic transposons or intragenic heterochromatin. In addition, FPA predominantly co-purifies with RNA 3’ processing factors rather than histone readers in our proteomics dataset. None of the known interactors of EDM2 and IBM2, which include AIPP1, AIPP2, AIPP3, and CPL2 (Duan et al., 2017), were found associated with FPA. We conclude that regulation of 3’ processing by FPA occurs independently to EDM2 regulated 3’ processing, at a different set of poly(A) sites, and using different mechanisms.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Alternative polyadenylation of genes with intronic heterochromatin in <italic>fpa-8</italic> and <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> lines.</title><p>(A-B) Gene track showing poly(A) site choice of (A) AT3G05410 and (B) AT1G11270 in <italic>fpa-8</italic> and <italic>35S::FPA:YFP</italic> lines.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65537-resp-fig3-v3.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
