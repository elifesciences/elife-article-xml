enlargements. Previously we showed, in uninjured animals, that conditionally silencing LAPNs disrupted left-right coordination of the hindlimbs and forelimbs in a context-dependent manner, demonstrating that LAPNs secure alternation of the fore- and hindlimb pairs during overground stepping. Given the ventrolateral location of LAPN axons in the spinal cord white matter, many likely remain intact following incomplete, contusive, thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), suggesting a potential role in the recovery of stepping. Thus, we hypothesized that silencing LAPNs after SCI would disrupt recovered locomotion. Instead, we found that silencing spared LAPNs post-SCI improved locomotor function, including paw placement order and timing, and a decrease in the number of dorsal steps. Silencing also restored left-right hindlimb coordination and normalized spatiotemporal features of gait such as stance and swing time. However, hindlimb-forelimb coordination was not restored. These data indicate that the temporal information carried between the spinal enlargements by the spared LAPNs post-SCI is detrimental to recovered hindlimb locomotor function. These findings are an illustration of a post-SCI neuroanatomical-functional paradox and have implications for the development of neuronal- and axonal-protective therapeutic strategies and the clinical study/implementation of neuromodulation strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>propriospinal neurons</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>viral vector</kwd><kwd>neuronal silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS089324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>David SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Whittemore</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 GM103507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whittemore</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012645</institution-id><institution>Kentucky Spinal Cord and Head Injury Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>David SK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS112304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>David SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Whittemore</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Silencing L2 neurons that project to C6 after a T9 contusion, effectively removing spared axons, results in improved paw placement timing and order, and normalizes speed-dependent changes in swing and stance representing a significant neuroanatomical-functional paradox for spinal cord injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, locomotion involves descending commands from supraspinal centers and peripheral input from sensory systems converging on spinal locomotor circuitry. This circuitry includes central pattern generators (CPGs), intrinsic spinal networks that generate the coordinated muscle activity associated with stereotypic limb movements during stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sherrington, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sherrington and Laslett, 1903</xref>). Each limb has its own CPG and the lumbar and cervical CPG pairs are interconnected by long ascending (LAPNs) and long descending (LDPNs) propriospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">English et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giovanelli Barilari and Kuypers, 1969</xref>). These neurons are thought to provide a functional coupling of the two enlargements and presumably allow precise temporal information to be passed between the hindlimb and forelimb CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">English et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rossignol et al., 1993</xref>). However, direct interactions between the two populations have yet to be demonstrated. LAPN somata reside in the intermediate gray matter, primarily in laminae VII and VIII, with 40â60% having commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reed et al., 2009</xref>) that cross at-level before ascending in the outermost regions of the lateral funiculus and ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reed et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts communication between the brain and spinal cord, resulting in an immediate inability to initiate and maintain patterned weight-supported locomotion at or below the level of lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">CÃ´tÃ© et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dietz and Harkema, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fong et al., 2009</xref>). Even if classified as neurologically complete, most SCIs are anatomically incomplete with some sparing of white matter, most often the outermost rim of the lateral funiculus and VLF where LAPN axons reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>). These neurons and their axons comprise a percentage of the anatomically spared circuitry, thus providing a functional bridge across the injury site, making them well suited to participate in locomotor recovery after incomplete, contusive thoracic SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conta and Stelzner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conta Steencken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conta Steencken and Stelzner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siebert et al., 2010</xref>). Many studies have reinforced this notion, suggesting that propriospinal neurons, albeit descending in these studies, can contribute to locomotor recovery by serving as injury-crossing bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benthall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flynn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vavrek et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Conditionally silencing LAPNs in uninjured rat resulted in the partial decoupling of the forelimb and hindlimb pairs, disrupting alternation at each girdle when overground locomotion was evaluated on a high friction surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). These changes were independent of locomotor rhythm and speed and did not affect intralimb joint movements or coordination. Given the anatomical characteristics and functional importance of LAPNs for overground locomotion on high friction surfaces, we evaluated the functional contributions of LAPNs post-SCI in the same context. We hypothesized that LAPNs would contribute to recovered function after incomplete thoracic SCI and that silencing them would further disrupt locomotion by reducing the number of functional spared axons that cross the injury site leaving animals unable to produce a functional stepping pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Silencing alters interlimb coordination while other key features of locomotion are maintained</title><p>To silence LAPNs, we utilized the two-virus strategy developed by Tadashi Isa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>). A highly efficient retrograde lentiviral vector (HiRet) containing a tetracycline response element upstream of enhanced tetanus neurotoxin (eTeNt) and EGFP (eTeNT.EGFP) was injected at C5/6 (LAPN axon terminals) and an AAV2/2 containing a tetracycline transactivator (rtTAV16) was injected at L2/3 (LAPN cell bodies). Doxycycline (Dox) administration produces eTeNT.EGFP in LAPNs, which cleaves the vesicular docking protein VAMP2, preventing neurotransmitter release and silencing LAPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>, see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design to conditionally silence long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) after spinal cord injury (SCI).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Viral injection protocol for viral silencing in neurons.

A second viral vector, AAV2-CMV-rtTAV16, is injected at the cell bodies and expresses the doxycycline (Dox)-dependent Tet-On sequence, a variant of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (<bold>a3</bold>). Without Dox, neurons constitutively express rtTAV sequence, but it is not active. Upon administration of Dox in the animalsâ drinking water (<bold>a4</bold>), rtTAV16 becomes active and binds to the tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter on the lentiviral vector, leading to expression of EGFP.eTeNT only in doubly infected neurons. EGFP.eTeNT is then anterogradely transported to neuronal cell terminals (<bold>a5</bold>), where it cleaves vesicle associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) which impairs vesicles binding to the cell membrane, vesicle exocytosis, and neurotransmission (<bold>a6</bold>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>).

We hypothesized that LAPNs spared after SCI contribute to spontaneous functional recovery, and that silencing them effectively makes the injury more severe and should reduce recovered locomotor function. We first evaluated the regularity index (RI), central pattern index (CPI), and plantar stepping index (PSI) as three related measures that rely on paw placement order to assess interlimb coordination. RI is simply the proportion of correctly patterned steps, excluding dorsal steps and irregularly patterned steps giving a sensitive measure of stepping quality after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamers et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, CPI evaluates steps in a rolling fashion allowing it to detect double steps, and it includes dorsal steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, PSI is the ratio of hindlimb steps over forelimb steps and is a direct assessment of forelimb and hindlimb coordination (see Materials and methods section for derivation of these measures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuerzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2009</xref>).

It is intuitive to hypothesize that any spared component of the inter-enlargement pathway represented by the LAPNs should participate in recovered locomotion following an SCI. Unexpectedly, silencing spared LAPNs post-SCI improved various aspects of locomotor function. These results demonstrate improvements in both intralimb and interlimb coordination when LAPNs are silenced, including improved paw placement order and timing and speed-dependent gait indices. Despite these improvements, hindlimb-forelimb coordination improved only slightly during post-SCI silencing.</p><p>These findings are counter-intuitive and suggest that the spared LAPNs interfere with hindlimb stepping following thoracic SCI. Given that few LAPNs have local axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>), these observations suggest that an ascending-descending, inter-enlargement loop involving LAPNs and the descending equivalents, LDPNs, may carry complementary temporal information between the two girdles. The thoracic contusion injury employed significantly reduces the cross-sectional area of white matter at the epicenter, while leaving the outermost rim of the lateral funiculus and VLF intact, precisely where the majority of long propriospinal axons reside. In addition to frank axon loss, demyelination occurs acutely, and some deficits in remyelination persist chronically, post-SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lasiene et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pukos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Totoiu and Keirstead, 2005</xref>), which could lead to slowed and variable action potential conduction velocities. Thus, post-injury, the information carried by the partially spared LAPNs and LDPNs may no longer have the temporal precision necessary to reliably communicate the information needed for interlimb coordination. Rather than aiding in the recovery of stepping, it appears that spared LAPNs hinder the capability of the hindlimb locomotor circuitry below the lesion to function appropriately, contributing to diminished stepping capacity at chronic timepoints. We speculate that silencing LAPNs may remove excess ânoiseâ within the locomotor system, thereby increasing the ability of intrinsic lumbar circuitry to function independently. Alternatively, maladaptive plasticity may be occurring below the contusion site, leading to detrimental interactions between LAPN input and CPG circuitry.</p><p>Another interesting aspect to consider is the loss of influence of LAPNs on forelimb circuitry post-injury, suggesting that their role in providing temporal information helpful for forelimb coordination (alternation) is altered. In our recent study focused on LAPN silencing in uninjured animals, the behavioral phenotype was strongly context-dependent, with disruptions to alternation occurring only during non-exploratory overground locomotion on a walking surface with good grip. Disruptions were insignificant during overground stepping on a slick surface, on a treadmill, or during exploratory-driven stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). These observations suggest a dynamic balance between spinal autonomy (where silencing disrupts alternation) and supraspinal oversight (where alternation is maintained). The parsimonious interpretation is that SCI results in increased supraspinal oversight of the cervical circuitry and forelimbs, preventing any disrupted flow of temporal information between the enlargements from disrupting forelimb function. In short, the influence of ascending circuitry post-SCI may be drastically reduced in the presence of increased supraspinal drive. Computational modeling could provide some insight into this conundrum as it would contribute to improved understanding of the drive between the hindlimbs and the forelimbs post-SCI.</p><p>Current literature has provided only a basic understanding of LAPN anatomy in the intact spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">English et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reed et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether anatomical and/or transmitter/receptor changes to LAPNs at either the level of the cell bodies in the lumbar cord or at the level of the axon terminals in the cervical cord are contributing to altered behavior after SCI. Further exploration of the anatomical profiles of this population of neurons will be essential to understand improvements seen during LAPN silencing. Another unresolved question is the potential for silencing-induced plasticity, as improvements in locomotor recovery during silencing were maintained for 20 days. Determining whether synaptic plasticity and/or anatomical changes in LAPNs play a role in improved stepping behaviors during or after silencing will further contribute to our understanding of these perplexing outcomes.</p><p>Alternatively, LAPNs may not undergo anatomical remodeling after SCI or silencing and any behavioral changes as a result of silencing could be due to maladaptive plasticity of sensory afferents. The context specificity of the LAPN silenced phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>) implies that LAPNs are integrators of hindlimb sensory information. As both proprioceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beauparlant et al., 2013</xref>) and nociceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</xref>) afferents caudal to the injury sprout post-SCI, newly formed circuits involving these afferents may include aberrant connections making it difficult for the LAPNs to properly integrate the information needed for interlimb coordination. Ex vivo studies suggest that the isolated lumbar and cervical enlargements are each capable of producing locomotor-like rhythms and, when in complete spinal preparations, that the lumbar circuitry has a greater influence on cervical circuitry than its reciprocal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballion et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juvin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juvin et al., 2005</xref>). If LAPNs are receiving aberrant sensory inputs from the hindlimb, removing them from the lumbar and lumbo-cervical circuitry could allow more autonomous correction of the intrinsic patterning within the lumbar cord.</p><p>A number of electrophysiologic studies have provided evidence that LAPNs are present in humans. For example, joint positions of the lower limbs can modulate reflexes in the upper limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldissera et al., 1998</xref>), stimulation of the peroneal nerve evokes short latency (&lt;75 ms) responses in the upper limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zehr et al., 2001</xref>) and stimulation of the lower limbs can trigger motor activity and reflexes in the upper limbs after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNulty and Burke, 2013</xref>). Clinically, epidural stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord improves both voluntary motor and locomotor performance in chronic SCI subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angeli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harkema et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Minassian et al., 2013</xref>). In large part, the mechanisms that underlie these outcomes are unknown, but clinically analogous stimulation in rodents was found to activate principally dorsal column and/or primary afferent sensory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Capogrosso et al., 2013</xref>). It is unlikely that clinical epidural stimulation is directly activating lumbar locomotor circuitry or LAPNs, but likely influences lumbar motor circuitry via the more dorsally (posteriorly) located sensory circuitry. This leads us to speculate that the more successful stimulus parameters, chosen via painstaking epidural stimulus mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mesbah et al., 2017</xref>), may be those that avoid activation of aberrant pathways, including any anomalous sensory input onto LAPNs or lumbar CPG circuitry. It will be critical to consider the presence of some spared pathways, such as this distinct population of LAPNs, as maladaptive to locomotor improvement in humans as it may be contributing to a ceiling effect for human locomotor recovery and to the beneficial effects of epidural and/or transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that some spared axons may be detrimental to locomotor recovery after a thoracic contusion, contributing to a âneuroanatomical-functional paradoxâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fouad et al., 2021</xref>), and raising the possibility that neuron- or axon-protective strategies leading to anatomical sparing may not result in the expected benefits. Further studies utilizing reverse-engineering strategies to selectively silence/excite identified neuronal populations will be needed to identify which ascending and descending axons are contributory or inhibitory to recovery and the post-injury events leading to these drastic changes in functional role.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Laboratory Animals, and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety (IBC) Committees at the University of Louisville.</p><p>Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (215â230 g) were housed 2/cage under 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water. Each animal served as its own control. Power analysis for gait measures revealed that N = 6â10 could detect a true significant difference with power of 85â95%. A total of 16 animals entered the study to account for animal mortality following multiple surgical procedures. N = 4/16 animals were excluded for not meeting the a priori inclusion criteria based on uninjured behavioral phenotype during LAPN silencing. Of the remaining 12 animals, 2 died after surgery leaving N = 10 that were used for the main pre- and post-injury data set.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Intraspinal injections of viral vectors to doubly infect LAPNs</title><p>Virus production, characterization, and injections were done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pocratsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, we utilized a dual viral vector technique to infect LAPNs via their terminals (C6) and cell bodies (L2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). HiRet-TRE-EGFP.eTeNT was injected at C6 and AAV2-CMV-rtTAV16 was injected at L2 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). In the presence of Dox, only doubly infected neurons that constitutively express the rtTAV16 Tet-On sequence induce expression of eTeNT, which is then transported anterogradely to the cell terminals. At the terminals, eTeNT prevents synaptic vesicle release, leading to âsilencedâ neurotransmission that takes 3â5 days to develop once Dox is given. Removing Dox reverses the silencing and restores functional neurotransmission over a 3- to 5-day period both before and after SCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Spinal cord injury</title><p>Two weeks after conclusion of uninjured Dox<sup>ON</sup> assessments, animals were re-anesthetized (ketamine:xylazine, 80 mg/kg:4 mg/kg; Henry Schein Animal Health; Akorn Animal Health) and the T9/T10 spine was immobilized using custom-built spine stabilizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). SCI was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2009</xref>). Post-injury care during recovery included antibiotics, analgesics, daily manual bladder expression, and supplemental fluids as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2009</xref>). Animals were allowed to recover for ~6 weeks before any additional pre-DOX assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental timeline</title><p>Doxycycline hydrochloride (Dox, 20 mg/ml; Fisher Scientific BP2653-5, Pittsburgh, PA) was dissolved in 3% sucrose and provided ad libitum for 8 days pre-injury and for 8â21 days starting 6 weeks post-injury. Dox solution was made fresh, replenished daily, and monitored for consumption. All behavioral assessments were performed during the light cycle portion of the day and concluded several hours before the dark cycle began.</p><p>Prior to SCI, behavioral assessments were performed before viral injections (baseline, âBLâ), preceding Dox-induced LAPN silencing (pre-Dox, âPD1â), during Dox (Dox1<sup>ON</sup>D5-D8, âD1D5â, âD1D8â), and 10 days post-Dox (âPostD1â). Animals that met the a priori inclusion criteria based on the behavioral phenotype subsequently received SCI. Following SCI, pre-Dox and Dox<sup>ON</sup> timepoint assessments were performed twice (Dox2 and Dox3) to assess the reproducibility of the silencing-induced behavioral changes. Data shown are from pre-injury control and Dox timepoints (âpre-SCIâ) and post-injury control and Dox timepoints (âpost-SCIâ). Individual and group comparisons were made for control vs. Dox uninjured and control vs. Dox injured at each timepoint. Behavioral analyses began on DoxD5 and were repeated on DoxD8. Terminal behavioral assessments occurred on DoxD8 and DoxD21.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hindlimb kinematics and intralimb coordination</title><p>Acquisition and analysis of hindlimb kinematics were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, we digitized the movements of the hindlimb by marking the skin overlying the iliac crest (anterior rim of the pelvis), the hip (head of the greater trochanter), ankle (lateral malleolus) and toe (fifth metatarsophalangeal joint) and recording from two sagittally oriented cameras, using the MaxTraq software package (Innovision Systems Inc; Columbiaville, MI) to calculate limb kinematics in 3D. The knee was not marked as excessive movement of the joint under the skin results in inaccurate localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boakye et al., 2020</xref>). However, this model easily detects changes in intralimb kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbeau and Rossignol, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boakye et al., 2020</xref>). Data were exported to a custom Microsoft Excel workbook and hindlimb angles were calculated for each digitized frame. The temporal relationship between the proximal and distal hindlimb angles was calculated for the left and right hindlimbs independently using the peak-to-peak duration of the lead angle during a single step cycle. Stick figures (2D) were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Overground gait analyses</title><p>Overground gait analyses were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). Dorsal steps, defined by the dorsum of the hindpaw contacting the surface during stance, was considered a step if it maintained contact with the surface during the swing phase of the step cycle. Hindlimb steps were analyzed using the left limb as the reference. As a result, dorsal steps were identified only if they involved the left limb.</p><p>Interlimb phase was calculated by dividing the initial contact time of one limb by the stride time (initial contact to initial contact) of the other limb. Phase was represented as circular polar plots to demonstrate interlimb coordination regardless of lead limb and was converted to a linear scale (0.5â1.0) to eliminate any lead limb preferences. When plotted linearly, blue shaded boxes on graphs represent a threshold of &gt;2 standard deviations (SD) as calculated from uninjured control average and SD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Open field locomotor assessments</title><p>Hindlimb function during overground locomotion was assessed using the BBB open field locomotor scale, and assessments were performed by trained individuals blinded to experimental timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caudle et al., 2015</xref>). Prior to injury, BBB assessments occurred at baseline, pre-Dox, and Dox timepoints. After SCI, BBB scores were acquired weekly beginning at 7 days post-injury until scores plateaued (~6 weeksâ post-SCI). BBB testing occurred prior to Dox administration (pre-Dox) and on any days of kinematic testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stepping coordination indices</title><p>RI, CPI, and PSI were used to evaluate gross motor coordination. RI = ([number of normal step sequence patterns Ã 4]/the number of paw placements). RI excludes any dorsal steps or irregularly patterned steps (step cycles in which paw placements are not sequential for all four paws, i.e. does not follow the cruciate, alternate, or rotary stepping patterns seen in normal rats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamers et al., 2001</xref>) and thus is a sensitive measure of stepping quality after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamers et al., 2001</xref>). CPI = (number of correctly patterned step cycles/the total number of step cycles). Unlike RI, CPI includes both dorsal and plantar steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). PSI = (number of hindlimb plantar steps/number of forelimb plantar steps). In an uninjured animal, the ratio of hindlimb to forelimb steps is 1:1, or a PSI score of 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnuson et al., 2009</xref>). This provides a measure of hindlimb plantar stepping as compared to forelimb stepping after SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spatiotemporal indices of stepping</title><p>For each individual plantar and dorsal step, temporal and spatial measures were plotted against their instantaneous speed (centimeters/second): swing time (the time the limb is in the air from lift off to initial contact), stance time (the time the limb is in contact with the ground from initial contact to lift off), stride time (stance time + swing time), all in seconds, stride/step frequency (1/stride time), and stride distance (distance traveled per step, centimeters). Average swing, stance and stride times, and stride distances were determined using the individual step values independent of speed. The average speed was calculated from the instantaneous speeds of each step analyzed. Averages were generated for each animal and were plotted with the group average.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hindlimb phase during swimming</title><p>Swimming assessments used a maximum of three passes with three to six complete stroke cycles per pass, per animal in each direction (to the left and to the right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). The position of the toe at peak limb extension was digitized for both hindlimbs and the time of peak extension of the nearside hindlimb was divided into the length of time for one complete stroke cycle of the reference opposite hindlimb. Values were transformed as described above and the proportion of strokes with phases &gt; 2 SD from control mean were compared across time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Animals were euthanized at one of two timepoints: D3D8 (N = 2) or D3D20 (N = 11) to determine if viral expression and behavioral changes would persist beyond 1 week of Dox administration. Histological analysis revealed no differences between D8 and D20. Therefore, all images are shown from D20 animals.</p><p>Animals were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital, followed by pneumothorax and transcardial perfusion with 0.1 âM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed for 1.5 hr, and transferred to 30% sucrose for &gt;4 days at 4Â°C. Spinal segments C5-C8, T8-T12, and T13-L3/L4 were dissected, embedded in tissue freezing medium, and stored at â20Â°C until they were cryosectioned at 30 Âµm.</p><p>EGFP.eTeNT expression in the cervical spinal cord was confirmed immunohistochemically. Sections were incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min, then rehydrated in PBS for 10 min (pH 7.4, room temperature) followed by a 60 min incubation in a blocking solution made of nine parts milk solution (bovine serum albumin [BSA]), 0.75 g of powdered skim milk, and 14.25 ml 0.1% of PBS with Tween 20 (PBST) and one part 10% normal donkey serum (NDS). This was followed by another 10 min wash in PBS and overnight incubation at 4Â°C in milk solution containing primary antibodies. The primary antibody milk solution contained a combination of rabbit anti-GFP (to enhance eTeNT.EGFP) and either guinea pig anti-synaptophysin (presynaptic marker), guinea pig anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1, sensory afferents), guinea pig anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2, excitatory synapses), or goat anti-vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT, inhibitory synapses). For information on primary antibodies, see Key resources table.</p><p>On day 2, tissue sections were washed several times at room temperature, alternating between PBS and 0.1% PBST, followed by a 1 hr incubation in a dark room in milk solution containing the following secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor Plus 488 (1:500), donkey anti-guinea pig Alexa-Fluor 594 (1:200), and donkey anti-goat Alexa-Fluor 594 (1:200) (Key resources table). Tissue sections were washed with PBS for 10 min and then incubated at room temperature with fluorescent Nissl (NeuroTrace 640/660 Deep Red, ThermoFisher N21483, dilution of 1:100) in PBS for 1 hr to stain neuronal cell bodies. Tissue was then washed with PBS for 2 hr and coverslipped using Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc; Birmingham, AL). The above procedure was repeated on lumbar spinal cord sections. Isotype matched IgG with identical protein concentration was used as a negative control (donkey anti-rabbit IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch #711-005-152).</p><p>Fluorescent images were captured on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. Tissue sections were viewed with an oil immersion 100Ã objective using 488, 543, and 647 lasers (Olympus; Center Valley, PA). Z-stacks ranged from 55 to 64 slices at 0.45 Âµm optical steps. Neurons within the intermediate gray matter were imaged for both cervical and lumbar sections. Images were analyzed using Amira software as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Spared white matter at the injury epicenter was assessed as described previously using sections stained with iron eriochrome cyanine and alkali differentiation (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnuson et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, slides were allowed to warm at room temperature for 60 min before being placed in a hydration gradient consisting of xylenes, ethanol, and distilled water. EC stain was applied to the slides for 10 min, followed by two short applications of distilled water to remove excess stain (10â15 s). Slides were placed in differentiating solution for 30 s before air drying overnight. On day 2, slides were placed in xylenes solution for 10 min and were coverslipped with Permount. Sections were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E400 light microscope at 10Ã magnification. Spot Software (v.5.1) was used to format images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS v22 software package from IBM. Additional references for parametric and non-parametric testing were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hays, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ott et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegel and Castellan, 1988</xref>). Differences between groups were deemed statistically significant at p â¤ 0.05. Two-tail p-values are reported.</p><p>The binomial proportion test was used to detect significant differences in the proportion of coordination values beyond control threshold (&gt;2 SD) for the raw and transformed values of interlimb coordination of various limb pairs prior to and post-SCI. It was also used to determine statistical significance for interlimb phase, raw BBB score differences, intralimb phase, dorsal steps as a percentage of total steps, and percentage of categorically organized steps (anti-phase, out of phase, in phase). Statistical outliers were excluded when appropriate.</p><p>Circular statistics were performed on the stepping interlimb coordination data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zar, 1979</xref>). We primarily used the non-parametric two-sample U<sup>2</sup> test based on a previously described rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). The null hypothesis tested was whether two timepoints have the same expression of coupling pattern (right-left phase), that is, phase values are concentrated around 0.5 or are distributed throughout the possible range.</p><p>Regression analyses to compare the slopes for the lines of best fit were performed on the speed vs. spatiotemporal gait indices data sets, including speed vs. swing, stance and stride times, and stride distance for both hindlimb and forelimb pairs before and after SCI. For regression analyses post-SCI, plantar and dorsal steps were included in the analysis and dorsal steps are shown in teal; 95% prediction intervals are indicated on the graphs by solid lines. Dorsal steps were never seen for the forelimbs; thus all forelimb regression analyses were performed on plantar steps only.</p><p>Mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc t-tests (where appropriate) were used to detect a significant difference in the BBB scores based on sidedness and condition (i.e. control vs. Dox; data not shown,). No significant differences were observed between sidedness and within condition. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to ensure that the average number of steps analyzed per animal during uninjured and injured timepoints. No differences were detected (for all comparisons, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Paired t-tests were used to detect significant differences in proximal and distal angle excursion for intralimb coordination, average gross stepping measures including RI, CPI, PSI, and BBB scores, average intralimb phase, percentage of dorsal step sidedness, average swing time, average stance time, average duty cycle, and overall average speed at control and Dox pooled timepoints, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

A bit more precision in descriptions of findings in the Results would help the reader who is not a specialist in gait understand what the changes in gait parameters mean.

One can get through the results and figure out what they mean but it is sometimes unclear from the text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>The results would be easier to understand if the experimental model system summarized in Figure 1 was introduced before getting into the details of the results. As an example, the reader has not idea of the rationale was for testing for eTeNT.EGFP for EGFP-positive fibers. One has to dig through the methods to understand what these abbreviations mean and what is being measured. Explaining the experimental design (summarized in Figure 1) and approach (use of these various viral constructs to ablate synaptic transmission in a very specific way that is tunable with doxycycline) would greatly help the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract should be improved. Can you be more specific reporting results? Many sentences are too broad and &quot;whishy-washy&quot; regarding results and implications.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>It would be useful to include further information about LDPNs. What are the known interactions between the descending and ascending LPNs? Why is there a need for both?</p><p>Results</p><p>As alluded previously, no knee marker: if markers are on joint, can only determine hip or foot displacements no hip/knee and knee/ankle as described. Linking hip to ankle marker gives false reading?</p><p>How did you account for paw or limb rotations? Medial and lateral rotations at the hip also pronation or supinations at the ankle could provide very distorted 2D representations of joint angles.</p><p>Again, as alluded previously, no toe marker results in no information about toe drag.</p><p>How many LAPNs were spared? Is there sprouting of terminals? Why was there not quantification of anatomical data?</p><p>Co-localization difficult to see in Figure 2</p><p>Were angular displacements calculated for both plantar and dorsal steps? And averaged? Why?</p><p>Swimming test: Did the injury induce rats to use their forelimbs? How did that influence results?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Behaviour improvements with silencing are modest, some of the conclusions should be toned down? For example, intralimb coordination and other kinematic parameters measurements are incomplete.</p><p>How is this effect happening? Authors speculated that LAPNs have maladaptations after SCI, but no evidence.</p><p>No forelimb effect could simply be due to redundancies in the system. Also, no evidence for their contention for supraspinal oversight of forelimbs.</p><p>Discussion in humans: what is the evidence this pathway and mechanism is similar in humans, as humans are bipedal animals. Maybe the effect would be similar to the results from the swimming tests?</p><p>Methods</p><p>Brief descriptions of the methods are requirement for a basic understanding. For example, there was no indication whether kinematics measurements were taken on a treadmill, open field, catwalk, etc.?</p><p>Pg 14. What is &quot;irregularly patterned steps&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>1. Prior findings were context dependent (i.e. on 'grippy' surfaces but not smooth/slick, non-exploratory locomotion). There is no mention of context here. Is there a context dependency to these effect post-SCI or were the same surfaces/contexts used?</p><p>2. Some of the benchmarks for comparison were not well described and some of indices used were not explained fully enough to distinguish between them or to see how they may have different implications for function.</p><p>a. For the RI, there are discrepancies in the Methods and the more detailed description in the paper referred to. This is likely due to the wording, rather than the actual measure. According to the paper referred to, the denominator is number of paw placements, not cycles (there are 4 paw placements per cycle). The dorsal or irregularly patterned are not excluded, except from the numerator, so that they are 'counted against' the index.</p><p>b. Based on the explanation provided, it is not clear how the CPI is different from the RI. The CPI does not appear to be included in the references referred to. What is &quot;correctly patterned&quot;? Is it order or phasing of one foot relative to another (i.e. alternation)?</p><p>c. Plantar step and dorsal step indices are presented as different measures but they appear to be the inverse of each other (based on the numbers). The plantar step index is described as plantar hindlimb steps relative to forelimb steps. Is a plantar step index of less than 100 due the presence of dorsal steps? Or is this a measure of forelimb-hindlimb coordination deficits?</p><p>d. In Figure 6, an indication of the &quot;normal range&quot; that is being referred to (in a-c) would be helpful, or alternatively, defining what is considered abnormal. The swing and stance times are said to be &quot;improved&quot;. The basis for this judgment is not obvious.</p><p>3. Figure 5 does not include homolateral coupling. Although this was unaffected in intact, the LAPNs are both ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting so this is of interest. Whether or not there are differences in homolateral coupling, this could be discussed in terms of anatomical work of the authors with regards to the populations of LAPNs being silenced and the more caudal LAPNs which are presumably (?) unaffected by the silencing.</p><p>4. Relatedly, information related to efficacy of the technique (i.e. approximate % of the LAPN population affected, distance of spread within lumbar segments when L2 is targeted) would enhance the interpretation as well.</p><p>5. There are several possible explanations for the results offered which are feasible based on the presented data. It seems that these may be possible to narrow down based on tissue from these experiments. Specifically, a quantification of LAPN terminals (or non-somatic fluorescence) in lumbar and cervical cord in these SCI rats compared to that in the uninjured may suggest, first, the degree to which terminals are lost after SCI (or an approximate proportion that are spared) and, second, if there is significant sprouting at either level. Since lumbar terminals were sparse in the intact, are there terminals seen in lumbar cord after SCI? Presence or absence may lend support to either the long loop effects or local gain of aberrant connections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70058.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The common thread to the three reviews that revisions were needed to improve clarity and readability of the manuscript.

The use of 2 cameras for 3D estimates is described in the section âHindlimb kinematics and intralimb coordinationâ. We consider the accuracy sufficient to support the primary conclusions which rely heavily on measures and indices that would not be influenced by paw or limb rotation. Figure 5 and Figure 2 supplement 1 both show 2D stick figures derived from the 3D coordinates (from MaxTraq 3D) where the ankle-toe distance would decrease during paw rotation, however the calculated angle would not be affected because it is derived from the 3D coordinates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Explaining the experimental design (summarized in Figure 1) and approach (use of these various viral constructs to ablate synaptic transmission in a very specific way that is tunable with doxycycline) would greatly help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer and have added details to the âSilencing alters interlimb coordination while other key features of locomotion are maintainedâ section of the results (lines 78-85). Additionally, a new Figure 1 has been amended to provide further detail on the experimental setup and design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract should be improved. Can you be more specific reporting results? Many sentences are too broad and &quot;whishy-washy&quot; regarding results and implications.</p></disp-quote><p>The abstract has been significantly rewritten to provide specifics about the behavioral (locomotor) outcomes and is now more direct about possible implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction</p><p>It would be useful to include further information about LDPNs. What are the known interactions between the descending and ascending LPNs? Why is there a need for both?</p></disp-quote><p>Direct interactions between the LAPNs and LDPNs are not known, but some additional information about these two populations has been added to the introduction (lines 41-44) and discussion (lines 250-262)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>As alluded previously, no knee marker: if markers are on joint, can only determine hip or foot displacements no hip/knee and knee/ankle as described. Linking hip to ankle marker gives false reading?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct, we do/did not mark the knee for intralimb kinematics as there is extensive movement of the knee joint under the skin (PMIDs:19270266, 14673005, 32605423). To accurately identify and track the knee the lengths of the tibia and femur are needed, and software is needed to triangulate knee position. Thus, our approach is to mark the Iliac crest, the head of the greater trochanter, the lateral malleolus of the ankle, and the most lateral metatarsophalangeal joint to create a three-segment, two-angle model of the limb that is both accurate and sensitive for detecting intralimb kinematics (PMIDs: 32605423, 29213073, 32902379). This has now been clearly stated in the methods section âHindlimb kinematics and intralimb coordinationâ (lines 387-400)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How did you account for paw or limb rotations? Medial and lateral rotations at the hip also pronation or supinations at the ankle could provide very distorted 2D representations of joint angles.</p></disp-quote><p>Repeat from above: Paw rotation is a common characteristic of stepping post-SCI and was at least partly accounted for by our kinematic assessment which used 2 cameras placed at angles allowing the limb movements on one side of the animal to be quantified in 3 dimensions, with some limitations compared to multi-camera set-ups. The use of 2 cameras for 3D estimates is described in the section âHindlimb kinematics and intralimb coordinationâ. We consider the accuracy sufficient to support the primary conclusions which rely heavily on measures and indices that would not be influenced by paw rotation. Figure 5 and Figure 2 supplement 1 both show 2D stick figures derived from the 3D coordinates (from MaxTraq 3D) where the ankle-toe distance would decrease during paw rotation, however the calculated angle would not be affected because it is derived from the 3D coordinates. We hope this clarifies our experimental approach and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, as alluded previously, no toe marker results in no information about toe drag.</p></disp-quote><p>The toe is marked (as the most lateral metatarsophalangeal joint), and we have verified that this is clearly stated in the methods (lines 388-395). This information is now illustrated clearly in the new Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many LAPNs were spared? Is there sprouting of terminals? Why was there not quantification of anatomical data?</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions/points raised by the Reviewer but are beyond the scope of the current study. To correctly address these questions would require additional cohorts of animals and use of a dual-viral system specifically designed for anatomic quantification. The axons of long propriospinal neurons (spanning &gt; 6 spinal levels) are positioned superficially in the lateral and ventrolateral white matter which increases the likelihood that substantial numbers of these axons remain anatomically intact post-SCI (PMID: 15514981).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Co-localization difficult to see in Figure 2</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 has been slightly adjusted for visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were angular displacements calculated for both plantar and dorsal steps? And averaged? Why?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we calculated intralimb coordination and kinematics for both plantar and dorsal steps and chose not to focus on just plantar steps because dorsal steps are one of the consequences of the injury delivered that does mildly influence limb kinematics. During silencing after injury the number of dorsal steps was significantly reduced and we believe this was reflected in the intralimb kinematic outcomes (like angular displacement). Thus, it made sense to us to include both dorsal and plantar steps. Figure 5 illustrates how dorsal stepping might influence angular displacement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Swimming test: Did the injury induce rats to use their forelimbs? How did that influence results?</p></disp-quote><p>The injuries were mild enough for the animals to have hindlimb-only swimming when a functional plateau was achieved (albeit at a slower speed than normal). We choose swimming passes for analysis that are uninterrupted and where the animals are swimming down the middle of the lane, since both uninjured and injured animals (at their functional plateau, silenced or not) will use their forelimbs for steering and/or to push off the sides of the tank.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>Behaviour improvements with silencing are modest, some of the conclusions should be toned down? For example, intralimb coordination and other kinematic parameters measurements are incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusions have been toned down where appropriate. Given that the metatarsophalangeal joint is marked, and that we have more fully described our kinematic and gait assessments that utilize a 3D estimation of the limb using three segments and two angles (please see response to Reviewer 2) that is both accurate and sensitive to changes in intralimb kinematics (PMID: 32605423), and that we utilized appropriate statistical analyses, we content that it is still appropriate to refer to the results as significant if p&lt;.05. Furthermore, taken together, the improvements are not just statistically significant, but are functionally significant as can be seen in the included videos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is this effect happening? Authors speculated that LAPNs have maladaptations after SCI, but no evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct. We do not have any evidence to help explain how/why these behavioral effects occur and but have presented several potential mechanisms in the discussion. Our laboratories are currently developing and optimizing the methods to narrow down these possibilities. As these methods must be empirically optimized for each application (PMID: 33828464), definitive answers about the mechanism(s) responsible for the behavioral outcomes are outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No forelimb effect could simply be due to redundancies in the system. Also, no evidence for their contention for supraspinal oversight of forelimbs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to this section of the discussion in the hopes of supporting this speculation. In our previous paper (PMID: 32902379), we showed that LAPN silencing disrupted both forelimb and hindlimb alternation but in a context specific manner. We speculate that the context specificity is due to greater supraspinal oversight in some contexts as compared to others. Silencing the LAPNS after SCI did not disrupt forelimb alternation, suggesting that the context of SCI may involve greater supraspinal oversight over forelimb function. We agree that this could also simply be due to redundancies in the system, but what redundancies would be present in the SCI state, but not in the uninjured state?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion in humans: what is the evidence this pathway and mechanism is similar in humans, as humans are bipedal animals. Maybe the effect would be similar to the results from the swimming tests?</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we did not include human literature/references providing evidence for LAPNs in humans.

Additional details about the viral system (lines 78-85) and locomotor indices have also been added (lines 148-156) to improve readability and comprehension.

What is &quot;irregularly patterned steps&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>A clear definition of âirregularly patterned stepsâ has been added to the âStepping coordination indicesâ in the methods (lines 424-427).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Prior findings were context dependent (i.e. on 'grippy' surfaces but not smooth/slick, non-exploratory locomotion). There is no mention of context here. Is there a context dependency to these effect post-SCI or were the same surfaces/contexts used?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The context specificity of the previous findings and rationale for the current study design have been added to the end of the introduction (lines 69-71).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some of the benchmarks for comparison were not well described and some of indices used were not explained fully enough to distinguish between them or to see how they may have different implications for function.</p></disp-quote><p>Brief descriptions of the various gait analysis/parameters used have been added to the âSilencing LAPNs post-SCI improves locomotor functionâ section of the results (lines 148-156).

For the RI, there are discrepancies in the Methods and the more detailed description in the paper referred to. This is likely due to the wording, rather than the actual measure. According to the paper referred to, the denominator is number of paw placements, not cycles (there are 4 paw placements per cycle). The dorsal or irregularly patterned are not excluded, except from the numerator, so that they are 'counted against' the index.</p></disp-quote><p>A brief description for the interpretation of RI has been added to âSilencing LAPNS post-SCI improves locomotor functionâ section of the results (lines 148-156), and the equation for RI has been corrected in the methods section (lines 423-428).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Based on the explanation provided, it is not clear how the CPI is different from the RI. The CPI does not appear to be included in the references referred to. What is &quot;correctly patterned&quot;?

Plantar step and dorsal step indices are presented as different measures but they appear to be the inverse of each other (based on the numbers). The plantar step index is described as plantar hindlimb steps relative to forelimb steps. Is a plantar step index of less than 100 due the presence of dorsal steps? Or is this a measure of forelimb-hindlimb coordination deficits?</p></disp-quote><p>While the nomenclature is similar for these locomotor indices, they provide differing information related to locomotion and are not the inverse of one another. The Reviewer is correct, that a PSI of &lt;1.0 (or &lt;100%) would be due to the presence of dorsal hindlimb steps and based on its derivation is also a measure of forelimb-hindlimb coordination. Details about the interpretation and derivation of DSI and PSI have been added to the results (lines 182-183) and methods sections (lines 422-432) and are also provided below.</p><p>â¾Dorsal stepping index (DSI) is defined as âthe ratio of dorsal steps to total hindlimb stepsâ and assesses precision of stepping or paw placement of the hindlimbs.</p><p>â DSI = (# hindlimb dorsal steps / # total hindlimb steps)</p><p>â¾Plantar stepping index (PSI) is defined as âthe ratio of hindlimb plantar steps to number of forelimb stepsâ and assesses coordination of the forelimbs and hindlimbs.</p><p>â PSI = (# hindlimb plantar steps / # forelimb plantar steps)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. In Figure 6, an indication of the &quot;normal range&quot; that is being referred to (in a-c) would be helpful, or alternatively, defining what is considered abnormal. The swing and stance times are said to be &quot;improved&quot;. The basis for this judgment is not obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>The normal trend is indicated in Figure 2g-k, as this represents the expected spatiotemporal relationship in the same animals prior to SCI and without silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 5 does not include homolateral coupling. Although this was unaffected in intact, the LAPNs are both ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting so this is of interest. Whether or not there are differences in homolateral coupling, this could be discussed in terms of anatomical work of the authors with regards to the populations of LAPNs being silenced and the more caudal LAPNs which are presumably (?) unaffected by the silencing.</p></disp-quote><p>These data have been added to figure 6 (previously figure 5) and show that coupling of homolateral limb pairs is unaltered with silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Relatedly, information related to efficacy of the technique (i.e. approximate % of the LAPN population affected, distance of spread within lumbar segments when L2 is targeted) would enhance the interpretation as well.</p></disp-quote><p>A recent publication from our laboratories (PMID: 33828464) found similar numbers of ipsilateral LAPNs were labeled when using Fluororuby, a 10kD rhodamine dextran amine, (mean number of LAPNs labeled = 135 +/-52) and a dual-viral system (mean number of LAPNs labeled = 126 +/- 46) similar to the dual-viral silencing a silencing system used here. Provided Fluroruby gives an accurate representation of the number of LAPNs, the dual-viral silencing system used here likely silencing &gt;90% of LAPNs. Additionally, eTeNT (produced by the dual-viral silencing system) has extremely high catalytic activity (PMID:7527117) that is active at very low levels. Which also supports that &gt;90% of LAPNs were silenced in the current study. As this information will aid in the interpretation of the current study, it has been added to the âSpared LAPNS express synapse-silencing eTeNT.EGFP chronicallyâ section of the results (lines 140-143).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are several possible explanations for the results offered which are feasible based on the presented data. It seems that these may be possible to narrow down based on tissue from these experiments. Specifically, a quantification of LAPN terminals (or non-somatic fluorescence) in lumbar and cervical cord in these SCI rats compared to that in the uninjured may suggest, first, the degree to which terminals are lost after SCI (or an approximate proportion that are spared) and, second, if there is significant sprouting at either level. Since lumbar terminals were sparse in the intact, are there terminals seen in lumbar cord after SCI? Presence or absence may lend support to either the long loop effects or local gain of aberrant connections.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions/points raised by the Reviewer but are beyond the scope of the current study.
