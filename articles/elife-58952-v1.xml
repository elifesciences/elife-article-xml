How these transients are generated and regulate brain function in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes exhibit spontaneous, activity-independent microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in their fine processes. Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are mediated by the TRP channel TrpML, stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and can be enhanced in frequency by the neurotransmitter tyramine via the TyrRII receptor. Interestingly, many astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are closely associated with tracheal elements, which dynamically extend filopodia throughout the central nervous system (CNS) to deliver O<sub>2</sub> and regulate gas exchange. Many astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are spatio-temporally correlated with the initiation of tracheal filopodial retraction. Loss of TrpML leads to increased tracheal filopodial numbers, growth, and increased CNS ROS. We propose that local ROS production can activate astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients through TrpML, and that a subset of these microdomain transients promotes tracheal filopodial retraction and in turn modulate CNS gas exchange.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>calcium transient</kwd><kwd>glia</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>neuron-glia signaling</kwd><kwd>calcium transients</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS03538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006668</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH RO1 NS053538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Astrocyte microdomain calcium transients are mediated by TrpML, stimulated by ROS and tyramine, and mediate astrocyte–tracheal interactions in CNS gas exchange.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Astrocytes exhibit two major types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events, whole-cell fluctuations and near-membrane microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khakh and McCarthy, 2015</xref>). Whole-cell transients are coordinated across astrocyte networks and regulated by adrenergic receptor signaling. Emerging data suggests these transients are important for state-dependent changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>), and involve TRPA1 channels that regulate the insertion of neurotransmitter transporters like GAT-3 into astrocyte membranes to alter neurophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shigetomi et al., 2011</xref>). Whole-cell astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS are also stimulated by the invertebrate equivalents of adrenergic transmitters, octopamine (Oct) and tyramine (Tyr). Octopamine and tyramine stimulate cell-wide astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase through the dual-specificity Octopamine-Tyramine Receptor (Oct-TyrR) and the TRP channel Water witch (Wtrw). This astrocyte-mediated signaling event downstream of octopamine and tyramine is critical for in vivo neuromodulation: astrocyte-specific elimination of Oct-TyrR or Wtrw in larvae blocks the ability of octopamine and tyramine to silence downstream dopaminergic neurons, and alters both simple chemosensory behavior and a touch-induced startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Adrenergic regulation of whole-cell astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is therefore an ancient and broadly conserved feature of metazoan astrocytes.</p><p>The mechanisms that generate astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are not understood, nor are the precise in vivo roles for this type of astrocyte signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khakh and McCarthy, 2015</xref>). In mammals, astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occur spontaneously, do not require neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nett et al., 2002</xref>), depend on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rungta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>), and persist in cultured astrocytes, which has been used to argue they are cell-autonomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khakh and McCarthy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nett et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study described close association of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with mitochondria, and found that pharmacological blockade of the mPTP led to a suppression of transients, while ROS led to an enhancement of transients. These observations led to the proposal that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were generated by opening of the mPTP during oxidative phosphorylation, perhaps as a means to balance mitochondrial function and ongoing astrocyte support with local metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report that <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes exhibit spontaneous, activity-independent microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and show they are mediated by the TRP channel TrpML. Many astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are associated with branches and filopodia extending from CNS trachea, an interconnected set of tubules that allow for gas exchange in the larval CNS, and astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients precede the onset of filopodial retraction. Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are regulated by ROS and loss of TrpML leads to tracheal overgrowth and increased CNS ROS. We propose that one in vivo role for tracheal–astrocyte interactions is to regulate CNS gas exchange, with tracheal filopodia-dependent local hyperoxia resulting in increased production of ROS, which gates TrpML to generate local astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, ultimately promoting tracheal retraction and reducing local O<sub>2</sub> delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes exhibit microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title><p>To monitor the near-membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes, we expressed myristoylated GCaMP5a (myr-GCaMP5a) in astrocytes using the astrocyte-specific <italic>alrm-Gal4</italic> driver. We acutely dissected 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval CNS and live-imaged myr-GCaMP5a signals in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). We collected images at the midpoint of the neuropil along the dorsoventral axis for 6 min time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients exhibited diverse waveforms, with variable durations and frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The average full width at half maximum (FWHM) for these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was 5.5 ± 2.26 (mean ± SD) seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients frequently occurred at the same location, suggesting there are hotspots where microdomains repeatedly occur for a given astrocyte. The majority of foci exhibited 1–3 events during the 6 min imaging window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at different sites did not exhibit obvious synchrony with one another. We also observed microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of a similar rise-and-fall pattern, although with a slightly shorter duration (FWHM, 1.7 ± 0.08 s, mean ± SD) in the astrocytes of intact L1 (1<sup>st</sup> instar) larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>), suggesting the microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the acute CNS preparations we observed largely reflect in vivo astrocyte activity, although with some differences in duration. Blockade of action potential firing with tetrodotoxin did not alter astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, although they were eliminated by removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and were sensitive to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker lanthanum chloride (LaCl<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from extracellular space is essential for generation of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of larval CNS (white area, neuropil; gray, cortex).

We sought to determine whether microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients spanned astrocyte-astrocyte cell boundaries, or if they appeared only within the domain of single cells. We used a flippable construct expressing either QF or Gal4 under the control of the <italic>alrm</italic> promoter, along with two genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators: <italic>QUAS::myr-GCaMP5a</italic> and <italic>UAS::myr-R-GECO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm both myr-GCaMP5a and myr-R-GECO1 behaved similarly, we first examined double-positive cells and found both can detect the same microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and in cells exclusively expressing one of these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators there were no differences in the overall frequency of the microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> events detected between these sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then identified cell boundaries between myr-GCaMP5a/myr-R-GECO1 single-labeled cells, and examined the dynamics of astrocyte microdomains across those boundaries. We observed coincident signaling with myr-GCaMP5a and myr-R-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data indicate that individual astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can span astrocyte-astrocyte borders. Our observations support the notion that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are regulated by extrinsic cues that can simultaneously stimulate two astrocytes, or that astrocyte-astrocyte communication/coupling is sufficient to coordinate very local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events across neighboring cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are enhanced by tyramine through TyrRII and mediated by TrpML</title><p>To determine whether neurotransmitters were capable of modulating astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we bath applied several neurotransmitters and live-imaged astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Application of glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, or octopamine had no effect on the frequency of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We screened the known receptors for tyramine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and found that astrocyte-specific depletion of TyrRII blocked the ability of tyramine to increase astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. The spontaneous microdomain events were not dependent on the presence of tyramine or octopamine, as mutants that block the production of tyramine and octopamine (<italic>Tdc2<sup>RO54</sup></italic>) or octopamine (<italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic>) did not significantly alter the frequency of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, nor did mutations in <italic>Oct-TyrR</italic>, which we previously showed was essential for activation of whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The myc-tagged version of TrpML predominantly localized at GFP-Lamp1<sup>+</sup> endo-lysosomes in astrocytes in both fine astrocytic processes and cell bodies, as well as near the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). TrpML might therefore execute its regulation of astrocyte microdomains from endo-lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or both.</p><p>Previous work has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate TrpML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and astrocyte near-membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in mammals are sensitive to ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore assayed the sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to ROS. We observed that bath application of the ROS generator hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) led to a TrpML-dependent increase in astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, while, reciprocally, addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine completely abolished them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). These data indicate that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are mediated by TrpML and are highly sensitive to ROS. Furthermore, our observation that TrpML and Wtrw regulate only microdomain or whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, respectively, demonstrates that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and whole-cell changes in astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> are physiologically and genetically distinct signaling events, although adrenergic transmitters (tyramine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and norepinephrine in mouse) may serve as factors to coordinate their activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are associated with trachea and precede tracheal filopodia retraction</title><p>Mammalian astrocytes make intimate contacts with blood vessels by forming endfeet to allow for gas exchange, uptake of nutrients from blood, and maintenance of the blood brain barrier.

The onset of trachea filopodial retraction was tightly correlated with astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaks (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>), with a latency time of 25.9 ± 2.18 s.

Correlations between astrocyte microdomains and any changes in tracheal filopodial dynamics were only observed when filopodia overlapped with astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling above or below the plane of focus could be modulating the dynamics of these trachea.

We propose that one important physiological role for a subset of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is to modulate CNS gas exchange through TrpML and ROS signaling.</p><p>Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> share many features with those observed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). They are spontaneously generated, exhibit diverse waveforms, and appear for the most part asynchronous across astrocyte populations. Their production requires the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and they are suppressed by the broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker LaCl<sub>3</sub>. Our analysis of adjacent astrocytes that are labeled with uniquely identifiable Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (myr-GCaMP5a versus myr-R-GECO1) demonstrated individual astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients can span astrocyte-astrocyte boundaries, which might argue for an extrinsic mechanism regulating their production. Alternatively, it might indicate that astrocyte-astrocyte coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events is strong during their production. Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are not suppressed by blockade of action potentials with tetrodotoxin, suggesting they are not activity dependent, although we also cannot formally rule out a role for spontaneous release of neurotransmitters at synapses.</p><p>Based on their persistence in <italic>Tdc2</italic> mutants, which lack tyramine and octopamine in CNS, we conclude that spontaneous astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients do not require the production of tyramine or octopamine in vivo. Nevertheless, and similar to application of norepinephrine to mouse preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>), we found that tyramine was capable of stimulating a partial increase in astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and that to some extent this required the tyramine receptor TyrRII on astrocytes. Why these transients do not require tyramine for their spontaneous production, but can be stimulated by tyramine application, remains unclear, but this adrenergic regulation of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling appears to be a conserved feature in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse. It is possible that adrenergic regulation may serve as a way to physiologically couple whole-cell and microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as a mechanism to coordinate neuronal activity with astrocyte calcium signaling, or both. The regulation of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in vivo by octopamine and tyramine is complex. Tyramine can stimulate increases in whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in astrocytes through the Oct-TyrR, as does octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2016</xref>), but the latter has no effect in astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Signaling mediated by TyrRII may somehow increase the open probability of TrpML in microdomains in a way that is distinct from whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. This is consistent with our observation that TrpML is partially responsible for the tyramine-induced increase in astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p><p>TrpML may exert its effects on astrocytic microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at endo-lysosomes, at the cell cortex, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). TrpML is well known to signal in the endo-lysosomal compartment as well as the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). We observed localization of TrpML to endo-lysosomes and the cell surface (or cell cortex) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes. TrpML may function in astrocytic endo-lysosomes (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from these compartments) to indirectly activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through other cation channels at the cell surface. Alternatively, TrpML might function at the cell surface to directly drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, or stimulate entry from the extracellular space by other channels, or release from intracellular stores. It is also important to note that while we have assayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, TrpML is also capable of passing several other cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feng et al., 2014</xref>), and so its role in regulating astrocyte functions could be mediated by these cations in addition to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and whole-cell changes in astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling appear to be distinct, in terms of their regulation by neurotransmitters and the molecular machinery generating each type of event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, whole-cell astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are modulated by norepinephrine, adrenergic receptor signaling, and startle stimuli, while microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are activity-independent, associated with mitochondria and are sensitive to ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, whole-cell transients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes are activated by tyramine or octopamine (the invertebrate adrenergic neurotransmitters). We previously showed either of these can activate the Oct-TyrR receptor and the TRP channel Waterwitch on astrocytes, and in turn through the adenosine receptor AdoR, mediate many of the physiological and behavioral changes exerted by tyramine and octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in astrocytes are not regulated directly by neural activity, are mediated by TrpML (but not Oct-TyrR or Wtrw) and they are sensitive to ROS.</p><p>In mouse, a subset of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are associated with mitochondria, which have been proposed to serve as a source of ROS, potentially through transient opening of the mPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>). These events may also require mitochondria in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, however the density of mitochondria in astrocyte processes was sufficiently high in our preparations that drawing such a conclusion was not feasible—a single astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient appears to span domains that include many mitochondria. It is reasonable to speculate that astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients across species are to a significant extent functionally distinct from whole-cell fluctuations, and that they play a role in coupling astrocyte signaling with tracheal/vasculature dynamics or other metabolic changes occurring in astrocytic mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>). Multiple distinct functional roles for astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (i.e. in tracheal regulation versus metabolism) could explain why although only half of all observed astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are associated with tracheal filopodia, all appear to be potently regulated by ROS. Perhaps the remaining half of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients not associated with trachea are responding to mitochondria-based metabolic needs through ROS signaling. Finally, approximately half of tracheal filopodia we observed were not visibly associated with astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, yet they were able to extend and retract. This argues that other mechanisms exist to modulate tracheal dynamics in the CNS and astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients only represent one regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Maintaining a healthy, spatiotemporally regulated normoxic environment to prevent either hypoxia or hyperoxia in CNS is an enormous and ongoing challenge, as the O<sub>2</sub>-consuming metabolism is thought to fluctuate vigorously in response to neural activity. The close association of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with trachea, the larval breathing apparatus, and with tracheal retraction in particular, suggests a role in modulating CNS gas exchange. Increase in O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues can lead to hyperoxia and elevated production of ROS. TrpML has recently been found to be a ROS sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), which would allow for a simple mechanism for ROS-mediated activation of TrpML downstream of increased O<sub>2</sub> delivery. Consistent with such a role in regulation of gas exchange, we found an increase in ROS in the CNS of <italic>trpml</italic> mutants, and we demonstrated that bath application of tyramine to stimulate astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was sufficient to promote tracheal filopodial retraction. Together our data support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) where a subset of TrpML-mediated microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in astrocytes facilitate tracheal retraction, likely in conjunction with TrpML in trachea. Complete loss of TrpML led to an increase in tracheal growth (e.g. an increased vascularization of neural tissues), which argues that astrocyte-tracheal signaling through TrpML can regulate long-term structural changes in the tracheal morphology. Based on these findings, we propose that an important role for a subset of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the larval CNS is to coordinate gas exchange through regulation of tracheal dynamics, thereby balancing O<sub>2</sub> delivery/CO<sub>2</sub> removal according to local metabolic needs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC: 28992</td><td valign="top">FlyBase symbol: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup>;

The petri dish then was placed on the stage of a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a 40X water dipping objective. The focal plane was fixed around where most of the dorsal lateral astrocytes start to appear in the field of view. After 4 min acclimation and stabilization, a 6 min movie (excitation channel, 488 nm. exposure time, 300 ms. single focal plane) was taken for analysis. The 488 nm and 516 nm channels were alternated for imaging both the microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in astrocytes and the dynamics of tracheal filopodia. To keep the tracheal filopodia in focus during the course of extension and retraction, images spanning 5 µM in z depth were taken.</p><p>The frequency (the number of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients per minute) of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in each preparation was initially quantified as follows: a 100 µm X 100 µm window was cropped from each movie and resulted in nine smaller, side-to-side 100pixel X 100pixel windows (line drawing over movies) in which the number of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was counted manually. The total number of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in each preparation (100 µm X 100 µm) was acquired by adding up all the numbers counted in these 9 100pixel X 100pixel windows. The cutoff for defining a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient is 5% change in delta F/F<sub>0</sub>, which is evaluated by <italic>post hoc</italic> calculations after manually selecting active events. After the automatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analysis software Astrocyte Quantitative Analysis (AQuA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) became publicly available, we also compared our initial datasets of the dissected CNS from wildtype 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae using the above manual method to the ones obtained through AQuA (Manual vs AQuA-Source Data 8), and we didn’t find a significant difference (manual: 16.7 ± 3.69 versus AQuA: 19.8 ± 3.02, p=0.53). The intensity of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was measured with software Volocity (PerkinElmer, Inc), and the amplitude of microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was defined by (F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> (t = 0,1,2…40, the peak amplitude was designated at t = 20, delta F = F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>) as percentage. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of astrocyte microdomains was acquired using software Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc).</p><p>For bath application of compounds, halfway through the 6 min imaging window (~3 min), 100 µl imaging buffer (1.2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) containing drugs (2X final concentration) was directly applied onto the preparations, then imaging continued for another 3 min. The chemicals used for bath application experiments include: Tocris, tetrodotoxin (1 µM, Cat# 1078). Sigma-Aldrich, lanthanum chloride (LaCl<sub>3</sub>, Cat# 211605), acetylcholine (2.5 mM, Cat# A6625), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 2.5 mM, Cat# A2129), glutamate (2.5 mM, Cat# G1626), tyramine (2.5 mM, Cat# T90344), octopamine (2.5 mM, Cat# O0250), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 2.5 mM, Cat# A7250), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM, Cat# H1009).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunostaining and tracheal branch tracing</title><p>The CNS dissected in PBS from 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae (larval density ~100, 25℃, 100–108 hr after egg laying) was immediately transferred in 4% formaldehyde for fixation for 20 min (for co-staining with tracheal filopodia, the dissection was performed in the imaging buffer with 0.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the CNS preparations were incubated in the imaging buffer with 1.2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 10 min before 4% formaldehyde fixation).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brian A MacVicar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ma and Freeman present results from studies of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system and their relationship to the physiology and behavior of CNS trachea. Using genetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporters, they first show that astrocyte processes exhibit transient changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within microdomains. They present results suggesting that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes within microdomains, and they identify the TrpML ion channel, in a targeted genetic screen, as a critical component of the mechanism regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> within microdomains. Importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are almost eliminated with astrocyte-specific knockdown of <italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic>. The authors further show that tyramine, acting through a fly tyramine receptor (TyrRII), can enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients but that it is not required for such transients. They demonstrate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains are in close proximity to filopodia of tracheal tubules, and go on to show that transient changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> within such microdomains can influence the behavior of tracheal filopodia.</p><p>Their results suggest that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> within such microdomains is strongly correlated with filapodial retraction events. Additional findings show that extension of tracheal filopodia is enhanced in the <italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, whereas retraction events are normal, suggesting that the TrpML channel is important for inhibition of extension events. Finally, the authors show that there is overgrowth of trachea and higher levels of reactive oxygen species in the <italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, suggesting a role of the TrpML channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tracheal growth and gas exchange.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and represents a significant advance in understanding Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in astrocytes. The results are important as similar astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains regulate CNS physiology in mammals, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides an important genetic model for the analysis of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. However, there are a few issues and suggestions for improvement, as well as points that need clarification prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on the data presented, it is not clear whether the TRP channel is the primary source of calcium influx for microdomain oscillations, or secondarily coupled to the process to control the frequency of the events only. Please clarify this or provide more convincing data that <italic>trpml</italic> directly mediates calcium microdomain influx or tone down conclusion and add more to the Discussion that discusses alternative models.</p><p>2) Where is <italic>trpml</italic> localized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> astrocytes? All reviewers agree that it is important to know whether TrpML is acting in astrocyte lysosomes or at the cell membrane to regulate CNS and tracheal functions. Localizing it would help, as would measuring the amount of calcium influx signal in the absence of the channel --- the frequency goes down, but they still appear to be present. See reviewer comments for specific comments and suggestions.</p><p>3) Please address whether astrocytes are regulating trachea in the mature larval CNS, as detailed in comments by reviewer 3.

The presentation of these results leads the reader to think that TrpML acts at the astrocyte cellular membrane to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. While this might be true, The TrpML channel has been described as a lysosomal membrane rather than a cellular membrane channel, and it is clearly required for cell migration and phagocytosis via regulation of actomyosin contractility (Edwards-Jorquera et al., JCB, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201905228). Is there any evidence that TrpML is even present at the cellular membrane? Have the authors determined localization of the channel in astrocytes? If not, the presentation will lead most readers to think its site of action is the cellular membrane when this has not been demonstrated and is likely not to be the case. A more detailed model for TrpML, taking its localization into account, is needed.</p><p>2) The authors propose &quot;that one important physiological role for astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is to modulate CNS gas exchange through TrpML and ROS signaling.&quot; This suggests that TrpML might have a modulatory role in the mature nervous system. However, it seems that all of the authors' results about TrpML could be interpreted as a requirement for the channel in astrocytes during development with a consequent effect on physiology of the tracheal system. Indeed, the authors show that tracheal overgrowth occurs in the channel mutant. I wonder if there is any evidence for a role of TrpML in the mature nervous system. Did the authors attempt a conditional knockdown of TrpML in the mature larval CNS? What about inhibition of TrpML in mature CNS astrocytes using an antagonist that blocks Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from lysosomes? Or, activation of TrpML with an agonist in the mature CNS? Or, transient blockade of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in the mature larval CNS? Is it known whether such manipulations alter tracheal function? It would seem important to determine whether astrocytes actually modulate trachea and/or gas exchange in the mature CNS since this is the implication of the authors' model.</p><p>3) Although TrpML is known to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable, it is also permeable to other cations. It is described in FlyBase as a cation channel involved in regulation of endosomal trafficking, autophagy, lateral inhibition and TOR signaling in hemocytes and perhaps other cell types. Is regulation of astrocytes and tracheal function as simple as modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry or is it more complicated than that? I wonder if Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains are affected indirectly because of an effect on endosomal trafficking. Some discussion of this is needed.</p><p>4) There is no mention of CNS abnormalities in the <italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant or <italic>trpml<sup>1</sup></italic> knockdown flies.

I don't think the microdomains were observed using the older dye loading techniques. For example, the Nett et al. paper showed almost complete block of the astrocyte calcium signals by the IP3-R antagonist heparin. In my opinion these fly microdomains that are described here are most similar to the microdomains first reported by Srinivasan et al., 2015. Rungta et al., 2016, supports Srinivasan et al. and their data also point to a calcium entry pathway independent of IP3R mediated release and not altered in TRPA1-/- mice. Of course, there appear to be multiple sources of calcium that generate microdomains and Agarwal et al., 2017, point to a mechanism of calcium release from mitochondria. The differences between these various mechanisms generating calcium transients should be clearly stated because different types of calcium signals generated in different regions of astrocytes may potentially have different functions (as would be expected in neurons).</p><p>3) This observation of ROS sensitivity in this study is consistent with the report by Zhang et al., 2016, describing the ROS sensitivity of TRPMl1 channels. However, there is a significant difference in that Zhang et al. describe the calcium signals as arising from the ROS triggered release of calcium from lysosomes into the cytoplasm not as a plasma membrane channel leading to entry from the extracellular space. The authors should reconcile this important difference and describe which signals are lysosomal release dependent.</p><p>4) &quot;We note that those that exhibited only retraction did so very early in the imaging window, which could indicate that we began our imaging after extension had been initiated.&quot;</p><p>This paragraph is not critical but is confusing.

Our argument is based on the increased ROS in <italic>trpml</italic> mutants or when <italic>trpml</italic> is depleted from astrocytes (Figure 4D). Our best evidence for active regulation of tracheal elements by astrocytes in the mature (3<sup>rd</sup> instar) larval nervous system is that bath application of tyramine, which activates microdomain transients, drives filopodial retraction in live preparations (Figure 4B). We included our new data in the revised manuscript that showed <italic>trpml</italic> knockdown specifically at the 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval stage did result in faster tracheal filopodial growth.

Finally, All of the approaches suggested above to manipulate calcium would likely work in live preparations (e.g. Figure 1D, LaCl<sub>3</sub> and 0mM extracellular calcium) for blockade of different aspects of calcium signaling in astrocytes, but it would not spare trachea from influence, and more importantly not be technically feasible for us to do this chronically, allow animals to grow, and then observe how this alters tracheal morphology. Nevertheless, in response to this concern we will temper our conclusions regarding active regulation of gas exchange and leave open alternative possibilities for the phenotypes we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although TrpML is known to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable, it is also permeable to other cations.

Would it be possible to add a supplementary figure showing more of just these traces for all (or a larger representative sample) of the data included in Figure 3E. That figure shows a perfect correlation, but the raw data provided do not look convincing. Seeing more of those raw data would be very helpful for convincing the readers of this correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional set of traces and video frames.</p></body></sub-article></article>
