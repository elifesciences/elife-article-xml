A number of proteins transiently associate with spliceosomes to specifically impact these steps (first and second step factors). We recently identified Fyv6 (FAM192A in humans) as a second step factor in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>; however, we did not determine how widespread Fyv6’s impact is on the transcriptome. To answer this question, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze changes in splicing. These results show that loss of Fyv6 results in activation of non-consensus, branch point (BP) proximal 3ʹ SS transcriptome-wide. To identify the molecular basis of these observations, we determined a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast product complex spliceosome containing Fyv6 at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that Fyv6 is the only second step factor that contacts the Prp22 ATPase and that Fyv6 binding is mutually exclusive with that of the first step factor Yju2. We then use this structure to dissect Fyv6 functional domains and interpret results of a genetic screen for <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor mutations. The combined transcriptomic, structural, and genetic studies allow us to propose a model in which Yju2/Fyv6 exchange facilitates exon ligation and Fyv6 promotes usage of consensus, BP distal 3ʹ SS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program DGE-1747503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Senn</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Max E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM135066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Senn</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> spliceosome component Fyv6 contributes to precursor messenger RNA splicing by promoting use of branch site distal 3' splice sites and interacting with key factors involved in exon ligation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is catalyzed by a large macromolecular complex called the spliceosome. Spliceosomes are composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), each composed of a small nuclear RNA (snRNA; U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and several different protein splicing factors. The snRNPs and dozens of other proteins assemble de novo at each intron to form spliceosomes. Spliceosomes are highly dynamic and form different complexes as proteins and snRNAs join and leave. Many of these complexes have been characterized biochemically, genetically, and by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plaschka et al., 2019</xref>). The splicing reaction itself is carried out in two sequential transesterification reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, the 5ʹ splice site (5ʹ SS) is cleaved during formation of an intron lariat (first step). Second, the intron lariat is removed simultaneously with exon ligation at the 3ʹ SS (second step).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Widespread splicing changes due to loss of Fyv6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing reaction steps and products.

In yeast, several DExD/H-box ATPases function to limit usage of suboptimal SS by enhancing splicing fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Semlow and Staley, 2012</xref>). Two of these ATPases, Prp16 and Prp22, impact the fidelity of the first and second catalytic steps, respectively. In addition to these roles, Prp16 is also required for remodeling of the spliceosome to permit the first to second step transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwer and Guthrie, 1992</xref>), and Prp22 is essential for releasing the mRNA product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Company et al., 1991</xref>). While Prp16 does not need to be present during the first step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2023</xref>), Prp22 is required to be present for exon ligation if the branch point (BP) to 3ʹ SS distance is ≥21 nucleotides (nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). Despite many biochemical, single molecule, and structural studies, how spliceosomes promote usage of BP distal, Prp22-dependent 3ʹ SS has remained elusive.</p><p>Identification of the correct 3ʹ SS is an especially challenging problem given that the consensus sequence in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) and humans is just three nucleotides (YAG, Y=U or C). Cryo-EM structures of spliceosome product (P) complexes have revealed how these nucleotides can be recognized within the spliceosome active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fica et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The AG 3ʹ SS dinucleotide is recognized by the formation of non-Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions with the 5ʹ SS +1G and BP adenosine, while the pyrimidine at the –3 position of the 3ʹ SS is recognized by the Prp8 protein. Given this short consensus sequence, multiple different splicing factors also help to ensure that the correct 3ʹ SS is utilized, including Cwc21 and the second step factors Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank and Guthrie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gautam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). It is believed that Slu7 and Prp18 help to stabilize 3ʹ SS docking to the active site and that this contributes to second step efficiency. It has been proposed that Prp22 antagonizes 3ʹ SS docking to permit sampling of different 3ʹ SS to ensure that optimal sequences are used as a proofreading mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, identification of the correct 3ʹ SS depends not just on identification of the YAG sequence but also involves choosing which YAG sequence to use. Prp18 appears to aid in selection of BP distal 3ʹ SS and avoidance of BP proximal (and often non-consensus) 3ʹ SS. This observation could be due to Prp18 imposing a BP to 3ʹ SS distance constraint, enforcing use of canonical YAG 3ʹ SS sequences, or a combination of the two activities.</p><p>Recently, Fyv6 was identified as a novel second step factor in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). Fyv6 is a homolog of the human protein FAM192A, which was identified in pre-C* structures of the human spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>). While the impact of FAM192A on human spliceosome activity has not yet been well characterized, loss of Fyv6 in yeast decreases second step splicing efficiency in vitro and results in use of an alternative 3ʹ SS in the <italic>SUS1</italic> pre-mRNA in vivo. It is likely that unassigned cryo-EM densities in yeast C* (just prior to exon ligation) and P complexes correspond to Fyv6 since these densities are in analogous locations to that for FAM192A in the human pre-C* structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>). However, the resolutions of the yeast C* and P complex structures make unambiguous assignment of Fyv6 amino acid side chains and interactions difficult.</p><p>Here, we use a combination of transcriptomic, structural, biochemical, and genetic assays to elucidate how Fyv6 controls 3ʹ SS usage in yeast. RNA-seq analysis reveals widespread activation of alternative, BP proximal non-consensus 3ʹ SS in the absence of Fyv6 consistent with biochemical assays that show Fyv6 facilitates splicing of 3ʹ SS located <underline>≥</underline>21 nt from the BP. To further elucidate Fyv6 function, we determined a 2.3 Å cryo-EM structure of the yeast P complex spliceosome in which Fyv6 can be modeled. The structure reveals interactions between Fyv6 and Prp22 as well as a domain in Syf1 that interacts with either Fyv6 or the first step factor Yju2. 3D classification allowed us to identify two additional conformational states of P complex and provides insights into the coupling of 3ʹ SS active site docking and the presence of second step factors. We then used this structural data to dissect the functional domains of Fyv6, interpret the results of a genetic screen for suppressors of <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>, and to probe Fyv6 and Prp22 interactions. Combined, we propose a model in which Fyv6 is recruited to the spliceosome via interactions with the NTC component Syf1 in order to promote usage of BP distal, and Prp22-dependent, 3ʹ SS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of <italic>FYV6</italic> results in widespread use of alternative 3′ SS</title><p>Our previous work showed that loss of <italic>FYV6</italic> causes changes in 3ʹ SS usage in the <italic>SUS1</italic> pre-mRNA. To probe for changes transcriptome-wide, we used nonsense mediated decay (NMD)-deficient (<italic>upf1Δ</italic>, WT) yeast cells expressing or lacking Fyv6. By suppressing NMD, we hoped to limit degradation of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms generated in the absence of Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sayani et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with results from <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains, the <italic>fyv6Δ upf1Δ</italic> double mutant strain also showed reduced growth at 30°C and cold-sensitive (<italic>cs</italic>) and temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) phenotypes relative to a <italic>upf1Δ</italic> control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then used RNA-seq to analyze the isolated RNAs from these strains. As expected, many more changes in splicing were observed in the <italic>fyv6Δ upf1Δ</italic> strain relative to the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This is consistent with many mRNA isoforms generated due to loss of Fyv6 being substrates for NMD. Loss of Fyv6 resulted in a number of changes in gene expression with many non-intron-containing genes also being up- or downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We compared and classified changes in splicing between strains containing or lacking <italic>FYV6</italic> under permissive growth conditions (30°C) or after the yeast had been shifted to a non-permissive temperature (16°C or 37°C) for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In this case, we only considered events resulting in at least a 10% change in the percent spliced in value when <italic>FYV6</italic> is deleted. At all temperatures, we see changes in alternative 3ʹ SS usage in the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strain relative to the <italic>FYV6</italic> background. For example, we detected use of the alternative 3ʹ SS in the first intron of the <italic>SUS1</italic> transcript as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). We also saw increased use of a cryptic, non-consensus GAG 3ʹ SS in the first, but not second, intron of the <italic>YOS1</italic> transcript in the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> datasets and confirmed this result by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We observed several cases of alternative 5ʹ SS. However, the majority of these alternative 5ʹ SS were used with equal efficiencies in the WT and <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>The strains temperature shifted to 16°C had the largest number of changes due to <italic>FYV6</italic> deletion and the strains shifted to 37°C the least. The temperature shift to 16°C caused an increase in the numbers of both alternative 3ʹ SS and retained intron events detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The changes in alternative 3ʹ SS used at each temperature were mostly unique with few events detected under all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, we observed that 61 different RNAs (~20% of introns) changed splicing patterns due to loss of Fyv6. For many of these mRNAs, we detected multiple different 3ʹ SS being used.</p><p>To investigate these splicing events more closely, we analyzed changes in usage of alternative splice junctions by calculating the fraction of annotated splicing (FAnS) in the presence and absence of Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). FAnS ratios report the relative abundance of an alternative splicing event in relation to the main spliced isoform. We calculated FAnS values for all exon junction reads corresponding to usage of a canonical 5ʹ SS and an alternative 3ʹ SS for WT and <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains at each temperature. We then calculated the ratios of the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>/WT FAnS values for each transcript. These results confirm changes in alternative 3ʹ SS usage for both ribosomal protein gene (RPG) and non-RPG transcripts at all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We could not detect any significant differences between RPG and non-RPG splicing with this analysis, suggesting that differences in gene expression and splicing efficiencies between these two classes are not correlated with alternative 3ʹ SS usage. Combined these results show that Fyv6 plays a critical role in defining mRNA isoform production in yeast, particularly under non-optimal growth conditions such as temperature stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fyv6 facilitates usage of BP distal 3′ SS</title><p>We next analyzed the features of the 3ʹ SS impacted by Fyv6 loss. We used RNAs collected from yeast grown at 30°C and sequenced the libraries at higher depth than those used for the temperature-shift experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (~400 million vs. 200 million reads; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We first identified alternative 3ʹ SS used in each strain, annotated each as being upstream (5ʹ) or downstream (3ʹ) of the canonical 3ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grate and Ares, 2002</xref>), and then calculated the FAnS ratio for each site. This analysis shows that the majority of the alternative 3ʹ SS arising from Fyv6 deletion are upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, pink points above the diagonal). When these alternative 3ʹ SS are mapped according to their nucleotide distance from the canonical site, most of these are found within ~40 nt upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, purple violin). Plotting these alternative 3ʹ SS sites relative to their distance from the annotated BP reveals that the highest density of sites is ≤20 nt from the BP for transcripts with the highest FAnS ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, purple violin). It is important to note that we did not map BP in Fyv6 deletion strains, and it is possible that in some cases a shift in 3ʹ SS usage could also coincide with a shift in the BP. Indeed, a small number of alternative 3ʹ SS detected in the Fyv6 datasets are located upstream of the annotated BP, suggesting activation of an alternative BP and 3ʹ SS. However, we believe that the changes are predominantly due to usage of alternative 3ʹ SS located between the annotated BP and canonical 3ʹ SS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of Fyv6 activates branch point (BP) proximal, non-consensus 3ʹ splice site (SS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plot of the log<sub>10</sub> of fraction of annotated splicing (FAnS) values for differences between alternative 3ʹ SS usage in <italic>fyv6Δ upf1Δ</italic> and <italic>upf1Δ</italic> strains.

To test this directly and systematically, we created a series of ACT1-CUP1 reporters with various BP to 3ʹ SS distances (9–50 nt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) based on sequences used in previous studies of 3ʹ SS selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brys and Schwer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank and Guthrie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). We transformed strains containing or lacking Fyv6 and without debranchase (Dbr1) to limit degradation of lariat intermediates. We then detected RNA products by primer extension and calculated the second step (exon ligation) efficiency for each reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). While loss of Fyv6 has minimal impact on exon ligation when BP to 3ʹ SS distances are short (9–15 nt), exon ligation efficiency decreases significantly at distances of 21 nt or greater. In addition, we do not see evidence of cryptic BP usage in these assays. This result is consistent with the RNA-seq analysis and supports a function for Fyv6 in facilitating splicing at BP distal 3ʹ SS.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the sequence features of the alternative 3ʹ SS with increased use after loss of Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). For sites located upstream of the canonical 3ʹ SS, we observed much greater sequence variability relative to the canonical site. We detected increased use of highly variable 3ʹ SS including those with atypical HAU (H=A,C,U) and BG (B=C,U,G) motifs and confirmed generation of new RNA isoforms for several of these by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Increased use of variable 3ʹ SS was also observed when the second step factor <italic>PRP18</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). However, the subset of RNAs most impacted by splicing factor deletion appear to be different.

Prp18 and Fyv6 likely have transcript-specific effects on splicing outcomes.

Combined with AlphaFold2-assisted modeling, we were able to obtain more accurate models for the U2 snRNP, NTC, U5 Sm ring, and Cwc22 N-terminal domains. Our model for the NTC within the P complex is similar to our previous model for the NTC within C and C<sup>i</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably however, we observed a star-shaped density coordinated by several conserved lysines from Clf1 and Ntc20, which we were able to model as inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The same density, at lower resolution, is visible in the C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>). A distinct, separate IP<sub>6</sub> molecule had previously been observed within all catalytic spliceosomes between the B<sup>act</sup> and P complex stages coordinated by Prp8 and (for C* and P complexes) Slu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We do not believe that the NTC-bound IP<sub>6</sub> is essential for splicing since deletion of the Clf1 tetratricopeptide repeat that coordinates IP<sub>6</sub> does not result in growth or splicing phenotypes in yeast and Ntc20 is a nonessential splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 1999</xref>). Nonetheless, it is possible that IP<sub>6</sub> may regulate splicing in some manner via interactions with both Prp8 and the NTC.</p><p>We were able to unambiguously assign three, connected long α-helices to Fyv6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These helices were visible in previous cryo-EM reconstructions of yeast C* and P complexes but were either unassigned or misassigned. In the cases of misassigned densities, Fyv6 was previously attributed to the C-terminal domain of the first step factor Yju2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Yju2 also has an elongated helical architecture and adopts a similar position on C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>) and the post-P complex intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). We closely inspected the density from previously determined spliceosome structures and concluded that the Yju2 C-terminus is still a better fit than Fyv6 for densities in B*, C, and ILS complexes, whereas Fyv6 is a better fit than Yju2 for densities in C* and P complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, this position of Fyv6 seems to be characteristic of a second step conformation of the spliceosome and consistent with the position of its distant human homolog FAM192A in the human pre-C* complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Fyv6 makes a multitude of interactions with essential splicing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E–G</xref>). One conserved region of Fyv6 is the N-terminus with an FVSE motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This motif forms a ‘hook’ that interacts with a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the Prp22 RecA2 domain, where it also forms hydrogen bonds by β-sheet augmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The hook is followed by three α-helices. The start of helix 2 sits on top of the intron between the BP and the active site docked 3ʹ SS, where it may act as a steric block to prevent 3ʹ SS undocking and promote exon ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Helix 2 also contains a patch of conserved arginines that form salt bridges with Asp317 and Glu318 of Slu7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The linker between helices 2 and 3 interacts with the NTC component Cef1, and helix 3 interacts with NTC component Syf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The binding interface with Syf1 overlaps with the Syf1/Yju2 interaction in the C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting these interactions are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Fyv6 thus provides a direct link between the Prp22 ATPase, NTC components, and other essential splicing factors over a distance of ~100 Å.</p><p>By 3D classification, we were able to resolve a total of three states of the P complex spliceosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). State I, represented by 51% of particles, is the most complete and has all the above-described factors visible, including a stably docked 3ʹ SS. State II, represented by 20% of particles, is similar to state I but lacks density for the N-terminal half of the second step factor Slu7. The endonuclease-like domain of Prp8, to which this domain of Slu7 binds, is correspondingly shifted. Interestingly, this state retains strong density for the 3ʹ SS, suggesting the N-terminal regions of Slu7 are not involved in maintaining 3ʹ SS docking after exon ligation. Finally, state III, containing 29% of particles, entirely lacks density for the second step factors Slu7, Prp18, and Fyv6. Prp17 and the RNase H domain of Prp8 are still present but are weaker than in States I and II, suggesting they are more flexible in state III. Most of Prp22 can still be observed with weaker density except for the C-terminal domain that interacts with Prp8, which lacks density entirely. Importantly, state III also lacks density for the 3ʹ SS but has density for the 3ʹ exon, suggesting it is indeed post-catalytic and represents a state after loss of second step factors and undocking of the 3ʹ SS from the catalytic core. The coincidence of loss of Fyv6 with loss of Prp18 and Slu7 reinforces the notion that these three factors act together and are important for 3ʹ SS docking, maintaining the 3ʹ SS in the active site after exon ligation, and for stabilization of Prp17, Prp22, and the RNase H domain of Prp8.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Fyv6/Syf1 interaction is critical for suppressing <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> phenotypes</title><p>To determine the functionally critical regions and interactions of Fyv6, we used the cryo-EM structure to design five truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The first three truncations remove amino acids from the N-terminus of Fyv6: deletion of the first 16 amino acids, which are not resolved in the cryo-EM structure (Δ1–16); deletion of the first 23 amino acids, which removes the conserved hook region of Fyv6 that interacts with the Prp22 RecA2 domain (Δ1–23); and deletion of amino acids 1–51, which additionally removes the first α-helix and interactions with Prp22, Prp8, and Slu7 (Δ1–51). The remaining two mutants are C-terminal truncations. In the first, amino acids 134–173, which do not have clear density in the cryo-EM structure and are not modeled but which do contain a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS), are deleted (Δ134–173) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen Ba et al., 2009</xref>).

All of the N-terminal truncation mutations could suppress the <italic>cs</italic> or <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes to some degree. Surprisingly, a strain with the complete deletion of the conserved hook domain that interacts with Prp22 (Δ1–23) grew similarly to the strain expressing WT Fyv6. We wondered if splicing changes could still be present even if the growth phenotype was suppressed; so, we assayed <italic>SUS1</italic> isoforms by RT-PCR. We previously showed that loss of Fyv6 causes use of an alternative 3ʹ SS in the first intron of this pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipinski et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to suppression of the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> growth phenotype, the N-terminal truncation mutants also showed no evidence for changes in <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The N-terminal region of Fyv6 composed of the hook domain and the first α-helix is not required for suppression of either the temperature sensitivity or splicing phenotypes observed when Fyv6 is lost despite its conservation and interactions with critical splicing factors (Prp8, Prp22, and Slu7).</p><p>For the C-terminal truncations, the Δ134–173 truncation was also able to suppress the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes, indicating that the predicted NLS is also not essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, this mutant grew more poorly at 16°C than did the Δ1–16 and Δ1–23 truncations and showed some evidence of alternative 3ʹ SS usage in <italic>SUS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The largest effects were seen when the C-terminus was truncated further. The Δ103–173 truncation strain phenocopied the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strain and grew poorly at 37°C and was dead at 23°C or 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, RT-PCR showed increased use of the alternative 3ʹ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> with this truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine if this phenotype could be due to loss of protein expression, we assayed expression of the epitope-tagged proteins by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In all cases, we could detect protein; however, the abundance of the N-terminally epitope-tagged Δ103–173 variant was much lower than the others. Therefore, we also constructed a C-terminally epitope-tagged version of Δ103–173 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The C-terminally tagged protein expressed at much higher levels but also failed to suppress the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes. These data suggest that the C-terminal region of Fyv6 that includes a portion of α-helix 3 and the Syf1 interaction domain is critical for function.</p><p>To obtain additional evidence for the importance of the Fyv6/Syf1 interaction, we created a <italic>syf1Δ</italic> shuffle strain containing WT Fyv6 and expressed C-terminal Syf1 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We hypothesized that loss of the Fyv6-interacting domain on Syf1 would phenocopy <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>. We observed just this effect. Loss of the Fyv6-interacting region in Syf1 Δ778–859 and Δ634–859 mutants resulted in either modest (Δ778–859) or severe (Δ634–859) <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes. In addition, these Syf1 truncation mutants also triggered use of the alternative 3ʹ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, if the Δ778–859 and Δ817–859 Syf1 mutants are expressed in a <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> background, it results in suppression of the <italic>fyv6Δ ts</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the <italic>SUS1</italic> alternative 3ʹ SS is still used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This indicates that <italic>ts</italic> phenotype suppression and triggering usage of the alternative 3ʹ SS in <italic>SUS1</italic> are separable processes.</p><p>When considered together, these results likely originate from mutually exclusive Fyv6/Syf1 and Yju2/Syf1 interactions. It is possible that in the absence of Fyv6, Syf1 inappropriately binds Yju2 during exon ligation. The presence of Yju2 during the second step could then lead to growth defects that are suppressed when the Yju2-binding site on Syf1 is deleted. Alternatively or in addition, the absence of Fyv6 could perturb the equilibrium between the first and second step conformations of the spliceosome and result in favoring of the first step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2007b</xref>). Loss of this equilibrium could lead to growth defects that are suppressed by destabilization of the first step conformation by removing a binding site for Yju2 on Syf1 and restoring the equilibrium. In both cases, truncation of Syf1 suppresses growth defects but not <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing defects since Fyv6 function is still needed during the second step.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mutations in many different splicing factors can suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> phenotypes</title><p>To gain additional insights into Fyv6 function, we carried out a genetic screen to detect spontaneously arising suppressors that can correct temperature-dependent growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

All of these colonies were able to suppress growth defects at 37°C, and many also suppressed the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype at 23°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on the largest of the picked colonies as these were expected to be the strongest suppressors. In 19 of 20 sequenced strains, we were able to identify at least one non-silent mutation in a splicing factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). When we carried out a similar experiment aimed at identifying <italic>cs</italic> suppressors, we were unable to identify any likely causative mutations in splicing factors. Therefore, we focused our analysis on the <italic>ts</italic> suppressor mutations.</p><p>Collectively, the identified mutations tended to fall into two categories: gain of positive charge or substitution with a bulkier side chain. Gain of positive charge mutations were found in Prp8 (G1868R) as well as the second step factors Slu7 (A24R and N28K) and Prp22 (I1133R). Structurally, amino acids within Prp8 and Prp22 are proximal to RNA within the spliceosome and addition of charged amino acid side chains may stabilize interactions with the phosphodiester RNA backbone. The N-terminus of Slu7 containing A24 and N28 is not resolved in any spliceosome structure to our knowledge and normally contains many negatively charged residues. The majority of identified suppressors involve a mutation to a bulkier side chain including several in Prp8 (S1594F/Y, V1862L), Prp17 (A251V, G386W), Cef1 (A37V), and Clf1 (T33I). The increase in hydrophobic surface area provided by these mutations may help to stabilize interactions with nearby proteins, compensating for structural destabilization due to the absence of Fyv6. Alternatively, since Prp8, Prp17, Cef1, and Clf1 are all present during 5'SS cleavage, it is possible that these bulky mutations could destabilize a first step conformation of the spliceosome and suppress phenotypes due to the loss of Fyv6 by facilitating formation of the second step conformation.</p><p>We isolated one suppressor mutation within the U2 snRNA (A25G) near where the C-terminal domain of Prp22 inserts toward the active site and located beneath the Fyv6 binding site. It has previously been observed that mutation of this specific U2 snRNA nucleotide is not deleterious to growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McPheeters and Abelson, 1992</xref>) and is therefore well tolerated by yeast. The mechanism of suppression by this mutation is not clear; however, it is interesting to note that we also observed suppressor mutations in the U2 snRNP component Rse1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) which is released from the spliceosome prior to catalysis. The Rse1 mutations always occurred coincident with mutations in other splicing factors. It is possible that suppressors in factors present prior to or after exon ligation are able to suppress (or enhance suppression of) <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> by changing how pre-mRNAs compete for a limited set of splicing factors or by reducing blocks to pre-spliceosome assembly caused by accumulation of stalled complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mendoza-Ochoa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munding et al., 2013</xref>). Together these data indicate that mutations in many different splicing factors including second step factors and the U2 snRNA can be isolated from <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Multiple second step splicing defects can be rescued by the same suppressor</title><p>We decided to study several of these mutations in greater detail and to confirm that they were sufficient for <italic>fyv6Δ ts</italic> phenotype suppression. In the case of Cef1, we obtained several mutants located near the interface between Cef1 and the second step factor Prp17: A37V, M175I, and Q193P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This interface has only been observed in structures of C* and P complex spliceosomes, suggesting its importance for exon ligation. In addition, it has previously been reported that another mutant of Cef1 A37 – A37P – is able to suppress splicing defects due to a BS adenine to guanosine substitution (BS-G) which causes stalling after 5ʹ SS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Query and Konarska, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we wondered if other Cef1 mutants capable of suppressing defects due to BS-G could also suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> (Cef1 A37P, V36R, and S48R). We created <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> shuffle strains for Cef1 and tested each mutant’s ability to suppress <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). All of these Cef1 mutants, both those isolated from our suppressor screen and those identified as BS-G suppressors, could at least weakly suppress the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype at 23°C with our isolated M175I mutant being a particularly strong suppressor. In addition, all of the mutants except Cef1 A37V could suppress the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype at 37°C to varying degrees. These results confirm that single point mutants in Cef1 can suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> growth phenotypes and that at least some BS-G suppressors in Cef1 also suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic>. A common mechanism could be that these mutations stabilize the exon ligation conformation of the spliceosome to favor the second step either when a BS-G is present or Fyv6 is absent.</p><p>In the case of Prp8, we tested five different suppressor mutations in <italic>prp8</italic> shuffle strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Two of these are located within the Prp8 α-finger domain (S1584F,Y; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) while the remainder are located within the RNase H-like domain β-finger (V1862L, G1868R, T1982S; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>). We confirmed that four of the identified Prp8 suppressor mutations could partially suppress either or both of the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts fyv6Δ</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; S1574Y, V1862L, G1868R, and T1982S). Even though we isolated the Prp8 S1584F mutant in our screen and this substitution is very similar to S1584Y, we were not able observe suppression due to this mutant in these strains. Identification of mutants in Prp8 that suppress <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> is not surprising since many different alleles of Prp8 are known to modulate the conformational equilibrium between the first and second steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fica and Nagai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Query and Konarska, 2004</xref>) or other steps in splicing. Indeed, suppressors in Prp8 have previously been identified at some of these same positions: V1862A/Y/D and T1982A were identified as suppressors of, respectively, the <italic>U4-cs</italic>1 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuhn and Brow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuhn et al., 1999</xref>) or the 5ʹ SS U2A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siatecka et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Finally, given our observations with the Cef1 and Prp8 mutants, we wondered about the generality of second step splicing factor suppression. Several dominant mutants in the second step factor Prp18 were previously shown to suppress <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes due to various mutations in Slu7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronova et al., 2007</xref>). We wondered if these Prp18 mutants would also suppress the <italic>ts</italic> (or <italic>cs</italic>) phenotype due to Fyv6 loss. Indeed, the Prp18 V191A suppressor of <italic>slu7</italic> alleles was able to improve growth at 37°C of <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together our results from the suppressor analysis support a model in which a given second step suppressor mutation may be able to restore splicing activity lost by a variety of mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A Prp22-dependent splicing stall is relieved by Fyv6 deletion</title><p>The final <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor mutation that we studied was the Prp22 I1133R mutant. This mutation is located within the C-terminal domain of Prp22 that enters the spliceosome active site and is located proximal to U2 snRNA nucleotide A31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Fyv6 bridges over this Prp22-U2 snRNA interaction. The I1133R mutation might stabilize Prp22/U2 snRNA contacts that can compensate for Fyv6 loss and promote exon ligation. The Prp22 I1133R mutant is able to weakly suppress both the <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes in <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Given its location in the C-terminal domain, we wondered if it or <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> would show synthetic genetic interactions or epistasis with mutations in the helicase domain. We tested two helicase domain mutations, R805A and G810A, both of which are known to impact Prp22-dependent proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>). The Prp22 R805A mutant is by itself <italic>cs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwer and Meszaros, 2000</xref>) and showed a synthetic lethal interaction with <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). This was only slightly rescued by simultaneously introducing I1133R into Prp22. In contrast, Prp22 G810A mutant is viable in the presence and absence of Fyv6 as well as in combination with the I1133R suppressor mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Prp22 G810A by itself does not suppress the <italic>ts fyv6Δ</italic> phenotype; however, the Prp22 G810A/I1133R double mutant is a stronger suppressor of the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype than either mutant alone. These additive genetic interactions suggest that the Prp22 <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor mutation (I1133R) and the helicase domain mutations (R805A and G810A) impact distinct Prp22 functions. These functions could correspond to Prp22’s role in promoting exon ligation during the second step (the C-terminal domain mutation) and its role in promoting ATP-dependent mRNA release and proofreading (the helicase domain mutations).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Genetic interactions between Prp22 and Fyv6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the Prp22 I1133R <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> suppressor in the P complex structure.

However, we noticed that the Prp22 helicase mutants, R805A and G810A, both caused an accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA. This is consistent with these mutations causing a block during pre-mRNA splicing and having a different effect on splicing than Prp22 I1133R. Surprisingly, the block due to the G810A mutation was relieved in the <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> strains and little pre-mRNA accumulation was observed in the absence of Fyv6. This result suggests that Fyv6 could act as a negative regulator of splicing of the <italic>SUS1</italic> transcript when a Prp22 helicase domain mutant is present. Removing Fyv6 restores splicing by activation of the <italic>SUS1</italic> BP proximal 3ʹ SS.</p><p>To further explore the connections between Fyv6 and Prp22 fidelity, we used the ACT1-CUP1 assay in which yeast growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cu<sup>2+</sup> is proportional to the extent of splicing of a reporter RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Since the Prp22 R805A mutant grew poorly, we only assayed the Prp22 G810A, I1133R, and G810A/I1133R (double) mutants in the presence and absence of Fyv6. Consistent with previous results, we found that <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> is deleterious for splicing of the WT ACT1-CUP1 reporter containing consensus SS. Copper tolerance was improved when <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> was combined with Prp22 I1133R. Unexpectedly, Prp22 I1133R was deleterious when Fyv6 was present for this reporter. If this Prp22 mutant and Fyv6 both promote the second step, then their combination may have an additive, negative effect on splicing due to over-stabilization of this spliceosome conformation.</p><p>Finally, we assayed strains containing a 3ʹ SS UAG to gAG reporter since it was previously shown that Prp22 helicase domain mutants could increase usage of non-consensus 3ʹ SS due to faulty proofreading activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). In agreement with this, we observed a dramatic increase in copper tolerance when Prp22 contained both the C-terminal domain and helicase mutants (double). This suggests that splicing of non-consensus 3ʹ SS is enhanced both by stabilization of the second step conformation (I1133R) and perturbing mRNA release (G810A). This effect on Prp22 is Fyv6-dependent since loss of Fyv6 results in very poor copper tolerance of strains containing the gAG reporter, likely since this 3ʹ SS is located far from the BP (38 nt). These results show that <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> can be suppressed with a Prp22 C-terminal domain mutant and that mutations in the Prp22 C-terminal domain can have distinct functional consequences from those located in the helicase domain. In the case of <italic>SUS1</italic>, stalling of splicing due to the Prp22 G810A mutant can be relieved by removing Fyv6 and activation of a BP proximal 3ʹ SS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we establish Fyv6 as a second step splicing factor in yeast that promotes usage of BP distal 3ʹ SS. Structural, genetic, and biochemical studies reveal critical contacts and interactions between Fyv6 and the splicing machinery. From these data, we propose that Yju2/Syf1 interactions need to be disrupted for proper Fyv6 recruitment and that Fyv6 can enforce the Prp22 dependence of at least some splicing events. Combined, our data allow us to propose a model for Fyv6’s role during the second step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, Fyv6 is recruited to the C* complex after Prp16-dependent release of Yju2, which exposes the binding site for Fyv6 on Syf1. Once bound, Fyv6 (possibly in concert with Slu7 and Prp18) facilitates docking of BP distal 3ʹ SS into the active site. In the absence of Fyv6, the use of BP distal 3ʹ SS becomes more difficult and BP proximal 3ʹ SS are favored. Under these conditions, the requirement for Prp22 during exon ligation is reduced and Yju2 may also potentially re-bind Syf1. One or both of these factors could contribute to formation of a lower fidelity spliceosome with relaxed sequence constraints for exon ligation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of Fyv6 during the second step.</title><p>Fyv6 interacts with Syf1 and Prp22 and promotes usage of BP distal 3ʹ splice site (SS).

It is possible that lack of Fyv6 also results in the presence of Yju2 during exon ligation and relaxing of the requirement for Prp22 at this step.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100449-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Structural insights into the recruitment and release of second step factors</title><p>A key principle of spliceosome structural biochemistry is the presence of mutually exclusive interactions that coordinate the stepwise and directional progression of splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Townsend et al., 2020</xref>). Our cryo-EM structure of the P complex spliceosome suggests another such interaction is involved in the first to second step transition during which Fyv6 displaces Yju2. Yju2 and Fyv6 occupy overlapping binding sites on the splicing factor Syf1 and, in fact, unassigned density in spliceosome P complexes due to Fyv6 was previously mis-interpreted as Yju2 due to their structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkinson et al., 2021</xref>). We propose that Prp16-promoted spliceosome remodeling results in release of Yju2 from the spliceosome C complex and permits mutually exclusive binding of Fyv6. Fyv6 remains bound in the P complex but then may dissociate to permit re-binding of Yju2, which was observed by cryo-EM to be a component of the yeast ILS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). It should be noted, however, that intron lariats only weakly co-immunoprecipitate with Yju2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2007a</xref>) and that Yju2’s presence in the cryo-EM data likely originated from the ILS complexes being purified with a TAP-tag on Yju2 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan et al., 2017</xref>). Since Yju2 has also not been observed in metazoan ILS complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorländer et al., 2024</xref>), its role in spliceosome disassembly and any need for Fyv6-Yju2 exchange during the P to ILS transition should be studied further.</p><p>Previously, Chiang and Cheng noted that while the N-terminal half of Yju2 was able to restore first step activity to Yju2-depleted extracts, it is much more stably associated if a second polypeptide containing the C-terminal, Syf1-interacting half was included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang and Cheng, 2013</xref>. It is possible that competition between Yju2 and Fyv6 for Syf1 binding can explain these results. If only the N-terminal half of Yju2 is present, Fyv6 could associate prematurely with Syf1 and result in destabilization of the first step conformation in favor of second step interactions. This may then result in weaker binding for the N-terminal half of Yju2. Failure to properly recruit and exchange the Yju2/Fyv6 interaction on Syf1 may also be the origin of some of the yeast growth and splicing phenotypes we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The need for Yju2/Fyv6 exchange hints at two distinct functions for Fyv6: a role in Yju2 displacement to prevent its re-binding during exon ligation and a role in stabilization of the second step spliceosome conformation. These two functions can potentially result in the distinct <italic>cs</italic> and <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes in yeast. While more work is needed to dissect these phenotypes, it is possible that the <italic>cs</italic> phenotype results from increased stability of the Yju2/Syf1 interaction at lower temperatures and the need for Fyv6 to act as a competitor of this interaction. The <italic>ts</italic> phenotype on the other hand may result from destabilization of the second step conformation of the spliceosome active site due to loss of Fyv6. It is possible that loss of Fyv6 results in destabilization due to removal of a buttress that holds the RNase H-like domain of Prp8 in place (along with Prp18), changes in how the C-terminal domain of Prp22 interacts with the spliceosome active site, removal of an impediment to reversal of the U2 snRNA/BS duplex conformational change that occurs during the C to C* complex transition, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>The high quality of our cryo-EM data combined with 3D classification also provide new insights into the requirements for 3ʹ SS docking into the active site and potentially for how the P complex spliceosome is disassembled into the ILS complex. It was previously speculated that the N-terminal domain of Slu7 may be critical for 3ʹ SS docking by reducing the entropic cost of this process when the BP to 3ʹ SS distance is long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>). In our state II P complex structure, the 3ʹ SS remains docked but this domain of Slu7 is not observed. This suggests that either Slu7 N-terminal domain interactions with Cwc22 and Prp8 are not essential for 3ʹ SS docking into the active site for exon ligation and/or that these interactions are not essential for maintaining 3ʹ SS docking within P complex once they form in C*.</p><p>In the state III P complex structure, densities for the second step factors Fyv6, Prp18, and Slu7 are entirely missing and the 3ʹ SS is no longer docked into the active site. While it is possible that this may reflect decomposition of the P complex (or another intermediate) by a pathway unrelated to cellular spliceosome disassembly, the structure is suggestive that 3ʹ SS undocking is coupled to second step factor release. These steps may be necessary to help prepare the spliceosome for ILS complex formation since the 3ʹ SS is undocked in all ILS structures obtained to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vorländer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Prp22 is still present in this structure, and it is possible that state III represents a conformation occurring after exon ligation but prior to Prp22-dependent mRNA release. In this case, the state III structure implies that Prp22 ATPase activity is not needed for dissociation of Fyv6, Prp18, and Slu7. It is also interesting to note that the C-terminal domain of Prp22 can no longer be resolved in the state III structure. What exactly activates the Prp22 ATPase to promote proofreading or mRNA release is not known. It is conceivable that undocking of the 3ʹ SS from the active site can be sensed by the Prp22 C-terminal domain and this contributes to ATPase activation. This model differs from that previously proposed for Prp22-enabled 3ʹ SS sampling in which that ATPase activity of Prp22 is needed to undock the 3ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). However, sampling could involve multiple steps: ATP-independent 3ʹ SS undocking and ATP-dependent entry into the sampling state. Whether or not the second step factors must release or alter conformation to enable sampling is unknown. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it is important to recognize that the P complex structures determined here were all obtained using a Prp22 mutant defective in mRNA release. The chemical and kinetic competencies of these states will require future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple, non-redundant second step factors promote use of BP distal 3′ SS</title><p>The challenge of 3ʹ SS selection involves not just selection of the correct nucleotide sequence (YAG) but also identifying which YAG sequence to use. Here, we define a function for Fyv6 in facilitating use of BP distal 3ʹ SS, especially those located ≥21 nt away from the branch. This function is similar to those of other second step factors important for efficient splicing when the BP-3ʹ SS distance is ≥12 nt (Slu7, Prp18) or ≥21 nt (Prp22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brys and Schwer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Schwer, 1997</xref>). Human Slu7 has additionally been reported to be important for preventing suppression of the correct 3ʹ SS in favor of up- or downstream alternative 3ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chua and Reed, 1999</xref>). Our previous study using competing 3ʹ SS in the ACT1-CUP1 intron did not provide evidence for suppression of the correct 3ʹ SS in the absence of Fyv6, suggesting that this function is not shared between human Slu7 and yeast Fyv6. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that the splicing machinery employs multiple factors that enforce usage of BP distal 3ʹ SS. These functions are not redundant as changes in 3ʹ SS are still observed in the absence of Fyv6 but presence of Prp18 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Intron architecture can also contribute to 3ʹ SS selection since canonical ‘AG’ 3ʹ SS are depleted in humans in the region between the BP and annotated 3ʹ SS (the AG exclusion zone [AGEZ]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corvelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gooding et al., 2006</xref>). AG sites are also typically depleted in the corresponding region in yeast introns (data not shown). This would suggest that annotated 3ʹ SS are also the most optimal sites located downstream of the BP. However, an important assumption of this model is that non-AG 3ʹ SS can also be effectively proofread and not used. Deletion of either Prp18 or Fyv6 leads to activation of not just BP proximal 3ʹ SS but also those with highly divergent sequences from the YAG consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). This suggests that an AGEZ alone is insufficient for correct 3ʹ SS usage and that mechanisms to ensure preferential use of YAG sites are critical.</p><p>It is likely that Fyv6 and Prp18 enforce usage of YAG sites by common as well as factor-specific mechanisms. Both proteins stabilize the conformation of the Prp8 RNase H-like domain in P complex. Numerous SS suppressor mutations map to this domain including those that enhance splicing of non-YAG 3ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galej et al., 2013</xref>). Fyv6 and Prp18 may be essential for establishing a ‘high fidelity’ conformation of the RNase H-like domain that enforces use of canonical YAG 3ʹ SS and preventing activation of cryptic sites within the AGEZ. In support of this, we note that in our state III P complex structure that lacks both Fyv6 and Prp18 and a stably docked 3ʹ SS, the RNase H-like domain is also more flexible.</p><p>In addition to this possibility, Fyv6 and Prp18 may also contribute uniquely to 3ʹ SS fidelity and selection. The conserved loop region of Prp18 inserts into the spliceosome active site and contacts the 3ʹ SS. Partial deletion of this region of Prp18 phenocopies at least some of the changes in 3ʹ SS selection when Prp18 is deleted entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2023</xref>). This indicates that even when the Prp8 RNaseH-like domain is still stabilized by Prp18 (and Fyv6) disruptions to 3ʹ SS selection can still occur. Unlike Prp18, Fyv6 does not contact the spliceosome active site. However, it is the only second step factor that contacts exon ligation fidelity factor Prp22. While these contacts are not essential for suppressing use of an alternative 3ʹ in <italic>SUS1</italic>, a mutation in Prp22 can nonetheless suppress a <italic>fyv6Δ</italic> phenotype and loss of Fyv6 relieves a Prp22 helicase mutant-dependent stall in <italic>SUS1</italic> splicing. These observations suggest that Fyv6 and Prp22 are functionally connected to one another.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Some second step factors may enforce usage of Prp22 during exon ligation</title><p>We were particularly struck by the similarities in the BP-3ʹ SS distances for the requirement of Prp22 during exon ligation and for promotion of BP distal 3ʹ SS usage by Fyv6, both ≥21 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwer and Gross, 1998</xref>). In addition, the alternative, BP proximal 3ʹ SS that are activated when Fyv6 is deleted show much less sequence conservation relative to the annotated 3ʹ SS and include sequences (GAG, BG) known to be proofread and rejected by Prp22. Together, this suggests that one function of Fyv6 is to enforce Prp22 dependence of exon ligation by stabilizing a spliceosome conformation that more easily enables usage of BP distal 3ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As these sites require Prp22 for exon ligation, it is also likely that they are subject to Prp22-dependent proofreading, and this may enforce accurate exon ligation at the YAG 3ʹ SS consensus. When Fyv6 is absent, many alternative, BP proximal 3ʹ SS are activated. These sites could have a relaxed requirement for Prp22 and proofreading. While the Fyv6 dependence of Prp22 occupancy is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, loss of Prp18 (which also activates usage of non-canonical, BP proximal 3ʹ SS) does result in lower occupancy of Prp22 on the <italic>ACT1</italic> intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strittmatter et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that Prp22 occupancy, and possible involvement in the exon ligation step, can be influenced by second step factors.</p><p>There is precedent for nonessential splicing factors enforcing use of a proofreading ATPase. Cus2 is not essential for pre-spliceosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan et al., 1998</xref>). However, when Cus2 is present then ATPase activity of Prp5 is essential for disruption of the Hsh155/Cus2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perriman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Talkish et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, Cus2 is not essential for Prp5 proofreading of BP selection, and the connection between the ATP hydrolysis activity of Prp5, removal of Cus2, and proofreading is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang and Cheng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Talkish et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu and Query, 2007</xref>). It is possible that enforcement of Prp5 ATPase activity by Cus2 is important for other aspects of pre-spliceosome formation in vivo and the impact of Prp5 and Cus2 on BP selection has not yet been studied transcriptome-wide using high-resolution, sequencing-based approaches. The C-terminal domain of the first step splicing factor Yju2 (the same domain that competes with Fyv6 for Syf1 binding) is also not essential for 5ʹ SS cleavage. In the absence of this domain, the N-terminal domain of Yju2 is sufficient for promoting the first step reaction, and the spliceosome can transition to the second step and carry out exon ligation without Prp16, albeit inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang and Cheng, 2013</xref>). Importantly, addition of the C-terminal domain on a separate polypeptide reduces Prp16-independent activity. This suggests that the Yju2 C-terminal domain enforces the use of the Prp16 ATPase. As we propose with Fyv6 and Prp22, the C-terminal domain of Yju2 may not just help to promote the first to second step transition by enforcing Prp16 dependence but could also facilitate Prp16-dependent proofreading during 5ʹ SS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Semlow et al., 2016</xref>). General operating principles of the yeast splicing machinery may not just include proofreading but also use of splicing factors that enforce usage of the proofreading ATPases.</p></sec></sec><sec

The reaction mixture was centrifuged through a 40% glycerol cushion in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mM KCl, 0.25 mM EDTA).

Spliceosomes (3 µL) were applied and after 60 s was manually blotted using Ø55 grade 595 filter paper (Ted Pella), followed by application of another 3 μL of spliceosomes, waiting 60 s, before blotting again and plunging into liquid ethane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Cryo-EM data collection</title><p>Cryo-EM data were collected as two datasets from two grids made from the same sample. Dataset 1 was acquired using a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios cryo-TEM (LMB Krios 1) and dataset 2 was acquired using a Thermo Scientific Titan Krios G3i cryo-TEM (LMB Krios 3). Both used a K3 direct detector (Gatan) operated in super-resolution mode with twofold binning, and an energy filter with slit width of 20 eV. Micrographs were collected automatically using EPU in AFIS mode, yielding a total of 51,113 movies at ×81,000 or ×130,000 magnification with a real nominal pixel size of 0.93 Å or 0.669 Å, with defocus ranging from –1.3 μm to –3.1 μm and a total fluence per micrograph of 40 e<sup>–</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, fractionated into 40 frames.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Cryo-EM data processing</title><p>All cryo-EM data were processed using RELION-5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimanius et al., 2024</xref>). Both datasets were initially processed separately. Movies were corrected for motion using the RELION implementation of MotionCor2, with 4×4 patches and dose-weighting. CTF parameters were estimated using CTFFIND-4.1. Particle picking was done using Topaz with the general model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>), yielding 1,820,457 particles. 3D classification was performed on fourfold (dataset 1) or fivefold (dataset 2) binned particles using a P complex reference map (EMD-10140), and 299,741 (dataset 1) or 599,123 (dataset 2) were selected and refined to 2.99 Å or 2.78 Å resolution respectively. After Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement (per-particle defocus, anisotropic magnification, beam tilt, trefoil, and fourth-order aberrations) the resolution improved to 2.67 Å or 2.32 Å, respectively. To improve the general density quality, 3D classification without alignment was performed with a soft mask around the whole complex with T=15. Particles with good density, without selecting for Fyv6 occupancy, were selected (151,443 and 257,501 for datasets 1 and 2) and refined to 2.66 Å or 2.27 Å, respectively. The particles were then merged, refined, and then refined for anisotropic magnification. The overall scaling factors from the ‘anisotropic’ magnification matrix was then used to calculate the corrected pixel size for dataset 1 as 0.94057 Å, keeping dataset 2 constant at 0.669 Å per pixel. Defocus values for dataset 1 were then scaled by the square of 0.94057/0.93, with an empirical constant correction of –10.06 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, another round of per-particle defocus refinement and anisotropic magnification refinement was performed to reduce errors in defocus correction and dataset scaling. The combined particles refined to 2.24 Å resolution. Resolution is reported using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation with 0.143 cutoff.</p><p>The refined particles after merging were subjected to 3D classification without alignment, with a soft mask around the entire spliceosome, with T=15. The resulting four classes were used to define States I, II, and III. To improve the densities for the periphery of the spliceosome that displayed local flexibility, focused refinements were used with Blush regularization in RELION-5 to reduce overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimanius et al., 2024</xref>). The Prp22 density was improved using a soft mask just around the Prp22 helicase domain for refinement of particles from States I and II, yielding a 2.96 Å map. Densities for the U2 snRNP, NTC, U5 Sm ring, and Cwc22 N-terminal domain were each improved first by 3D classification without alignment of particles from all three states, selecting particles with strong density (72,869 for the U2 snRNP, 260,409 for the NTC, 113,561 for the U5 Sm ring, 201,984 for Cwc22-NTD), performing signal subtraction to remove density for the rest of the spliceosome (recentering on the mask center of mass and re-boxing to 300 pixels, or 192 pixels for Cwc22-NTD), and finally 3D refinement starting with 1.8 degree local angular searches, giving 3.42 Å for the U2 snRNP, 3.72 Å for the NTC, 3.06 Å for the U5 Sm, and 3.57 Å for Cwc22-NTD.

Twenty single colonies of yAAH3353 were selected from a YPD plate and used to inoculate 20×5 mL YPD liquid culture. Cultures were grown for 48 hr at 30°C. A 1 mL volume of culture was spun down, resuspended in 200 µL YPD liquid medium, and spread on a YPD plate containing 40 mg/L adenine hemisulfate (to prevent ade2 reversion). Duplicate plates for each overnight were placed in incubators at either 18°C or 37°C. Many colonies of various sizes appeared on each plate by 9 days for 37°C and 12 days for 18°C. Colonies were picked after that time and annotated first by growth temperature, then by overnight number, and finally roughly by colony size with 01 generally being the largest colony on a plate (ex: 370101 from a plate grown at 37°C inoculated from overnight 01 and the largest colony selected from the plate). Picked colonies were grown overnight in 5 mL YPD at 30°C and frozen stocks were made.

Filtering reduced the dataset to &lt;100 unique variants per colony. Few unique SNPs were within protein- or snRNA-coding genes. Of SNPs within protein-coding regions, single amino acid changes were frequently found within splicing factors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

This requires recruitment of factors dedicated to the second chemical step of splicing and exclusion of factors dedicated to the first chemical step of splicing. Through the highest resolution cyroEM structure of the spliceosome to-date, the authors show the binding site for Fyv6, a factor dedicated to the second chemical step of splicing, is mutually exclusive with the binding site for a distinct factor dedicated to the first chemical step of splicing, highlighting that splicing factors bind to the spliceosome at a specific stage not only by recognizing features specific to that stage but also by competing with factors that bind at other stages. The authors further reveal that Fyv6 functions at the second chemical step to promote selection of 3' splice sites distal to a branch point and thereby discriminate against proximal, suboptimal 3' splice site. Lastly, the authors show by cyroEM that Fyv6 physically interacts with the RNA helicase Prp22 and by genetics Fyv6 functionally interacts with this factor, implicating Fyv6 in 3'SS proofreading and mRNA release from the spliceosome.

Pre-mRNA splicing is a critical gene expression step that occurs in two steps, branching and exon ligation. Fyv6 had been recently identified by the Hoskins' lab as a factor that aids exon ligation (Lipinski et al., 2023), yet the mechanistic basis for Fyv6 function was less clear. Here, the authors combine yeast genetics, transcriptomics, biochemical assays, and structural biology to reveal the function of Fyv6. Specifically, they describe that Fyv6 promotes the usage of distal 3'SSs by stabilizing a network of interactions that include the RNA helicase PRP22 and the spliceosome subunit SYF1. They discuss a generalizible mechanism for splice site proofreading by spliceosomsal RNA helicases that could be modulated by other, regulatory splicing factors.</p><p>This is a very high quality study, which expertly combines various approaches to provide new insights into the regulation of 3'SS choice, docking, and undocking. The cryo-EM data is also of excellent quality, which substantially extends on previous yeast P complex structures.

The authors re-evaluate published EM densities of yeast spliceosome complexes (B*, C,C*,P) for the presence or absence of Fyv6, substantiate Fyv6 as a 2nd step specific factor, confirm it as the homolog of the human protein FAM192A, and provide a model for how Fyv6 may fit into the splicing pathway. The biochemical experiments on probing the splicing effects of BP to 3'SS distances after Fyv6 KO, genetic experiments to probe Fyv6 and Syf1 domains, and the suppressor screening add substantially to the study and are well executed.

Whereas some of the other suppressors of the fyv6 deletion can be interpreted as impacting directly the second step spliceosome (e.g., because the gene product is only present in the second step conformation), it seems that many more suppressors beyond prp8 mutants, especially those corresponding to bulky substitutions, which would more likely destabilize than stabilize, could similarly act indirectly by destabilization of first step conformation.

How do they discriminate e.g. in the 'G-1 and G+1' case K+ from water?</p></disp-quote><p>The assignment of K+ at this position is justified by both longer coordination distances and relatively high cryo-EM density compared to structured water molecules in the same vicinity. We have added a panel to figure3-figure supplement 4C to show the density for the G-1/G+1 bridging K+ ion and to show the adjacent density for putative water molecules which coordinate the ion. The K+ ion density is larger and has stronger signal than the adjacent water molecules. The coordination distances are also longer than would be expected for a Mg2+. For these reasons and because K+ was present in the purification buffer, we modelled the density as K+.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors comment on Yju2 and Fyv6 assignments in all yeast structures except for the ILS. Can the authors comment on if they have also looked into the assignment of Yju2 in the yeast ILS structure in the same manner? While it is possible that Fyv6 could dissociate and Yju2 reassociate at the P to ILS transition, this would merit a closer look given that in the yeast P complex Yju2 had been misassigned previously.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this very interesting topic! We have used ModelAngelo to analyze the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ILS structure for support of density assignment as Yju2 (and not Fyv6). This analysis supports the assignment as Yju2 in this structure and we have no evidence to doubt its presence in those particular purified spliceosomes. We have updated Figure 4- figure supplement 1B accordingly.</p><p>That being said, we do think that this issue should be studied more carefully in the future. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ILS structure (5Y88) was determined by purifying spliceosome complexes with a TAP-tag on Yju2. So the conclusion that Yju2 is part of the ILS spliceosome involves some circular logic: Yju2 is part of ILS spliceosome complexes because it is present in ILS complexes purified with Yju2. We also note that Yju2 was absent in ILS complexes recently determined from metazoans by the Plaschka group. We have added some additional nuance to the Discussion to raise this important mechanistic point at lines 711-718.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For accessibility to a general reader, figures 1c, d, e, 2a, b, would benefit from additional headings or labels, to immediately convey what is being displayed.

The subsequent discussion seems muddled. A discussion of Fyv6 binding at the first step, instead of Yju2, doesn't seem relevant here (though worthy of consideration in the discussion), given that the starting mutation is the Fyv6 deletion. Further, conjuring rebinding of Yju2 based on the data in the paper seems unnecessarily speculative (assumes that biochemical state III is on pathway), unless I am unaware of some other evidence for such rebinding. Instead, a simpler explanation would seem to be that in the absence of Fyv6, Syf1 inappropriately binds Yju2 instead at the second step and that deletion of the common Fyv6/Yju2 binding site on Syf1 suppresses this defect. In this case, the ts phenotype of the Fyv6 deletion would result from inappropriate binding of Yju2, and the splicing defect would be due to loss of Fyv6 activity. Alternatively, especially considering the work of the labs of Query and Konarska, the authors should consider the possibility that (i) the Fyv6 deletion destabilizes the second step conformation, shifting an equilibrium to the first step conformation, and that (ii) the Syf1 truncation destabilizes binding of Yju2, thereby restoring the equilibrium. In this case the ts phenotype of the Fyv6 deletion is due to a disturbed equilibrium and the splicing defect is due to the failure of Fyv6 to function at the second step.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is specifically referencing the final paragraph of this Results section (the paragraph that comes just before the section “Mutations in many different splicing factors…”). In retrospect, we agree that our discussion was convoluted. In particular, we emphasized rebinding of Yju2 based on its presence in the cryo-EM structure of the yeast ILS complex. However, given some uncertainties about whether or not Yju2 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> ILS component (as discussed above). We don’t think it is appropriate to over-emphasize rebinding of Yju2 and have decided to incorporate the elegant mechanisms proposed by the reviewer. This paragraph has now been edited accordingly (lines 386-395).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors imply they have performed biochemical studies, which I think is misleading. Of course, RT-PCR and primer extension assays for example are performed in vitro, but these are an analysis of RNA events that occurred in vivo. In my view a higher threshold should be used for defining &quot;biochemistry&quot;. To me &quot;biochemistry&quot; would imply that the authors have, for example, investigated 3' splice site usage in splicing extracts of the fyv6 deletion or engaged in an analysis of the Syf1-Fyv6 interaction involving the expression of the interacting domains in bacteria followed by a binding analysis in the test tube.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer on this point. Biochemistry is defined as the “branch of sciences concerned with the chemical substances, reactions, and physico chemical processes which occur within living organisms; biological or physical chemistry.” (Oxford English Dictionary). Biochemical studies are not defined by whether or not they take place in vitro, in vivo, or even in silico. Indeed, much of the history of biochemistry (especially in studies of metabolism, for example) involved experiments occurring in vivo that reported on the molecular properties and mechanisms of biological processes. We think many of our experiments fall into this category including our structure/function analysis of splicing factors and the use of the ACT1-CUP1 reporter substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The monovalents are shown; inositol phosphate is shown; is the binding of Prp22 to RNA shown?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a panel to Figure 3-figure supplement 4D showing density for the 3' exon within Prp22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors invoke undocking of the 3'SS in the P complex.

To better assess for the reader whether these numbers reflect large or small effects of Fyv6 in defining mRNA isoforms, it would be more useful to state these as percent changes of total events or to provide a reference number for how many introns are spliced in S.c. See for example the statements in Lines 132 and 145.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a percentage at line 138 that indicates ~20% of introns in yeast showed splicing changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Do the authors have a proposed explanation for the observed DGE in non-intron containing genes in the Fyv6 depleted cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The simplest explanation is that this is an indirect effect due to splicing changes occurring in other genes (such as transcription factors, ribosomal protein genes, etc..). It is possible that this can be further dissected in the future using shorter-term knockdown of Fyv6 using Anchors Away or AID-tagging. However, that is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, and we do not wish to comment on these non-intron containing genes further at present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A - What is going on with the events that show no FAnS value under one condition (i.e. are up against the X or Y axis)?

At this stage, we do not wish to interpret these events further since most have a relatively low number of reads overall.</p></body></sub-article></article>
