Transposable elements (TEs) can affect immune gene expression as a source of inducible regulatory elements, but the significance of these elements in facilitating evolutionary diversification of innate immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mouse epigenomic response to type II interferon (IFN) signaling and discovered that elements from a subfamily of B2 SINE (B2_Mm2) contain STAT1 binding sites and function as IFN-inducible enhancers. CRISPR deletion experiments in mouse cells demonstrated that a B2_Mm2 element has been co-opted as an enhancer driving IFN-inducible expression of <italic>Dicer1</italic>. The rodent-specific B2 SINE family is highly abundant in the mouse genome and elements have been previously characterized to exhibit promoter, insulator, and non-coding RNA activity. Our work establishes a new role for B2 elements as inducible enhancer elements that influence mouse immunity, and exemplifies how lineage-specific TEs can facilitate evolutionary turnover and divergence of innate immune regulatory networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>transposon</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM128822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuong</surname><given-names>Edward B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuong</surname><given-names>Edward B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005508</institution-id><institution>Boettcher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horton</surname><given-names>Isabella</given-names></name><name><surname>Chuong</surname><given-names>Edward B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

While innate immune signaling pathways are generally conserved across mammalian species, the specific transcriptional networks are increasingly recognized to show differences across lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shaw et al., 2017</xref>). These differences are widely attributed to independent evolutionary histories and continual selective pressures to adapt to new pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>). Understanding how innate immune systems have evolved in different host genomes is critical for accurately characterizing and modeling responses that are related to autoimmunity or involved in disease susceptibility.</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as a source of genetic elements that shape the evolution of mammalian innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</xref>). TE-derived sequences constitute roughly half of the genome content of most mammals, and are the predominant source of lineage-specific DNA. While most TE-derived sequences are degraded and presumed nonfunctional, TEs have occasionally been co-opted to function as genes or regulatory elements that benefit the host organism. In the context of host innate immunity, there are several reported examples of species-specific restriction factors that are encoded by TEs co-opted for host defense, including Friend Virus 1, Syncytin, Suppressyn, and Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frank et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lavialle et al., 2013</xref>). In many cases, TEs derived from ancient viral infections are poised for co-option since they already have the ability to bind to receptors, therefore blocking infection as a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Feschotte, 2017</xref>).</p><p>More recently, TEs have also been identified as a source of non-coding regulatory elements that control inducible expression of cellular innate immunity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttler and Chuong, 2022</xref>). In the human genome, we previously showed that MER41 elements have been co-opted as enhancer elements to regulate multiple immune genes in human cells, including the <italic>AIM2</italic> inflammasome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>). Elements belonging to other transposon families, including LTR12, MER44, and THE1C, have also been co-opted to regulate inducible expression of immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donnard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Srinivasachar Badarinarayan et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the majority of these families are primate-specific, supporting the co-option of TEs as a driver of primate-specific divergence of immune regulatory networks.</p><p>A key open question is whether the co-option of TEs as immune regulatory elements is evolutionarily widespread as a mechanism driving divergence of innate immune responses. Most research in this area has focused on human cells and primate-specific TE families, but different mammalian species harbor highly distinct and lineage-specific repertoires of TEs in their genomes. Due to the independent origin of most of these TEs in different species, it remains unclear whether the co-option of TEs is a rare or common mechanism contributing to the evolution of immune gene regulatory networks.</p><p>Here, we focused on the role of TEs in regulating murine innate immune responses. Mice are a commonly used model for human diseases but their immune system is appreciated to have significant differences. Transcriptomic studies have revealed that mouse and human immune transcriptomes show substantial divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shaw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shay et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with functional differences in inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Seok et al., 2013</xref>). The rodent and primate lineages diverged roughly 90 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>) and 32% of the mouse genome consists of rodent-specific repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we sought to define the potential role of TEs in shaping lineage-specific features of the murine innate immune response.</p><p>In our study, we re-analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets profiling the type II interferon (IFN) response in primary mouse macrophage cells. We screened for TEs showing epigenetic signatures of inducible regulatory activity, and identified a rodent-specific B2 subfamily as a substantial source of IFN-inducible regulatory elements in the mouse genome. As a case example, we used CRISPR to characterize a B2-derived IFN-inducible enhancer that regulates mouse <italic>Dicer1</italic>. These findings uncover a novel cis-regulatory role for the SINE B2 element in shaping the evolution of mouse-specific IFN responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Species-specific TEs shape the epigenomic response to type II IFN in mouse</title><p>To examine how TEs contribute to mouse type II IFN signaling regulation, we re-analyzed two independent transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets of primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that were stimulated with recombinant interferon gamma (IFNG) or untreated for 2 or 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Platanitis et al., 2019</xref>). These datasets included matched RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for STAT1 and H3K27ac. The STAT1 transcription factor mediates the type II IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Platanias, 2005</xref>) by binding to enhancers and promoters containing the Gamma-IFN activation site (GAS) motif, and the H3K27ac modification is strongly associated with active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>). Using these datasets, we mapped both IFNG-inducible enhancers and IFNG-stimulated genes (ISGs).</p><p>Our analysis of the RNA-seq data identified a total of 1,896 ISGs (FDR adjusted p-value &lt;0.05, log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC)&gt;1), which enriched for canonical genes associated with the IFNG response (GO:0034341, adjusted p-value = 9.394 × 10<sup>–35</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We predicted IFNG-inducible enhancers based on occupancy by the enhancer-associated histone mark H3K27ac and the transcription factor STAT1, which mediates type II IFN signaling. We identified 22,921 regions bound by STAT1 in IFNG-induced cells, 18,337 (80.0%) of which also resided within H3K27ac-enriched regions, indicating they are putative enhancers. Specificity of pulldown was confirmed by enrichment of canonical STAT1 binding motifs including the Gamma-IFN activation site (GAS; E-value=1.11 × 10<sup>–746</sup>) and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE; E-value=1.01 × 10<sup>–442</sup>) motifs within the STAT1 ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Using this set of STAT1 binding sites, we next asked what fraction of binding sites were derived from mouse TEs. Using the summits of the STAT1 ChIP-seq peaks, we found that 26.6% resided within TEs, 71.1% of which contain significant matches (p-value &lt;1 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) to either ISRE or GAS motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These TEs likely represent direct binding sites of STAT1 with potential regulatory activity. We next asked whether any TE families were overrepresented within the set of predicted IFNG-inducible binding sites, using GIGGLE colocalization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Layer et al., 2018</xref>). We identified three subfamilies enriched for STAT1 binding sites, including the rodent-specific B2_Mm2 subfamily (p-value = 7.18 × 10<sup>–201</sup>) as well as the RLTR30B_MM (p-value = 9.61 × 10<sup>–77</sup>) and RLTR30E_MM (p-value = 7.32 × 10<sup>–31</sup>) endogenous retrovirus subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

B2 SINE elements have been characterized to show a wide range of regulatory activities in mice, including acting as promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrigno et al., 2001</xref>), insulator elements bound by CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ichiyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lunyak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), or regulatory non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karijolich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karijolich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schaller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yakovchuk et al., 2009</xref>). As the potential for B2_Mm2 SINEs to act as inducible enhancers has not yet been investigated, we decided to further investigate B2 SINEs in this context.</p><p>The B2_Mm2 subfamily showed strong evidence of enrichment within regions bound by STAT1, providing 2,122 total binding sites (odds ratio = 4.85). These B2_Mm2 elements show significantly higher localization near ISGs (p-value = 5.03 × 10<sup>–52</sup>, odds ratio = 9.13) than interferon-repressed genes (IRGs) or nonresponsive genes, compared to unbound B2 elements or random genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Additionally, STAT1-bound B2_Mm2 elements are transcriptionally upregulated at the family level in response to IFNG stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Although unbound B2_Mm2 elements are also transcriptionally active, we did not observe a significant increase in expression in response to IFNG stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that thousands of B2_Mm2 elements show epigenetic and transcriptional evidence of IFNG-inducible regulatory activity in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages.</p><p>We investigated the sequence features of each B2 SINE subfamily to determine the basis of IFNG-inducible activity. Given that B2 SINE elements have previously been associated with CTCF binding due to the presence of a CTCF motif harbored by most copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), we subdivided elements from each family based on occupancy by STAT1, CTCF, both factors, or neither factor based on ChIP-seq. Across each of these subsets, we looked for the presence of GAS or CTCF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, all B2 subfamilies showed extensive ChIP-seq binding evidence of CTCF and the RAD21 cohesin subunit, coinciding with a CTCF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, only a subset of elements from the B2_Mm2 subfamily showed inducible binding of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with ChIP-seq evidence, STAT1-bound B2_Mm2 elements contain both GAS and CTCF motifs, while B2_Mm1a/t elements only harbor CTCF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Within B2_Mm2, elements that are bound by STAT1 are significantly enriched for GAS motifs when compared against unbound elements (E-value 2.08×10<sup>–71</sup><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). In addition, STAT1-bound B2_Mm2 elements contain stronger sequence matches to GAS motifs compared to unbound B2_Mm2 elements and B2_Mm1a/t elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Our study reveals a new subclass of B2 elements that have IFNG-inducible enhancer activity. These elements, which belong to the B2_Mm2 subfamily, contain strong binding sites for both STAT1 and CTCF, are marked by H3K27ac, and have the potential to exert inducible enhancer activity on nearby genes.</p><p>Given the abundance of B2 elements and their potential to cause pathological regulatory rewiring, many B2 elements are targeted for SETDB1/H3K9me3-mediated epigenetic repression which inhibits their regulatory potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gualdrini et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the functional impact of B2 elements on the mouse epigenome remains unclear. By using CRISPR to generate knockout cells of a B2_Mm2 element, we demonstrated that B2 elements can be co-opted to act as inducible enhancer elements in the context of IFNG stimulation. While our experiments were conducted in the J774.A1 immortalized cell line, we confirmed that thousands of B2_Mm2 elements including B2_Mm2.Dicer1 show strong transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of inducible enhancer activity in multiple primary macrophage epigenomic datasets.</p><p>We identified hundreds of B2_Mm2-derived enhancers that are predicted to regulate genes displaying IFNG-inducible expression in mouse cells but not human cells, which supports their role in facilitating lineage-specific evolution of the IFNG-inducible regulatory network. However, we also identified a subset of target genes that show inducible expression in both species, suggesting independent evolution or turnover of regulatory elements that could serve similar regulatory functions as the B2_Mm2 enhancers. For instance, we identified an intronic STAT1 binding site derived from a primate-specific TE in the human <italic>DICER1</italic> locus. While we did not uncover consistent evidence supporting IFNG-inducible regulation of human <italic>DICER1</italic>, these observations align with the concept of convergent regulatory evolution, in which similar expression patterns are perpetuated by the co-option of lineage-specific TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, as B2_Mm2 elements shaped the evolution of rodent immune regulatory networks, individual co-option events may have mediated either divergence or preservation of gene expression patterns.</p><p>Our identification of a B2_Mm2 element as an intronic enhancer of <italic>Dicer1</italic> potentially uncovers a novel regulatory feedback loop that controls <italic>Dicer1</italic> function related to TE silencing. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>Dicer1</italic> cleaves double-stranded RNAs including those derived from B2 SINE transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Dicer1</italic> knockout embryonic stem cells, TE-derived transcripts are upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodak et al., 2017</xref>), and upregulation of B2-derived double-stranded RNAs causes activation of the IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gurung et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Dicer1</italic> is important for defense against aberrant TE upregulation. We speculate that co-option of the B2_Mm2 element as an enhancer of <italic>Dicer1</italic> facilitates upregulation of <italic>Dicer1</italic> in response to conditions that drive TE upregulation, such as infection or stress.</p><p>In human, dysregulation of <italic>DICER1</italic> is associated with a wide range of pathologies ranging from DICER1 syndrome, cancer, neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Theotoki et al., 2020</xref>). While <italic>DICER1</italic> has a highly conserved function as an endonuclease involved in RNA interference, our work highlights that orthologs of <italic>DICER1</italic> have undergone lineage- or species-specific regulatory evolution that may drive underappreciated differences in function across species. While we found that both human and mouse orthologs of <italic>DICER1</italic> have STAT1 binding sites, the underlying cis-regulatory architecture is not conserved and likely results in different expression patterns. This could have significant implications when developing and testing RNA-based therapeutics in mouse genetic models, which may elicit distinct <italic>Dicer1</italic>-mediated responses due to species-specific enhancers such as B2_Mm2.Dicer1.</p><p>In conclusion, our work adds to a growing body of evidence highlighting the co-option of lineage-specific TEs for the regulation of ISGs. Previous genomic and experimental studies in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>) and cow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelly et al., 2022</xref>) have revealed independent co-option of TEs as IFNG-inducible enhancer elements. Interestingly, while endogenous retroviruses have been described as a prevalent source of TE-derived inducible enhancers in human, their contribution is relatively minor in cows and mice. Instead, we found that the B2_Mm2 SINE subfamily is the predominant source of TE-derived inducible enhancers in mouse, and the Bov-A2 SINE subfamily is the predominant source in cow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelly et al., 2022</xref>). These findings indicate that the acquisition of STAT1-associated GAS motifs and enhancer activity is not limited to a specific type of TE. In human cells, Alu SINE sequences are transcriptionally activated upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jang and Latchman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Panning and Smiley, 1993</xref>), although their epigenetic impact remains unexplored. It remains unclear whether the infection-inducible regulatory activity promotes SINE replication, and it is possible that the emergence of these motifs is coincidental and does not affect TE fitness. Nevertheless, our work supports the idea that TEs have been repeatedly co-opted as IFNG-inducible enhancers throughout mammalian evolution, contributing to the rewiring of immune regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequences</title><p>A list of all primer sequences and gRNA sequences can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA-seq re-analysis</title><p>RNA-seq data (single-end reads) from primary murine BMDMs stimulated with 100 ng/mL IFNG for 2 or 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Piccolo et al., 2017</xref>) or 10 ng/mL IFNG for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Platanitis et al., 2019</xref>) were downloaded from SRA using fasterq-dump v2.10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">NCBI, 2022</xref> ).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kenji Ichiyanagi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There was consensus among the reviewers that the topic is of broad interest and the data were rigorously generated. The reviewers, however, also felt that some of the claims require additional support. A request for new analyses of the current dataset in hand could potentially blunt these concerns. Depending on the results of these additional analyses, a single new experiment would be required to support the inference that the focal B2 element acts as a Dicer1 enhancer. Please see below for specific revisions requested.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the Dicer1 locus is unique. Are there other loci that have both a nearby B2_Mm2 element and a binary difference between inducibility in mouse versus human cells? It would be helpful to understand whether there other B2_Mm2 insertions that could contribute to a mouse-specific IFGN-sensitivity. Adding DEseq values from human RNAseq data the authors already use (current references 10 and/or 37) for identifiable human orthologs to Table S7 would thus strengthen their conclusions. If there are many potential candidates, the authors should discuss the rationale for selecting Dicer1 in particular.</p><p>2) The results of Serpina3g and Serpina3F gene expression in the authors' knockout cells are very interesting. However, the authors focus almost exclusively on Serpina3g and Serpina3F, which makes it difficult to understand what is happening genome wide. Are other IFNΓ-induced genes (including those not on chromosome 12) similarly affected at the level of basal or induced transcription? How many genes are different in WT versus KO cells, both at basal and induced states? Does this correlate with their CUT&amp;TAG data shown in Figure 5? By focusing only on nearby genes (Serpina3g and Serpina3F), the authors hint that this may be a long-range regulatory effect, &quot;potentially mediated by the CTCF binding activity of the element&quot; that they removed. But by only focusing on two nearby IFNΓ-induced genes, their data do not rule out the (also potentially quite interesting) possibility that there may be a more indirect role for this TE site or Dicer1 in basal transcription of IFNΓ-induced genes or IFNΓ-mediated gene expression.</p><p>3) The specificity of the KO effect on the Dicer1-Serpina region of chromosome 12 is not clear. Without analysis of the complete RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN datasets, it is difficult to rule out a more global effect (i.e., beyond chromosome 12). If these new analyses yield evidence of specificity of the KO lines, the reviewers will be satisfied. If not, the reviewers request an additional manipulation: KO of an intron element of equivalent size to the original deletion, KO of a different B2 element – apparently there is one 2kb away, or even better, replacement of the B2 element with one that lacks cGAS motifs (though the final suggestion is likely too technically challenging). Determining whether there are changes in the basal or induced levels of Dicer1/Serpina genes in this additional line would serve as an important control for the KO experiment. Providing more data on other genes throughout the genome in WT and KO cells, which the authors have generated but do not include in the manuscript, would help distinguish between these models.</p><p>4) There are high levels of POLR2A occupancy at the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element in induced WT cells. Could this be a Pol2 pause site? Could deletion of this element lead to a change in Pol2 occupancy and change Dicer1 expression independent of enhancer activity? To probe such questions, the reviewers requested that the authors directly test the possibility that the intronic B2 element actually acts as a regulator of splicing or transcriptional elongation. Careful analysis of the Dicer1-mapping reads from the RNA-seq data – or RT-qPCR – could resolve this concern.</p><p>5) Figure 4F – The authors claim that &quot;deletion of B2_Mm2.Dicer1 also has a significant repressive effect on the IFNΓ-inducible expression of Serpina genes.&quot; However, the basal levels of Serpina3f/Serpina3g are significantly reduced upon this deletion compared to WT. Furthermore, expression of Serpina genes in the KO cell lines significantly increase upon IFNΓ stimulation, suggesting that they still show inducible expression despite the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 deletion. The authors should compare the magnitude of induction before and after stimulation between the WT and KO cell lines to determine if there is indeed a repressive effect on inducible expression of Serpina genes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mouse B2 SINE elements function as IFN-inducible enhancers&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Molly Przeworski (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated your many additional experiments/analyses as well as the edits to the text. The manuscript has been improved substantially but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. All three reviewers felt that the response to Critique#1 was insufficient. There are several places in the manuscript referring to the significance of the Mouse B2 SINE elements contributing to lineage-specific immune response. For example, the introduction highlights that &quot;a key open question is whether the co-option of TEs as immune regulatory elements is evolutionarily widespread as a mechanism driving divergence of innate immune responses.&quot;</p><p>The reviewers (or at least two of them) did not expect to see additional KO experiments but did expect the authors to highlight a handful of other examples where STAT1 binding to a proximal B2 SINE element is found in a mouse-specific ISG only. If no other such examples are available to highlight, then it's currently difficult to discern how generalizable this relationship is between rodent-specific B2 SINE elements and mouse-specific ISGs.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors highlight a limitation of the current human cell dataset – specifically the limitation of sampling gene expression only 24 hours after interferon treatment (new paragraph starting line 310) in human cells. However, in line 232, the same dataset is used to support the earlier statement that &quot;the human ortholog DICER1 does not show IFNΓ-inducible expression in human primary macrophages (Qiao et al. 2016)…mouse DICER1 shows a significant 50% upregulation in response to IFNΓ in primary mouse BMDMs….&quot;</p><p>This earlier statement is substantially weakened by the final Results paragraph. This issue needs to be resolved to support the major claim of the paper that a lineage-specific TE is responsible for a lineage-specific immune response, echoed in the abstract: &quot;B2 elements…exemplifies how lineage-specific TEs can facilitate evolutionary divergence of innate immune regulatory networks.&quot;</p><p>2. In the response to reviewer comments under critique#2, it was stated that &quot;…the other differentially expressed genes in the KOs most likely represent off-target/stochastic changes, that are commonly seen across separate clonal isolations.&quot; And as communicated in the manuscript: Line 288: &quot;The other dysregulated genes showed no discernable physical or functional pattern and also showed high variability between individual clones…consistent with intrinsic clonal transcriptional variation…&quot; Whether this is true for all 101 genes should be clarified. It seems surprising given that at least some genes should be indirect targets of Dicer1. Finally, does Dicer1 show less variability than these other genes? If so, that should be stated.</p><p>3. Finally, one reviewer was concerned that the intronic location of B2 SINE means that the authors cannot delineate whether the element acts as an enhancer or instead a regulator of transcriptional elongation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82617.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the Dicer1 locus is unique.

As suggested, we have re-analyzed a publicly available human RNA-seq dataset to identify human ISGs in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes stimulated with IFNΓ for 24 hours. A more detailed description of our analysis is provided below. In summary, we classified mouse ISGs based on whether those genes were also ISGs based on the human RNA-seq data, and integrated mouse Hi-C data to predict enhancer/gene interactions. We found that B2_Mm2 elements are associated nearby hundreds of mouse-specific ISGs, consistent with a role in regulating a network of mouse ISGs. However, we note several caveats below, including the observation that B2_Mm2 elements are also associated with many non mouse-specific ISGs, and cannot be causally tied to gene regulation without additional experimental perturbation.</p><p>Using RNA-seq data of IFNΓ-stimulated human CD14+ monocytes (GEO accession GSE84691) (Qiao et al., 2016), we identified a total of 2314 human ISGs (FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 0), 1453 of which had a 1:1 ortholog assignment to a mouse gene based on ENSEMBL Biomart (Cunningham et al., 2022). We integrated the mouse and human datasets to classify mouse genes into 3 categories:</p><p>i) &quot;mouse-specific ISGs&quot; (i.e., genes that have a 1:1 mouse/human ortholog but are only ISGs in mouse OR mouse ISGs with no direct ortholog in human)</p><p>ii) &quot;shared ISGs&quot; (i.e., genes that have a 1:1 mouse/human ortholog and are ISGs in both species)</p><p>iii) &quot;human-specific ISGs&quot; (i.e., genes that have a 1:1 mouse/human ortholog but are only ISGs in human).</p><p>The DESeq2 values for this dataset are now reported in Supplementary file 1. Notably human <italic>DICER1</italic> does not appear to be induced (Supplementary file 1, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). To compare this set to mouse ISGs, we used ISGs defined from BMDMs stimulated with IFNΓ for 4 hours from the Piccolo et al. dataset (GSE84517) analyzed in our previous submission (Piccolo et al., 2017). From this dataset, we defined 2720 mouse genes as ISGs (FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 0). We compared this set of genes to the 1453 human ISGs defined above (i.e., genes that are an ISG in human CD14+ monocytes and have a direct 1:1 human:mouse orthology relationship). Out of the 2720 mouse ISGs, 2266 genes (83.3%) were only ISGs in mouse (including 1467 genes with a 1:1 human ortholog and 799 genes with no 1:1 ortholog), and 454 (16.6%) were ISGs in both mouse and human. Conversely, out of the 2314 human ISGs, 1860 genes (80.4%) were only ISGs in human (including 999 genes with a 1:1 mouse ortholog and 861 genes with no 1:1 ortholog). The relatively low fraction of ISGs shared across species is consistent with a previous study comparing ISGs induced by type I interferon α across vertebrates (Shaw et al., 2017), where a core of 62 ISGs were conserved across species (in our IFNΓ datasets, 56 of these are induced in either mouse or human, 40 of which are induced in both species).</p><p>We next sought to determine how broadly B2_Mm2 has shaped murine innate immune responses using our list of mouse-specific, human-specific, and shared ISGs. We first assigned predicted enhancers to their predicted targets using the Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model (Fulco et al., 2019), which incorporates both epigenomic signal and Hi-C 3D interaction data to predict enhancer-gene targets. As input into the ABC model, we used publicly available ATAC-seq and Hi-C data (PRJNA694816) (Platanitis et al., 2022) from murine BMDMs stimulated with IFNΓ for 2 hours along with the H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets included in the manuscript to identify putative enhancer-gene contacts. We identified 50264 putative enhancer-ISG contacts attributed a minimum ABC likelihood score of 0.01, with an average of 14 enhancers for each gene</p><p>represented in our list of mouse- and human-to-mouse ISGs. We subsequently identified 393 &quot;mouse-specific&quot; 142 &quot;human-specific&quot;, and 64 &quot;shared&quot; ISGs associated with at least one B2_Mm2 enhancer. A list of all mouse and human-to-mouse ISGs along with the top predicted B2_Mm2-derived enhancer can be found in Supplementary file 7.</p><p>Of 2266 mouse-specific ISGs, 393 (17.3%) were predicted to be regulated by at least one B2_Mm2 element. We confirmed that the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element was predicted by ABC to target <italic>Dicer1</italic> (a mouse-specific ISG) with an ABC likelihood score of 0.127508 (Supplementary file 7). This finding is consistent with the idea that B2_Mm2 elements have facilitated the evolution of the mouse-specific ISG regulatory network. However, we also found that B2_Mm2 elements are predicted to regulate 64 out of 454 (14.1%) genes that are shared ISGs in both mouse and human, and 142 out of 999 (14.2%) of genes that are only ISGs in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe a difference in the distribution of ABC scores between mouse- and human-specific ISGs for B2_Mm2-derived enhancers as well as nonresponsive TE families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This indicates that the association with a B2_Mm2-derived enhancer is not strongly predictive that a gene is a mouse-specific ISG.</p><p>There are a few notable caveats with this analysis. (1) the human RNA-seq dataset was generated by a different lab and derived from cells stimulated with IFNΓ for 24 hours, whereas the two mouse RNA-seq datasets collected cells 2 or 4 hours after IFNΓ stimulation. Previous studies have shown that transcriptional responses to type I and II IFNs vary across timepoints (Piccolo et al., 2017; Sumida et al., 2022). Genes that are not induced in human cells after 24 hours may potentially be induced at 4 hours. As such, the number of shared ISGs is likely an underestimate. Careful analysis of human and mouse datasets derived from cells collected at similar timepoints may improve identification of species-specific ISGs and potentially result in a larger difference in the number of B2_Mm2 elements predicted to drive species-specific ISG expression. (2), we used a relaxed ABC likelihood score threshold of 0.01 such that the number of B2_Mm2-derived enhancer-gene contacts identified likely represent the maximum possible using these data. These predictions also did not distinguish between elements that show constitutive or IFN-inducible regulation, so it is possible that some B2 elements may have act as constitutive rather than IFN-inducible enhancers. (3) we were able to confidently identify only 1453 (62.8%) human-to-mouse, one-to-one ISG orthologs. Careful analysis of all potential orthologs and paralogs (such as species-specific gene family expansions) may better reveal the full extent to which B2_Mm2 has contributed to species-specific immune regulatory evolution.</p><p>In summary, while our reanalysis is indeed consistent with a slightly increased enrichment of B2_Mm2 elements near mouse-specific ISG (e.g., 17.3% of mouse-specific ISGs are predicted to be regulated by B2_Mm2 elements compared to 14.1% of shared human/mouse ISGs), there are many caveats that we feel are outside the scope of this study to address and therefore we have opted not to include these analyses in the study.</p><p>We initially decided to study the B2_Mm2 within the <italic>Dicer1</italic> intron for several reasons that were outlined in the main text, including the species-specific IFN-inducible expression of <italic>Dicer1</italic> and strong epigenomic signature of inducible enhancer activity (STAT1, H3K27ac, CTCF) of the specific B2_Mm2 element. We have clarified our process for selecting the element as below, incorporating the revised ABC analysis to assign enhancers to genes through 3D interactions as described above.</p><p>“Having established that B2_Mm2 elements are an abundant source of IFNΓ-inducible STAT1 binding sites in the mouse genome, we asked whether any of these elements have been co-opted to regulate expression of individual ISGs. We first assigned predicted enhancers to their predicted targets using the Activity by Contact (ABC) model (Fulco et al., 2019), which incorporates both epigenomic signal and Hi-C 3D interaction data to predict enhancer-gene targets. As input into the ABC model, we used publicly available ATAC-seq and Hi-C data from murine BMDMs stimulated with IFNΓ for 2 hours (PRJNA694816) (Platanitis et al., 2022) and H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from (Piccolo et al. 2017). Focusing on a permissive set of 2720 ISGs from (Piccolo et al. 2017) (FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05, log2 fold change &gt; 0), we identified 530 B2_Mm2 elements predicted to interact with 457 mouse ISGs (16.8% of the set of 2720 in this analysis) (Supplementary file 7). Compared with a set of human ISGs from human CD14+ monocytes (Qiao et al., 2016), 393 of these 457 (86%) genes were only ISGs in mouse, and the remaining 64 (14%) were ISGs in both mouse and human.</p><p>From this set, we decided to focus on a specific B2_Mm2 element located on Chromosome 12 within the first intron of <italic>Dicer1</italic>, which is an endonuclease responsible for recognizing and cleaving foreign and double stranded RNA that has been linked to innate immunity (MacKay et al. 2014; Poirier et al. 2021; Chiappinelli et al. 2012; Gurung et al. 2021). While the human ortholog <italic>DICER1</italic> does not show IFNΓ-inducible expression in human primary macrophages (Qiao et al., 2016) (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1), mouse <italic>Dicer1</italic> shows a significant 50% upregulation in response to IFNΓ in primary mouse BMDMs (Figure 3A). This indicates that <italic>Dicer1</italic> is a mouse-specific ISG and likely acquired IFNΓ-inducible expression in the mouse lineage, potentially due to the co-option of the B2_Mm2 element as a species-specific IFNΓ-inducible enhancer. The intronic B2_Mm2 element (B2_Mm2.Dicer1) shows biochemical hallmarks of enhancer activity including inducible STAT1 and H3K27ac signal as well as constitutive binding by CTCF and RAD21 (Figure 3B). The element provides the only prominent nearby STAT1 binding site and is not present in rat or other mammals (Figure 3B). Therefore, we hypothesized that the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element was co-opted as an IFNΓ-inducible enhancer of mouse <italic>Dicer1</italic>.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Activity-by-Contact (ABC) analysis of B2_Mm2 enhancers and ISGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proportions of ISGs (mouse-specific, human-specific, shared) predicted to be regulated by a B2_Mm2 enhancer.

However, the RNA-seq dataset for WT and KO cells generated in our initial submission was not suited for this comparison because (i) they were generated in different batches, and (ii) the WT control was a pool of WT J774 cells rather than clonal controls. Therefore, we generated new RNA-seq data where WT and KOs were treated in the same batch, using 3 additional control WT/unedited clones that were carried through the limited dilution process. For each WT (N=3) and KO (N=2) independently derived clonal line, we carried out 3 experimental replicates of untreated cells and cells treated for IFNΓ for 4 hrs, and harvested RNA for RNA-seq. These were all conducted in the same round of experiments to avoid potential batch effects.</p><p>We re-analyzed our new RNA-seq data to address the concerns raised by reviewers' comment (2) and comment (3). Consistent with our previous analysis, KO cells showed significantly reduced expression of <italic>Dicer1</italic> in both untreated and IFNΓ-induced conditions. We first conducted DESeq2 pairwise differential expression analysis considering all replicates, WT (N=9) vs KO (N=6) in untreated cells showed <italic>Dicer1</italic> downregulation with log<sub>2</sub>FC = -0.43, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 9×10<sup>-4</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).

As before, all KO lines showed the same non-inducible expression of <italic>Dicer1</italic>. Within all WT clones, <italic>Dicer1</italic> showed significant IFNΓ-inducibility (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 0.35; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.7×10<sup>-6</sup>) while this inducibility was ablated in KO cells (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 0; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.98).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>MA plot of all WT replicates vs all KO replicates in the untreated condition.</title><p>Dicer1 is labeled and is highly expressed and modestly but significantly downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -0.43, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 9×10<sup>-4)</sup>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82617-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>MA plot of all WT replicates vs all KO replicates in the IFNΓ-treated condition.</title><p>Dicer1 is labeled and is highly expressed and significantly downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -0.43, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 9×10<sup>-4)</sup>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82617-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We next examined how <italic>Dicer1</italic> compares to other genes affected genome-wide by the knockout. Comparing IFNΓ-treated WT to KO cells, <italic>Dicer1</italic> was the 102nd most dysregulated gene (out of 3567 total genes with FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). In untreated cells, <italic>Dicer1</italic> was ranked 1741 out of differentially expressed genes based on FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (out of 3992 total genes with FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05). In other words, in untreated KO cells, there are 1740 genes that show a more significant change than <italic>Dicer1</italic>. In contrast, in IFNΓ-treated KO cells, there are just 101 genes that show a more significant change than <italic>Dicer1</italic>. In both conditions, the other dysregulated genes are located across all chromosomes and did not show any clear functional patterns or enrichment. We did not observe correlations between these genes and our CUT&amp;TAG data, with the caveat that our CUT&amp;TAG was performed on just one KO clone (KO1) and the pooled WT cells. We expect that CUT&amp;TAG data would correspond to RNA-seq data if derived from the same clone.</p><p>Based on the global distribution across the genome, the other differentially expressed genes in the KOs most likely represent off-target/stochastic changes, that are commonly seen across separate clonal isolations. We routinely use CRISPR KO and observe similar levels of off-target effects by RNA-seq even across control lines, presumably due to the process of clonal isolation. We have observed greater on-target gene expression differences when using CRISPRi (dCas9-Krab) to target enhancers in pooled cells (avoiding clonal isolation), but we decided not to use CRISPRi for this element, reasoning that the element is located within the gene intron and dCas9-Krab binding could impede <italic>Dicer1</italic> transcription. While it is a potentially interesting scenario that the observed dysregulation of other genes is an indirect effect of <italic>Dicer1</italic> downregulation, the untreated KO cells showed only a modest downregulation of <italic>Dicer1</italic> (log<sub>2</sub>FC = -0.43) which is may not sufficiently alter Dicer1 protein levels or function. The functional consequence of IFNΓ-inducible regulation on Dicer1 would be interesting to follow up in a future study.</p><p>Summary of changes</p><p>– Figure 4B-E is updated to use numbers from the NA-seq reanalysis</p><p>– Main text updated as follows</p><p>“We used RNA-seq to study the genome-wide effects of the B2_Mm2.<italic>Dicer1</italic> element in both knockout clones and 3 control wild-type clones which were also isolated by limiting dilution. Consistent with the RT-qPCR results, we found that <italic>Dicer1</italic> showed significant IFNΓ-inducible upregulation in all WT clones but that this induction was completely ablated in B2_Mm2.<italic>Dicer1</italic> KO clones (Figure 4B). Notably, the RNA-seq normalized count data revealed that levels of <italic>Dicer1</italic> were also significantly reduced in untreated knockout cells (Figure 4B, 5A). This indicates that the B2_Mm2.<italic>Dicer1</italic> element regulates both basal expression levels of <italic>Dicer1</italic> and inducible expression by IFNΓ. Focusing on the IFNΓ-treated condition, <italic>Dicer1</italic> was significantly downregulated in KO cells compared to WT cells cells (log2FC = -0.80, adjusted p-value = 3.393×10<sup>-15</sup>). Genome-wide, there were 101 genes that showed greater significance than <italic>Dicer1</italic> when testing for differential expression between IFNΓ-treated KO and WT cells (out of 3567 total genes with FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; Supplementary file 8). The other dysregulated genes showed no discernable physical or functional pattern and also showed high variability between individual clones, consistent with clonal transcriptional variation typical of the limiting dilution process (Lee et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The specificity of the KO effect on the Dicer1-Serpina region of chromosome 12 is not clear. Without analysis of the complete RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN datasets, it is difficult to rule out a more global effect (i.e., beyond chromosome 12). If these new analyses yield evidence of specificity of the KO lines, the reviewers will be satisfied. If not, the reviewers request an additional manipulation: KO of an intron element of equivalent size to the original deletion, KO of a different B2 element – apparently there is one 2kb away, or even better, replacement of the B2 element with one that lacks cGAS motifs (though the final suggestion is likely too technically challenging). Determining whether there are changes in the basal or induced levels of Dicer1/Serpina genes in this additional line would serve as an important control for the KO experiment. Providing more data on other genes throughout the genome in WT and KO cells, which the authors have generated but do not include in the manuscript, would help distinguish between these models.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our response above for Reviewer Critique #2, we have generated RNA-seq data for 3 new control lines generated by taking wild-type cells through clonal isolation. We agree with the reviewers that a &quot;negative control KO&quot; would be the best control, however in our past experience with CRISPR we find that most off-target/non-specific expression changes arise due to the process of clonal isolation. We also repeated the experiments and RNA-seq from our 2 KO lines such that our comparisons would not be confounded by batch effects.</p><p>Our new RNA-seq analysis of the 3 clonal WT lines and 2 KO lines confirmed that <italic>Dicer1</italic> is consistently IFNΓ-inducible in the controls but not inducible in the KOs, with lower basal and induced levels (updated Figure 4A-B). However, and importantly, we found that <italic>Serpina3f</italic> and <italic>Serpina3g</italic> did not show the same pattern of regulation we observed previously (significantly reduced untreated and IFNΓ-induced expression in KO cells). In the new round of RNA-seq, we found that <italic>Serpina3f</italic>/<italic>g</italic> did not show significantly or consistently reduced expression in untreated KO cells (Supplementary file 8). These results conflict with our previous claim that <italic>Serpina3f</italic> and <italic>Serpina3g</italic> are regulated by the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element, and instead suggest that our previous observation was an artifact of clonal variation and the extremely strong (log2fc &gt; 10) IFNΓ-inducibility of <italic>Serpina3g</italic> within each genotype (in WT, inducible log<sub>2</sub>FC = 11.3, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.27×10<sup>-183</sup>; in KO, inducible log<sub>2</sub>FC 10.4; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value ≈ 0) and <italic>Serpina3f</italic> (WT log<sub>2</sub>FC = 10.4, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.8E×10<sup>-99</sup>; KO log<sub>2</sub>FC 10.3, FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 9.3×10<sup>-100</sup>). It is likely that our previous observation was due to the fact that our KO1/2 RNA-seq datasets were generated in a separate experimental batch than the WT control, which was a pooled set of cells. Furthermore, our chromatin interaction analysis (described in response to Reviewer Critique #1) predicts that the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element targets <italic>Dicer1</italic>, but does not target the <italic>Serpina</italic> genes. Taken together, our new controls support a specific regulatory effect of the element on <italic>Dicer1</italic> but not the <italic>Serpin</italic> genes (as previously claimed). As such, we have removed our claims that <italic>Serpin</italic> genes are affected by the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 knockout from the main text. While our re-analysis indicates that the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element does not have long-range enhancer activity as we previously concluded, this does not affect the major claims of our study. While the long-range distal enhancer activity was potentially an interesting observation, the fact that B2_Mm2.Dicer1 has a clear and reproducible regulatory effect on the more proximal gene <italic>Dicer1</italic> is consistent with our central claim that B2_Mm2 elements act as IFNΓ-inducible enhancers.</p><p>The following paragraph was removed from the main text:</p><p>Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that deletion of B2_Mm2.Dicer1 also had a significant repressive effect on the IFNΓ-inducible expression of <italic>Serpina</italic> genes. In mouse, <italic>Serpina</italic> is a family of inflammatory genes represented by a large cluster of 14 murine paralogs, located 330 – 1000 kb from B2_Mm2.Dicer1. In particular, we found that <italic>Serpina3f</italic> and <italic>Serpina3g</italic> (approximately 500 kb from B2_Mm2.Dicer1) show a 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in basal and induced gene expression in knockout cells compared to WT cells (Figure 4E-F, 5B). The relatively long range of this regulatory activity is not uncommon in vertebrate genomes (Schoenfelder and Fraser, 2019) and is potentially mediated by the CTCF binding activity of the element.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are high levels of POLR2A occupancy at the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element in induced WT cells. Could this be a Pol2 pause site? Could deletion of this element lead to a change in Pol2 occupancy and change Dicer1 expression independent of enhancer activity? To probe such questions, the reviewers requested that the authors directly test the possibility that the intronic B2 element actually acts as a regulator of splicing or transcriptional elongation. Careful analysis of the Dicer1-mapping reads from the RNA-seq data – or RT-qPCR – could resolve this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting if the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 altered <italic>Dicer1</italic> transcription separately from its function as an inducible enhancer, and thank the reviewer for the suggestion. As shown in Figure 5, deletion of the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element does remove Pol2 occupancy over the element and reduces overall signal over the locus, consistent with enhancer activity but not mutually exclusive with pausing activity. If the intronic B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element acts as a regulator of splicing, we would expect changes in isoform expression. As suggested, we manually inspected aligned RNA-seq reads from all WT and KO untreated/treated samples. Qualitatively, we observed no evidence of differential splicing or exon skipping when looking at aligned fragments from WT J774 and B2_Mm2.Dicer1 KO J774 cells (see below).</p><p>To more formally analyze this possibility with the data available, we conducted transcript assembly on all the samples and tested for differential isoform usage focusing on <italic>Dicer1</italic> transcripts. As suggested by the reviewers, if the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element acts as a pause site, it may alter splice site or polyadenylation site usage and cause measurable differential expression of specific <italic>Dicer1</italic> splice variants in KO cells. To test this, we ran Stringtie v2 to conduct transcript assembly using the RNA-seq reads from each WT and KO individual sample, then used the ‘--merge’ flag to generate a merged gene annotation file representing isoforms from all samples. In parallel we also generated merged GTF files created using alignment files only from WT or B2_Mm2.Dicer1 KO samples. All exons identified in the fully merged GTF file are represented in the WT- and KO-specific GTF files. At the transcript level, all <italic>Dicer1</italic> isoforms in the fully merged GTF file are also represented in the WT- and KO-specific GTF file. Together, this indicates that there are no isoforms that are unique to either KO and WT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>UCSC Snapshot of the <italic>Dicer1</italic> locus in mouse, with custom Stringtie transcript-level annotation (top three tracks), GENCODE gene-level annotation (fourth track), and alignments from clonal WT (fifth track) and B2_Mm2.</title><p>Dicer1 KO (sixth track) J774.A1 cells.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82617-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To quantify differences in isoform expression, we used DESeq2 to measure differences in isoform expression across WT and B2_Mm2.Dicer1 KO samples using the merged Stringtie isoform information as input (gene-level analysis was used for the manuscript). This revealed several transcripts that all show similar trends to the gene-level analysis (see Supplementary file 9), where expression is reduced in both basal and IFN-treated conditions in the KO, and inducible expression is lost. If the element acted as a pause site affecting elongation, we would have expected unrestricted Pol2 elongation in both conditions and therefore greater expression levels in the KO in either or both basal and treated conditions. However, we only observed reduced expression of transcripts in all conditions in the KO, which is most consistent with activity as an enhancer.</p><p>We have uploaded these alignments and accompanying Stringtie annotation files to an updated UCSC Genome Browser session (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/coke6162/B2_SINE_enhancers_Horton_et_al).

For example, it is possible that the element serves as a pause site in vitro, and is only released by NELF and other factors specifically under IFNΓ conditions, driving inducible elongation of <italic>Dicer1</italic> in WT cells. However, the fact that KO of the element reduced basal transcript levels of <italic>Dicer1</italic> more strongly supports enhancer activity. Direct ChIP-weq investigation of NELF/P-Tefb (CDK9/Cyclin T1) in our IFNΓ-treated WT and KO cells, as well as use of nascent transcription (PRO-seq), are necessary to directly investigate Pol2 pausing. However, given that did we did not observe any clear differences at the transcript level, we feel that our findings are most consistent with the element acting as a typical inducible cis-regulatory enhancer, and investigation of pausing would be outside the scope of the study.</p><p>We have added our analysis of isoform-level changes to the main text as follows:</p><p>“Given the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element is bound by POLR2A in WT cells, we examined whether the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 element may alter transcription by affecting usage of different splice sites or polyadenylation sites, which would be consistent with pause site activity. We examined transcript isoform-level expression changes in KO cells in both untreated and treated conditions and found multiple transcripts that showed the same trend as the gene-level analysis, where most expressed transcripts are downregulated in both basal and IFNΓ-treated conditions and show lack of inducibility in KO cells (Supplementary file 9). These findings are consistent with the element acting primarily as an IFNΓ-inducible enhancer without any major effect on alternative splicing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4F – The authors claim that &quot;deletion of B2_Mm2.Dicer1 also has a significant repressive effect on the IFNΓ-inducible expression of Serpina genes.&quot; However, the basal levels of Serpina3f/Serpina3g are significantly reduced upon this deletion compared to WT. Furthermore, expression of Serpina genes in the KO cell lines significantly increase upon IFNΓ stimulation, suggesting that they still show inducible expression despite the B2_Mm2.Dicer1 deletion. The authors should compare the magnitude of induction before and after stimulation between the WT and KO cell lines to determine if there is indeed a repressive effect on inducible expression of Serpina genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to further validate the regulatory effect on the Serpina genes. In our original study, the WT and KO cell lines were treated and sequenced in different batches, which confounded our comparison. As we describe in our answer to reviewer comment (3), we have re-generated and re-analyzed RNA-seq data from multiple WT and KO clonal lines in both untreated/treated conditions, with all data generated in the same experimental batch. This reanalysis confirmed the specificity of the enhancer's inducible regulation of <italic>Dicer1</italic>, but revealed no consistent effect on <italic>Serpina3f</italic>/<italic>a3g</italic>. This suggests that our previous finding of <italic>SerpinA3g</italic> was an artifact likely due to clonal variation and/or batch effect, as our reanalysis using new control clones that were isolated by limited dilution no longer showed a consistent effect on the <italic>Serpina</italic> genes. Therefore we have removed our findings on the enhancer's long-range regulation of <italic>Serpina3g</italic> and focus on the effect of enhancer activity on <italic>Dicer1</italic>. We do not believe this alters our central claims, which is that B2_Mm2 elements are an abundant source of IFNΓ-inducible enhancers, which typically regulate proximal genes within 50 kb of the gene.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers appreciated your many additional experiments/analyses as well as the edits to the text. The manuscript has been improved substantially but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. All three reviewers felt that the response to Critique#1 was insufficient. There are several places in the manuscript referring to the significance of the Mouse B2 SINE elements contributing to lineage-specific immune response. For example, the introduction highlights that &quot;a key open question is whether the co-option of TEs as immune regulatory elements is evolutionarily widespread as a mechanism driving divergence of innate immune responses.&quot;</p><p>The reviewers (or at least two of them) did not expect to see additional KO experiments but did expect the authors to highlight a handful of other examples where STAT1 binding to a proximal B2 SINE element is found in a mouse-specific ISG only. If no other such examples are available to highlight, then it's currently difficult to discern how generalizable this relationship is between rodent-specific B2 SINE elements and mouse-specific ISGs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to highlight examples of species-specific mouse ISGs predicted to be regulated by B2_Mm2 elements. We identified 393 B2_Mm2 elements predicted regulate mouse-specific ISGs based on chromatin state and interaction (ABC model (Fulco et al., 2019)). We have added the information on these candidate elements and their target gene as a new sheet in Supplementary File 7. We also highlighted 5 additional examples in new Figure 3 supplements (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, Figure Supplement 2), based on high ABC predicted interaction scores and published associations with immunity. We also conducted GO enrichment on these 393 genes and identified significant enrichment of terms related to immune responses, which we have also reported in a new sheet in Supplementary File 7. We have added the following paragraph to the main text:</p><p>“The 393 mouse-specific ISGs predicted to be regulated by B2_Mm2 elements were significantly enriched for multiple immune related functions (GO:0002376, adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 6.023×10<sup>-9</sup>; Supplementary file 7). We identified multiple examples of predicted B2_Mm2 target genes with established immune functions that showed mouse-specific IFNΓ-inducible expression (Figure 3 Figure Supplement 1, Figure Supplement 2), including dicer 1 ribonuclease III (<italic>Dicer1</italic>) (Poirier et al., 2021) (Figure 3A), SET domain containing 6, protein lysine methyltransferase (SETD6) (Levy et al., 2011), DOT1-like histone lysine methyltransferase (Kealy et al., 2020), fumarate hydratase 1 (Fh1) (Zecchini et al., 2023), heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1B (<italic>Hspa1b</italic>) (Jolesch et al., 2012), NFKB inhibitor δ (<italic>Nfkbid</italic>) (Souza et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors highlight a limitation of the current human cell dataset – specifically the limitation of sampling gene expression only 24 hours after interferon treatment (new paragraph starting line 310) in human cells. However, in line 232, the same dataset is used to support the earlier statement that &quot;the human ortholog DICER1 does not show IFNΓ-inducible expression in human primary macrophages (Qiao et al. 2016)…mouse DICER1 shows a significant 50% upregulation in response to IFNΓ in primary mouse BMDMs….&quot;</p><p>This earlier statement is substantially weakened by the final Results paragraph. This issue needs to be resolved to support the major claim of the paper that a lineage-specific TE is responsible for a lineage-specific immune response, echoed in the abstract: &quot;B2 elements…exemplifies how lineage-specific TEs can facilitate evolutionary divergence of innate immune regulatory networks.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>During the first revision, we found that the human DICER1 locus harbors STAT1 binding sites, despite not showing IFNΓ-inducible expression in primary monocytes (Qiao et al. 2013, 2016). While it is possible the STAT1 binding sites are nonfunctional, this prompted us to analyze RNA-seq data of IFNΓ-stimulated monocytes from another group (McCann et al. 2022) and saw that <italic>DICER1</italic> did show IFNΓ-inducible expression in this other dataset. Thus, the evidence for inducible expression of human <italic>DICER1</italic> was inconsistent but we felt it was important to include this additional analysis. There are several factors that could drive this observation, including the fact that these studies were conducted by different groups from cells from different donors. We recognize that this observation weakens our original claim stating that B2 elements drive lineage-specific expression and &quot;evolutionary divergence of innate immune regulatory networks.&quot; However, our finding is consistent with conclusions from other groups (Choudhary et al., 2020; Sundaram et al., 2014) that lineage-specific TEs can contribute to regulatory turnover of transcription factor binding sites and/or convergent evolution.</p><p>We emphasize that B2 elements are still driving lineage-specific evolution of the cis-regulatory architecture underlying the IFNΓ regulatory network. But, at the gene expression level, different B2 elements may drive lineage-specific divergence or maintenance/turnover (replacement of existing sites) (Dermitzakis and Clark, 2002; Moses et al., 2006) or convergent regulatory evolution, which are important mechanisms of regulatory evolution (Long et al., 2016). Distinguishing the last two possibilities would require examining <italic>Dicer1</italic> inducibility by IFNΓ in monocytes from other species, which would be interesting but outside the scope of this study. Furthermore, given that we identified 393 other B2 elements predicted to act as species-specific enhancers (based on our comparison of the Piccolo et al. and Qiao et al. 2016 datasets), we expect that a substantial fraction are driving lineage-specific divergence of inducible gene expression.</p><p>We have rewritten the final results paragraph to clarify that this idea:</p><p>“Considering that the B2_Mm2 enhancer is specific to rodents, we examined the regulatory landscape of the human <italic>DICER1</italic> locus. Our analysis of RNA-seq data from human primary monocytes treated with IFNΓ for 24 hrs (Qiao et al., 2016) indicated that human <italic>DICER1</italic> expression is not induced by IFNΓ (Supplementary file 1, Figure 3 —figure supplement 3). However, ChIP-seq data from IFN-treated monocytes from the same group (Qiao et al., 2013) showed multiple inducible STAT1 binding sites within the human <italic>DICER1</italic> locus, including one originating from a primate-specific TE (LTR27) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Although these binding sites do not correlate with inducible <italic>DICER1</italic> expression in the matched RNA-seq dataset, they suggest human <italic>DICER1</italic> may be inducible under different conditions. An analysis of an independent dataset generated from another donor (McCann et al., 2022) supported the inducible expression of <italic>DICER1</italic> (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 0.91 &amp; FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.0×10<sup>-4</sup>) (Supplementary file 1). Thus, while the evidence for inducible human <italic>DICER1</italic> expression is inconsistent, our analyses indicate that human <italic>DICER1</italic> has independently evolved primate-specific binding STAT1 binding sites, which may also confer inducible regulation.”</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>“We identified hundreds of B2_Mm2-derived enhancers that are predicted to regulate genes displaying IFNΓ-inducible expression in mouse cells but not human cells, which supports their role in facilitating lineage-specific evolution of the IFNΓ-inducible regulatory network. However, we also identified a subset of target genes that show inducible expression in both species, suggesting independent evolution or turnover of regulatory elements that could serve similar regulatory functions as the B2_Mm2 enhancers. For instance, we identified an intronic STAT1 binding site derived from a primate-specific TE in the human <italic>DICER1</italic> locus. While we did not uncover consistent evidence supporting IFNΓ-inducible regulation of human <italic>DICER1</italic>, these observations align with the concept of convergent regulatory evolution, in which similar expression patterns are perpetuated by the co-option of lineage-specific TEs (Choudhary et al., 2020; Sundaram et al., 2014). Therefore, as B2_Mm2 elements shaped the evolution of rodent immune regulatory networks, individual co-option events may have mediated either divergence or preservation of gene expression patterns.”</p><p>We have also edited the last sentence of the abstract as follows to be consistent with our Dicer1 findings:</p><p>“Regulatory networks underlying innate immunity continually face selective pressures to adapt to new and evolving pathogens. Transposable elements (TEs) can affect immune gene expression as a source of inducible regulatory elements, but the significance of these elements in facilitating evolutionary diversification of innate immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the mouse epigenomic response to type II interferon (IFN) signaling and discovered that elements from a subfamily of B2 SINE (B2_Mm2) contain STAT1 binding sites and function as IFN-inducible enhancers. CRISPR deletion experiments in mouse cells demonstrated that a B2_Mm2 element has been co-opted as an enhancer driving IFN-inducible expression of <italic>Dicer1</italic>. The rodent-specific B2 SINE family is highly abundant in the mouse genome and elements have been previously characterized to exhibit promoter, insulator, and non-coding RNA activity. Our work establishes a new role for B2 elements as inducible enhancer elements that influence mouse immunity, and exemplifies how lineage-specific TEs can facilitate evolutionary turnover and divergence of innate immune regulatory networks.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
