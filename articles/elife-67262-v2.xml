in layer V, allegedly mediate transfer of information from the hippocampus to the neocortex, underlying long-term memory. Recently, this circuit has been shown to comprise a hippocampal output recipient layer Vb and a cortical projecting layer Va. With the use of in vitro electrophysiology in transgenic mice specific for layer Vb, we assessed the presence of the thus necessary connection from layer Vb-to-Va in the functionally distinct medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subdivisions; MEC, particularly its dorsal part, processes allocentric spatial information, whereas the corresponding part of LEC processes information representing elements of episodes. Using identical experimental approaches, we show that connections from layer Vb-to-Va neurons are stronger in dorsal LEC compared with dorsal MEC, suggesting different operating principles in these two regions. Although further in vivo experiments are needed, our findings imply a potential difference in how LEC and MEC mediate episodic systems consolidation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parahippocampal region</kwd><kwd>local circuit</kwd><kwd>hippocampal-cortical output circuit</kwd><kwd>hippocampal-entorhinal re-entry circuit</kwd><kwd>systems memory consolidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001201</institution-id><institution>Kavli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witter</surname><given-names>Menno P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (#19K06917)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohara</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#197467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witter</surname><given-names>Menno P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#223262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witter</surname><given-names>Menno P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#227769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witter</surname><given-names>Menno P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The connection from layer Vb-to-Va neurons, a key component of the canonical hippocampal-cortical output circuit, which is allegedly crucial for memory consolidation, is relatively stronger in lateral entorhinal cortex compared with the medial entorhinal cortex, thus suggesting different operating principles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Everyday memories, which include information of place, time, and content of episodes, gradually mature from an initially labile state to a more stable and long-lasting state. This memory maturation process, called memory consolidation, involves gradual reorganization of interconnected brain regions: memories that are initially depending on hippocampus become increasingly dependent on cortical networks over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>). Although various models have been hypothesized for this systems-level consolidation, such as the standard consolidation model and multiple trace theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Squire and Alvarez, 1995</xref>), they all share a canonical hippocampal-cortical output circuit via the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is crucial to mediate long-term memory storage and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BuzsÃ¡ki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</xref>). The existence of this circuit was originally proposed based on the ground-breaking report of a non-fornical hippocampal-cortical output route mediated by layer V (LV) of the EC in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977</xref>), which was later confirmed also in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">KÃ¶hler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosel et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>The EC is composed of two functionally distinct subdivisions, the lateral and medial EC (LEC and MEC, respectively). MEC processes allocentric, mainly spatial information, whereas LEC represents the time and content of episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montchal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu and Wilson, 2012</xref>). Despite these evident functional differences, both subdivisions are assumed to share the same cortical output system mediated by LV neurons. Recently, we and others have shown that LV in both MEC and LEC can be genetically and connectionally divided into two sublayers: a deep layer Vb (LVb), which contains neurons receiving projections from the hippocampus, and a superficial layer Va (LVa), which originates the main projections out to forebrain cortical and subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wozny et al., 2018</xref>). These results indicate that for the hippocampal-cortical dialogue to function we need to postulate a projection from LVb to LVa neurons. Although the existence of such a LVb-LVa circuit is supported by our previous study using transsynaptic viral tracing in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>), experimental evidence for functional connectivity from LVb-to-Va in LEC and MEC is still lacking.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the presence of this hypothetical intrinsic EC circuit by using a newly generated LVb-specific transgenic (TG) mouseÂ line obtained with an enhancer-driven gene expression (EDGE) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankvoort et al., 2018</xref>). To compare the LVb intrinsic circuit between LEC and MEC, we ran identical in vitro electrophysiological and optogenetical experiments in comparable dorsal portions of LEC and MEC. To our surprise, we found differences in the postulated intrinsic LVb-LVa pathway between the two entorhinal subdivisions: the connectivity is prominent in dorsal LEC but is apparently sparse in dorsal parts of MEC. In contrast, other intrinsic circuits from LVb to layers II and III (LII and LIII), which constitute hippocampal-entorhinal re-entry circuits, are very similar in both entorhinal subdivisions. Our data seem to suggest that the current view of the canonical hippocampal-cortical output circuit that allegedly is crucial for systems consolidation might need revision, though the functional impact of our findings awaits further in vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of LVb TG mouse line</title><p>Entorhinal LV can be divided into superficial LVa and deep LVb based on differences in cytoarchitectonics, connectivity and genetic markers such as Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor interacting protein 2 (Ctip2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods for details). To target the entorhinal LVb neurons, we used a TG mouse line (MEC-13-53D) that was obtained with the EDGE approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankvoort et al., 2018</xref>). In this TG line, the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA, Tet-Off) is expressed under the control of a specific enhancer and a downstream minimal promoter. To visualize the expression patterns of tTA, this line was crossed to a reporter mouse line, which expresses mCherry together with GCaMP6 in a tTA-dependent manner.</p><p>In both LEC and MEC, mCherry-positive neurons were observed mainly in LVb (93.2% in LEC and 82.9% in MEC) and some in layer VI (LVI; 5.1% in LEC and 16.8% in MEC) but hardly in LVa (1.7% in LEC and 0.3% in MEC), and none in superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâD</xref>). The proportion of PCP4-positive LVb neurons that show tTA-driven labeling was 45.9% in LEC and 30.9% in MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The tTA-driven labeling colocalized well with the PCP4Â labeling (percentage of tTA-expressing neurons that were PCP4-positive was 91.7% in LEC and 99.3% in MEC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), highlighting the specificity of the line. In another experiment using a GAD67 TG line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), we showed that the percentage of double-labeled (PCP4+, GAD67+) neurons among total GAD67-positive neurons is very low in both LEC and MEC (4.3% and 2.3%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This percentage of double-labeled neurons was significantly lower than in the Ctip2-stained sample in both regions (18.1% for LEC and 7.2% for MEC). This result shows that PCP4 can be used as a marker for excitatory entorhinal LVb neurons. Occasionally PCP4-positive neurons were observed in what seems to be layer Va, where there is a lack of continuity in the cell layer as indicated by retrograde tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although sparse, these âmisplacedâ LVb neurons were also targeted in our TG mouse line. The MEC-13-53D is thus an attractive TG mouseÂ line to target excitatory LVb neurons in both LEC and MEC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortexÂ (MEC) layer VbÂ (LVb) neurons show distinct morphological features.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Expression of tetracycline-controlled transactivatorÂ (tTA) in the enhancer-driven gene expressionÂ (EDGE) mouse line (MEC-13-53D), which is visualized with mCherry (green) by crossing to a tTA-dependent mCherry line.

In line with previous studies, many MEC-LVb neurons were pyramidal cells with apical dendrites that ascended straight toward layer I (LI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,Â J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamam et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, more than 40% of the targeted LEC-LVb neurons were tilted pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canto and Witter, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamam et al., 2002</xref>) with apical dendrites not extending superficially beyond LIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,Â J</xref>). Since this latter result may result from severing of dendrites by the slicing procedure, we also examined the distribution of LVb apical dendrites in vivo. After injecting AAV2/1-TRE-Tight-GFP in the deep layer of LEC in the TG line, the distribution of labeled dendrites of LEC-LVb neurons was examined throughout all sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Even with this approach, the labeled dendrites mainly terminated in LIII and only sparsely reached layer IIb. These morphological differences indicate that MEC-LVb neurons sample inputs from different layers than LEC-LVb neurons: MEC-LVb neurons receive inputs throughout all layers, whereas LEC-LVb neurons only receive inputs innervating layer IIbâVI. In contrast to LVb neurons, the morphology of LVa neurons was relatively similar in both regions: the basal dendrites extended horizontally mostly within LVa, whereas the apical dendrites reached LI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Here, we examined this by analyzing a total of 121 neurons recorded from the TG mouse line (MEC-13-53D): 31 LEC-LVa, 45 LEC-LVb, 20 MEC-LVa, and 25 MEC-LVb neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canto and Witter, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamam et al., 2002</xref>), only a few LV neurons showed weak depolarizing afterpotentials (DAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with a higher incidence in MEC than in LEC. Among the 12Â examined electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>), differences were observed between the LVa and LVb neurons in most parameters except for resting potential, input resistance, and action potential (AP) threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâK</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Principal component analysis based on the 12Â parameters resulted in a clear separation between LVa and LVb neurons, and also in a moderate separation between LEC-LVb and MEC-LVb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Sag ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,Â F</xref>), time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and AP frequency after 200 pA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,Â H</xref>) were the three prominent parameters that separated LVa and LVb neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) with the sag ratio and AP frequency after 200 pA injection being smaller in LVa than LVb, and the opposite was true for the time constant. The difference in sag ratio may indicate that LVb neurons show more prominent subthreshold oscillations, which have been reported to occur in LV, although details on differences between the two sublayers have not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egorov et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmitz et al., 1998</xref>). The clearest features aiding in separating LEC-LVb and MEC-LVb were time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), AP frequency after 200 pA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,Â H</xref>), and fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,Â N</xref>). Neurons in MEC-LVb showed a smaller time constant, higher AP frequency, and smaller fast AHP than LEC-LVb neurons. Although LVb neurons in LEC and MEC thus differed in some of their electrophysiological characteristics, as well as morphologically (described above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâJ</xref>), it remains to be determined how these two features influence neuronal and network activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Local projections of LVb neurons in LEC and MEC are different</title><p>Subsequently, we examined the local entorhinal LVb circuits by injecting a tTA-dependent AAV carrying both the channelrhodopsin variant oChIEF and the yellow fluorescent protein (citrine, AAV2/1-TRE-Tight-oChIEF-citrine) into the deep layers of either LEC or MEC in mouse line MEC-13-53D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This enabled specific expression of the fused oChIEF-citrine protein in either LEC-LVb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâF</xref>) or MEC-LVb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3GâK</xref>). Not only the dendrites and the soma but also the axons of these LVb neurons were clearly labeled. As shown in the horizontal sections taken at different dorsoventral level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD,Â GâI</xref>), citrine-labeled axons were observed mainly within the EC, and only very sparse labeling was observed in other regions, including the angular bundle, a major efferent pathway of EC. This result supports our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>) showing that the main targets of the entorhinal LVb neurons are neurons in superficially positioned layers. Within EC, the distribution of labeled axons differed between LEC and MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Although in both LEC and MEC, labeled axons were densely present in LIII rather than in layers II and I, we report a striking difference between LEC and MEC in LVa, as is easily appreciated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,Â M</xref>: many labeled axons of LEC-LVb neurons were present in LVa, whereas in case of MEC-LVb, the number of labeled axons was very low in LVa. Such entorhinal labeling patterns were not affected by the unintended labeled neurons in the deep perirhinal cortex (PER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or postrhinal cortex (POR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) since these neurons hardly project to LEC and MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). It is also very unlikely that the sparse labeling patterns in MEC-LVa is a false negative result due to the selective targeting of a LVb subpopulation that modestly project to LVa for two reasons. First, the PCP4-labeling patterns referred to above also differ in LVa between MEC and LEC: PCP4-labeled fibers are hardly present in MEC LVa, whereas the axonal density is much higher in LEC LVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Second, a strikingly similar labeling pattern was observed in LVa of MEC following an anterograde tracer injection into MEC-LVb in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Note that we also confirmed this labeling pattern in rat MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), which is inÂ line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">KÃ¶hler, 1986</xref>). Based on these anatomical observations, we predicted that LVb neurons in both LEC and MEC innervate LIII neurons rather than LII neurons. Importantly, our findings further indicate that LVb-to-LVa connections, which mediate the hippocampal-cortical output circuit, are much more prominent in LEC than in MEC. To test these predicted connectivity patterns, we used optogenetic stimulation of the oChIEF-labeled axons together with patch-clamp recordings of neurons in the different layers of EC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Layer Vb (LVb) neurons project locally, and their projections differ between lateral entorhinal cortexÂ (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortexÂ (MEC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tetracycline-controlled transactivatorÂ (tTA)-expressing entorhinal LVb neurons were visualized by injecting a tTA-dependent adeno-associated virusÂ (AAV) expressing oChIEF-citrine into either LEC or MEC of MEC-13â53G.

In contrast, the axonal labeling was sparse in LII, and this distribution was reflected in the observed sparser connectivity. The percentage of pyramidal neurons in LII responding to optical stimulation was 61.1% (11 out of 18 cells), and this percentage was especially low in stellate cells (25.0%; 5 out of 20 cells). Even in the five stellate cells that responded to the light stimulation, evoked responses were relatively small as measured by the amplitude of the synaptic event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,Â E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C,Â E</xref>). In order to compare the differences of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes across different layers/cell types, the voltage responses of each neuron were normalized to the response of LIII cells recorded in the same slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The normalized EPSP amplitude of LII cells was significantly smaller than those of LIII pyramidal cells, and within LII cells, the normalized responses of stellate cells were significantly smaller than those of pyramidal cells (LII stellate cells, 0.24Â Â±Â 0.06; LII pyramidal cells, 0.63Â Â±Â 0.08; LIII pyramidal cells, 1.0Â Â±Â 0.03; p&lt;0.001 for LIIs vs. LIII and LIIp vs. LIII, p&lt;0.01 for LIIs vs. LIIp, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test). This difference in responses between LII and III neurons is likely due to the difference of the LVb fiber distribution within these layers. In contrast, the difference of responses between the two cell types in LII might be explained by the difference of the input resistance between these neurons, the input resistances of stellate cells being significantly lower than that of pyramidal cells (101.2Â Â±Â 5.9 vs. 278.9Â Â±Â 29.1 MÎ©; p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), although we cannot exclude a possible difference in total synaptic input between the stellate and pyramidal neurons in LII.

In contrast, the inputs to LII pyramidal cells showed latencies similar to those of LIII cells (3.2Â Â±Â 0.2 vs. 2.9Â Â±Â 0.1 ms). These differences in latencies indicate that projections from LVb to LIII and LII pyramidals may be monosynaptic and those to LII neurons may be disynaptic. Since we did not assess this pharmacologically, it is hard to conclude, particularly since in a parallel study in mouse LEC LII, using similar viral and laser stimulation protocols, we measured latencies ranging from 4.5 to 6.8 ms, which consistently were shown to be monosynaptic when tested using pharmacological measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilssen, 2019</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, and also in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>), LVa pyramidal cells have their basal dendrites mainly confined to LVa, which is the layer that MEC-LVb neurons avoid to project to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D,Â G</xref>).

Since functional differences along this axis have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steffenach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>), we examined whether the LVb-LVa connectivity differs along the dorsoventral axis by grouping the recorded LVa responses in three distinct dorsoventral levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The voltage responses of the more ventrally positioned LVa neurons were significantly higher than those measured more dorsally in MEC (p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test). Since the EPSP amplitudes of LIII neurons did not differ at different dorsoventral levels, it is unlikely that the observed response differences are caused by different levels of oChIEFÂ expression in LVb fibers along the dorsoventral axis. The observed difference may be caused by the difference in severing of apical dendrites at different dorsoventral levels since the axons of MEC-LVb neurons massively distribute in LIII and frequently reach into LI. This, however, does not seem to be the case since LVa cells in the dorsal MEC, irrespective of whether they have full (nÂ =Â 3) or severed dendrites (nÂ =Â 2), did not respond to light stimulation. Similarly, for the central dorsoventral level, four out of five neurons with intact apical dendrites in LIII did not respond. In the ventral MEC recordings, four out of five neurons with seemingly intact dendrites responded to the optical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Translaminar local connections of LEC-LVb neurons</title><p>We next examined the LVb local circuits in LEC with the similar method as applied in MEC (above). In LEC, LII can further be divided into two sublayers: a superficial layer IIa (LIIa) composed of fan cells and a deep layer IIb (LIIb) mainly composed of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). Fan cells mainly extend their apical dendrites in LI, where the density of LVb labeledÂ fibers is extremely low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This contrasts with LIIb, LIII, and LVa neurons, which distribute at least part of their dendrites in layers with a relatively high density of LVb axons. In line with these anatomical observations, only 26.9% of the fan cells (7 out of 26 neurons) responded to the light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,Â D</xref>). On the other hand, the response probabilities of LIIb, III, and Va were high, 76.9% (20 out of 26 cells), 100% (34 out of 34 cells), and 94.7% (18 out of 19 cells), respectively. The voltage responses of these neurons were also significantly larger than those of the LIIa neurons (LIIa neurons, 0.15Â Â±Â 0.03; LIIb neurons, 0.79Â Â±Â 0.15; LIII neurons, 1.0Â Â±Â 0.04; LVa neurons, 0.93Â Â±Â 0.10; p&lt;0.01 for LIIa vs. LIIb, p&lt;0.001 for LIIa vs. LIII and LIIa vs. LVa, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,Â F</xref>). In contrast to MEC-LII stellate cells, the input resistance of LIIa fan cells was significantly higher than that of LIIb and LIII neurons (LIIa neurons, 323.6Â Â±Â 16.1; LIIb neurons, 226.5Â Â±Â 17.2; LIII neurons, 194.3Â Â±Â 13.3 MÎ©; p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This indicates that the small responses of LIIa fan cells cannot be explained by the differences in input resistance among the superficial neurons and may simply be due to the small number of synaptic inputs to LIIa fan cells from LVb neurons. In contrast to MEC, LEC-LVa neurons showed large responses to light stimulation, which matched with the anatomically dense LVb fiber distribution in LEC-LVa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

In contrast to the similar responses of LII neurons between the two subregions, the normalized voltage responses of LEC-LVa neurons were significantly larger than those of MEC-LVa neurons (0.93Â Â±Â 0.10 vs. 0.47Â Â±Â 0.10, p&lt;0.05, two-tailed unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). On a final note, it is apparent that postsynaptic responses in LEC are larger than those in MEC. This difference in response amplitudes is most likely due to the differences in the number of oChIEF-expressing neurons since, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the proportion of tTA-expressing neurons is higher in LEC than in MEC. We deem it unlikely that these amplitude differences are caused by differences in biophysical properties since no such differences have been reported between matching cell types in LEC and MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>).

In contrast, other intrinsic circuits from LVb to LII/III were very similar in both entorhinal subdivisions, which preferentially targeted pyramidal cells rather than the stellate or fan cells in LII. These data indicate that the weak experimental support for a strong LVb-to-LVa projection in dorsal MEC is not due to technical issues. Rather, the data provide evidence that the intrinsic LV circuitry that supposedly underlies the canonical hippocampal-cortical output circuit in dorsal MEC is differently organized than in other parts of EC.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the different local circuits in lateral entorhinal cortexÂ (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortexÂ (MEC) used by layer VbÂ (LVb) neurons to transfer dorsal hippocampal output.</title><p>Local connectivity of LVb neurons in LEC (left, orange) and MEC (right, purple).

Such projections are sparse and weak in MEC. Neurons in LVa are the output neurons of EC, projecting to the neocortex and other telencephalic subcortical structures. In contrast, in both LEC and MEC we find projections from LVb that target pyramidal cells in LIII, including neurons projecting to CA1 and subiculum, and pyramidal cells in LII. Projections to stellate (MEC) and fan (LEC) cells, which project to the dentate gyrus and CA3, are sparse and weak.

Our key finding is that LEC and MEC are strikingly different in that excitatory connectivity from LVb to LVa is anatomically denser and electrophysiologically stronger in dorsal LEC than in dorsal MEC. In addition, we present new data that point to three major functionally relevant insights in the organization of the intrinsic translaminar entorhinal network originating from LVb neurons.</p><p>First, the present data indicate that LVb pyramidal neurons in LEC and MEC differ with respect to main morphological and electrophysiological characteristics. In contrast, LVa neurons in MEC and LEC are rather similar in these two aspects. Second, we show that projections from principal neurons in LVb in both entorhinal subdivisions preferentially contact pyramidal neurons in LIII and LII. LVb neurons have a sparser connectional relationship with principal neurons in LII that project to the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3/CA2 region, i.e., stellate and fan cells. Last, and most important, our data point to a new and challenging circuit difference between the two entorhinal subdivisions with respect to the inputs to LVa neurons, i.e., the output neurons of EC. Whereas in LEC, LVa neurons receive substantial input from LVb neurons, this projection is relatively weak in dorsal MEC. This difference in dorsal MEC, though unexpected in view of previous data including our own rabies tracing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>), has been recently corroborated in an in vitro study using paired-patch recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rozov et al., 2020</xref>), and our present corroborating tracing data are in line with previous tracing data in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">KÃ¶hler, 1986</xref>) and monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrobak and Amaral, 2007</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Layer Vb neurons in LEC and MEC are morphologically and electrophysiologically different</title><p>The use of layer-specific TG mice allowed us to differentiate neurons in LVa from those in LVb and to differentiate these layer-specific neuronÂ types between LEC and MEC.

We corroborate the reported morphological differences and add that the neurons also differ with respect to their electrophysiological properties. The most striking difference between MEC- and LEC-LVb neurons, however, is in the morphology of the apical dendrite. Neurons in MEC-LVb have an apical dendrite that heads straight to the pia, such that distal branches reach all the way up into LI, which is in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the apical dendrites of LEC-LVb neurons have a more complex branching pattern and they do not extend beyond LIII. This indicates that LEC-LVb neurons are unlikely to be targeted by inputs to LEC that selectively distribute to layers I and II, such as those carrying olfactory information from the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luskin and Price, 1983</xref>) as well as commissural projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). The LVb neurons in LEC are thus dissimilar to their counterparts in MEC, which are morphologically suited to receive such superficially terminating inputs, as has been shown for inputs from the parasubiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canto et al., 2012</xref>) and contralateral MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>). The here reported differences between LVb neurons, with MEC-LVb neurons showing a shorter time constant than LEC-LVb neurons, further indicate that MEC-LVb neurons have a shorter time window to integrate inputs compared to LEC-LVb neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canto and Witter, 2012b</xref>). The differences in AP frequency and half duration of AP may result in differences in the propensity of neurons to show graded persistent firing, which is prominent in MEC LV. Unfortunately, reports of persistent activity in MEC do not differentiate between neurons in LVa and LVb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egorov et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">FransÃ©n et al., 2006</xref>). However, up-down state activity originating in LIII particularly entrains neurons in LVb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beed et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that indeed LVb neurons might preferentially show persistent activity. Together, these differences will result in differences in information processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Layer Vb neurons preferentially target pyramidal neurons in layers III and II rather than layer II neurons that project to the DG</title><p>Both our anatomical and electrophysiological data show that projections from principal neurons in LVb in both entorhinal subdivisions preferentially target pyramidal neurons in LIII and LII. LVb neurons have a weaker relationship with the class of stellate and fan cells in MEC or LEC, respectively. This makes it likely that in both LEC and MEC hippocampal information preferentially interacts with neurons that are part of the LIII-to-CA1/Sub projection system rather than with the LII-to-DG/CA2-3 projecting neurons. Additional target neurons in layer II/III might be the pyramidal neurons that project contralaterally, which in LII belong to the calbindin (CB+) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steward and Scoville, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varga et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the substantial population of CB+ excitatory intrinsic projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohara et al., 2019</xref>). The present findings are in line with a previous study using wild-type mice, reporting that most of the inputs to MEC-LII stellate cell arise from superficial layers, whereas those of MEC-LII pyramidal cells arise from the deep layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beed et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The relatively sparse projection from MEC LVb neurons to LII stellate cells and the more massive projection to LII pyramidal cell was unexpected for two reasons. First, both the stellate and the CB+ population of layer II pyramidal neurons contain grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2014</xref>) and hippocampal excitatory inputs are required for the formation and translocation of grid patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnevie et al., 2013</xref>). Though our data do not exclude that LVb inputs can reach LII stellate cells indirectly through LIII- and LII-pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>), they do indicate that the two populations of grid cells, stellate vs. CB+ cells, might differ with respect to the strength of a main excitatory drive from the hippocampus.</p><p>Second, re-entry of hippocampal activity, i.e., the presence of recurrent circuits, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms for temporal storage of information in a neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edelman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iijima et al., 1996</xref>). Re-entry through LII-to-DG has been observed in in vivo recordings under anesthesia in rats, although this was examined with current source density analysis, which is not optimal to exclude multisynaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kloosterman et al., 2004</xref>). Such multisynaptic inputs could be mediated by pyramidal neurons in LIII and LII, both of which do contact layer II-to-DG projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>). Our current data strongly favor the circuit via LIII-CA1/subiculum in both entorhinal subdivisions to mediate a recurrent hippocampal-entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. The importance of this layer III recurrent network is corroborated by the observation that entorhinal LIII input to the hippocampus field CA1 plays a crucial role in associating temporally discontinuous events and retrieving remote memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suh et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The density and strength of the excitatory projection from LVb to LVa appear more prominent in dorsal LEC compared to dorsal MEC</title><p>Ever since the seminal observation in monkeys and rats of a hippocampal-cortical projection mediated by layer V of theÂ EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosel et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977</xref>), the canonical circuit underlying the hippocampal-cortical interplay, necessary for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BuzsÃ¡ki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</xref>), is believed to use EC LV neurons that receive hippocampal output and send projections to the neocortex. More recent studies in rats and mice indicated that neurons in LVb likely are the main recipients of this hippocampal output stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>) and that principal neurons in LVa form the main source of outputs to neocortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>). We showed that in LEC as well as ventrally in MEC the LVb-to-LVa connectivity is relatively well developed, in line with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the relatively sparse connection from LVb-to-LVa in dorsal MEC reported here indicates that at least in dorsal MEC the canonical role of EC LV neurons to mediate hippocampal information transfer to downstream neocortical areas might require a revision. Note that in the present study we focused on the presumed direct excitatory connectivity from LVb-to-LVa neurons using a newly derived TG mouse line. Although we above provided data to argue that we find it unlikely that the reported difference in connectivity between LEC and MEC might be caused by a different preference for a specific cell type in MEC vs. LEC, we cannot completely exclude that option. We further cannot exclude that the apparent differences between dorsal MEC, on the one hand, and ventral MEC and LEC, on the other hand, might be modulated through differences in local circuits, resulting in state changes in the LV network, such as reported in MEC depending on activity in LIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beed et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, differences in local inhibitory circuits or in the in vivo membrane potential and spike threshold of LVa neurons might be relevant, but in vivo these are unknown. However, our in vitro data do not support the latter possibility. The effectiveness of functional connections may further be influenced by incoming inputs to LVa and/or LVb, such as those from the claustrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>), medial septum, medial prefrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>). Adding to this complexity is a recent report that there is a direct projection from the intermediate/ventral hippocampus to neurons in MEC LVa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rozov et al., 2020</xref>). To assess these complex interactions, further in vivo studies are clearly required.</p><p>Finally, it is of interest that LVa, the entorhinal-output layer, is thicker in LEC than in MEC, which might be taken to strengthen our proposal that LEC might be the more relevant player in mediating the hippocampal-cortical interplay relevant for systems memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BuzsÃ¡ki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>). However, studies thatÂ have functionally linked the LVa-output projection with memory consolidation are based on data obtained in MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>). In our view, this more likely reflects the strong focus on functions of MEC circuits rather than LEC circuits ever since the discovery of the grid cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moser et al., 2017</xref>). With the discovery of LEC networks coding for event sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellmund et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montchal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>), this is likely to change. It is clear that our current suggestion that LEC might be more relevant than MEC in mediating the export of information from the dorsal hippocampus to the neocortex needs to be substantiated in vivo. The functional relevance of the similarities between networks in LEC and MEC mediating re-entry into the hippocampal formation with an apparent preference to target CA1 and subiculum isÂ likewise in need of in vivo studies in order to understand the functional consequences of the present data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>MEC13-53D</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankvoort et al., 2018</xref></td><td/><td>Not commercially available, but upon request we can send the mouseÂ line.

The animals were injected subcutaneously with buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg, Temgesic, Indivior), meloxicam (1 mg/kg, Metacam Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica), and bupivacaine hydrochloride (Marcain 1 mg/kg, Astra Zeneca), the latter at the incision site.

Acute slices were moved to the recording setup and visualized using infrared differential interference contrast optics aided by a Ã20/1.0 NA water immersion objective (Zeiss Axio Examiner D1, Carl Zeiss). Electrophysiological recordings were performed at 35Â°C and slices superfused with oxygenated recording ACSF containing 126 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,Â and 1.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. LVb in both LEC and MEC was identified through the presence of the densely packed small cells, and LVb neurons labeled with GFP were selected for recording. LVa neurons were selected for recording on the basis of their large soma size and the fact that they are sparsely distributed directly superficial to the smaller neurons of LVb. Gigaohm resistance seals were acquired for all cells before rupturing the membrane to enter whole-cell mode. Pipette capacitance compensation was performed prior to entering whole-cell configuration, and bridge balance adjustments were carried out at the start of current-clamp recordings. Data acquisition was performed by Patchmaster (Heka Elektronik) controlling an EPC 10 Quadro USB amplifier (Heka Elektronik). Acquired data were low-pass Bessel filtered at 15.34 kHz (for whole-cell current-clamp recording) or 4 kHz (for whole-cell voltage-clamp recording) and digitized at 10 kHz. No correction was made for the liquid junction potential (13 mV as measured experimentally).

Laser pulses had a beam diameter of 36 Î¼m and a duration of 1 ms. The tissue was illuminated with individual pulses at a rate of 1 Hz in a 4Â ÃÂ 5 grid pattern. The grid was positioned such as to allow for the light stimulation to cover across layer I to Va. Laser power was fixed to an intensity that evokes inward currents (EPSCs) but not action potentials. The voltage- or currentÂ traces from individual stimulation spots were averaged over 4â6 individual sweeps to create an average response for each point in the 4Â ÃÂ 5 grid. The stimulation point that showed the largest voltage response was used for further analysis. Deflections of the average voltage trace exceeding 10 SDs (Â±10 SDs) of the baseline were classified as synaptic responses. Postsynaptic potentials were calculated as the difference between the peak of the evoked synaptic potential and the baseline potential measured before stimulus onset. The latency of optical activation was defined as the time interval between light onset and the point where the voltage trace exceeded 10% amplitude. Data analysis was performed using MATLAB. Only slices with at least one successful synaptic response to photostimulation were included in the analysis. There were no outliers that were removed from the data.</p><p>All data presented in the figures are shown as mean Â± standard errors. Prism software was used for data analysis (GraphPad software), and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroniâs multiple comparison test was used to compare the electrophysiological properties and voltage responses between each cell types. To analyze mediolateral gradient in LVb-to-LVa connectivity of MEC, we used Pearson correlation coefficient. A principal component analysis based on the 12 electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>) was conducted in MATLAB.

Slices were permeabilized 5Â ÃÂ 15 min in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-Tx) and were immersed in a blocking solution containing PBS-TX and 10% Normal Goat Serum (NGS, Abcam: AB7481) for 3Â hr at room temperature. To visualize targeted entorhinal LVb neurons expressing either GFP or oChIEF-citrine, slices were incubated with a primary antibody, chicken anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam, #ab13970), diluted in the blocking solution for 4 days at 4Â°C. Note that citrine is derived from <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Griesbeck et al., 2001</xref>), and thus, the signal can be amplified with GFP antibodies. After this, the sections were washed 5Â ÃÂ 15 min in PBS-Tx at room temperature and incubated in a secondary antibody, goat anti-chicken (1:400, Alexa Fluor 488, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A11039), overnight at room temperature. This secondary antibody incubation was accompanied with the fluorescent conjugated streptavidin (1:600, Alexa Fluor 546, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #S11225) and Neurotrace 640/660 deep-red fluorescent Nissl stain (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #N21483) in order to stain cells filled with biocytin and to identify the cytoarchitecture. Slices were rinsed in PBS-TX (3Â ÃÂ 10 min) and dehydrated by increasing ethanol concentrations (30, 50, 70, 90, 100, andÂ 100%, 10 min each).

This amplification of GFP/citrineÂ signal enabled us to examine the axonal distribution of the infected LVb neurons. Due to the strong neurites labeling, however, it became difficult to visualize cell bodies of the targeted neurons. For such reasons, we occasionally used the native fluorophore (GFP/citrine) to visualize the cell bodies, while using immunolabeling (anti-GFP/citrine [anti-GFP]) to identify the neurites.</p><p>To identify the LVb border and characterize the TG mouse line, LVb neurons were visualized with primary (1:300, rabbit anti-PCP4, Sigma Aldrich #HPA005792; 1:3000, rat anti-Ctip, Abcam #ab18465) and secondary antibodies (1:400, Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rat IgG, Thermo Fisher Scientific # A21094; 1:400, Alexa Fluor-546 goat anti-rabbit IgG; 1:400, Alexa Fluor 635 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Thermo Fisher Scientific # A31576).

Finally, sections were rinsed 3Â ÃÂ 10 min in PBS. For Ctip2Â staining, sections were heated to 80Â°C for 15 min in 10 mM sodium citrate (SC, pH 8.5). After cooling to room temperature, the sections were permeabilized by washing them three times in SC buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (SC-Tx) and subsequently pre-incubated in a blocking solution containing SC-Tx and 3% BSA for 1Â hr at room temperature.

It shows a well-established typical laminar structure comprising two superficial and two deep cell layers, separated by a cell-free layer, or lamina dissecans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Witter, 2011</xref>). Here we divide EC into LEC and MEC, mainly defined based on cytoarchitectural differences in LV, LIII, and LII. MEC has more columnar arrangement of LVb neurons compared to LEC. Layer III in MEC shows a sharp border with the lamina dissecans and has a very homogeneous appearance, whereas in LEC the border is less clear and the cellular organization is much more irregular. Finally, LEC can be identified by the presence of a superficial LII (LIIa) with densely packed neurons that tend to cluster into islands.</p><p>The borders of the superficial layers (IâIII) and the thin acellular layer IV (lamina dissecans) were delineated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Witter, 2011</xref>). Layers Va and Vb were differentiated based on cell size, cell density, cell marker, and the projection patterns. LVb neurons are densely packed small cells that are PCP4-positive, whereas LVa is made up of sparsely distributed large cells, which project to various cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2015</xref>). The border between layer Vb and VI is more difficult to identify since PCP4Â staining also labels LVI neurons. We determined this border based on the cell density that decreases in LVI and the overall prominent orientation of neurons parallel to the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Witter, 2011</xref>). In case of MEC, the border can also be identified since the typical columnar organization of LVb stops upon entering LVI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) or MATLAB (MathWorks).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew F Nolan (Reviewer #2); Desdemona Fricker (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study addresses a fundamentally important question regarding the connectivity of LVb and LVa in the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex. The authors suggest that LVb to LVa connection exists in the LEC but not in the MEC. This finding would have important implications on studies investigating circuits functions between the hippocampus and the EC. All three reviewers found the central question important and the data novel. However, there are several technical issues that limit the robustness of the authors claim.</p><p>1. While the transgenic animal used in these experiments in elegant and novel, it only labels a subpopulation of the neurons. There is a possibility of selective labelling of neurons with distinct connectivity patterns. The authors would need to show that their approach is not leading to false negative results due to the selective visualization of those neurons that project more modestly to the LVa.</p><p>2. The specificity of the injection to the LEC/MEC should be better documented and potential spread to the perirhinal or postrhinal cortex carefully excluded.</p><p>3. The findings are presented as LVb to LVa connection did not exist at all in the MEC, however the data shows that the connection is there but it is significantly less dense than in the LEC. Given the graded finding, if the authors aim to show their central claim regarding the lack of mediation of hippocampo-cortical outputs by this connection in the MEC, this would require the addition of functional studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The current study by Ohara et al. describes differences in the connectivity patterns between LVb to LVa. The study builds on the authors previous study (Ohara et al. 2018) where they showed the intrinsic connectivity of LVb neurons in the MEC and LEC. The focus of the current study is the difference the authors observed in the strengths of connectivity between LVb and LVa in the MEC and LEC. The authors suggest that the in MEC Vb neurons do not provide substantial direct unput to LVa neurons. The manuscript emphasizes the functional importance of difference as the authors suggest that &quot;â¦â¦hippocampal -cortex output circuit is present only in LEC, suggesting that episodic systems consolidation predominantly uses LEC-derived information and not allocentric spatial information from MEC.&quot;</p><p>The study uses a newly developed mouse line to investigate connectivity differences, this is a nice technical approach and the experimental data is of high quality. While the data is solid, the authors tend to overinterpret their findings from the functional point of view. While the observed difference is quite interesting, it is unclear what the impact is on information flow in the MEC and LEC and to which degree they differ functionally. The authors assume major differences and their work is framed based on these expected differences, but the manuscript does not provide data that would demonstrate functionally distinct features.</p><p>1. Throughout the text the authors treat their findings as it was 'all-or-none' i.e the LEC has a direct connection between LVb and LVa while the MEC does not. This does not seem to be the case based on their data, the data shows that connectivity in the MEC is less robust but it is definitely there. The difference seems to be quantitative and not qualitative.</p><p>2. Due to this problem, the authors seem to be overinterpreting their data by suggesting that the information flow must be significantly different conceptually in the LEC and the MEC and this would have important implications for memory consolidation. It is impossible to draw these conclusions based on the data presented, as there are no experiments investigating the functional, network level consequences of these connectivity differences.</p><p>3. The electrophysiology experiments provide information about the basic parameters of the investigated cells, but these lack a physiological context that would allow the authors to evaluate the consequences of these differences on information flow and/or processing in the MEC and the LEC.</p><p>4. The study is using a novel transgenic mouse line to differentiate between LVb and LVa neurons, while this is definitely a strength of the study, this strategy allows the authors to visualize ~50% of LEC and ~30% MEC neurons. Since the authors aim to prove a negative (MEC does not have direct connection) the fact that ~70% of the neurons are not labelled could be problematic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study investigates key components of the entorhinal circuits through which signals from hippocampus are relayed to the neocortex. The question addressed is important but the stated claim that layer 5b (L5b) to layer 5a (L5a) connections mediate hippocampal-cortical outputs in LEC but not MEC appears to be an over-interpretation of the data. First, the experiments do not test hippocampal to L5a connections, but instead look at L5b to L5a connections. Second, the data provide evidence that there are L5b to L5a projections in LEC and MEC, which contradictions the claim made in the title. These projections do appear denser in LEC under the experimental conditions used, but possible technical explanations for the difference are not carefully addressed. If these technical concerns were addressed, and the conclusions modified appropriately, then I think this study could be very important for the field and would complement well recent work from several labs that collectively suggests that information processing in deep layers of MEC is more complex than has been appreciated (e.g. SÃ¼rmeli et al. 2015, Ohara et al. 2018, Wozny et al. 2018, Rozov et al. 2020).</p><p>1. An impressive component of the study is the introduction of a new mouse line that labels neurons in layer 5b of MEC and LEC. However, in each area the line appears to label only a subset (30-50%) of the principle cell population. It's unclear whether the unlabelled neurons have similar connectivity to the labelled neurons. If the unlabelled neurons are a distinct sub-population then it's difficult to see how the experiments presented could support the conclusion that L5b does not project to L5a; perhaps there is a projection mediated by the unlabelled neurons? I don't think the authors need include experiments to investigate the unlabelled population, but given that the labelling is incomplete they should be more cautious about generalising from data obtained with the line.</p><p>2. For experiments using the AAV conditionally expressing oChIEF-citrine, the extent to which the injections are specific to LEC/MEC is unclear. This is a particular concern for injections into LEC where the possibility that perirhinal or postrhinal cortex are also labelled needs to be carefully considered. For example, in Figure 3D it appears the virus has spread to perirhinal cortex. If this is the case then axonal projections/responses could originate there rather than from L5b of LEC. I suggest to exclude any experiments were there is any suggestion of expression outside LEC/MEC or where this cannot be ruled out through verification of the labelling. Alternatively, one might include control experiments in which the AAV is targeted to perirhinal and postrhinal cortex. Similar concerns should be addressed for injections that target the MEC to rule out spread to the pre/parasubiculum.</p><p>3. It appears likely from the biocytin fills shown that the apical dendrites of some of the recorded L5a neurons have been cut (e.g. Figure 4A, Figure 4-Supplement 1D, neuron v). Where the apical dendrite is clearly intact and undamaged synaptic responses to activation of L5b neurons are quite clear (e.g. Figure 4-Supplement 1D, neuron x). Given that axons of L5b cells branch extensively in L3, it is possible that any synapses they make with L5a neurons would be on their apical dendrites within L3. It therefore seems important to restrict the analysis only to L5a neurons with intact apical dendrites; a reasonable criteria would be that the dendrite extends through L3 at a reasonable distance (&gt; 30 Î¼m?) below the surface of the slice.</p><p>4. Throughout the manuscript the data is over-interpreted. Here are some examples:</p><p>â The title over-extrapolates from the results and should be changed. A more accurate title would be along the lines of &quot;Evidence that L5b to L5a connections are more effective in lateral compared to medial entorhinal cortex&quot;.</p><p>â &quot;the conclusion that the dorsal parts of MEC lacks the canonical hippocampal-cortical output system&quot; seems over-stated given the evidence (see comments above).</p><p>â Discussion, para 1, &quot;Our key finding is that LEC and MEC are strikingly different with respect to the hippocampal-cortical pathway mediated by LV neurons, in that we obtained electrophysiological evidence for the presence of this postulated crucial circuit in LEC, but not in MEC&quot;. This is misleading as there is also evidence for L5b to L5a connections in MEC, although this projection may be relatively weak. Recent work by Rozov et al. demonstrating a projection from intermediate hippocampus to L5a provides good evidence for an alternative model in which MEC does relay hippocampal outputs. This needs to be considered.</p><p>5. What proportion of responses are mono-synaptic? How was this tested?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The present manuscript focuses on a subpopulations of layer 5 neurons in medial and lateral entorhinal cortex and its functional connections to target neurons in layers 2, 3 and 5. The authors show a difference in LVb-to-LVa connectivity between MEC and LEC. The results suggest that the entorhinal output circuit via LVb-to-LVa is present primarily in LEC.</p><p>The work relies on and is made possible by a newly described transgenic mouse (TG) where LVb neurons can be labeled and stimulated with light. The authors showed that these neurons are largely co-labeled with PCP4, a marker for LVb. They compared the apical dendritic extent from TG labeled cells (LVb) and Nac retrogradely labeled cells (LVa) in medial and lateral EC. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of LVa and LVb neurons were measured and used for PCA showing segregation according to sublayer and region. The axonal distribution and translaminar local connections of LVb neurons form the TG mice were then examined. Cells were recorded in vitroin vitro and filled with biocytin, both from MEC and LEC, with multiple cells in a same slice, documented with exquisite high quality images. The study of the LVb translaminar connectivity via a direct comparison of postsynaptic responses in neurons in different layers in a same slice is gold standard for this type of functional connectivity analysis. There is also an investigation of mixed excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic response sequences, and evidence for a dorso-ventral gradient in LVb-to-LVa connectivity in MEC is given.</p><p>The study combines TG mice, immunolabeling, retrograde labeling, morphological analysis and in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetic photo-stimulation. While it builds on already published work by the same group and others, by comparing the local target neurons of LVb in MEC and in LEC, the manuscript provides a unique contribution to the literature on the laminar circuit organization in the Entorhinal Cortex. In view of the central position of this area in the hippocampal memory systems of the rodent brain, these results are of interest to a broader neuroscience audience. It is also a nice example of a bottom-up approach, where data on the entorhinal translaminar connectivity may influence and constrain theories of hippocampal-cortical processing.</p><p>1. Almost all TG labelled neurons are positive for PCP4 but not so vice versa, only 45.9 and 30.P% of PCP4 + neurons in LEC and MEC are labeled in the TG mouse (page 5) leaving open the possibility that the TG mous labels a (specific?) subset of LVb neurons. Did you test whether TG labeled LVb cells co-localize with Ctip2 ?</p><p>2. The direct comparison of translaminar connectivity of LVb neurons is very convincing. But if your main conclusion (title) concerns the difference of LVb-to-LVa connectivity between MEC and LEC, it would have been more appropriate to test that in a same slice. I think this point should not stand in the way of publication, but while the data strongly support conclusions on the laminar differences of LVb connectivity, the evidence for differences in LVb-to-LVa connectivity between MEC and LEC is a bit weaker and more indirect.</p><p>3. Postsynaptic responses (in mV) in LEC are about twice as high in amplitude as in MEC (Figure 4E vs Figure 5E), across all layers. Please discuss possible reasons, and possible impact on the circuit function. Is the probability to initiate action potentials higher in LEC ?</p><p>4. Give the onset latencies of postsynaptic excitatory potentials induced by LVb photostimulation. Are latencies monosynaptic? Or also polysynaptic? Ideally this could be tested by applying a cocktail of TTX-4-AP.</p><p>5. Figure 4 S3, Figure 5 S2. Analysis of inhibition. What is the cut-off criterium to say inhibition is present or not? It might be more appropriate to give the I/E ratio.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Local projections of layer Vb-to-Va are more effective in lateral than in medial entorhinal cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, I still think that the functional aspect and implications are overstated in the revised manuscript. The physiological data demonstrate the connectivity's strengths (and hence supports the anatomy data), but this alone won't be sufficient to comment on the functional effectiveness of the connections, which would also depend on other factors that are not investigated here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study presents data about the connectivity from subpopulations of neurons in layer 5b of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices to neurons in more superficial layers.

There is a risk here that this will have an impact, but beyond what the data actually establish and possibly in a way that will hinder rather than advance the field. In my opinion, the more specific claim, that differences in L5b -&gt; L5a connectivity suggest different processing mechanisms with as yet unknown functional impact would be sufficiently important to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A remaining technical weakness is that the possibility of cut dendrites explaining differences in synaptic responses is not addressed sufficiently convincingly.</p><p>It should be possible to address these issues without additional experimentation.</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript are the combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach that leverages a novel mouse line, and the likely importance of the observations to investigation of circuit mechanism for spatial cognition and memory.</p><p>While the manuscript is greatly improved there are remaining weaknesses.</p><p>1. While the over-interpretation of the data is reduced compared to the previous version of the manuscript, this still substantially compromises the study. The manuscript continues to make claims about functional effectiveness of connections that are not sufficiently supported by the data. A more specific claim that glutamateric connections from L5b to L5a appear denser in MEC than LEC, and that this suggests different operating principles for computation in these two regions, would be well justified by the data, would be of wide interest, would do much to stimulate future work and would not lead to erroneous interpretations down the line. Specific statements that over-interpret the data should be amended.</p><p>2. The Discussion could do a much better job of considering caveats in the interpretation of the data. In particular, relatively greater excitatory connectivity in a brain slice does not necessarily imply more effective functional connectivity. Alternative scenarios to consider could include the following. 1. It's unclear from the present data whether the relative difference in excitatory input from L5b to L5a is matched by a difference in feedforward or feedback inhibition. If it is then the pathways may turn out to be similarly effective. Testing this convincingly will require in vivo experiments. 2. Either pathway could be subject to neuromodulation in vivo. It's conceivable this could substantially modify or even reverse their apparent relative effectiveness. 3. The membrane potential and spike threshold of L5a neurons in vivo is unknown. If the membrane potential of L5a neurons in MEC is more depolarized in vivo than in LEC, then the L5b to L5a pathway could turn out to be more effective. The discussion should also consider the fact that the mouse line used labels only a sub-set of the neurons in L5b of LEC and MEC. The possibility that connectivity from other L5b neurons may differ should be clearly noted.</p><p>3. The possibility that differences in cut dendrites explain the differences in synaptic responses between LEC and MEC, and within the MEC, is still not ruled out. The revised manuscript now gives an indication of the number of dendritic branches in MEC that are &gt; 150 Î¼m. This is insufficient as layer 3 can be on the order of 300 Î¼m or more in width between its superficial and deep borders, while the axons from L5b extend well into L2. To make the claims convincing it's important that adequate quantification of remaining apical dendritic length (and if possible diameter/surface areas) in LEC and at each dorsoventral level of MEC is included (for both cut and not-cut neurons).</p><p>4. I couldn't find anywhere whether any connections were tested with glutamate receptor antagonists to confirm they are synaptic and glutamatergic. It's unlikely but not impossible that some short latency responses reflect low level expression of ChR2 in non-5b neurons (in my experience this might not be detectable from fluorescence). It would be good to know this can be ruled out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I have read the authors' responses and I feel that they are adequate.

In the initial version, we tried to address this concern in the discussion, by mentioning that traditional anterograde tracing methods result in similar patterns. We indeed did not provide additional experimental data to substantiate that this is not a concern. We have now added experimental data on the sparsity of projections from the general population of neurons in LVb of MEC to LVa, in both rats and mice (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1. D, E). We further maintained referencing existing literature in the rat (KÃ¶hler, 1986) and in the present version added a reference to a study in the monkey (Chrobak and Amaral, 2007), both substantiating the apparent differences between LEC and MEC regarding Vb to Va projections in wildtype animals using anterograde tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In the original manuscript, we already included some functional comments related to main differences in physiological properties of neuron types in layers II and III. In the revised manuscript, we added some comments concerning potential functional consequences of the reported differences in neurons in LVa and LVb and between LVb neurons in LEC versus MEC. However, since firing patterns of neurons result from the complex interactions of morphological structure, the types and somatodendritic distribution of voltage-gated channels and many other factors, we refrain from detailed functional speculations since these are not related to the core message we aim to convey with this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We included similar experimental data for POR (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C). Regarding spread of AAV from MEC into pre/parasubiculum, we feel that this is not an issue, since we report a diminished projection to LVa, not an added component. Moreover, it is very well established that pre/parasubiculum preferentially if not exclusively project to superficial layers. However, the reviewer is correct that these inputs might target neurons in LVa, as we have shown in the rat (Canto et al., 2012). So, this might have resulted in an overestimation of the inputs to LVa neurons, but even so, the input synaptic strength and proportion of responsive neurons never reaches the level as seen in LVa of LEC. Note that we did stimulate the slices throughout all layers, and we have emphasized this in the method section of the paper (see also our reply to comment 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It appears likely from the biocytin fills shown that the apical dendrites of some of the recorded L5a neurons have been cut (e.g. Figure 4A, Figure 4-Supplement 1D, neuron v). Where the apical dendrite is clearly intact and undamaged synaptic responses to activation of L5b neurons are quite clear (e.g. Figure 4-Supplement 1D, neuron x). Given that axons of L5b cells branch extensively in L3, it is possible that any synapses they make with L5a neurons would be on their apical dendrites within L3. It therefore seems important to restrict the analysis only to L5a neurons with intact apical dendrites; a reasonable criteria would be that the dendrite extends through L3 at a reasonable distance (&gt; 30 Î¼m?) below the surface of the slice.</p></disp-quote><p>As correctly pointed out by the reviewer, all L5a neurons which respond to the light stimulation indeed have intact apical dendrites in L3. However, we also did observe many neurons with apical dendrites (&gt; 150 Î¼m in L3) which do not respond in dorsal- (N=3) and middle-level slices (N=6). These data indicate that the differences of LVb-to-LVa connectivity along the dorso-ventral axis were not due to the severing of apical dendrites. We added the information of severed apical dendrites of L5b neurons in âFigure 4âfigure supplement 2â. Note that in all experiments we systematically optically stimulate in all layers of the slice allowing us to assess the possible impact of axons in layers III and II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This is misleading as there is also evidence for L5b to L5a connections in MEC, although this projection may be relatively weak. Recent work by Rozov et al. demonstrating a projection from intermediate hippocampus to L5a provides good evidence for an alternative model in which MEC does relay hippocampal outputs. This needs to be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this paper, but please note that this paper was published after we submitted the paper to <italic>eLife</italic>.

What proportion of responses are mono-synaptic? How was this tested?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, but we did not test this directly, using standard pharmacological approaches. We have added information on latency of the measured responses in Figures 4 and 5 (see also the request of Reviewer 3). In a series of experiments carried out in parallel in mouse LEC LII, using similar viral and laser stimulation protocols, we measured latencies ranging from 4.5 â 6.8 msec, which consistently were shown to be monosynaptic when tested using pharmacological measures (applying TTX and 4-AP to the bath; E.S. Nilssen, 2019 Synaptic connectivity of principal cells in layer II of the lateral entorhinal cortex. PhD Thesis NTNU, ISSN 1503-8181). Based on the present latency data, we find it likely that most recorded responses are monosynaptic, though we cannot exclude that some of the connections, particularly the ones from MEC LVb to LVa neurons and to LII stellate cells include or represent disynaptic responses. We have inserted a short note on this in the manuscript. When we planned these experiments, we did not deem pharmacological checks on monosynaptic contacts all that relevant; even if there are disynaptic or polysynaptic responses, the fact that the overall number of responding cells and the synaptic strengths is lower in LVa in dorsal MEC compared to ventral MEC and LEC stands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] 1.

The direct comparison of translaminar connectivity of LVb neurons is very convincing. But if your main conclusion (title) concerns the difference of LVb-to-LVa connectivity between MEC and LEC, it would have been more appropriate to test that in a same slice. I think this point should not stand in the way of publication, but while the data strongly support conclusions on the laminar differences of LVb connectivity, the evidence for differences in LVb-to-LVa connectivity between MEC and LEC is a bit weaker and more indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not entirely sure what the reviewer is getting at. If the point is that the difference between LEC and MEC is not tested in the same slice, that is a correct statement, but to do that is technically unrealistic. In line to our replies to the previous reviewers, the main point is that in dorsal MEC the projections from LVb to LVa are very different from what we observe in LEC and ventral MEC.</p><p>However, to get dorsal MEC and LEC in the same slice is impossible and although dorsal and ventral MEC might be captured in one sagittal section, one need to inject AAV at multiple dorsoventral levels to do such recordings. The risk of having too much spread of virus in such cases would be too high and we do not find it ethically acceptable to use many animals in the hope of getting one (at best) successful animal. The number of animals used and the number of neurons we recorded from provide a reliable statistical sample to conclude that there are differences in the local circuits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Postsynaptic responses (in mV) in LEC are about twice as high in amplitude as in MEC (Figure 4E vs Figure 5E), across all layers. Please discuss possible reasons, and possible impact on the circuit function.

We donât have any data that indicate that the probability to initiate action potentials higher in LEC than in MEC and this is in line with data in two published studies in the rat where elementary biophysical properties were systematically compared between neurons in all layers of LEC and MEC in postnatal rats (Canto et al. 2012a and b) As discussed at some length in Canto and Witter (2012a) most studies carried out in adult rodents are in line with these observations. We deem it most likely that the differences in the generated postsynpatic amplitudes are due to the differences in the number of oChiEF-expressing neurons and thus the resulting differenced in labeled axonal densities. As shown in Figure 1E, the proportion of tTA-expressing neurons is higher in LEC than in MEC. We have inserted a comment along these lines in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We fully agree with the reviewer that we do not provide experimental data allowing us to conclude on the functional effectiveness of the connections.

We are aware of the fact that many other factors will impact these functional consequences in vivo and have elaborated on that a bit more in the discussion (pages 18/19, lines 460-472 of the revised manuscript).

A more specific claim that glutamateric connections from L5b to L5a appear denser in MEC than LEC, and that this suggests different operating principles for computation in these two regions, would be well justified by the data, would be of wide interest, would do much to stimulate future work and would not lead to erroneous interpretations down the line. Specific statements that over-interpret the data should be amended.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive remark, and we have reformulated our main conclusions and suggestions throughout accordingly and tried to clearly differentiate between conclusions and suggestions. The relevant changes include sentences in the abstract, the introduction and the discussion mainly. They can be easily spotted in the version in which we indicated the main changes we made in the revised version (see also our comment to point two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Discussion could do a much better job of considering caveats in the interpretation of the data. In particular, relatively greater excitatory connectivity in a brain slice does not necessarily imply more effective functional connectivity. Alternative scenarios to consider could include the following. 1. It's unclear from the present data whether the relative difference in excitatory input from L5b to L5a is matched by a difference in feedforward or feedback inhibition. If it is then the pathways may turn out to be similarly effective. Testing this convincingly will require in vivo experiments. 2. Either pathway could be subject to neuromodulation in vivo. It's conceivable this could substantially modify or even reverse their apparent relative effectiveness. 3. The membrane potential and spike threshold of L5a neurons in vivo is unknown. If the membrane potential of L5a neurons in MEC is more depolarized in vivo than in LEC, then the L5b to L5a pathway could turn out to be more effective. The discussion should also consider the fact that the mouse line used labels only a sub-set of the neurons in L5b of LEC and MEC. The possibility that connectivity from other L5b neurons may differ should be clearly noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestions of the reviewer and we fully agree that all the suggested, and even more scenarios might be relevant. To cover them all would go far beyond the scope of the paper or would simply result in a listing of possibilities with references. Of course, we cannot exclude any of the ones suggested, though some are more plausible than others and that is true for the many additional alternatives one could think of. We do however feel that the observed differences in connectivity, as nicely formulated by the reviewer under point 1 allow for some speculative comments of why this might be relevant. We have rephrased the relevant parts of the discussion accordingly.</p><p>The reviewer is apparently not satisfied with the additional supplementary data and the arguments we provided to address the potential risk of selectivity in the population of neurons in the particular TG animal. Of course, we cannot exclude that option but in the previous revision we provided arguments to address this. This was embedded in the result section and we feel that it would interrupt the flow of the manuscript to move that into the discussion. Our arguments are on page 8, lines 202-211. We have reiterated this now in the discussion in two sentences on page 18, lines 457460 which reads: âNote that in the present study we focussed on the presumed direct excitatory connectivity from LVb-to-LVa neurons using a newly derived TG mouse line. Although we above provided data to argue that we find it unlikely that the reported difference in connectivity between LEC and MEC might be caused by a different preference for a certain cell type in MEC versus LEC, we cannot completely exclude that option.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The possibility that differences in cut dendrites explain the differences in synaptic responses between LEC and MEC, and within the MEC, is still not ruled out. The revised manuscript now gives an indication of the number of dendritic branches in MEC that are &gt; 150 Î¼m. This is insufficient as layer 3 can be on the order of 300 Î¼m or more in width between its superficial and deep borders, while the axons from L5b extend well into L2. To make the claims convincing it's important that adequate quantification of remaining apical dendritic length (and if possible diameter/surface areas) in LEC and at each dorsoventral level of MEC is included (for both cut and not-cut neurons).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided supplementary data (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D) providing detailed information on how far dendrites extend towards superficial layers for each neuron and correlated that parameter with the evoked postsynaptic responses. The data indicate that it is unlikely that the severing of the apical dendrites caused the differences in the response between MEC- and LEC-LVa neurons. Our material does not allow to provide information of dendritic dimensions other than distribution across layers, so we have therefor not included diameter and surface area information.</p><p>We further did not include potential differences in receptor/channel distributions, all of which might result in differences not only between neurons with or without cut dendrites, but also between MEC and LEC neurons with intact dendrites. We thus suggest, and agree with the reviewer, that a parsimonious explanation is the striking difference in apparent anatomical density of the projections from LVb to LVa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I couldn't find anywhere whether any connections were tested with glutamate receptor antagonists to confirm they are synaptic and glutamatergic. It's unlikely but not impossible that some short latency responses reflect low level expression of ChR2 in non-5b neurons (in my experience this might not be detectable from fluorescence). It would be good to know this can be ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use any pharmacological approaches, as suggested by the reviewer, to test whether contacts are synaptic and glutamatergic. Note that we analyzed the transgenic line extensively and we report that the line almost exclusively labels non-GABAergic neurons: âusing a GAD67 transgenic line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), we showed that the percentage of double-labelled (PCP4+, GAD67+) neurons among total GAD67-positive neurons is very low in both LEC and MEC (4.3% and 2.3% respectively, Figure 1âfigure supplement 2)â.</p><p>Therefore, we assume that most of the TG-targeted neurons are excitatory, likely glutamatergic. This is certainly something we will explore in the future as we plan to do an âin vivoâ study using the same mouse line.</p><p>We cannot exclude that a number of tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA, Tet-Off) neurons expressed too weakly to be reported in the tTA-dependent reporter mouse which expresses mCherry and that such non-reported neurons might express ChR2 at a level that would impact our results, particularly through representing an unknown class of non-glutamatergic neurons, but we deem that rather unlikely. Since we were looking for overall connectivity differences or similarities between LEC and MEC, and in view of the striking differences between responses in LVa in dorsal LEC versus dorsal MEC we did not explore either of these possibilities further.</p></body></sub-article></article>
