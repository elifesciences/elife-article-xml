often relies on asymmetric fate determination governed by niche signals and/or cell-intrinsic factors but how these regulatory mechanisms cooperate to promote asymmetric fate decision remains poorly understood. In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, asymmetric Notch (N) signaling inhibits intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal by promoting ISC differentiation into enteroblast (EB). We have previously shown that epithelium-derived Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) promotes ISC self-renewal by antagonizing N pathway activity (Tian and Jiang, 2014). Here, we show that loss of BMP signaling results in ectopic N pathway activity even when the N ligand Delta (Dl) is depleted, and that the N inhibitor Numb acts in parallel with BMP signaling to ensure a robust ISC self-renewal program. Although Numb is asymmetrically segregated in about 80% of dividing ISCs, its activity is largely dispensable for ISC fate determination under normal homeostasis. However, Numb becomes crucial for ISC self-renewal when BMP signaling is compromised. Whereas neither Mad RNA interference nor its hypomorphic mutation led to ISC loss, inactivation of Numb in these backgrounds resulted in stem cell loss due to precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation. Furthermore, we find that <italic>numb</italic> mutations resulted in stem cell loss during midgut regeneration in response to epithelial damage that causes fluctuation in BMP pathway activity, suggesting that the asymmetrical segregation of Numb into the future ISC may provide a fail-save mechanism for ISC self-renewal by offsetting BMP pathway fluctuation, which is important for ISC maintenance in regenerative guts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Numb</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>ISC</kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The asymmetrically segregated Notch pathway inhibitor Numb is essential for intestinal stem cell self-renewal in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts when the stem cell niche signaling is compromised.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult organs such as intestine rely on resident stem cells to replenish damaged tissues during homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut, an equivalent of mammalian small intestine, has emerged as a powerful system to study stem cell biology in adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casali and Batlle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in adult midguts are localized at the basal side of the gut epithelium where they can undergo asymmetric cell division to produce renewed ISCs and enteroblasts (EBs) that differentiate into enterocytes (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). At low frequency, an ISC daughter is fated to preEE/EEP that differentiates into two enteroendocrine (EE) cells after another round of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biteau and Jasper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beehler-Evans and Micchelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng and Hou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). About 20% ISCs undergo symmetric cell division to produce two ISCs or two EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). The decision between ISC self-renewal and differentiation into EB lineage is controlled by Notch (N) signaling whereby N activation drives ISC differentiation into EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>). The asymmetric N signaling between ISC and EB is influenced by Par/integrins-directed asymmetric cell division and differential BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). EC-produced BMP ligands containing Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb) heterodimers are secreted basally and concentrated on the basement membrane aligning the basal side of the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). After asymmetric cell division of ISCs, basally localized daughter cells transduce higher levels of BMP signaling activity than the apically localized daughter cells and the differential BMP signaling promotes ISC self-renewal by antagonizing N pathway activity through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian and Jiang, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The N pathway inhibitor Numb plays a decisive role in asymmetric cell fate determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral and central nervous systems whereby Numb segregates asymmetrically into one daughter during division of a neuronal precursor cell and confers distinct fates to the two daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uemura et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rhyu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spana et al., 1995</xref>). The mammalian homologs of Numb are also critical for asymmetric fate determination during neurogenesis and myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conboy and Rando, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petersen et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies showed that, during asymmetric division of an ISC in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult midgut, Numb was preferentially segregated into the basally localized daughter that becomes future ISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>); however, many <italic>numb</italic> mutant clones retained ISC after many rounds of cell division although they failed to produce EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>). Given the well-established role of Numb in blocking N pathway activity and the observation that Numb is asymmetrically segregated into the future ISC, it is surprising and puzzling that loss of Numb does not lead to ectopic N pathway activation that drives ISC-to-EB differentiation. We speculate that BMP signaling may play a more dominant role in ISC self-renewal than Numb and that the BMP signaling gradient could generate differential N signaling between the apical and basal pair of ISC daughters to generate ISC/EB binary fates even when Numb is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian and Jiang, 2017</xref>). Accordingly, attenuating BMP signaling may unmask the role of Numb in ISC self-renewal.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) and genetic mutations to inactivate Numb in otherwise wild-type background or in midguts defective in BMP signaling due to RNAi or genetic mutation of <italic>mothers against decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>mad</italic>), which encodes a signal transducer in BMP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sekelsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Newfeld et al., 1997</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>), neither <italic>mad</italic> RNAi nor its hypomorphic mutation led to ISC loss. However, inactivation of Numb in these backgrounds resulted in stem cell loss due to precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation. By carefully examining mutant clones for multiple <italic>numb</italic> alleles, we also observed an increased number of <italic>numb</italic> clones that lack ISCs compared with wild-type control clones. Interestingly, the stem cell loss phenotype was exacerbated by feeding flies with bleomycin, which resulted in EC damage and fluctuation of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tian et al., 2017</xref>), underscoring an important role of Numb in ISC maintenance during gut regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of BMP signaling results in ectopic N pathway activity even when Dl is depleted</title><p>Our previous study showed that depleting the type II receptor Punt (Put) for BMP in progenitor cells (ISC/EB) resulted in precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation, leading to stem cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). In Put deficient progenitor cells, the N pathway was activated in the absence of detectable N ligand Delta (Dl). Progenitor cells deficient for both Put and N failed to differentiate to EBs and formed stem cell-like tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian and Jiang, 2014</xref>). These observations imply that inactivation of Put may unleash a ligand-independent N pathway activity that drives precocious ISC-to-EB differentiation, leading to stem cell depletion. However, it remains possible that a trace amount of Dl that is beyond the detection by immunostaining might activate N in Put deficient progenitor cells.</p><p>To further explore the relationship between the BMP and N pathways, we carried out genetic epistatic experiments to determine the functional relationship between Put and Dl. We depleted Put and Dl either individually or in combination via RNAi in midgut progenitor cells using the <italic>esg-Gal4 tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<italic>esg<sup>ts</sup></italic>) system, in which Gal4 is under the control of a temperature sensitive Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> was included in the <italic>esg<sup>ts</sup></italic> system to mark all precursor cells whereas <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> (also called <italic>Su(H)GBE-lacZ</italic>), a transcriptional reporter of N signaling, was used to monitor N pathway activity and mark the EBs. Three- to five-day-old adult females expressing <italic>UAS-Put-RNAi</italic> and <italic>UAS-Dl-RNAi</italic> individually or in combination via <italic>esg<sup>ts</sup></italic> were shifted to 29°C for 10 days prior to dissection, followed by immunostained with the corresponding antibodies. For quantification, we focused on the posterior region (R4) of the midguts to minimize the variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>). In control guts, most pairs of <italic>esg&gt;GFP <sup>+</sup></italic> precursor cells, which may represent two recently divided ISC daughters, contained only one <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> positive cell, indicating that these ISCs divided asymmetrically to produce one ISC and one EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B–B’’, F</xref>). In line with our previous findings, most <italic>esg&gt;GFP <sup>+</sup></italic> precursor pairs from the Put RNAi guts expressed <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> in both ISC daughters, suggesting that ISCs underwent symmetric cell division to produce two EBs when Put was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’’, F</xref>). By contrast, <italic>esg&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in Dl RNAi guts formed ISC-like tumor clusters that were negative for <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’’, F</xref>), similar to the ISC-like tumor clusters in guts containing <italic>Dl</italic> or <italic>N</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siudeja et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that in Dl RNAi guts, N pathway activity was diminished. Put and Dl double RNAi suppressed the formation of ISC-like clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In these guts, <italic>esg-GFP<sup>+</sup></italic> cells exhibited <italic>Su(H)-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’’, F</xref>), suggesting that they activate the N pathway and differentiate into EBs. Hence, loss of BMP signaling resulted in ectopic N pathway activity that drives ISC-to-EB differentiation even when Dl was depleted.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BMP signaling inhibits Dl-independent N pathway activity to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme for the ISC lineage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut.

It is possible that a backup mechanism for ISC self-renewal may exist, which could compensate for the partial loss of BMP signaling to prevent ectopic N pathway activation that drives differentiation. During an asymmetric ISC division, the N inhibitor Numb is segregated into the basally localized daughter that becomes the future ISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that the asymmetric distribution of Numb may provide such a backup mechanism to ensure that the basally localized ISC daughter has lower N pathway activity than the apically localized one when differential BMP signaling is compromised so that the differential N signaling between the apical and basal is still sufficient to drive asymmetric fate determination. To test this hypothesis, we inactivated Numb and Mad either individually or in combination using two independent approaches: (1) RNAi and (2) genetic mutations. For the RNAi experiments, 3- to 5-day-old females expressing <italic>UAS-Numb-RNAi</italic>, <italic>UAS-Mad-RNAi</italic>, or <italic>UAS-Numb-RNAi + UAS-Mad-RNAi</italic> under the control of <italic>esg<sup>ts</sup></italic> were transferred to 29°C for 14 days. The guts were then dissected out for immunostaining to detect the expression of <italic>esg&gt;GFP</italic>, Dl-lacZ (ISC marker), E(spl)mβ-CD2 (EB marker) and Pros (EE marker). Because preEE expressed both Dl-lacZ and Pros and Dl-lacZ signals could be found in some EBs due to its perdurance, we counted Dl-lacZ<sup>+</sup> mβ-CD2<sup>−</sup> Pros<sup>−</sup> cells as ISCs and mβ-CD2<sup>+</sup> cells as EBs.

We found that Numb is largely dispensable for homeostatic ISC self-renewal due to the predominant role of BMP signaling in this context. Indeed, we found that Numb becomes critical for ISC self-renewal under conditions where BMP signaling is compromised.</p><p>Previous studies did not score a stem cell loss phenotype associated with <italic>numb</italic> mutant clones because the majority of <italic>numb</italic> mutant ISC-lineage clones could grow into large size comparable to control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>).

However, during regeneration, BMP ligand production was downregulated due to the autoinhibition of BMP ligand expression by BMP signaling in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). The reduction in BMP ligand production promoted ISC-to-EB differentiation to reset the ISC population size back to the homeostatic level after regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that asymmetric distribution of Numb in dividing ISCs may prevent excessive ISC-to-EB differentiation that could otherwise lead to a decreased ISC population during regeneration. Indeed, we observed an increase in the frequency of <italic>numb</italic> mutant clones lacking ISCs in response to bleomycin treatment, suggesting that Numb becomes critical for ISC maintenance during gut regeneration in response to tissue damage.</p><p>Based on our findings in current and previous studies, we propose the following working model to account for the cooperation between Numb and BMP signaling in the regulation of ISC self-renewal under homeostatic and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Under homeostatic conditions, most ISCs divide basally so that the basally localized ISC daughters inherit Numb and transducing higher levels of BMP signaling activity than the apically situated daughter cells, the combined differential activities in BMP signaling and Numb drive robust asymmetric division outcomes to produce ISC/EB pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the <italic>num</italic>b mutant background, differential BMP signaling activities between the apical and basal daughter cells suffice to drive asymmetric division outcomes in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the <italic>mad</italic> mutant background, the BMP signaling activity gradient becomes shallower but differential Numb activity between the apical and basal daughter cells can compensate for the compromised BMP signaling gradient to drive asymmetric division outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, in <italic>numb mad</italic> double mutant background or in <italic>numb</italic> mutant guts damaged by bleomycin feeding, the compromised BMP signaling activity gradient alone is often insufficient to drive asymmetric division outcomes, leading to ISC loss due to symmetric EB/EB division outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). One interesting question is why asymmetric Numb activity is unable to drive asymmetric ISC division outcome in the absence of BMP signaling as seen in <italic>put</italic> mutant background. One possibility is that the Numb level is too low in midgut ISCs so that the asymmetric Numb inheritance during ISC division is not robust enough to ensure asymmetric N signaling in the absence of BMP signaling. Indeed, previous studies indicate that endogenous Numb was undetectable using Numb antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couturier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>). Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that Numb may not be able to counter the ligand-independent N pathway activity unleashed in <italic>put</italic> mutant backgrounds. Future study is needed to test these possibilities and to determine the precise mechanism by which BMP signaling inhibits N pathway activity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for Numb and BMP signaling in intestinal stem cell (ISC)/enteroblast (EB) fate decision.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During asymmetric ISC division, the basal ISC daughter transduces higher level of BMP signaling and inherits higher level of Numb activity than the apical one.

The mechanism by which this occurs was activation of Notch in Put-deficient progenitors. How Notch was upregulated in Put-deficient ISCs was not established in this prior work. In the current study, the authors test whether a very low level of Dl was responsible. But co-depletion of Dl and Put led to a similar phenotype as depletion of Put alone. This result suggested that Dl was not the mechanism. They next investigate genetic interactions between BMP signaling and Numb, an inhibitor of Notch signaling. Prior work from Bardin, Schweisguth and other labs has shown that Numb is not required for ISC self-renewal. But the authors wanted to know whether loss of both the BMP signal transducer Mad and Numb would cause ISC loss. This result was observed for RNAi depletion from progenitors and for mad, numb double mutant clones. Of note, ISC loss was observed in 40% of mad, numb double mutant clones, whereas 60% of these clones had an ISC. They then employed a two-color tracing system called RGT to look at the outcome of ISC divisions (asymmetric (ISC/EB) or symmetric (ISC/ISC or EB/EB)). Control clones had 69%, 15% and 16%, respectively, whereas mad, numb double mutant clones had much lower ISC/ISC (11%) and much higher EB/EB (37%). They conclude that loss of Numb in moderate BMP loss of function mutants increased symmetric differentiation which lead caused ISC loss. They also reported that numb15 and numb4 clones had a moderate but significant increase in ISC-lacking clones compared to control clones, supporting the model that Numb plays a role in ISC maintenance. Finally, they investigated the relevance of these observation during regeneration. After bleomycin treatment, there was a significant increase in ISC-lacking clones and a significant decrease in clone size in numb4 and numb15 clones compared to control clones.

Based on RNAi combinations and double mutant clonal analyses, they propose that Numb has a function in inhibiting Notch pathway to maintain intestinal stem cells, and is a backup mechanism with BMP pathway in maintaining midgut stem cell mediated homeostasis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully constructed series of experiments, and the results and statistical analyses provides believable evidence that Numb has a role, albeit weak compared to other pathways, in sustaining ISC and in promoting regeneration especially after damage by bleomycin, which may damage enterocytes and therefore disrupt BMP pathway more. The results overall support their claim.</p><p>The data are highly coherent, and support a genetic function of Numb, in collaborating with BMP signaling, to maintain the number and proliferative function of ISCs in adult midguts. The authors used appropriate and sophisticated genetic tools of double RNAi, mutant clonal analysis and dual marker stem cell tracing approaches to ensure the results are reproducible and consistent. The statistical analyses provide confidence that the phenotypic changes are reliable albeit weaker than many other mutants previously studied.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In the absence of Numb itself, the midgut has a weak reduction of ISC number (Fig. 3 and 5), as well as weak albeit not statistically significant reduction of ISC clone size/proliferation. I think the authors published similar experiments with BMP pathway mutants. The mad1-2 allele used here as stated below may not be very representative of other BMP pathway mutants. Therefore, it could be beneficial to compare the number of ISC number and clone sizes between other BMP experiments to provide the readers a clearer picture how these two pathways individually contribute (stronger/weaker effects) to the ISC number and gut homeostasis.</p><p>The main weakness of this manuscript is the analysis of the BMP pathway components, especially the mad1-2 allele. The mad RNAi and mad1-2 alleles (P insertion) are supposed to be weak alleles and that might be suitable for genetic enhancement assays here together with numb RNAi. However, the mad1-2 allele, and sometime the mad RNAi, showed weakly increased ISC clone size. This is kind of counter-intuitive that they should have a similar ISC loss and ISC clone size reduction.</p><p>A much stronger phenotype was observed when numb mutants were subject to treatment of tissue damaging agents Bleomycin, which causes damage in different ways than DSS. Bleomycin as previously shown to be causing mainly enterocyte damage, and therefore disrupt BMP signaling from ECs more likely. Therefore, this treatment together with loss of numb led to highly significant reduction of ISC in clones and reduction of clone size/proliferation. One improvement is that it is not clear whether the authors discussed the nature of the two numb mutant alleles used in this study and the comparison to the strength of the RNAi allele. Because the phenotypes are weak, and more variable, the use of specific reagents is important.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of possible activating alleles of either or both pathways to test genetic enhancement or synergistic activation will provide strong support for the claims.</p><p>For the revision, the authors have provided detailed responses, comments, and a revised manuscript that together satisfactorily answer all my questions. The manuscript read well and the flow of information is quite clear. I do not have further concerns and support the manuscript moving forward.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104723.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mengjie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dallas</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Aiguo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tulane University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">NEW ORLEANS</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dallas</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>By way of background, the Jiang lab has previously shown that loss of the type II BMP receptor Punt (Put) from intestinal progenitors (ISCs and EBs) caused them to differentiate into EBs, with a concomitant loss of ISCs (Tian and Jiang, eLife 2014).

This reduction is less significant in guts containing numb<sup>15</sup> clones. However, the percentage of Dl<sup>+</sup>-containing clones is similar between DSS and mock-treated guts. It is possible that ISC proliferation is lightly reduced due to numb<sup>4</sup> mutation or the genetic background of this stock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) There is probably a mistake on sentence line 314 -316 &quot;Indeed, previous studies indicate that endogenous Numb was not undetectable by Numb antibodies that could detect Numb expression in the nervous system&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors provide an in-depth analysis of the function of Numb in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. Based on RNAi combinations and double mutant clonal analyses, they propose that Numb has a function in inhibiting Notch pathway to maintain intestinal stem cells, and is a backup mechanism with BMP pathway in maintaining midgut stem cell mediated homeostasis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully constructed series of experiments, and the results and statistical analyses provides believable evidence that Numb has a role, albeit weak compared to other pathways, in sustaining ISC and in promoting regeneration especially after damage by bleomycin, which may damage enterocytes and therefore disrupt BMP pathway more. The results overall support their claim.</p><p>The data are highly coherent, and support a genetic function of Numb, in collaborating with BMP signaling, to maintain the number and proliferative function of ISCs in adult midguts. The authors used appropriate and sophisticated genetic tools of double RNAi, mutant clonal analysis and dual marker stem cell tracing approaches to ensure the results are reproducible and consistent. The statistical analyses provide confidence that the phenotypic changes are reliable albeit weaker than many other mutants previously studied.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In the absence of Numb itself, the midgut has a weak reduction of ISC number (Fig. 3 and 5), as well as weak albeit not statistically significant reduction of ISC clone size/proliferation. I think the authors published similar experiments with BMP pathway mutants. The mad<sup>1-2</sup> allele used here as stated below may not be very representative of other BMP pathway mutants. Therefore, it could be beneficial to compare the number of ISC number and clone sizes between other BMP experiments to provide the readers with a clearer picture of how these two pathways individually contribute (stronger/weaker effects) to the ISC number and gut homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We have tested other components of BMP pathway in our previously study (Tian et al., 2014). More complete loss of BMP signaling (for example, Put clones, Put RNAi, Tkv/Sax double mutant clones or double RNAi) resulted in ISC loss regardless the status of numb, suggesting a more predominant role of BMP signaling in ISC self-renewal compared with Numb. We speculate that the weak stem cell loss phenotype associated with numb mutant clones in otherwise wild type background could be due to fluctuation of BMP signaling in homeostatic guts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main weakness of this manuscript is the analysis of the BMP pathway components, especially the mad<sup>1-2</sup> allele. The mad RNAi and mad<sup>1-2</sup> alleles (P insertion) are supposed to be weak alleles and that might be suitable for genetic enhancement assays here together with numb RNAi. However, the mad<sup>1-2</sup> allele, and sometimes the mad RNAi, showed weakly increased ISC clone size. This is kind of counter-intuitive that they should have a similar ISC loss and ISC clone size reduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We used mad<sup>1-2</sup> and mad RNAi here to test the genetic interaction with numb because our previous studies showed that partial loss of BMP signaling under these conditions did not cause stem cell loss, therefore, may provide a sensitized background to determine the role of Numb in ISC self-renewal. The increased proliferation of ISC/ clone size associated with mad<sup>1-2</sup> and mad RNAi is due to the fact that reduction of BMP signaling in either EC or EB non-autonomously induces stem cell proliferation. However, in mad numb double mutant clones, there was a reduction in clone size due to loss of ISC in many clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A much stronger phenotype was observed when numb mutants were subject to treatment of tissue damaging agents Bleomycin, which causes damage in different ways than DSS. Bleomycin as previously shown to be causing mainly enterocyte damage, and therefore disrupt BMP signaling from ECs more likely. Therefore, this treatment together with loss of numb led to a highly significant reduction of ISC in clones and reduction of clone size/proliferation. One improvement is that it is not clear whether the authors discussed the nature of the two numb mutant alleles used in this study and the comparison to the strength of the RNAi allele. Because the phenotypes are weak and more variable, the use of specific reagents is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included information about the two numb alleles in the “Materials and Methods”. numb<sup>15</sup> is a null allele, and the nature of numb<sup>4</sup> has not been elucidated. According to Domingos, P.M. et al., numb<sup>15</sup> induced a more severe phenotype than numb<sup>4</sup> did. Consistently, we also found that more numb<sup>15</sup> mutant clones were void of stem cell than numb<sup>4</sup> mutant clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the use of possible activating alleles of either or both pathways to test genetic enhancement or synergistic activation will provide strong support for the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Activation of BMP (esgts&gt;Tkv<sup>CA</sup>) alone induced stem cell tumor (Tian et al., 2014) whereas overexpression of Numb did not induce increase stem cell number although overexpression of Numb in wing discs produced phenotypes indictive of inhibition of N (our unpublished observation), making it difficult to test the synergistic effect of activating both BMP and Numb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>- Cartoon of RGT in Fig 4 needs to be improved.
