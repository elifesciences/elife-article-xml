phenomenon known as self-heating. In the framework of mechanobiology, it has been accepted that cells react and adapt to mechanical stimuli. However, the cellular effect of temperature increase as a by-product of loading has been widely neglected. In this work, we focused on cartilage self-heating to present a ‘thermo-mechanobiological’ paradigm, and demonstrate how the coupling of a biomimetic temperature evolution and mechanical loading could influence cell behavior. We thereby developed a customized in vitro system allowing to recapitulate pertinent in vivo physical cues and determined the cells chondrogenic response to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli. Cellular mechanisms of action and potential signaling pathways of thermo-mechanotransduction process were also investigated. We found that co-existence of thermo-mechanical cues had a superior effect on chondrogenic gene expression compared to either signal alone. Specifically, the expression of Sox9 was significantly upregulated by application of the physiological thermo-mechanical stimulus. Multimodal transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels were identified as key mediators of thermo-mechanotransduction process, which becomes ineffective without external calcium sources. We also observed that the isolated temperature evolution, as a by-product of loading, is a contributing factor to the cell response and this could be considered as important as the conventional mechanical loading. Providing an optimal thermo-mechanical environment by synergy of heat and loading portrays new opportunity for development of novel treatments for cartilage regeneration and can furthermore signal key elements for emerging cell-based therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>cartilage self-heating</kwd><kwd>thermo-mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>tissue viscoelasticity</kwd><kwd>TRPV4 channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#310030_149969/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pioletti</surname><given-names>Dominique P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#CR23I3_159301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pioletti</surname><given-names>Dominique P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The loading-induced temperature evolution phenomenon in the knee joint modulates chondrogenic cells response to loading and accordingly opens a new paradigm that is coined 'thermo-mechanobiology'.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanoregulation is a central process to maintain health and functionality of musculoskeletal tissues. Cells within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of load-bearing tissues receive various physical stimuli and maintain tissue homeostasis and function through reciprocal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>). The externally applied load generates different sensible cues within the cells surrounding microenvironments, such as spatiotemporal deformation, interstitial fluid pressure, shear stress, and ion mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mow et al., 1999</xref>). In this process, mechanical properties, organizational structure, and constituents of the ECM are massively influential and mediate the conveyed signals. Cell sensory systems integrate and convert the perceived physical inputs into the biochemical transients via different mechanisms of actions (e.g. calcium signaling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, cells react and the elicited response modifies expression of genes and subsequent proteins to adapt tissue composition and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>). In particular, chondrogenic cells were shown to respond to physical stimuli when various dynamic loading regimens were applied (compression, torsion, tension, hydrostatic pressure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>) and when scaffold materials with different properties were used (elastic, viscoelastic, porous, non-porous) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panadero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goetzke et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of multimodal physical cues and associated coupling phenomena in chondrogenesis still remains to be fully understood.</p><p>Articular cartilage is a load-bearing tissue with significant dissipative capacity. This property arises from the cartilage ECM intrinsic viscoelasticity and fluid-solid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mak, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mow et al., 1992</xref>). Dissipation is a function of the applied loading as well as material characteristics and is therefore an integrative variable for macroscopic physical cues generating spatiotemporal signals around cells. We have capitalized on this concept and demonstrated that matching dissipative capacity of scaffolds with native cartilage is an effective strategy to convey chondro-inductive cues to cells seeded in scaffolds under cyclic loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2019</xref>). Apart from direct effects of mechanical dissipation, being associated with matrix deformation, shear stress, and interstitial fluid pressure around cells, the cartilage dissipation may indirectly influence chondrocyte behavior by increasing tissue temperature. This phenomenon is called self-heating and occurs following conversion of the lost mechanical energy to heat over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2014b</xref>). In addition to cartilage dissipation, other factors such as ambient temperature and heat transfer from surrounding tissues could contribute to the temperature evolution in the joint. Previous studies indicated that cyclic compression exerted on cartilage could significantly increase its local temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, in vivo measurements inside intra-articular regions of knee joints have shown a temperature rise from 32°C (at rest) to ~38°C following 1 hr of jogging activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becher et al., 2008</xref>) at the ambient temperature of 19°C. Chondrocytes are sensitive to temperature and the literature suggests that their biophysical response to heat stimulation is dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tonomura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). However, none of the conducted studies are based on a biomimetic temperature evolution regime. The loading-induced self-heating of cartilage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, is an unexplored coupled phenomenon in the field of biomechanics which could initiate a new ‘thermo-mechanobiology’ paradigm.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cartilage loading-induced self-heating during physical activity.</title><p>Mechanical hysteresis in cartilage tissue during joint loading generates heat and causes the temperature rise over time. The self-heating of cartilage originates from both, intrinsic matrix viscoelasticity and solid-fluid interaction sources during joint loading. Structural and material characteristics of matrix microenvironment are acting in concert with external stresses to provide direct and indirect biophysical cues for cells such as deformation and temperature variation (p<sub>f</sub>, v<sub>f</sub>: fluid pressure and flow velocity; ε<sub>s</sub>, σ<sub>s</sub>solid matrix strain and stress; T: temperature).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72068-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In cartilage microenvironment, different elements residing inside and/or on plasma membrane of chondrocytes (cytoskeleton, nucleus, ion channels, primary cilium, integrin, and TGFβ<sub>3</sub> receptors) could be activated by receiving spatiotemporal cues and trigger intracellular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panadero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loeser, 2014</xref>). In particular, transient variation of intracellular calcium is a fundamental pathway for transduction of an external physical stimulus to control cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). It has been shown that, fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degala et al., 2011</xref>), mechanical strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pingguan-Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>), and osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>) modulate cytosolic calcium oscillation in chondrocytes. Among different calcium mediators, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a multimodal ion channel that significantly contributes to the transduction of physical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>). The literature suggests that over-activation and full inhibition of TRPV4 channels in chondrocytes cause negative effects on joint development and cartilage homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupkova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Conor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atobe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). Of note, TRPV4 channels are responsive to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>) and temperature rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2003</xref>), making it a potential sensory system for translation of stimuli involved in loading-induced self-heating phenomenon.</p><p>The overall objective of the present work is to address cartilage thermo-mechanobiology. For this purpose, we first developed an original model system capable of simulating the self-heating phenomenon in vitro. Specifically, our customized system encompassed a modular bioreactor designed to independently control the evolution of temperature and applied mechanical loading on cell-laden constructs, as well as a biomechanically functional scaffold recapitulating cartilage viscoelastic properties. Having developed the tailored in vitro platform, we then determined the individual contribution and the combined effects of temperature and loading on cell response. In this study, the cellular reaction was evaluated through varied expression of chondrogenic genes following an applied stimulus. Finally, we aimed to identify downstream signaling and the potential role of TRPV4 ion channels as a mediator in the thermo-mechanotransduction process. Accordingly, the influence of thermo-mechanical cues on cell response was investigated when inhibiting TRPV4 channels as a signal transducer or diminishing cytosolic calcium variation as a mechanism of action. An insight on the effect of cartilage microenvironment on chondrocyte behavior and respective transduction cascade can positively contribute to the development of emerging cell-based therapies for tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A custom-made in vitro platform for cartilage thermo-mechanobiology</title><p>We developed an in vitro platform allowing to recapitulate loading-induced self-heating in articular cartilage and study corresponding cell response. Our system consisted of two essential components: (i) a poro-viscoelastic scaffold, with comparable dissipative capacity and equilibrium compressive stiffness to cartilage, seeded with human chondro-progenitor cells (ECPs); (ii) a modular bioreactor to independently control applied mechanical loading, temperature increase, as well as gas concentration and humidity levels during stimulation. We have used ECPs because they provide an off-the-shelf cell source and have potential chondro-differentiation capability and reportedly they can produce cartilage matrix in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Studer et al., 2017</xref>). By using this cell source, we were able to have a standardized platform for all of our experimentation with the high quality of cells and full safety features for experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laurent et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurent et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As a 3D support for cells, a fatigue-resistant hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>) was developed by combination of flow-dependent and flow-independent dissipation sources to recapitulate cartilage viscoelastic properties. This was accomplished by a hybridly crosslinked (combination of covalent and physical bonds) pHEMA network and a poorly permeable macrostructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rearrangement of polymeric chains, dissociation of reversible bonds, and fluid frictional drag mechanisms contributed to viscoelastic behavior of the developed hydrogel as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2019</xref>). The stress-strain curve under cyclic loading was minimally varied showing that the developed hydrogel can preserve applied mechanical cues during multiple physiological stimulations. The poro-viscoelastic scaffold was also functionalized by RGD peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to enhance cell attachment and cell-matrix interactions during loading. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey scan recorded on pure (non-modified) and RGD functionalized samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), confirmed the effectiveness of the RGD grafting process. As the pure pHEMA hydrogel does not contain any nitrogen atom in its molecular structure, no signal was observed in respective range for pure samples contrary to RGD functionalized samples with a peak for nitrogen at 402 eV.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Developed in vitro system to study cartilage thermo-mechanobiology.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Poro-viscoelastic hydrogel with RGD decoration on pores.

Our findings demonstrated that the loading-induced self-heating (simultaneous temperature evolution and mechanical loading) positively enhances chondrogenic expression of cells and outperforms mechanical or thermal stimulus alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d-i</xref>). Importantly, we obtained a boosted effect on the expression of Sox9, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, following biomimetic thermo-mechanical stimulation designated as Thermo-Mech (32.5–39°C). Sox9 is a transcription factor and its role as one of the key regulators of chondrogenic differentiation processes is well established in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>). Upregulation of Sox9 gene under thermo-mechanical stimulation was significantly higher than the control, mechanical, and thermal groups. In parallel, Twist-related protein 1 (Twist1), which is known as an inhibitor of chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2012</xref>), exhibited a significantly downregulated expression following the thermo-mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

Col1a1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) was not significantly different between stimulated and control groups. The obtained relative fold-change ratio for Col2a1/Col1a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) confirms enhanced chondrogenic differentiation capacity regardless of the absolute level of Col2 and Col1 genes. Collectively, the applied thermo-mechanical stimulus provided a chondro-inductive signal by simulating the cartilage native environment under loading.</p><p>While still a promoter of chondrogenesis, isolated mechanical or thermal stimuli were not as effective as thermo-mechanical stimulus combined. Notably, application of intermittent temperature increases (from 32.5°C to 39°C during 1.5 hr) on cells significantly upregulated expression of Sox9, Col2a, COMP and downregulated Twist1. Unlike traditional mechanobiological in vitro models with unrealistic culture temperature of 37°C, we evaluated the effect of steady-state incubation temperature on chondrogenic cellular responses. Compared to the control group, a significant fold increase was detected on expression of COMP by loading at 32.5°C. An enhanced expression of Col2a was also observed following mechanical stimulation without temperature variation. A statistically significant difference in fold increase of Sox9 was obtained between stimulated samples at 37°C and 32.5°C. This implies that chondrogenic cells respond better to compressive loading at higher temperatures which supports the common mode of action in most bioreactors for cartilage tissue engineering. Yet, simulation of loading-induced self-heating condition better promoted chondrogenic markers compared to mechanical stimulus at constant temperatures (32.5°C or 37°C). This indicates that cells could sense the transient temperature rise. The transient effect should therefore be considered as a potential regulatory cue besides external stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cartilage thermo-mechanotransduction is a TRPV4-mediated and calcium-dependent signaling mechanism</title><p>Knowing that oscillation of intracellular calcium is an important regulator of chondrogenesis, the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in thermo-mechanotransduction process was evaluated.

Our results also indicated that TRPV4 acts as signal integrator for thermal and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). By comparing the Col2a and Sox9 gene expression for either cue alone, with and without GSK205, one can observe reduced levels of these markers when TRPV4 is inhibited. The downregulation in blocked TRPV4 channels condition is statistically significant for Sox9 only in case of mechanical loading and for Col2a only in case of thermal stimulus.</p><p>Without application of external physical stimulus, we could not observe a significant change on relative gene expression of cells in presence of 2 mM EGTA.

However, previous in vitro mechanobiological studies typically considered a constant culture temperature of 37°C which does not correspond to the physiological in vivo condition in human knee. For the first time, we investigated cartilage thermo-mechanobiology and demonstrated the synergetic effect of heat and loading stimuli at the transcriptional level of chondrogenesis. We further demonstrated that the thermo-mechanotransduction is indeed calcium dependent and TRPV4 gates on the plasma membrane play a key role in this process. This study also revealed that a decomposed thermal cue, as a by-product of loading, could itself promote chondrogenesis similar to or even better than the mechanical signal alone. Our findings support the concept that ECM viscoelasticity can indirectly influence biological response of cells as self-heating phenomenon links the temperature evolution to cyclic loading of viscoelastic materials.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Simultaneous consideration of inter-related cues for cartilage thermo-mechanobiology</title><p>As already well established, the biophysical cues significantly influence the cellular responses in musculoskeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>). In a mechanistic view point, structural and material properties of ECM microenvironment are acting in association with external stresses to generate physical cues for cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panadero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goetzke et al., 2018</xref>). The cartilage dissipative capacity originates from intrinsic matrix viscoelasticity and solid-fluid interactions under an applied loading. These dissipative sources are associated with the matrix deformation, hydrostatic pressure, and interstitial fluid flow around cells which were previously considered as mechanobiological regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salinas et al., 2018</xref>). Cartilage dissipation, therefore, could be a functional property for chondrogenesis overarching all solid- and fluid-related mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2019</xref>). In parallel, energy dissipation in avascular cartilage during joint loading generates heat and causes the temperature evolution over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdel-Sayed et al., 2014b</xref>). The absolute temperature rise in cartilage microenvironment also depends on the joint boundary condition (e.g. the ambient temperature and heat flux by surroundings tissues). Regardless of the heat source(s) and of the complex heat transfer mechanisms inside articular cavity, the varied temperature during joint loading could affect chondrocyte biological responses. To simulate such conditions and study cartilage thermo-mechanobiology, we developed a fatigue-resistant dissipative hydrogel for 3D culture of cells and a modular bioreactor to apply respective biophysical cues in vitro as there was not an available platform for this purpose elsewhere.</p><p>The developed modular bioreactor is necessary for evaluating the role of the temperature rise during mechanical loading in a laboratory design. Yet, the use of human articular cartilage explants instead of cell-seeded constructs in our customized bioreactor could better reproduce the in vivo thermo-mechanical environment. However, the difficulty in obtaining healthy human articular cartilage with similar size and physiological state was the main reason for which we developed a reproducible model and used cell-laden hydrogels. Indeed, this system has its own limitation and the spread morphology of the cells in our dissipative porous hydrogels is one of them. The ideal construct would be a mechanically capable scaffold that provides an environment for moderate cells adhesion and fairly maintains round morphology of cells. This might be realized by cells encapsulation into an adhesive soft hydrogel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karami et al., 2021</xref>) with endogenous binding sites for cells which is firmly integrated in a stiff and porous 3D support with load-bearing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boere et al., 2014</xref>). The limitation of our porous dissipative hydrogel for this method of construct preparation is its intentional low permeability (order of E<sup>–14</sup> m<sup>2</sup>) to induce frictional drag dissipation. The permeability can be increased by enlarging the size of the pores and providing full interconnectivity within the porous structure. Nonetheless, recapitulating cartilage dissipation might not be achievable in this condition. The focus of current research was studying the effect of loading-induced temperature evolution on cells behavior by a reasonable and reproducible in vitro model. Given the fact that we employed identically prepared cell-scaffolds constructs for all of our experimentation, we assumed that the isolated role of externally applied stimuli on cells chondrogenic response could be evaluated irrespective of cells morphology.</p><p>The reciprocal relationship between cells and ECM governs cartilage hemostasis as chondrocytes receive physical cues and regulate tissue turnover to maintain its functional characteristics (e.g. dissipation). An altered gene expression is generally considered as the first indicator for cells responsiveness to conveyed cues which could ultimately lead to long-term matrix deposition depending on other contributing factors. Collagen type II (Col2a), aggrecan (Agc1), and SRY-related HMG-box gene 9 (Sox9) genes are the most utilized chondrogenic markers at the molecular level for mechanobiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Johnstone, 2017</xref>). Not only does Sox9 contribute to early chondrogenesis and matrix synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>), but it also inhibits chondrocyte terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). Col2a and Agc1 are anabolic markers of main ECM components in cartilage tissue and COMP gene controls synthesis of the linkage protein with multiple binding possibilities to integrate and stabilize the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koelling, 2006</xref>). Twist1 is known to hinder chondrogenesis by direct inhibition of Sox9 as the master regulator of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). Our customized model system enabled us to show that chondrogenic cells immediately responded to biomimetic thermo-mechanical cues by altering their gene expression and that cells are able to sense the transient temperature rise. We evaluated cellular reactions after three rounds of stimulation to consider their probable desensitization and estimate a robust transcriptional response. However, given the transient nature of the chondrogenic markers to an applied stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scholtes et al., 2018</xref>), analysis of results at different time points could help to better understand the gene expression profile. Additionally, it still remains to be determined to what extent the promoted chondrogenic gene expression could enhance downstream protein expression and functional properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cartilage thermo-mechanics portrays new opportunity to advance chondrogenesis in vitro</title><p>The expression of chondrogenic markers was enhanced by the applied physical stimulus in all groups except for Agc1 and COMP in one group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The obtained gene expression data for Col2a1, Agc1, Col1a, Sox9, Twist1, and COMP clearly show that thermo-mechanical stimulus generates more potent signaling to elicit cell responses compared to either cue alone. Moreover, Col2a1/Col1a relative fold-change ratio confirmed that combined biomimetic stimuli enhanced progenitor cell chondrogenic capacity. Yet, prolonged culture of ECP cells with growth factor supplements (at least 21 days) was needed to reach mature chondrogenic differentiation state where the absolute expression of Col2 could exceed the absolute expression of Col1 as reported by other studies with this cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Studer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laurent et al., 2021</xref>). One compelling aspect of this finding is that employing bioreactors which are capable of controlling temperature evolution during dynamic loading should be preferred for tissue engineering applications. Indeed, chondro-inductivity can be enhanced by the condition which simulates the in vivo cartilage more similarly as shown by other multi-functional bioreactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schätti et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, simulating complex physiological loading conditions in articulating joints by combined compression, sliding, and shear was shown to be more effective than a single loading mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schätti et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, combining hypoxia culture with multi-directional loading performed better than normaxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wernike et al., 2008</xref>) as low oxygen level could direct chondrogenesis. Accordingly, investigating controlled oxygen tension combined with thermo-mechanical stimulation might shed more light on the in vivo chondrogenic process.</p><p>Dynamic temperature evolution also had promising impact on transcription of chondrogenic markers in the current study where applied thermal stimulus outperforms pure mechanical loading. Significant upregulation in Col2a1, COMP, and Sox9 expression as well as downregulation of Twist1 gene clearly indicate enhanced cellular responses to isolated self-heating cue (temperature rise without loading). In line with our findings, available evidence in the literature suggests that proper heat stimulation can enhance and accelerate chondrogenic differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tonomura et al., 2008</xref>). Over stimulation by high temperature, however, reduces the cell viability and inhibits cartilage matrix synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to simulate the dynamics of thermal environment in vivo and optimize the influence of thermal stimuli by defining a biomimetic intermittent temperature rise. Considering clinical translation, it is encouraging to have chondro-inductive cues only with application of careful heating to simulate joint thermal environment during physical activity. Such stimulus can be simply delivered to patients in need by development of a customized heat therapy device for joint disease. It remains to elucidate if this argument is true for osteoarthritic cartilage as damaged chondrocytes may respond differently to biophysical cues as reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agarwal et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Calcium signaling is a major mechanism of action in transduction of thermo-mechanical cues sensed by TRPV4 channels</title><p>Understanding the translation mechanisms of external stimuli and their interaction with molecular signaling pathways is essential for development of therapeutic products to modulate the target regulators. It is well established that TRPV4 is a key mediator in transduction of mechanical signals in chondrocytes which is necessary for maintenance of cartilage tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agarwal et al., 2021</xref>). In parallel, the reported activation temperature around 30°C for TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Güler et al., 2002</xref>) makes this channel a potential mediator of loading-induced self-heating in cartilage. Our study revealed that TRPV4 is a potent modulator for expression of Col2a and Agc1 genes in response to thermo-mechanical cues. These results are in agreement with the data reported for post-transcriptional markers determined by protein expression and functional properties of cell-encapsulated hydrogels under mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). The obtained gene expression profile of Sox9 in this study suggested a partial contribution of TRPV4 to its transcription in response to thermo-mechanical cues. This means that there are parallel mechanisms for sensing the applied stimuli and eliciting Sox9 enhancement which could be other transmembrane channels, primary cilium or integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Conor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panadero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupkova et al., 2017</xref>). Integrin-mediated pathways arising from cell-matrix interaction are mechanisms by which cells may sense the mechanical cues in the surrounding microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loeser, 2014</xref>). Since RGD motifs were conjugated onto the pores of the developed hydrogels, a stable and effective cell-matrix interaction during loading can be expected. According to our results, significant upregulation of Sox9 in the mechanically loaded samples with and without GSK205 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) could imply the contribution of an integrin pathway. Of note, previous studies also showed that integrin could regulate activation of ion channels in chondrocytes and cell-matrix interactions could modulate calcium signaling dynamics in response to physical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jablonski et al., 2014</xref>). We could not find any direct thermo and/or mechano-biological study in the literature reporting even partial effect of TRPV4 blocking on Sox9 expression in chondrogenic cells. However, in agreement with our findings, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that pharmacological activation/inhibition of TRPV4 channels could mediate Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atobe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muramatsu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>TRPV4 activity can modulate intracellular calcium transients and literature findings indicate that a well-adjusted TRPV4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is necessary for correct biological functioning of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Conor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupkova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Conor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atobe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2010</xref>). We found that full removal of external calcium sources could further diminish the enhanced chondrogenic response obtained by thermo-mechanical cues when compared with TRPV4 inhibition alone. This behavior was consistent in gene expression profiles of the investigated markers and induced transcription returned toward control levels in the presence of EGTA. These findings indicate that calcium is a major signaling mechanism for thermo-mechanotransduction. Intracellular calcium oscillation is a key signaling mechanism in chondrocytes and can be triggered by different types of mechanical stimuli such as strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>) and fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degala et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, the dynamic characteristics of calcium signaling (e.g. amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients) were shown to be temperature dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that the signaling cascade of thermo-mechanotransduction process is almost incomplete without external calcium sources. Previous studies also showed that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> source is necessary for calcium signaling processes and increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not possible without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, even when intracellular stores are full of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pingguan-Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>When thermo-mechanical cues are applied, downregulation of Agc1 and COMP and upregulation of Twist1 were significantly different in the presence of EGTA compared to the condition in which TRPV4 antagonist was used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This different response could arise from two plausible reasons. First, TRPV4 channels were not fully blocked by GSK 205 and the conveyed signal was strong enough to partially activate some of the channels. This is consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>) where quantitative results indicated that 10 µm GSK205 significantly inhibited but did not fully abolish TRPV4 channel activity. A second possibility would be that, parallel thermo-mechanically responsive pathways besides TRPV4 were involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediation in order to make this process more effective and robust. This is not surprising as accumulating evidence in the literature suggests that distinct calcium pathways, including stretch-activated channels (e.g. PIEZO1), voltage-gated calcium channels (e.g. T-type VGCC), purinergic receptors (e.g. P2Y or P2X), PLC-IP3-induced endoplasmic reticulum, and TRP family channels (e.g. TRPV3), are directly or indirectly influenced by an externally applied stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pingguan-Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupkova et al., 2017</xref>). Determining other probable contributing mediators in thermo-mechanotransduction processes are thus important next steps and need further investigation.</p><p>In summary, different aspects involved in cartilage thermo-mechanobiology following joint loading were analyzed by developing a novel customized in vitro model. Our findings have demonstrated the superior effect of thermo-mechanical cues on chondrogenesis compared to either cue alone. Indeed, the applied synergetic stimulus provided a chondro-inductive signal by simulating the cartilage native environment under loading. This study also has shown that biomimetic temperature evolution as by-product of mechanical loading could itself induce biological responses of cells. Moreover, TRPV4 ion channels were identified as a key mediator of thermo-mechanotransduction process. Thermo-mechano-responsive nature of TRPV4 channels makes them a key target for future investigation on thermo-mechanobiology. We found calcium signaling as a contributing mechanism of action translating the effect of the externally applied cues to intracellular biochemical signals for cells. However, other pathways are also playing parallel roles, especially for Sox9 transcription, which therefore would necessitate further understanding of thermo-mechano-transduction processes overall.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cell line (Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ECPs (human chondro-progenitor cells</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3727/215517912X639324">https://doi.org/10.3727/215517912X639324</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/.10.3390/biom11020250">https://doi.org/.10.3390/biom11020250</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Fetal chondro-progenitor cell source (FE002-Cart.) established after standardized processing of a fetal cartilage sample in Prof Lee Ann Applegate lab in 2009</italic>.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Antibody</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Anti-TRPV4 (Rabbit polyclonal</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Abcam</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cat#: ab191580</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>IF (1:200</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Commercial assay or kit</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Flou 4-AM (Calcium indicators</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Thermo Fisher Scientific</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cat#: F14201</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>5</italic> µM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Chemical compound, drug</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>TRPV4 agonist;

Cell growth medium consisted of DMEM containing L-glutamine, 4.5 g/l D-glucose and sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies) which was supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1% L-glutamine and penicillin (Life Technologies). Cells were grown to 90% confluence, trypsinized and redistributed again in 2D culture up to passage 5 before seeding into scaffolds (~1.2 mio/scaffold). Stimulation medium was prepared with cell growth medium without FBS but having 10% ITS IV (Life Technologies) and 1% vitamin C. MTT staining Kit I (Roche) was used to control the cell distribution and Viability Assay Kit (Biotium) was utilized for live/dead evaluation according to the manufacturer’s protocols. By using the MTT reagent, the purple formazan is produced due to the cells metabolic activity and therefore reveals cell distribution within the hydrogels. Viability assay was performed via a cell-permeable dye (calcine) for staining live cells and a cell-impermeable dye (ethidium homodimer) for staining dead cells having a damaged cell membrane. The Hoechst 33258 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was employed for DNA quantification to evaluate the impact of hydrogel functionalization on cell attachment. Briefly, the pure and RGD-modified hydrogels (with and without cells) were cut in small pieces and incubated overnight inside 500 ml papain digestion buffer at 65°C. Then, by dilution of 10 µl of digested solution in 140 µl of the dye (0.2 µg/ml), the emission signal of samples was measured at 460 nm by a Wallac microplate reader after excitation at 355 nm.

The mechanical design of the bioreactor chamber was optimized to ensure sterility and application of reproducible spatiotemporal stimuli on samples. The chamber, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, contains 12 circularly arranged cylindrical wells for culture of cell-laden hydrogels. The set-up is compatible with the Instron uniaxial loading machine (Instron-E3000, Norwood, MA) to apply the mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) according to reported values for knee cartilage deformation during walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The bioreactor was fixed to the Instron apparatus at its base by a support, and was stimulated from above by a set of pistons attached to the actuator. To control culture temperature, a thermo-foil heater (Minco-HM6975) was embedded below an aluminum conductive disc supporting culture wells. The temperature was measured by a miniature RTD sensor (Minco-S308) placed inside one of the wells. The evolution of culture temperature was feedback controlled by a PID microprocessor (Minco-CT16A, Minneapolis, MN) based on the error signal between the desired and monitored temperatures. The parameters of the PID controller were tuned experimentally based on the standard Ziegler-Nichols method. The heat controller was tuned to regulate the culture temperature defined by sequential ramps with different slopes according to the model prediction. This strategy was employed to simulate the temperature increase (occurring in knee joint with its irregular boundary conditions due to cartilage self-heating) in our small-size scaffolds (Ø:8, t: 2.2 mm) surrounded by the relatively large volume of culture medium (~2 ml) inside the bioreactor wells. To minimize the temperature gradient due to conduction within the sample from bottom to top, a medical graded thermoplastic part (PPSU) was incorporated within the stainless-steel wells. The geometry of PPSU part was carefully designed to make convection the dominant heat transfer mechanism to samples. A flexible silicon support was also employed to keep the position of samples on the center during dynamic loading. To maintain sterility, the wells were isolated from the outside environment with perforated solid caps covered with gas-permeable filters (OpSite Flexigrid, Smith &amp; Nephew, Hull, UK). The CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> concentration and humidity inside the chamber were regulated by an external gas mixer (ibidi-Gas Incubation System, Martinsried, Germany) injecting humidified gas into the bioreactor.

The activation process was continued by agitation of samples in the solution for 1 hr at room temperature.

To ensure removal of any non-reacted NPC group, the samples were incubated in 0.5 M solution of ethanolamine in methanol for 20 min under gentle shaking. The samples were finally rinsed several times with methanol and bi-distillated water to wash non-specifically adsorbed peptides and entrapped NPC molecules inside the porous hydrogels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Simulation of heat transfer inside bioreactor culture well</title><p>To ensure independent control over applied loading and temperature evolution in bioreactor culture wells, we developed a finite element (FE) heat transfer model using COMSOL Multiphysics software (Burlington, MA). The hydrogel dissipation was considered as a heat source generating 9000 W/m<sup>3</sup> (determined experimentally based on area of hysteresis loop at 1 Hz) in each step of cyclic compression. The solid and the fluid phases of the porous scaffold were coupled based on theory of poro-elasticity and a linear viscoelastic behavior for the solid part was assumed as described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the heat transfer module was coupled to the resultant pressure/velocity field in porous media to consider convective heat transfer mechanism. In the model, the 2D axisymmetric cross section of cylindrical samples (2.2 mm thickness and 4 mm radius) and culture medium were divided into FEs and boundary conditions were applied as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>. The cyclic displacement (10% strain @ 1 Hz) was applied on the interface of the piston with sample-medium domains and stress, strain, velocity, pressure, and temperature fields were solved in a fully coupled manner. The model was examined for different mesh sizes to ensure that results are not changed with elements size. We assumed isotropic mechanical behavior for the poro-viscoleastic scaffold with material properties according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Material properties used in the heat transfer model of the hydrogel in the culture well.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Material properties</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Value</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Unit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Equilibrium modulus (Eeq)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">kPa</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Poisson ratio(ν)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.23</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Porosity (φ)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">68</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Permeability (k)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2·1e<sup>–14</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">m<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dissipative power of hydrogel</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9000</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w/m<sup>3</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Heat capacity of pHEMA (C<sub>solid</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1308</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">J/(kg·kelvin)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Conductivity of pHEMA (K<sub>solid</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">W/(m·kelvin)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Heat capacity of water (C<sub>fluid</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4200</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">J/(kg·kelvin)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Conductivity of water (K<sub>fluid</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">W/(m·kelvin)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biot–Willis coefficient (α)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation modulus (G<sub>1</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">200</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">kPa</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation modulus (G<sub>2</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">58</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">kPa</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation modulus (G<sub>3</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">215</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">kPa</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation time (τ<sub>1</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.42</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">s</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation time (τ<sub>2</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5.82</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">s</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Relaxation time (τ<sub>3</sub>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">s</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cartilage loading-induced self-heating in vitro</title><p>Human epiphyseal chondro-progenitor cells were expanded in 2D culture according to standard cell culture protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darwiche et al., 2012</xref>) before seeding them into porous hydrogels.

As the authors hypothesize, calcium signaling is a major mechanism of action in transduction of thermo-mechanical cues sensed by TRPV4 channels. However, the available data on calcium signaling pathways do not support this conclusion strongly.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that full removal of external calcium sources could further diminish the enhanced chondrogenic response obtained by thermo-mechanical cues when compared with TRPV4 inhibition alone. Specifically, downregulation of Agc and COMP and upregulation of Twist1 were significantly different in the presence of EGTA compared to the condition in which TRPV4 antagonist was used (see Figure 4). This different response could arise from two plausible reasons. First, TRPV4 channels were not fully blocked by GSK 205 and the conveyed signal was strong enough to partially activate some of the channels. This is consistent with other studies where quantitative results indicated that 10 µm GSK205 significantly inhibited but did not fully abolish TRPV4 channel activity. A second possibility would be that, parallel thermo-mechanically responsive pathways besides TRPV4 were involved in ca<sup>2+</sup> mediation in order to make this process more effective and robust. This is not surprising as accumulating evidence in the literature suggests that distinct calcium pathways, including stretch-activated channels (e.g. PIEZO1), voltage-gated calcium channels (e.g., T-type VGCC), purinergic receptors (e.g., P2Y or P2X), PLC-IP3 induced endoplasmic reticulum and TRP family channels (e.g., TRPV3), are directly or indirectly influenced by an externally applied stimulus. Determining other probable contributing mediators in thermo-mechanotransduction processes are thus important next steps and need further investigation to understand the overall mechanisms.</p><p>The above discussion was already in the first draft of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The gel structure seems to provide a complex environment at the cellular level since cells are embedded with large pores rather than individual encapsulated. What is the average pore size?</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to cartilage dissipation, other factors such as ambient temperature and heat transfer from surrounding tissues could contribute to the temperature evolution in the knee joint. Therefore, it is unlikely to have the same temperature evolution if we load the cartilage explants in a conventional compression bioreactor. Given the volume of the culture medium in each well, the size of the sample and the system boundary conditions, the accumulated lost energy from the dissipative test samples could negligibly change the temperature (&lt;0.5°C) in an in vitro system. Our heat transfer simulation confirmed this observation when the well interface temperature was kept constant at 32°C (Figure 2—figure supplement 6). However, in an unrealistic adiabatic condition, our numerical simulation showed a temperature rise (Figure 2—figure supplement 7) due to hydrogel dissipative capacity (see supplemental info for detail). Therefore, the developed modular bioreactor is necessary for evaluating the role of temperature rise during mechanical loading in a laboratory design. Yet, the use of human articular cartilage explants instead of cell-seeded constructs in our customized bioreactor can better reproduce the in vivo thermomechanical environment. However, the difficulty in controlling healthy human articular cartilage with similar size and physiological state was the main reason for which we developed a reproducible model and used cell-laden hydrogels. Moreover, we did not use animal explants as the recorded temperature rise obtained for human volunteers during physical activity and such data for temperature rise inside intra-articular cavity of animals was not available. This temperature evolution rate was shown to be important in this manuscript.</p><p>The pore size distribution is mainly between 100-200 µm as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Images of the cells show that they are not rounded but that they are attached and spread on the scaffold. How would this be expected to influence. What was the ratio of col2 to col1, as a measure of chondrogenesis? It is referenced as Figure 3 but this only shows relative expression to the control group for each gene.</p></disp-quote><p>As known, one mechanism by which cells may sense the externally applied stress is through their integrin interaction with anchored ligands within the extra cellular matrix. Despite controversial roles of ECM-mimetic elements in modulation of cell chondrogenic differentiation in free swelling hydrogels, a positive influence was observed for cell-laden hydrogels containing RGD in presence of dynamic loading . In particular, it is suggested that the moderate attachment of cells to hydrogel can make preculture time unnecessary for pericellular matrix formation before mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panadero et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has already been mentioned in the first version of the manuscript that cells could detach in non-modified scaffolds when cyclic compression was combined with temperature rise. This could lead to poor RNA extraction (low amount and quality) after multiple biophysical stimuli. We therefore employed ECM-mimetic functionalization of synthetic hydrogels to enhance cells adhesion and mechano-sensing during stimulation.</p><p>Despite providing a round morphology and chondro-inductive environment, encapsulation of cells in conventional hydrogels (alginate, agarose, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, etc) leads to cell-laden constructs with low stiffness dissimilar to cartilage properties. The ideal construct would be a mechanically capable scaffold that provides an environment for moderate cell adhesion and could maintain round morphology of cells. This might be realized by cell encapsulation into an adhesive soft hydrogel with endogenous binding sites for cells which is firmly integrated in a stiff and porous 3D support with load-bearing capacity . It is also suggested that covalent attachment between the soft and stiff components of the construct is important to properly transfer applied stimulus to cells. The limitation of our porous dissipative hydrogel for this method of construct preparation is its intentional low permeability (order of E<sup>-14</sup> m<sup>2</sup>) to induce frictional drag dissipation. The permeability can be increased by enlarging the size of the pores and providing full interconnectivity within the porous structure. However, in this condition recapitulating cartilage dissipation cannot be achieved. The focus of current research was studying effect of loading induced temperature evolution on cell behavior by a reasonable in vitro model. Indeed, this system has its own limitation and the spread morphology of the cells in our dissipative porous hydrogels is one of them. Given the fact that we employed identically prepared cell-scaffolds constructs for all of our experimentation, we assumed that the isolated role of externally applied stimuli on cell chondrogenic response could be evaluated irrespective of cell morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

It is known that the reciprocal relationship between cells and ECM governs cartilage hemostasis as chondrocytes receive physical cues and regulate tissue turnover to maintain its functional characteristics. Chondrogenesis covers different stages of differentiation during chondrocyte maturation and a promoted gene expression is its molecular level reference. An altered gene expression is generally considered as the first indicator for cells responsiveness to conveyed cues which could ultimately lead to long term matrix deposition depending on other contributing factors. Our customized model system enabled us to show that chondrogenic cells immediately responded to biomimetic thermo-mechanical cues by altering their gene expression and that cells are able to sense the transient temperature rise. We evaluated cellular reactions after three rounds of stimulation to consider their probable desensitization and estimate a robust transcriptional response. However, given the transient nature of the chondrogenic markers to an applied stimulation, analysis of results at different time points could help to better understand the gene expression profile. Furthermore, it still remains to be determined to what extent the promoted chondrogenic gene expression could enhance downstream protein expression and functional properties. The workload of additional experiments and analysis to evaluate protein expression and functional properties is indeed out of scope of the current manuscript. However, as mentioned in the previous response to reviewer letter , our group has recently examined GAG synthesis following application of mechanical, thermal and thermomechanical stimuli and observed the highest s-GAG/DNA accumulation when samples received combined stimuli. These results indicate that application of dynamic thermo-mechanical stimulus can significantly improve chondrocyte ability to secrete matrix components following enhanced expression of chondrogenic genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
