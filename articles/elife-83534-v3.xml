domains of proteins. However, as cholesterol concentration rises above the PM’s sequestration capacity, a new pool of cholesterol, called accessible cholesterol, emerges. The transport of accessible cholesterol between the PM and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. This pathway has also been implicated in the suppression of both bacterial and viral pathogens by immunomodulatory oxysterols. Here, we describe a mechanism of depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). We show that 25HC-mediated activation of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) in the ER creates an imbalance in the equilibrium distribution of accessible cholesterol between the ER and PM. This imbalance triggers the rapid internalization of accessible cholesterol from the PM, and this depletion is sustained for long periods of time through 25HC-mediated suppression of SREBPs and continued activation of ACAT. In support of a physiological role for this mechanism, 25HC failed to suppress Zika virus and human coronavirus infection in ACAT-deficient cells, and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection in ACAT-deficient cells and mice. We propose that selective depletion of accessible PM cholesterol triggered by ACAT activation and sustained through SREBP suppression underpins the immunological activities of 25HC and a functionally related class of oxysterols.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Listeria monocytogenes</kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>plasma

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential component of the membranes of animal cells and its levels are tightly regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms that control its production, uptake, and intracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Dysregulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis is implicated in many human diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shimano and Sato, 2017</xref>). There is also growing evidence that membrane cholesterol modulation plays key roles in host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cyster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). While the proteins and pathways that mediate cholesterol regulation have been extensively studied, how these processes are rapidly altered during infection remains poorly defined.</p><p>Most of a mammalian cell’s cholesterol is concentrated in the plasma membrane (PM), where the molecule makes up 40–50% of the total lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). The steady state levels of PM cholesterol are regulated by balancing the flow of cholesterol into and out of the PM. Inflows to the PM originate from two locations – (i) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where cholesterol is synthesized; and (ii) lysosomes where cholesterol is liberated from low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that bind to LDL receptors on the PM and are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>). Upon arrival at the PM from these locations, the incoming cholesterol forms complexes with sphingomyelin (SM) and other PM phospholipids, which imparts the PM with structural properties required for proper cellular function and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</xref>). Cholesterol in excess of the sequestering capacity of PM phospholipids forms a pool that has been termed ‘accessible cholesterol’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2014</xref>). Expansion of this pool signals cholesterol overaccumulation and triggers flow of accessible cholesterol out of the cell by PM cholesterol efflux proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Venkateswaran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Repa and Mangelsdorf, 2000</xref>), or into the cell by cholesterol transporters that move the lipid to organelles such as the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The accessible cholesterol that is transported to the ER interacts with two regulatory membrane proteins, a cholesterol sensor called Scap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Radhakrishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>) and a cholesterol-modifying enzyme called acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), also designated as sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu and Tabas, 1991</xref>). Binding of cholesterol to Scap prevents the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors that upregulate genes for lipid production, including those for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). The ACAT enzyme converts some of the incoming cholesterol to cholesteryl esters for storage in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional and enzymatic responses induced by accessible cholesterol arriving at the ER combine to reduce cellular cholesterol and protect the PM from cholesterol overaccumulation.</p><p>While accessible cholesterol in the PM plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and regulating cell growth, this pool of cholesterol can also be a vulnerability as it is exploited by numerous bacteria and viruses to promote infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Fortunately, animal cells have devised a clever solution to rectify this vulnerability. The solution involves an innate immune response that stimulates the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), an enzyme that attaches a hydroxyl group to the iso-octyl sidechain of cholesterol to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a potent signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lund et al., 1998</xref>). 25HC produced by macrophage cells in response to infection acts in a paracrine manner to induce rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol, but not cholesterol in complexes with SM, from the PMs of nearby cells. Such depletion prevents the spread of infection by bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020a</xref>) as well as cellular infection by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, 25HC acts in an autocrine manner to prevent macrophage lysis by bacterial pore-forming toxins that target accessible cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Establishing the mechanisms of how 25HC rapidly depletes accessible cholesterol from PMs has been complicated due to this oxysterol’s actions on multiple cholesterol homeostatic pathways, including (<italic>i</italic>) binding to Insigs, which suppresses the activation of SREBPs and reduces cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Radhakrishnan et al., 2007</xref>); (<italic>ii</italic>) activating Liver X receptors (LXRs), transcription factors that upregulate genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Venkateswaran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costet et al., 2000</xref>); and (<italic>iii</italic>) stimulating the activity of ACAT, which esterifies cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1975</xref>). Each of these actions would lower levels of total cellular cholesterol, which would then be expected to lower accessible cholesterol in PMs. The recent studies on 25HC’s role in restricting pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) have pointed to the involvement of two of these pathways – ACAT and SREBP – in depleting accessible cholesterol from PMs; however, several questions remain unanswered. First, what is the primary target of 25HC that initiates depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM? Second, what is the underlying mechanism by which 25HC depletes PMs of accessible cholesterol? Third, how does 25HC sustain low levels of accessible PM cholesterol over long time periods necessary to disrupt the lifecycles of pathogens in vivo? Finally, does 25HC inhibit both bacterial and viral infections through a common mechanism?</p><p>Here, using a panel of oxysterols with diverse structures and cell lines deficient in key components that regulate cholesterol homeostasis, we find that rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs by 25HC is solely determined by ACAT activity. Stimulation of ACAT by 25HC siphons off cholesterol that arrives at the ER for conversion to cholesteryl esters, forcing a redistribution of cellular cholesterol, which ultimately leads to a decrease in accessible PM cholesterol. Once initiated through ACAT, the depletion of accessible PM cholesterol persists for longer periods through 25HC’s inhibition of transcriptional pathways responsible for cholesterol synthesis and uptake as well as 25HC’s continued activation of ACAT. In the absence of ACAT, 25HC no longer protects cells from lysis by cytolysins secreted by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, or infection by Zika virus and coronaviruses. Moreover, in an ACAT-deficient animal model, 25HC-mediated protection of the spleen and liver from infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is reduced. Together, these studies unite the disparate reports of antibacterial and antiviral properties of 25HC through a common mechanism orchestrated by ACAT.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Side-chain oxysterols like 25HC trigger rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from PMs</title><p>To carry out a detailed examination of the effects of 25HC on PM cholesterol, we chose Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a model cellular system since these cells have been used for more than two decades to study cholesterol regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldstein et al., 2002</xref>). To detect accessible cholesterol in PMs of live cells, we used domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4), a non-lytic protein sensor that specifically detects this pool of cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gay et al., 2015</xref>). When a line of CHO cells designated CHO-K1 were grown in cholesterol-rich fetal calf serum (FCS), their PMs contained high levels of accessible cholesterol that were readily detected by ALOD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref><italic>, lane 1 of top panels</italic>). When these cells were incubated with 25HC for increasing times, ALOD4 binding declined sharply after 1 hr and was eliminated after 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>, top panel</italic>). When treated with increasing concentrations of 25HC, ALOD4 binding was sharply reduced after treatment with 1 µM 25HC and eliminated when 25HC exceeded 2.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref><italic>, top panel</italic>).

Oxysterols with hydroxyl groups at carbon 24 (<italic>G</italic>, <italic>H</italic>) partially reduced ALOD4 binding, whereas oxysterols with hydroxyl groups on carbon 22 (<italic>E</italic>, <italic>F</italic>) had no effect. These data indicate that the location of the hydroxyl modification on the sterol side-chain plays a crucial role in controlling accessible PM cholesterol. Moreover, the ability of a side-chain oxysterol like 25HC (<italic>I</italic>) to reduce ALOD4 binding required the 3β-hydroxyl group since replacement of this group with a sulfate group (<italic>K</italic>) abolished this effect. No reduction of ALOD4 binding was detected with oxysterols bearing hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus at carbons 4 (<italic>A</italic>), 7 (<italic>B</italic>), or 19 (<italic>C</italic>). While oxysterols <italic>D, G, H, I,</italic> and <italic>J</italic> reduced ALOD4 binding in an all-or-none fashion, they had no detectable effect on the binding of Ostreolysin A (OlyA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), a sensor for the SM-sequestered pool of PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endapally et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>).

We first tested the oxysterol specificity for activation of ACAT’s enzymatic activity using a well-established cellular assay that measures ACAT’s ability to attach [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate, a radiolabeled fatty acid, to cholesterol to generate cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we generated a CHO-K1 cell line that lacks ACAT enzymatic activity. Mammalian cells contain two isoforms of ACAT, ACAT1 and ACAT2, however previous studies of CHO cells have shown that ~99% of their ACAT activity arises from the ACAT1 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cadigan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the gene encoding ACAT1 (<italic>Soat1</italic>) in CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The resulting ACAT1-deficient cells, hereafter designated as ACAT1 knockout (KO) cells, had undetectable levels of ACAT1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, ACAT enzymatic activity, as judged by cholesteryl[<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formation, was stimulated by 25HC, one of the five oxysterols that triggered ACAT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), to an expected degree in wild-type (WT) cells but not in ACAT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <italic>first two groups</italic>), further indicating that the ACAT1 KO cells lacked ACAT activity. To ensure that these results were due to loss of ACAT activity, we stably expressed in the ACAT1 KO cells either wild-type human ACAT1 or a mutant version harboring a point mutation (H460A) that abolishes ACAT1’s enzymatic activity, and the resulting cell lines were designated as ACAT1 KO; hACAT1(WT) and ACAT1 KO; hACAT1(H460A), respectively. Compared to the ACAT1 KO cells, these two new cell lines contained high levels of ACAT1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of ACAT enzymatic activity by 25HC was restored by the stable expression of hACAT1(WT), but not hACAT1(H460A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> <italic>last two groups</italic>). Thus, these four cell lines provide a framework to study the specific role of ACAT activity in determining accessible cholesterol levels in PMs.</p><p>We then measured the effects of 25HC on accessible cholesterol in the PMs of these four cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In contrast, no such depletion was observed in ACAT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lanes 1–6, third panel</italic>). Restoration of ACAT activity by stable expression of hACAT1(WT) reestablished the ability of 25HC to deplete accessible PM cholesterol, whereas 25HC had no effect in cells stably expressing an inactive mutant of hACAT1 (H460A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>lanes 1–6, fifth and seventh panels</italic>). When each of these four cell lines were depleted of sterols and then treated with 25HC, we observed similar dose dependences for suppression of SREBP2 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that 25HC entered the cells and reached their ER membranes to bind Insigs and prevent SREBP2 transport. Thus, the inability of 25HC to deplete accessible PM cholesterol in ACAT1 KO cells is not simply due to a defect in cellular entry of 25HC.

How then can activation of ACAT, a cholesterol-modifying enzyme in the ER membrane, rapidly alter the levels of the accessible cholesterol pool in the PM? Previous studies have suggested that even though the total cholesterol concentrations in the PM and ER are quite different, the concentration of accessible cholesterol in the two membranes may be similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wattenberg and Silbert, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>). The equivalence in accessible cholesterol levels between the PM and ER is maintained by rapid bi-directional transport of cholesterol between the two membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009</xref>). Based on these previous insights, we propose that ACAT activation, and the resulting production of cholesteryl esters, would siphon off some of the accessible cholesterol from the ER, thus lowering levels of accessible cholesterol in the ER relative to the PM. Cholesterol transport from the PM to the ER would then rapidly restore the equivalence of accessible cholesterol between the two membranes. As a result, levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM would decline.</p><p>The above model provides a possible explanation for how ACAT activation by 25HC would lead to a depletion of accessible PM cholesterol in WT cells, but not in ACAT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We further tested this model by activating ACAT not by 25HC but by lipoproteins, which have been shown to generate high ACAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>). We then took advantage of the sensitivity of flow cytometry analysis to assess levels of accessible and SM-sequestered cholesterol in the PMs of WT and ACAT1 KO cells with fluorescent versions of ALOD4 and OlyA, respectively. When cells are grown under low cholesterol conditions (lipoprotein-deficient serum, LPDS), ACAT activity is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>). Under these conditions, both WT and ACAT1 KO cells had the same low levels of accessible and SM-sequestered cholesterol in their PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By comparison, when cells are grown under high cholesterol conditions (FCS), ACAT activity is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldstein et al., 1983</xref>). In this case, the PMs of ACAT1 KO cells had significantly higher levels of accessible cholesterol as compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result is consistent with the model proposed above since the ACAT1 KO cells, unlike the WT cells, are unable to siphon away ER cholesterol, leading to higher levels of accessible cholesterol in the PMs of these cells. Importantly, there was no difference in levels of SM-sequestered cholesterol in the PMs of WT and ACAT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), highlighting the specific effect of the ACAT pathway on accessible PM cholesterol.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Intracellular cholesterol trafficking and steady state levels of PM accessible cholesterol in ACAT-deficient cells.</title><p>On day 0, wild-type and ACAT1-deficient CHO-K1 cells were set up in medium B at a density of 5x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well of a 24-well plate (<bold>A, B</bold>) or 6x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well of a 48-well plate (<bold>C - E</bold>).

First, we depleted cholesterol from the PMs of FCS-treated cells by incubation with HPCD, which extracts cholesterol from PMs. The reduction in PM cholesterol is rapidly compensated for by drawing cholesterol from the ER, leading to a reduction in ER cholesterol levels and an increase in SREBP2 cleavage. In both WT and ACAT1 KO cells, HPCD treatment reduced ER cholesterol levels with similar time dependences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the pathways that transport cholesterol from ER to PM are not affected in the ACAT1 KO cells.</p><p>Second, we depleted both cell lines of cholesterol by incubation overnight in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient serum along with compactin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1978</xref>).

We then removed the 25HC and examined accessible PM cholesterol levels over time.

In line with our model of equivalence of accessible cholesterol levels in the PM and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we expected that ER accessible cholesterol levels would also be low 22 hr after 25HC removal, which would be reflected in increased cleavage of SREBP2 to its nuclear form.

Moreover, HPCD depletion triggered SREBP2 cleavage in an expected fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>second panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 1, 2</italic>), and this cleavage was suppressed at the same time as an increase in PM accessible cholesterol was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>second panel, lanes 3–8</italic>). These data further support the notion that 25HC’s long-term effects arise due to its suppression of SREBP cleavage. If this was the case, we would expect 25HC’s effects to be overcome by expression of the cleaved nuclear forms of SREBPs. We tested this possibility in previously developed cell lines where expression of the cleaved nuclear forms of each of the three isoforms of SREBPs – SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2 – can be induced by addition of the small molecule muristerone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the absence of muristerone, these cells had detectable levels of accessible cholesterol in their PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>lane 1</italic>). 25HC treatment depleted this pool and no replenishment was observed 22 hr after the 25HC was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>lanes 2, 3</italic>). We then treated the cells with muristerone to induce the expression of the nuclear forms of each of the three SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>lanes 4–6</italic>). Under these conditions, the accessible cholesterol in the PMs of these cells was also depleted by 25HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>lanes 4, 5</italic>). However, when the 25HC was removed, we now detected replenishment of accessible cholesterol on the PMs of cells expressing the nuclear forms of SREBP1a and SREBP2, but not SREBP1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>lane 6</italic>). This isoform specificity for restoring accessible PM cholesterol is consistent with the previous observation that the nuclear forms of SREBP1a and SREBP2, but not SREBP1c, increase cholesterol synthesis and induce expression of the LDL receptor allowing for uptake of cholesterol from the LDL in FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pai et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>While the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> point to an important role for SREBP suppression in mediating 25HC’s long-term depletion of accessible PM cholesterol, we wondered whether continued activation of ACAT by the lingering 25HC could also play a role. To test this possibility, we treated CHO-K1 cells with 25HC for 4 hr, which depleted accessible cholesterol from the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>first and third panels</italic>, <italic>lanes 1, 2</italic>). We then removed the 25HC and added back media containing cholesterol-rich FCS without and with SZ58-035, a small molecule that potently inhibits ACAT enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ross et al., 1984</xref>). In the absence of SZ58-035, we observed no replenishment of accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>first panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 3–8</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of SZ58-035, we began to detect accessible cholesterol on PMs after 8 hr and ~60% of the initial level of accessible PM cholesterol was restored after 22 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>third panel, lanes 3–8</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Based on these data, we hypothesized that 25HC acts through two distinct, temporally resolved stages. First, a short pulse of 25HC activates ACAT, which siphons away ER cholesterol resulting in rapid depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM. Second, 25HC’s suppression of SREBP-mediated uptake and synthesis of cholesterol combined with continued activation of ACAT, results in sustained depletion of accessible cholesterol in the PM. We next asked whether initial ACAT activation was required for depletion of accessible cholesterol over long time periods, or whether this could be achieved simply through sustained SREBP inhibition by residual 25HC? To answer this question, we compared the responses of WT and ACAT1 KO cells to depletion of accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As expected, HPCD treatment (1 hr) induced the depletion of accessible PM cholesterol in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>lanes 1, 2</italic>), and this depletion was fully reversed 22 hr after HPCD removal (<italic>lane 3</italic>), indicating that this mode of cholesterol depletion occurred independently of ACAT activity. A different result was observed after 25HC treatment for 4 hr. In WT cells, 25HC depleted the accessible cholesterol as expected and no replenishment was observed after the 25HC was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>first panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 4, 5</italic>). However, in ACAT1 KO cells, 25HC did not deplete accessible PM cholesterol and there was no further change after the 25HC was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>third panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 4, 5</italic>). Thus, without the initial action of 25HC on ACAT, the lingering intracellular 25HC that inhibits new cholesterol synthesis and uptake through suppressing SREBP activation is not enough to reduce accessible PM cholesterol, even after 22 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ACAT activation by 25HC protects cells from pore formation by bacterial cytolysins</title><p>Having determined how ACAT-activating oxysterols trigger both rapid and sustained depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM, we next sought to determine if these mechanisms are responsible for the previously reported immunological effects of 25HC. Recent studies have indicated that 25HC protects cells from pore-forming activities of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) that exploit accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ormsby et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ormsby et al., 2021</xref>). We used ACAT1 KO CHO-K1 cells as a model to test whether ACAT activation is the primary mechanism for 25HC’s protection from pore formation by two CDCs, Anthrolysin O (ALO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mosser and Rest, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) and Perfringolysin O (PFO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tweten et al., 2015</xref>). Dose curve analysis showed that much lower concentrations of ALO were required to form pores in ACAT1 KO cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>), consistent with the higher amounts of accessible cholesterol in the PMs of ACAT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, stable expression of hACAT1(WT), but not inactive hACAT1(H460A), in the ACAT1 KO cells rendered them less susceptible to pore formation by ALO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Similar results were obtained with PFO, although the extents of the dose dependency shifts were less dramatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we treated each of these four cell lines with 25HC for 4 hr and then measured the ability of ALO and PFO to rapidly form pores.

Since then, 25HC has been found to affect virtually every aspect of cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, the biological role of this oxysterol has remained mysterious since mice lacking CH25H, the enzyme that produces 25HC, have no defects in cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Russell, 2003</xref>). A role for 25HC in the immune system was first recognized with the finding that stimulation of macrophage Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induced expression of CH25H and production of 25HC, suppressing the production of immunoglobulin A by B cells as part of the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauman et al., 2009</xref>). There is also growing evidence that 25HC exhibits potent antibacterial and antiviral properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cyster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Spann and Glass, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Griffiths and Wang, 2021</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In this study, we provide a potentially unifying model for the broad immunological activities of 25HC. The model builds on recent observations that bacteria and viruses exploit a small pool of cholesterol in the host cell’s PM, termed accessible cholesterol, to promote infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We show that 25HC manipulates pathways normally used to maintain cholesterol homeostasis to (i) rapidly deplete accessible PM cholesterol; and (ii) maintain this depleted state over an extended period of time to deliver long-lasting protection against bacterial and viral infection.</p><p>A striking feature of 25HC is its ability to act within 30–60 min to deplete accessible PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that 25HC swiftly depletes accessible PM cholesterol primarily through stimulation of ACAT’s enzymatic activity, and not through its effects on LXR and SREBP transcriptional pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Since ACAT resides in the ER, we were surprised that its activation could rapidly deplete accessible cholesterol from the membrane of a different organelle, the PM. Our studies suggest that such depletion occurs by exploiting the rapid transport pathways that normally move cholesterol between the PM and ER to maintain an equivalence of accessible cholesterol between the two membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Activation of ACAT siphons off some of the ER accessible cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters, which results in an imbalance in accessible cholesterol levels between the PM and the ER. The rapid movement of cholesterol between the two membranes swiftly rectifies this imbalance and leads to a net lower level of accessible cholesterol in both membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, 25HC exploits existing cholesterol homeostatic features to rapidly deplete accessible PM cholesterol. In line with this model, a prescient earlier study showed that 25HC activation of ACAT in macrophages reduces a pool of PM cholesterol that is accessible for modification by the enzyme cholesterol oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tabas et al., 1988</xref>). It remains to be determined whether 25HC activation of ACAT depletes accessible cholesterol from other cholesterol-rich organelles such as lysosomes.</p><p>A potentially confounding observation is that stimulation of mouse macrophage TLRs by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) increases CH25H expression only for a short period of time (~4 hr), after which CH25H expression declines down to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>). How then could short-lived production of 25HC protect cells from bacterial and viral infections that occur over much longer time periods? Remarkably, we found that in cells exposed to 25HC for short periods of time (4 hr), accessible PM cholesterol levels remained low even after 22 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This result was surprising since one would expect that depletion of accessible PM cholesterol would also deplete accessible cholesterol in the ER, leading to upregulation of SREBP transcription factors that would increase cholesterol synthesis and uptake to replenish accessible PM cholesterol. Indeed, such replenishment is observed when accessible PM cholesterol is depleted by treatment with a cholesterol-extracting reagent such as HPCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, after cells were exposed to 25HC for 4 hr, the residual amounts of 25HC that remained in the cells was sufficient to maintain SREBPs in their inactive state over an extended period of 22 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, 25HC achieves both rapid and long-lasting depletion of accessible PM cholesterol through its concerted effects on ACAT and SREBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the panel of oxysterols studied here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is by no means an exhaustive list, it is worth noting that the four other oxysterols that deplete accessible cholesterol from PMs through stimulation of ACAT activity (20(<italic>R</italic>)HC, 24(<italic>R</italic>)HC, 24(<italic>S</italic>)HC, and 27HC) also suppress the activation of SREBP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). It is attractive to speculate that these other oxysterols may also regulate accessible PM cholesterol in other biological contexts.</p><p>The model we propose for 25HC’s anti-bacterial and anti-viral functions is dependent on ACAT activation as the initiator of rapid depletion of accessible PM cholesterol. In the absence of ACAT activity, 25HC loses the ability to protect cells from lysis by cytolysins secreted by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and infection by Zika virus and coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In mammalian cells, ACAT activity arises from two isoforms – ACAT1 and ACAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). While ACAT activity can be completely abolished in cultured cells through CRISPR-mediated deletion of either or both isoforms of ACAT, an animal knockout of both isoforms of ACAT is not currently available. However, 25HC’s ability to protect against infection by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> was completely lost in ACAT1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further studies are needed to identify the cell types targeted by 25HC since the ACAT1-deficient mice lost ACAT activity in peritoneal macrophages and adrenal tissue, but not in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meiner et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>An outstanding question that has yet to be answered is how pathogens exploit accessible PM cholesterol for infection and how 25HC-mediated loss of accessible PM cholesterol provides immune protection. In the case of cytolysins such as Perfringolysin O and Anthrolysin O that bind accessible cholesterol on the outer PM leaflet, oligomerize, and form lytic pores, it is plausible that depletion of accessible PM cholesterol would confer protection by preventing cytolysin binding. However, how depletion of accessible PM cholesterol protects against intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or viruses remains largely unknown. We suspect that accessible PM cholesterol regulates the activities of one or more protein receptors involved in these processes, as has been shown for proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</xref>). It is worth noting that cholesterol has been implicated in the regulation of several immune receptor signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the principles and tools described in the current study promise to aid in uncovering the mechanisms by which accessible PM cholesterol is exploited by pathogens and is mobilized by the host immune system through 25HC and other functionally related oxysterols.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW; Approval Reference Number: APN102346).

Previous studies have shown that ~99% of ACAT activity in CHO cells arises from ACAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cadigan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1995</xref>), whereas ACAT activity in Huh7.5 cells arises from both ACAT1 and ACAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pramfalk et al., 2020</xref>). To generate cells that lacked ACAT activity, we therefore disrupted the gene encoding ACAT1 in CHO-K1 cells (<italic>Soat1</italic>) and the genes encoding both ACAT1 and ACAT2 in Huh7.5 cells (<italic>SOAT1</italic> and <italic>SOAT2</italic>) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ran et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To generate mutant CHO-K1 cells, guide RNAs targeting exons 2 (5ʹ-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGGAACCGGCTGTCAAAATC</named-content>-3’) and 14 (5ʹ-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATAGCTCAAGCAGACAGCGA</named-content>-3’) of <italic>Soat1</italic> (ACAT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were designed using the Benchling CRISPR guide RNA design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.benchling.com/crispr">https://www.benchling.com/crispr</ext-link>) and cloned into the lentiviral vector lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene 52961) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>). For lentivirus production, HEK293T cells were set up in medium E at a density of 4x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well of polylysine-coated six-well plates. The next day, cells were transfected with four plasmids: (i) a puromycin-selectable lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid encoding a guide targeting exon 2 of <italic>Soat1</italic> (0.5 µg); (ii) a blasticidin-selectable lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid encoding a guide targeting exon 14 of <italic>Soat1</italic> (0.5 µg); (iii) a plasmid encoding HIV gag-polymerase (0.8 µg); and (iv) a plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (0.2 µg). Transfections were carried out in 1 ml of medium G using X-tremeGENE 9 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 6 hr, the media containing transfection reagents was removed and replaced with 1.5 ml of fresh medium G. After 48 hr, the media was removed and stored, and 1.5 ml of fresh medium G was added to the cells. After an additional 24 hr, media was removed and combined with the media collected after 48 hr. The pooled media was supplemented with 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 4 µg/ml hexadimethrine bromide, a cationic polymer that increases the efficiency of lentiviral transduction, and subjected to centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min. The supernatants containing lentiviral particle-rich media were stored at –80 °C.</p><p>To generate ACAT1-deficient cells using this lentivirus, CHO-K1 cells were set up on day 0 in medium B at a density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well of a 12-well plate. On day 1, media was removed and replaced with 1 ml medium H plus 120 µl of lentiviral particle-rich medium. The plate was then subjected to centrifugation at 1000 x g for 30 min at 37 °C, following which the spin-inoculated cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 24 hr, the media was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, following which 1 ml of medium B was added to each well. After 72 hr, transduced cells were selected by virtue of their ability to survive after incubation in medium B supplemented with 6 μg/ml puromycin and 12 μg/ml blasticidin for 14 days. During the 14-day selection period, media was removed every 2–3 days and replaced with fresh medium B supplemented with 6 µg/ml puromycin and 12 µg/ml blasticidin. Single cells were isolated by FACS and used to establish clonal cell lines. The <italic>Soat1</italic> genes in these lines were analyzed by genomic sequencing using primers to amplify exon 2 (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CTACAAGAGCTAGTTTCAGG</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCCTGTGTGTACAGTGCCTT</named-content>-3’) and exon 14 (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCACTCACCTTGAAGACCCA</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGGTTCCTCTCTACACACTCA</named-content>-3’). Sequencing analysis revealed one cell line that had a 4 bp deletion in both alleles of exon 14 resulting in a premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We did not detect any disruptions in the sequence of exon 2. This cell line was designated as CHO-K1 ACAT1 KO and used for analysis of the role of ACAT1 in maintaining accessible cholesterol on PMs.</p><p>The CHO-K1 ACAT1 KO cell line was also used as template to generate two additional cell lines expressing either WT human ACAT1 or a mutant version of human ACAT1 where H460, the catalytic histidine residue, was mutated to alanine (H460A). To achieve this goal, we used Gateway cloning methods to introduce either the WT or mutant <italic>Soat1</italic> gene (encoding ACAT1) into the pTRIP.CMV.IVSB.ires.TagRFP destination lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>Soat1</italic> genes were inserted upstream of two elements in the pTrip vector, an internal ribosomal entry site and Tag-RFP. Lentiviral particle-rich media was generated as described above and used to transduce the CHO-K1 ACAT1 KO cells using similar procedures as described above for CHO-K1 cells. After 72 hr, the transduced cells were washed once with PBS, removed from each well of 12-well plates by trypsinization, and transferred to 10 cm dishes in medium B. This procedure was repeated until a total of 2x10<sup>7</sup> cells were obtained. These cells were sorted by FACS to select RFP-positive cells from which clonal cell lines were established. Two cell lines that showed robust expression of human ACAT1 (WT or H460A versions) were selected for the studies reported here. All CHO-K1 ACAT1 KO cells were maintained under identical culture conditions as the parental CHO-K1 cells.</p><p>To generate an ACAT-deficient Huh7.5 cell line, we used CRISPR/Cas technology to first delete ACAT1 in Huh7.5 cells and then deleted ACAT2 in these ACAT1-deficient cells.

These guide RNAs were cloned into either a puromycin-selectable (exon 6 of <italic>SOAT1</italic>) or a blasticidin-selectable (exon 2 of <italic>SOAT2</italic>) lentiviral vector lentiCRISPR v2, and lentiviruses were generated as described above.</p><p>To generate ACAT-deficient cells using these lentiviruses, Huh7.5 cells were set up on day 0 in medium E at a density of 7x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well of a 12-well plate. On day 1, media was removed and replaced with 0.4 ml medium G plus 0.1 ml of lentivirus targeting exon 6 of <italic>SOAT1</italic> (ACAT1). After 6 hr, 2 mL of medium F was added to each well without removing the lentivirus. After additional incubation for 72 hr, cells from three wells of the 12-well plate were collected by trypsinization and set up in a single well of a six-well plate. After 24 hr, the media was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 2 ml of medium F supplemented with 8 µg/ml puromycin was added to each well. Puromycin selection was carried out for 14 days. During this selection period, media was removed every 2–3 days and replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium F supplemented with 8 µg/ml puromycin. After selection, single cells were isolated by FACS and set up in 96-well plates in 100 µl of medium F. Unfortunately, we were unable to establish clonal cell lines from these single-cell clones. To overcome this problem, 24 hr after the isolated single cells were set up in 96-well plates, we added Huh7.5 cells (1.5x10<sup>3</sup>) in 100 µl of medium F supplemented with additional FCS to reach a final concentration of 40% (v/v). After 5 days, 100 µl of medium F without FCS was added to each well to replenish media lost to evaporation. This replenishment step was repeated on the 10<sup>th</sup> day. After 15 days, the media was removed and replaced with 200 µl of medium F supplemented with 8 µg/ml puromycin. After an additional 7 days, only lentiviral-transduced cells survived, and these cells were collected by trypsinization and set up in 24-well plates in medium F supplemented with 8 µg/ml puromycin. After further selection for 3 days, surviving cells were expanded in medium F to obtain enough cells for genomic sequencing.

After 4 hr at 37 °C, the media was removed and replaced with 200 µl of either hCoV-OC43 virus or ZIKV-MR766-Venus virus in OptiMEM and incubated at 33 °C or 37 °C, respectively. After 1 hr, 800 µl of medium F was added to each well and maintained at either 33 °C or 37 °C as indicated above. After 24 hr, cells were harvested with Accumax, mixed with a 4% (v/v) stock solution of PFA in PBS (1% final concentration), and incubated for 10 min at RT, following which cells were analyzed by FACS either immediately or stored at 4 °C and processed at a later time.</p><p>Zika-infected cells were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatants were removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 150 µl of buffer E prior to FACS analysis.</p><p>OC43-infected cells were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatants were removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution. After incubation for 20 min at RT, 150 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution was added to each sample, after which samples were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatant was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution, and subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. After removing the supernatant, cell pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of anti-coronavirus group antigen antibody (1:50). After incubation for 30 min at RT, 150 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution was added, and samples were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatant was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution and subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatant was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of Goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor488 (1:1000). After incubation in the dark (wrapped in aluminum foil) for 30 min at RT, 150 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution was added and samples were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 200 µl of BD Wash/Perm Solution and subjected to centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min at RT. After this final step, the supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 150 µl of buffer E and analyzed on a Stratedigm S1000 EX Flow Cytometer using the GFP channel. Infection levels were determined as the percentage of Venus-positive cells (indicating Zika infection) or AlexaFluor488-positive cells (indicating OC43 infection) from at least 7500 single cells per replicate, as assessed by FlowJo software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were conducted at least three times with different litters of mice and with different batches of cells set up on different days.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Griffiths (Reviewer #1); Alan R. Tall (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You will be pleased to see below that the reviewers were generally quite positive. Nevertheless, they felt that the following issues need to be addressed in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1. Continued activation of ACAT could play a role in maintaining low cholesterol in the cells. This could be tested by using an ACAT inhibitor at later times in the chase after the initial 4-hour exposure to 25HC in the medium.</p><p>2. The authors used a high concentration of 25HC for their time course studies. If possible, it would be useful to know how the cellular concentration of 25HC compares with the amount generated in response to an infection. Is the 5 μM concentration relevant?</p><p>3. Please test whether ACAT inhibitors reduce this effect on cholesterol levels in macrophages, which are the relevant cell type.</p><p>4. Please quantify the western blots.</p><p>5. To provide some context for the concordant changes in ER and plasma membrane cholesterol, it would be helpful to mention that several studies have documented rapid equilibration of cholesterol among membranes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I would recommend that the abbreviation SOAT is also included. ACAT can be confused with acetyl-coenzyme A acetyltransferase.</p><p>2. Page 5 &amp; 6 and Figure 1, it would be much easier if the authors used simple abbreviations, 4βHC, 7αHC, 19HC rather than A, B, C, etc.</p><p>3. Figure 1. 20(R)-Hydroxycholesterol is an easier chemical nomenclature to follow than 20α-hydroxycholesterol. For completeness, I would define the stereochemistry at C25 in 27-hydroxycholesterol.</p><p>4. In the caption of Figure 4 it might be worth adding a note that a total of 25-HC was measured as a surrogate for free 25HC which I assume is the bioactive molecule. Or perhaps my assumption is wrong.</p><p>5. One thing I always wonder about is the oxysterol content of the medium, I guess it is low compared to the added 25HC, but I am guessing and don't really know.</p><p>Overall, a really nice paper that was a pleasure to read!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The paper only discusses cholesterol in the plasma membrane and the ER. However, other compartments, including the Golgi and the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) also contain cholesterol. In CHO cells the ERC contains over 30% of the cellular cholesterol (DOI 10.1074/jbc.M1088612). There are also papers describing rapid (t<sub>1/2</sub> 15 min) transport among these organelles, which is probably relevant for understanding the results in this paper. For example, cyclodextrin reduction of cholesterol will be compensated by cholesterol taken from several organelles – not just the ER. The rapid re-equilibration of cholesterol among membranes is not surprising given the rapid transport mediated by various sterol transporters.</p><p>2. Several of the figures show gels, and comparisons are made among conditions. It would be very helpful to have some quantification of these results and some indication of reproducibility.</p><p>3. For Figure 4, they used 5 μM 25HC, which is a high dose and probably is responsible for the long-lasting effects. At 8 hours, there is still about half the initial dose of 25HC in the cells, and they showed in Figure 1 that this would have a significant effect. It is likely that this amount of 25HC will still stimulate ACAT, preventing the cells from recovering. This hypothesis is easily tested with an ACAT inhibitor administered during the chase period. Thus, it is not just the continued effect on SREBP that is important.</p><p>4. They mention the effects on macrophages at the bottom of page 13. This could be tested easily with ACAT inhibitors in macrophages.</p><p>5. In Figure 7, it is confusing to change the scale for each panel.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A point for discussion or future investigation could be that the lingering effect of 25-OH cholesterol is not completely defined as to whether this reflects an ongoing effect of 25-OH cholesterol to bind Insigs and inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis or an effect on ACAT. In Figure 4D did ACAT1 KO prevent the effect of 25-OH cholesterol on the suppression of nuclear SREBP2? Would there be a way to more directly implicate sustained binding of low concentrations of 25-OH cholesterol to Insigs? It would also be helpful to know if concentrations of 25-OH cholesterol used in experiments or observed in cells are relevant to those likely to be achieved in the response to infectious agents in vivo.</p><p>Although the authors provide a focused and convincing discussion on the role of PM cholesterol in infectious processes, there are broader aspects of 25-OH cholesterol biology that are relevant to infectious processes that could be discussed and the topic broadened. In particular, Reboldi et al. (Science 2014) showed that 25-OH cholesterol acts to suppress the priming and activity of inflammasomes. This results in reduced inflammatory death but increased susceptibility to infection with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Although not necessarily contradictory, it would be interesting for the authors to discuss these earlier results in the context of their own findings.</p><p>Specific Points:</p><p>Line 96. Please cite the original report (Costet P et al., JBC 2000).</p><p>Lines 227-231. In Figure 2A ALOD4 binding seems somewhat reduced by 25-OH cholesterol in ACAT KO cells, especially after correction for actin. The same seems true when inactive ACAT is transected in the cells (bottom rows). How do the authors explain this? In Figure 2B the fOlyA fluorescence seems quite variable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83534.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You will be pleased to see below that the reviewers were generally quite positive.

We treated CHO-K1 cells with 5 µM of 25HC for 4 h, which completely abolished accessible cholesterol from the PMs (compare lane 2 to lane 1). We then removed the 25HC-containing media, washed the cells, and then added back media without 25HC. Similar to what we noted previously, no replenishment of accessible PM cholesterol was detected even after a 22 h recovery period (top two panels of Figure 4C). However, when we included 10 µM of an ACAT inhibitor (SZ58-035) during this recovery period, we began to detect accessible PM cholesterol after 8 h and ~60% of the initial level of accessible cholesterol was restored after 22 h (bottom two panels of Figure 4C and quantification in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2B). This result confirms the reviewers’ prediction that continued activation of ACAT by the lingering intracellular 25HC also plays a role in depleting accessible PM cholesterol over the longer time periods.</p><p>We have now carefully combed through our manuscript and modified all instances where we ascribed the long-term effects solely to 25HC’s effects on suppressing SREBP activation to also reflect ACAT’s contribution to the long-term depletion effects (tracked changes in revised manuscript). We are grateful to the reviewers for raising this point as it has helped clarify our mechanistic interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors used a high concentration of 25HC for their time course studies. If possible, it would be useful to know how the cellular concentration of 25HC compares with the amount generated in response to an infection. Is the 5 μM concentration relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>We would also love to know the amount of 25HC generated by a cell during infection, but as the reviewers can appreciate, measuring the concentration of 25HC in a particular cell is technically challenging. Even so, we can make some estimates based on measurements reported in the literature by us and others.</p><p>Two different studies (PMID: 32284563 and PMID: 23273843) reported that upon interferon-γ stimulation (25-500 U/ml for 12-24 h), the amount of 25HC secreted by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) into the extracellular media accumulated to a final concentration of ~0.4 µM. It is plausible that the concentration of 25HC inside of the 25HC-producing cell is much higher than the 0.4 µM value measured upon dilution into the extracellular medium.</p><p>One of the previous studies (PMID: 23273843) did also measure the intracellular 25HC produced after interferon-γ stimulation and reported a value of 0.2 nmol per 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Another group conducted a morphological analysis of macrophages and reported that their volume was 1000-5000 µm<sup>3</sup> (PMID: 9400735). Using these estimates, the intracellular concentration of 25HC upon interferon-γ stimulation could range from 40-200 µM.</p><p>The concentration of 5 µM that we use in many of our studies is between these bookend values and thus may not be completely unreasonable. We look forward to future technical breakthroughs which will allow a more precise answer to this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please test whether ACAT inhibitors reduce this effect on cholesterol levels in macrophages, which are the relevant cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>In this paper, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 knockout models to show that 25HCmediated depletion of accessible PM cholesterol is dependent on ACAT activity in hamster cells (CHO-K1) and a human hepatocyte cell line (Huh7.5). To answer the reviewer question about whether a similar ACAT-dependence operated in macrophage cells, we used a commercially available ACAT inhibitor (SZ58-035). We first tested whether SZ58-035 would inhibit ACAT activity in RAW macrophage cells (mouse). Using our standard ACAT activity assay (described in Figure 1F), we found that 25HCstimulated ACAT activity was partially reduced from 4.2 nmol/mg/h to 1.4 nmol/mg/h when the cells were pre-treated with 10 µM SZ58-035 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> – left 4 columns). Treatment with higher concentrations of SZ58-035 resulted in cell death. In contrast to the results with RAW cells, we observed almost complete inhibition of ACAT activity by 10 µM SZ58-035 in CHO-K1 cells, from 6.0 to 0.1 nmol/mg/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> – right 4 columns).</p><p>Even though SZ58-035 could not completely inhibit ACAT activity, we tested whether its partial inhibition of ACAT would affect 25HC’s ability to deplete accessible cholesterol from RAW cell PMs. When the macrophage cells were treated with 25HC in the absence of SZ58-035, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in accessible cholesterol levels (similar to other cell types) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> – top 2 panels). In the presence of the ACAT inhibitor, we observed that 25HC’s effects were greatly reduced, suggesting that even partial inhibition of ACAT activity was sufficient to inhibit 25HC’s effects in macrophage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> – bottom 2 panels). While this result is suggestive, a rigorous answer to the reviewer’s question will require generation of a macrophage cell line where both ACAT1 and ACAT2 have been eliminated by CRISPRCas9 methods or even better would be a comparison of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from ACAT1<sup>+/+</sup>/ACAT2<sup>+/+</sup> and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup>/ACAT2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We are currently working on generating these models and will report the results in a future study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of ACAT activity and depletion of accessible PM cholesterol by 25HC in RAW macrophage cells.</title><p>(A) ACAT activity [same procedure as in Figure 1F].

Measurements of 25HC in control media samples (DMEM/F12 with 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate) gave values ranging from 1-20 nM, well below the treatment concentrations that were in the μM range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The paper only discusses cholesterol in the plasma membrane and the ER. However, other compartments, including the Golgi and the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) also contain cholesterol. In CHO cells the ERC contains over 30% of the cellular cholesterol (DOI 10.1074/jbc.M1088612). There are also papers describing rapid (t<sub>1/2</sub> 15 min) transport among these organelles, which is probably relevant for understanding the results in this paper. For example, cyclodextrin reduction of cholesterol will be compensated by cholesterol taken from several organelles – not just the ER. The rapid re-equilibration of cholesterol among membranes is not surprising given the rapid transport mediated by various sterol transporters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that intracellular cholesterol trafficking involves organelles other than the PM and the ER such as the Golgi and the endocytic recycling compartment. We have chosen to keep our focus on the PM and the ER because the effect of 25HC studied here is depletion of accessible cholesterol from the PM and two of the 25HC targets that mediate this depletion (ACAT and SREBPs) are located in the ER. We also agree that the rapid re-equilibration of cholesterol among membranes such as the PM and ER has been known for a long time, although we were struck by how potently this process depends on ACAT activity. We had referenced 4 out of the many previous studies that have contributed to our understanding of intracellular cholesterol trafficking (Refs. 16, 48-50). In this revised submission, we have added an additional reference to an informative review on this subject (PMID: 19286471; Ref. 51). We have also included a sentence in the Discussion addressing the possibility that 25HC treatment could also deplete accessible cholesterol from other organelles (lines 547-548 in tracked changes version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For Figure 4, they used 5 μM 25HC, which is a high dose and probably is responsible for the long-lasting effects. At 8 hours, there is still about half the initial dose of 25HC in the cells, and they showed in Figure 1 that this would have a significant effect. It is likely that this amount of 25HC will still stimulate ACAT, preventing the cells from recovering. This hypothesis is easily tested with an ACAT inhibitor administered during the chase period. Thus, it is not just the continued effect on SREBP that is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this elegant experiment, the results of which are shown in a new Figure 4C. We treated CHO-K1 cells with 5 µM of 25HC for 4 h, which completely abolished accessible cholesterol from the PMs (compare lane 2 to lane 1). We then removed the 25HC-containing media, washed the cells, and then added back media without 25HC. Similar to what we noted previously, no replenishment of accessible PM cholesterol was detected even after a 22 h recovery period (top two panels of Figure 4C). However, when we included 10 µM of an ACAT inhibitor (SZ58-035) during this recovery period, we began to detect accessible PM cholesterol after 8 h and ~60% of the initial level of accessible cholesterol was restored after 22 h (bottom two panels of Figure 4C and quantification in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2B). This result confirms the reviewer’s prediction that continued activation of ACAT by the lingering intracellular 25HC also plays a role in depleting accessible PM cholesterol over the longer time periods.</p><p>We have now carefully combed through our manuscript and modified all instances where we ascribed the long-term effects solely to 25HC’s effects on suppressing SREBP activation to also reflect ACAT’s contribution to the long-term depletion effects (<italic>tracked changes</italic> in revised manuscript).

They mention the effects on macrophages at the bottom of page 13. This could be tested easily with ACAT inhibitors in macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>In this paper, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 knockout models to show that 25HCmediated depletion of accessible PM cholesterol is dependent on ACAT activity in hamster cells (CHO-K1) and a human hepatocyte cell line (Huh7.5). To answer the reviewer’s question about whether a similar ACAT-dependence operated in macrophage cells, we used a commercially available ACAT inhibitor (SZ58-035). We first tested whether SZ58-035 would inhibit ACAT activity in RAW macrophage cells (mouse). Using our standard ACAT activity assay (described in Figure 1F), we found that 25HC stimulated ACAT activity was partially reduced from 4.2 nmol/mg/h to 1.4 nmol/mg/h when the cells were pre-treated with 10 µM SZ58-035 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> – left 4 columns). Treatment with higher concentrations of SZ58-035 resulted in cell death. In contrast to the results with RAW cells, we observed almost complete inhibition of ACAT activity by 10 µM SZ58-035 in CHO-K1 cells, from 6.0 to 0.1 nmol/mg/h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> – right 4 columns).</p><p>Even though SZ58-035 could not completely inhibit ACAT activity, we tested whether its partial inhibition of ACAT would affect 25HC’s ability to deplete accessible cholesterol from RAW cell PMs. When the macrophage cells were treated with 25HC In the absence of SZ58-035, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in accessible cholesterol levels (similar to other cell types) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> – top 2 panels). In the presence of the ACAT inhibitor, we observed that 25HC’s effects were greatly reduced, suggesting that even partial inhibition of ACAT activity was sufficient to inhibit 25HC’s effects in macrophage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> – bottom 2 panels). While this result is suggestive, a rigorous answer to the reviewer’s question will require generation of a macrophage cell line where both ACAT1 and ACAT2 have been eliminated by CRISPRCas9 methods or even better would be a comparison of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from ACAT1<sup>+/+</sup>/ACAT2<sup>+/+</sup> and ACAT1<sup>-/-</sup>/ACAT2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We are currently working on generating these models and will report the results in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Would there be a way to more directly implicate sustained binding of low concentrations of 25-OH cholesterol to Insigs?</p></disp-quote><p>We did this control experiment and it is shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3. When ACAT1 KO cells were depleted of sterols, SREBP2 was processed to its nuclear form to a similar degree as wild-type cells (lane 1). When 25HC was added to these sterol-depleted cells, SREBP2 processing was suppressed in both cell lines with similar dose dependences (lanes 2 – 6). This indicates that 25HC enters the ACAT1 KO cells, reaches their ER membranes, binds to Insigs, and prevent SREBP cleavage in a similar fashion as in WT cells. In the experiment of Figure 4D, there is no initial depletion of accessible cholesterol by 25HC treatment for 4 h in ACAT1 KO cells and there is no further change after the 25HC is removed. The lingering 25HC’s suppression of SREBPs through binding to Insigs is not sufficient to reduce accessible cholesterol levels over the time period studied here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be helpful to know if concentrations of 25-OH cholesterol used in experiments or observed in cells are relevant to those likely to be achieved in the response to infectious agents in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We would also love to know the amount of 25HC generated by a cell during infection, but as the reviewers can appreciate, measuring the concentration of 25HC in a particular cell is technically challenging.

In particular, Reboldi et al. (Science 2014) showed that 25-OH cholesterol acts to suppress the priming and activity of inflammasomes. This results in reduced inflammatory death but increased susceptibility to infection with L. monocytogenes.
