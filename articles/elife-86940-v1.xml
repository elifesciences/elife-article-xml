sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory, including declarative and nondeclarative memory, unifies our mental world to ensure the quality of life for people of all ages, from newborns to elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>). The pioneering studies of Milner and her colleagues revealed that the hippocampus is required for declarative memory but not nondeclarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Penfield and Milner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>). The discovery of activity-dependent long-term potentiation and place cells provides the neurophysiological basis of hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bliss and Gardner-Medwin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). The rodent hippocampus can be divided into the dorsal and ventral domains, corresponding to the posterior and anterior hippocampus in humans, respectively. In recent decades, numerous studies have supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and functions along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moser and Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus, which connects and shares similar gene expression with the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>), serves the ‘cold’ cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation. The ventral hippocampus, which connects and generates similar gene expression with the amygdala and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pitkänen et al., 2000</xref>), corresponds to the ‘hot’ affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyng et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, to date, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus are differentiated and integrated are largely unknown.</p><p>The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure in the adult rodent forebrain, originates from the medial pallium (MP) in the medial line of the early dorsal telencephalon. The cortical hem (CH), which is located ventrally to the MP, functions as an organizer for hippocampal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hébert and Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schuurmans and Guillemot, 2002</xref>). It has been demonstrated that both extrinsic signals, such as WNTs and BMPs, and intrinsic factors, including EMX1, EMX2, LEF1, LHX2, and LHX5, are involved in the regulation of early morphogenesis of the hippocampus. As the earliest <italic>Wnt</italic> gene to be exclusively expressed in the cortical hem, <italic>Wnt3a</italic> is required for the genesis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2000</xref>); in addition, <italic>Lef1</italic> is downstream of Wnt signaling, and the hippocampus is completely absent in <italic>Lef1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galceran et al., 2000</xref>). Wnt signaling is essential for early development of the hippocampus. <italic>Emx1</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> are mouse homologs of <italic>Drosophila empty spiracles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simeone et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, the dorsal hippocampus is smaller in an <italic>Emx1</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>), while <italic>Emx2</italic> is required for the growth of the hippocampus but not for the specification of hippocampal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tole et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Lhx5</italic>, which encodes a LIM homeobox transcription factor and is specifically expressed in the hippocampal primordium, is necessary for the formation of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Lhx2</italic>, encoding another LIM homeobox transcription factor, is required for the development of both the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Porter et al., 1997</xref>). Intriguingly, deficiency of either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hébert and Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes may generate an essential regulatory axis to ensure the appropriate hippocampal development. Nevertheless, whether there are other intrinsic genes that participate in the regulation of morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus has not been fully elucidated.</p><p><italic>Nr2f</italic> genes, including <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2,</italic> encode two transcription factor proteins belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations of <italic>Nr2f1</italic> are highly related to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contesse et al., 2019</xref>), and mutations of the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> gene are associated with congenital heart defects (CHDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Turki et al., 2014</xref>). By using animal models, our studies and others have demonstrated that <italic>Nr2f</italic> genes participate in the regulation of the development of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>Nr2f1</italic> plays an essential role in the differentiation of cortical excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons, the development of the dorsal hippocampus, and cortical arealization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armentano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Pino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lodato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Nr2f2</italic> plays a vital role in the development of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, whether and how <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and/or <italic>Nr2f2</italic> genes regulate the differentiation and integration of hippocampal morphogenesis, connectivity, and function is still largely unclear.</p><p>Here, our data show that <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2</italic> genes are differentially expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the postnatal hippocampus. The loss of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> results in ectopic CA1 and CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, the deficiency of <italic>Nr2f1</italic> leads to not only dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus but also failed specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage. Furthermore, the deletion of both genes in the RX<sup>Cre/+</sup>; <italic>Nr2f1<sup>F/F</sup>; Nr2f2<sup>F/F</sup></italic> double-mutant mouse causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus, accompanied by compromised specification of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) domains. The components of the trisynaptic circuit are abnormal in the corresponding single-gene or double-gene mutant model. Moreover, <italic>Nr2f</italic> genes may cooperate to guarantee the appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential expression profiles of <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2</italic> genes along the dorsoventral axis in the developing and postnatal hippocampus</title><p>To investigate the functions of the <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2</italic> genes in the hippocampus, immunofluorescence staining was first performed to examine their expression in wild-type mice at postnatal month 1 (1M). In both the coronal and sagittal sections, NR2F1 exhibited a septal/dorsal high-temporal/ventral low expression pattern along the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, g, j, m, i, l, and o</xref>), and its expression is highest in the dorsal CA1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, j, and l</xref>), where place cells are mainly located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Keefe and Conway, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), and the dorsal DG, where there are adult neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gould and Cameron, 1996</xref>). However, the expression of NR2F2 was high in the temporal/ventral hippocampus but was barely detected in the septal/dorsal part of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab, c, e, f, h, i, k, l, n, and o</xref>). The dorsal-high NR2F1 and ventral-high NR2F2 expression profiles were further verified in the postnatal hippocampi at 1M by western blotting assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ap and q</xref>). At embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), NR2F1 was detected in the dorsal pallium (DP) laterally and NR2F2 was expressed in the MP and CH medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa and b</xref>). At E11.5 and E12.5, the expression of NR2F2 remained in the CH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ac, d and Bb, c</xref>). Interestingly, NR2F1 and NR2F2 generated complementary expression patterns in the hippocampal primordium with NR2F1 in the dorsal MP and NR2F2 in the ventral CH at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ba–f</xref>).

To answer this question, we conducted Nissl staining with samples from the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> single-gene (RX<sup>Cre/+</sup>; <italic>Nr2f2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) knockout mouse model. In coronal sections, compared with the control at 1M, the septal hippocampus was normal; unexpectedly, an ectopic CA-like region was observed medially in the temporal hippocampus in the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant, where the prospective posterior part of the medial amygdaloid (MeP) nucleus was situated, indicated by the star (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ba–f</xref>). The presence of the ectopic CA-like region in the ventral but not dorsal hippocampus of the mutant was further confirmed by the presence of the prospective MeP and amygdalohippocampal area (AHi) in sagittal sections, as indicated by the star (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bg–l</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays were performed to verify whether specific lineages of the hippocampus were altered with sagittal sections, in which the subregions of both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were well displayed and distinguished. Ctip2 is a marker for CA1 pyramidal neurons and DG granule neurons, and HuB is a marker for CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugiyama et al., 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus appeared normal in both the control and mutant mice at 1M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ca–l</xref>). Nonetheless, compared with the observations in control mice, an ectopic HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the star, and a duplicated Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the arrowhead, were observed in the ventral hippocampal area in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ca–f and m–r</xref>), revealing that there were ectopic CA1 and CA3 lineages in the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants.</p><p>Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leid et al., 2004</xref>), the expression of Ctip2 was detected in the amygdala including the AHi and posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus (PMCo); in addition, Ctip2 was also highly expressed in the dorsal part of the MeP (MePD) in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cb and n</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, compared with the controls at 1M, there were ectopic CA domains in the mutant ventral hippocampus with the expense of the Ctip2-positive AHi and MePD amygdaloid nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ce and q</xref>), indicated by the arrows.

We would like to investigate the correlation of the CH and/or amygdala anlage with the duplicated ventral hippocampal domains in the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant in detail in our future study. The observations above suggest that <italic>Nr2f2</italic> is not only specifically expressed in the ventral hippocampus but is also required for morphogenesis and probably the function of the ventral hippocampus. Since the ventral hippocampus participates in the regulation of emotion and stress, mutations in the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> gene lead to CHDs, and the formation of the ventral hippocampus is disrupted in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant mice at 1M, we wondered whether CHD patients with <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutations also exhibit symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>Nr2f1</italic> gene is required for the specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 identity</title><p>Next, we asked whether the deletion of the <italic>Nr2f1</italic> gene by RX-Cre also affected the development of the hippocampus. Consistent with the previous finding in <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Nr2f1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flore et al., 2017</xref>), it was the septal/dorsal hippocampus, not the temporal/ventral hippocampus, that was specifically shrunken in both coronal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aa–f</xref>) and sagittal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ag–i</xref>) of RX<sup>Cre/+</sup>; <italic>Nr2f1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mutant mice.

Compared with the control mice, <italic>Nr2f1</italic> mutant mice had fewer HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neurons, as indicated by the star; intriguingly, Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neurons failed to be detected, as indicated by the arrowhead, with Ctip2-positive DG granule neurons unaltered in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ba–l</xref>). The loss of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity in mutant mice was further confirmed by Wfs1, another dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takeda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ca–r</xref>).

Recently, accumulating evidence has supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and function along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moser and Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus marked in blue, in which gene expression is similar to the neocortex, serves the ‘cold’ cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation, and the ventral hippocampus marked in red, in which gene expression is close to the hypothalamus and amygdala, corresponds to the ‘hot’ affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

First, deficiency of the <italic>Nr2f2</italic> gene led to the duplication of the CA1 and CA3 domains of the ventral hippocampus but not the dorsal hippocampus, which was confirmed both morphologically and molecularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, the formation of the trisynaptic circuit was specifically abolished in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the intrahippocampal circuit, information transfer, and function of the ventral hippocampus could be compromised. Third, the ventral hippocampus generates neural circuits with the mPFC, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamus, which are associated with anxiety/behavioral inhibition, fear processing, pleasure/reward seeking, and the neuroendocrine system, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anacker and Hen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryant and Barker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Leary and Cryan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pitkänen et al., 2000</xref>).

It seems that the spatiotemporal activity of RX-Cre recombinase is better or broader than that of the Emx1-Cre recombinase during the critical period of the specification of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity. In addition, the Golgi staining assay revealed that the development of the dendrites of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons was abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). All the observations above indicate that the <italic>Nr2f1</italic> gene is not only necessary for the morphogenesis of the dorsal hippocampus but is also required for the specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, among which there are place cells. The identification of place cells 50 years ago was one of the most important breakthroughs in understanding the role of the hippocampus in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>).

These findings indicated that <italic>Nr2f</italic> genes may coordinate to regulate hippocampal development. Indeed, as discussed above, the loss of either <italic>Nr2f1</italic> or <italic>Nr2f2</italic> only leads to dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) or ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), respectively; intriguingly, while both genes are efficiently excised by RX-Cre in the hippocampal primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), more severely shrunken hippocampi developed in the 3-week-old double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Agenesis of the hippocampus is observed in either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> null mutant mice, and these genes particularly repress each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hébert and Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the proper expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes are critical to maintain the appropriate development of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Eb</xref>). The transcriptional and protein expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> but not <italic>Lhx2</italic> were first reduced in the hippocampal primordium of <italic>Nr2f</italic> double-mutant mice at E11.5; later, enhanced expression of the Lhx2 protein was detected in the hippocampal primordium of double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Moreover, the number of Lhx5-positive Cajal–Retzius cells was clearly reduced in the double-mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5, and E14.5; consistent with the observations in the <italic>Lhx5</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miquelajáuregui et al., 2010</xref>), the generation of Sox2-positive hippocampal NPCs was not affected, but the development of Tbr2-positive IPCs and NeuroD1-positive newborn neurons was abnormal in <italic>Nr2f</italic> double-mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

In addition, the discrepancy between the shrunken dorsal hippocampus associated with the loss of <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and the duplicated CA domains of the ventral hippocampus associated with the deficiency of <italic>Nr2f2</italic> suggested that the regulatory network related to <italic>Nr2f</italic> genes during the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus could be much more complicated than suspected and should be investigated in our future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>Nr2f</italic> genes are imperative for the formation of the trisynaptic circuit</title><p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are interconnected through various neural circuits to mediate the flow of the information associated with declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu and Siegelbaum, 2015</xref>). Both direct and indirect glutamatergic circuits are involved in the relay of information from the EC to the hippocampal CA1, and the trisynaptic pathway is the most well-characterized indirect circuit. The EC sends sensory signals from association cortices via the perforant path to the DG, then the DG granule cells send excitatory mossy fiber projections to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and CA3 pyramidal neurons project to CA1 via the Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the high expression of NR2F1 in the dorsal hippocampus and NR2F2 in the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the dorsal trisynaptic circuit is specifically damaged in <italic>Nr2f1</italic> mutants, as is the ventral trisynaptic circuit in <italic>Nr2f2</italic> mutant mice. Moreover, the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit was almost completely absent in the double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and our unpublished observations). The information transfer associated with the trisynaptic circuits should be abolished particularly in the dorsal and/or the ventral hippocampus in the above corresponding genetic mouse models. Interestingly, <italic>Nr2f1</italic> is also required to specify the medial EC cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the impaired formation and function of trisynaptic circuits could be caused by the abnormal development of CA1, CA3, DG, or EC lineages. Nonetheless, given that newborn granule neurons are continuously generated in the adult DG to integrate into the existing neural circuits essential for declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tuncdemir et al., 2019</xref>) and that hippocampal adult neurogenesis was severely compromised in the <italic>Nr2f</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we could not exclude the possibility that impaired adult neurogenesis may also contribute to the malformation and impaired function of the trisynaptic pathway in double mutants. We would like to investigate what sort of synaptic circuitry is compromised either physiologically or morphologically in the trisynaptic circuit of individual animal model in detail in future studies.</p><p>The hippocampus is heterogeneous along its dorsoventral axis, and either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus generates unique and distinguishable characteristics of gene expression and connectivity, which enable the hippocampus to execute an integrative function from the encoding and retrieval of certain declarative memory to adaptive behaviors. Lesions of the dorsal hippocampus, which are essential for the cognitive process of learning and memory, lead to amnesia and ID; while damage to the ventral hippocampus, which is central for emotion and affection, is highly associated with psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Our findings in this study reveal novel intrinsic mechanisms by which two nuclear receptor genes, <italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2</italic>, which are associated with NDD or CHD, converge to govern the differentiation and integration of the hippocampus along the dorsoventral axis morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, this study provides novel genetic model systems to investigate the crosstalk among the hippocampal complex in gene expression, morphogenesis, cell fate specification and differentiation, connectivity, functions of learning/memory and emotion/anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and the etiology of neurological diseases. Nevertheless, many enigmas, such as whether and how the abnormalities of either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus affect the characteristics of the other, remain unsolved. In addition to the excitatory lineages and circuits, interneurons and inhibitory circuits play vital roles in maintaining the plasticity and functions of the hippocampus. We also wonder whether and how defects in interneurons and inhibitory circuits could contribute to the compromised morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions of the hippocampus and the etiology of psychiatric and neurological conditions, including ID, ASD, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Nr2f1-floxed</italic> (<italic>Nr2f1<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) mice, <italic>Nr2f2-floxed</italic> (<italic>Nr2f2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) mice, <italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, and RX<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swindell et al., 2006</xref>) (PMID: 16850473) used in the study were of the C57B6/129 mixed background.

The FD rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTech) was used to process the brain tissue samples, which were immersed in an equal volume of immersion solution mixed with solutions A and B and stored in the dark for 2 wk at RT. At least 5 mL of immersion solution was used for each cubic meter of the tissue. To achieve the best results, the container of tissue was gently swirled from side to side twice a week during the incubating period. Afterward, the brain tissue was transferred to solution C in the dark at RT for at least 72 hr (up to 1 wk). Finally, the tissues were cut into 100-μm-thick slices with a cryostat at –20 to –22°C and transferred to gelatin-coated microscope slides containing solution C using a sample retriever. The slices were dried naturally at RT. The concrete staining procedure of the kit was followed using the manufactory’s protocol. Then, the sections were rinsed twice with double-distilled water for 4 min each time. The slices were placed in a mixture of one volume of solution D, one volume of solution E, and two volumes of double-distilled water for 10 min and were rinsed twice with distilled water for 4 min each time. The sections were later dehydrated in 50, 75, and 95% ethanol for 4 min, respectively. Next, the slices were dehydrated in 100% ethanol four times for 4 min each time. Finally, the sections were cleared in xylene and mounted with a neutral resin medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>By recording the time spent by the mice swimming in the water tank and finding the escape platform hidden underwater, and the swimming trajectory, the Morris water maze test can objectively reflect the spatial learning and memory ability of the mice. The test was divided into the control and mutant group with at least eight mice in each group. We poured tap water into the water maze tank and added an appropriate amount of well-mixed, milky white food dye. The height of the liquid level was about 1 cm higher than the escape platform, and the water temperature was kept at about 25 ± 1℃. At the same time, four markers of different shapes were pasted on the four directions of the inner wall above the water tank to distinguish different directions. The Morris water maze test was divided into the training phase and the probe trial phase. The training phase lasted for 6 d, four times a day, and the interval between each training was about 30 min. During training, the mice were placed into the tank from the entry points of four different quadrants facing the inner wall, and their latency was recorded from the time they entered the water to the time they found a hidden underwater platform and stood on it. After the mouse found the platform, we let it stay on the platform for 10 s before removing it. If the mouse failed to discover the platform 60 s after entering the water, it was guided to find the platform and left to stay for 10 s. Each mouse was placed into the water tank from four water entry points and recorded as one training session. The probe trial was carried out on the seventh day, and the underwater platform was removed. Each experimental mouse was put into the water tank at the same water entry point and allowed to move for 60 s. The time that each mouse spent in the quadrant, where the platform was originally placed, was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNAs were prepared from the whole telencephalon of the control (n = 5) and double-mutant (n = 3) mice at E11.5, respectively, with the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufactory’s protocol.

Dorsal hippocampus is involved in cognitive functions such as declarative memory and spatial navigation and interconnects chiefly with the neocortex. Ventral hippocampus interconnects with limbic structures such as amygdala and hypothalamus and is involved in affective states and anxiety. What specifies this functional regionalisation during development is not well understood. The present study focuses on the role of transcription factors COUPTFI and COUPTFII, confirming a previously observed dorsal to ventral gradient of expression of COUPTFI in both embryonic and adult mouse hippocampus, and reporting that expression of COUPTFII is strongest in ventral hippocampus. The aim of the authors was then to probe the role of these transcription factors with the use of conditional knockout of one or both factors using RxCre+ mice (sometimes Emx1Cre+ for comparison). As predicted, COUPTFI insufficiency resulted in failure of the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus to develop properly (with concomitant loss of performance in a spatial memory task) COUPTFII knockdown had even more marked effects upon the ventral hippocampus with ectopic CA1/CA3 domains forming, while a double knockout lead to a drastic reduction in size of the hippocampus with subsequent effects upon the appearance of hippocampal synaptic circuitry and the capacity for adult neurogenesis (a feature of rodent hippocampus). In order to help explain the role of COUPTFI/II a role in regulating expression of two transcription factors LHX2 and LHX5, known to be crucial to hippocampal development, was tested by examining gene and protein expression. Changes in LHX2 and LHX5 was observed and a role for COUPTFI/II in regulating expression of these genes was postulated.</p><p>I believe the authors have largely achieved their aims and the results mostly support the conclusions, but, as discussed further below, there are some weaknesses in the data and some areas that could be expanded upon and improved. The methods are mostly appropriate. The use of the transgenic mice and the application of histological methods, especially tyramide amplified immunohistochemistry, is exemplary. However, I'm not sure a wide enough range of tests to explore the phenotype of the transgenic mice was employed to back the conclusions drawn by the authors. The introduction and discussion are nicely written and explain the general concepts and conclusions well. The work makes an important contribution to our understanding of brain development in general and hippocampal development in particular.</p><p>Turning to more specific comments, I must first point out that specification of the ventral hippocampus by expression of COUPTFII is not an entirely original finding, as it was suggested for the developing human hippocampus following immunohistochemical experiments illustrating COUPTFII expression to be confined to the ventral hippocampal structures of the medial temporal cortex (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhx185). Of course, this study, unlike the present study, was restricted to fetal cortex, not adult, and also reported expression of COUP-TFI throughout dorsal and ventral hippocampal structures but without observing any dorsal to ventral gradient, however I feel its contribution to the field has been overlooked by the present study, and should be incorporated into the introduction and/or discussion.</p><p>More information about Rx-cre mice would be informative and could help explain the different phenotype observed when EMX1-cre mice were used to conditionally knock down COUPTFI/II expression.</p><p>The demonstration of antagonistic gradients of COUP-TFI and -TFII across the hippocampus is more convincing in the immunohistochemical preparations than in the western blots. The qualitative data presented in Fig.1p does not convincingly represent the quantitative data presented in Fig.1q. There seem to be multiple bands for COUP-TFII and I wonder exactly how quantifying this was approached?</p><p>Behavioural testing is limited to one test of dorsal hippocampus function. other tests for non-spatial memory, e.g. novel object recognition, or ventral hippocampus function, e.g. step through passive avoidance, might have lead to some interesting discriminations between the various knock down animals (see doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00091).</p><p>Abnormalities in the trisynaptic circuit. No studies of actual synapses, either physiological or morphological, were carried out. I wonder to what extent these immunohistochemical studies just further reflect the abnormalities in hippocampal morphology presented earlier in the manuscript without specifically telling us about synaptic circuits? Although the immunohistochemical preparations are beautiful, they are inadequate on their own in telling us much about what sort of synaptic circuitry exists in the transgenic animals.</p><p>LHX2/LHX5 interaction. The immunohistochemical study, which shows clear differences in LHX5 and LHX2 protein expression at E14.5 in double knockdown mice is more convincing than the qPCR study at E11.5, which show surprisingly small differences in mRNA expression. Could the authors expand upon whether this is due to stage of development, or differences between mRNA and protein expression? Why hasn't both mRNA and protein expression data at both time points been presented?</p><p>Response to the re-submission</p><p>I am happy that the western blot presentation has been improved, and my minor comments attended to. It is disappointing, although understandable given the timeframe, that the lack of qPCR data at 14.5 ED has not been rectified. The immunohistochemical data alone is qualitative and only indicative of LHX5 expression remaining depressed and LHX2 expression possibly increasing between E11.5 and E14.5. In the absence of qPCR data, a more quantitative immunohistochemical study, such as counting blind the number of LHX5+ Cajal-Retzius cells, or measuring optical density of LHX2 expression under rigorous experimental conditions regarding image collection and processing, would be required to support the hypothesis that COUPTFI/II expression modulates the LHX2/LHX5 axis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86940.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The Author's chose to limit their response to re-doing the Lhx5 immuno using the correct antibody which now displays the expected staining: Lhx5 expression is limited to the hem. They have not however presented a characterization of where the RxCre acts, although this was pointed out by other reviewers as well. It would have been useful to demonstrate the expression domain in particular with respect to the time of its initiation, to explain how it causes a phenotype close to that described for the Lhx5 knockout (Zhao et al., 1999). From the decrease of Lhx5 expression and the CR cells which arise from the hem, it appears that the RxCre does indeed act in the hem. However, the timing and spatial pattern is important to establish, as I had pointed out in my first review, &quot;If [the expression of RxCre] it has a dorso-ventral bias in the early embryo, it could explain the regional difference in the COUPTF phenotypes.&quot;</p><p>The major interpretive criticisms I made have not been addressed even though these would have only required a re-writing and re-interpretation of the data. The revised manuscript continues to include major errors of interpretation such as the idea that Lhx2 and Lhx5 &quot;inhibit each other&quot;, something that is unsupported since the expression domains of these two genes are mutually exclusive as is clear from the authors' own new data and the literature.Lines 355-360: &quot;The expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure 5Be-h, e'-h'). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the COUP-TF double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Bm-p, m'-p', u-x, u'-x'). The upregulation of Lhx2 expression is most likely associated with the reduced expression of the Lhx5 gene&quot;There's clearly no Lhx5 in the hippocampal primordium so how is this possible?</p><p>The authors have missed the insights from key papers that they cite, e.g. (lines 352-354) &quot; The expression of Lhx2 was expanded ventrally into the choroid plexus in the Lhx5 null mutant mice (Zhao et al., 1999)&quot; - this paper in fact shows there is no choroid plexus. Lhx2 appears to extend to the midline likely because the hem isn't specified. The authors would benefit from reading <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.513532">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.25.513532</ext-link> in which Lmx1a is shown to be the master regulator of the hem.</p><p>A sentence like (lines 77-81) further blurs the literature: &quot;Intriguingly, deficiency of either Lhx5 or Lhx2 results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other (Hébert &amp; Fishell, 2008; Mangale et al., 2008; Roy, Gonzalez-Gomez, Pierani, Meyer, &amp; Tole, 2014; Zhao et al., 1999), indicating that the Lhx5 and Lhx2 genes may generate an essential regulatory axis to ensure the appropriate hippocampal development&quot;</p><p>First, none of the papers they cite shows that these two factors inhibit each other. Second, the &quot;agenesis of the hippocampus&quot; in the Lhx2 knockout mentioned in Porter et al. (1997) was later shown to be due to a transformation of the hippocampal primordium into an EXPANDED hem (Mangale et al.) In contrast, the &quot;agenesis of the hippocampus&quot; in the Lhx5 mutant appears to be due to the near-complete LOSS of the hem and evidenced by the loss of its derivatives, the choroid plexus and the CR cells (Zhao et al., 1999). The fact that loss of these two factors have opposite effects on the hem (each resulting in loss of the hippocampus, one due to transformation of the hippocampal primordium into hem and the other because of a lack of hipopcampal induction) does not mean that there is an Lhx5-Lhx2 &quot;axis&quot; regulating hippocampal development.</p><p>I won't repeat my other comments here, but the majority of them were not addressed in any way.</p><p>In conclusion, I find it unfortunate that the authors have chosen not to use the detailed input provided by the reviewers which would have greatly improved their manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86940.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors have made significant improvements in addressing my major concerns raised during the previous review.

Based on the suggestion, we added immunofluorescent data in the double knockout mice at E11.5 in the Figure 5Ba-h. Meanwhile, given that it takes time to prepare animal samples at E14.5 for RT-qPCR assays, we performed immunofluorescent assays at both E13.5 and E14.5 to make sure that the changes of Lhx5 and Lhx2 expression in the hippocampal regions between the control and mutant mice were consistent. As shown in the new Figure 5B, consistent with the downregulated expression of Lhx5 transcripts in the double mutant, the expression of the Lhx5 protein was reduced in the CH in the double mutants at E11.5; moreover, the numbers of Lhx5-positive Cajal-Retzius cells decreased in the double mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Ba-d, a’-d’, a’’-d’’, i-l, i’-l’, q-t, q’-t’). Consistent with RT-qPCR data, the expression of Lhx2 was comparable between the control and double-mutant mice at E11.5 (Figure 5Be-h, e’-h’). Interestingly, the expression of the Lhx2 protein was increased in the hippocampal primordium in the COUP-TF double-mutant mice at E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Bm-p, m’-p’, u-x, u’-x’).

It is also important to point out that the immunofluorescence data in Figure 5B is contrary to what is known for Lhx5 (it's not expressed in the neocortical and hippocampal vz) and Lhx2 (it's not expressed in the choroid plexus). Authors should explain how their conclusions could align more clearly, and consider the possibility that their results are due to a possible artifact of image setting issues or worse, antibody specificity issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Very good point. Based on the comments and suggestions, we first tested another Lhx5 antibody, R&amp;D, Cat# AF6290, in the immunofluorescence assays. Indeed, there was something wrong with the previous Lhx5 antibody, Millipore, Cat# AB5762. With the new Lhx5 antibody, consistent with the reported in situ data, the expression of Lhx5 was detected specifically in the CH at E11.5, and in the Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the telencephalon. The same Lhx2 antibody, Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-19344, which has been used successfully in one of our previous studies (Tang et al., Development, 2012) (PMID: 22492355), was used in the present study. We believe that the observations at the MP and DP of the samples are really associated with the expression of Lhx2 protein. We performed new immunofluorescence assays with the new Lhx5 antibody and confirmed with the Lhx2 antibody. As shown in new Figure 5B, consistent with the downregulated expression of Lhx5 transcripts in the double mutant, the expression of the Lhx5 protein was reduced in the CH in the double mutants at E11.5; moreover, the numbers of Lhx5-positive Cajal-Retzius cells decreased in the double mutant embryos at E11.5, E13.5 and E14.5 (Figure 5Ba-d, a’-d’, a’’-d’’, i-l, i’-l’, q-t, q’-t’).
