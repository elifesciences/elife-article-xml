The cohesin complex is a conserved multi-subunit protein system that guarantees the proper segregation of sister chromatids in mitosis across living organisms. This complex is formed by four core subunits, including the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits SMC1 and SMC3, and the sister chromatid cohesin (SCC) subunits SCC1 and SCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolaños-Villegas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moronta-Gines et al., 2019</xref>). The cohesin complex forms a ring encircling the sister chromatids and ensures genomic stability during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, cohesin also participates in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), homologous pairing, construction of the synaptonemal complex (SC), orientation of kinetochores, and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cohesin is established during the S phase and includes arm and centromeric cohesin. Arm cohesin ensures sister chromatids bond together during mitotic prophase. Centromeric cohesin persists until the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, and is vital to resist the force exerted by spindle microtubules, allowing for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell. The dissociation of cohesin generally occurs in two steps, including through the dissociation of cohesin on chromosome arms during prometaphase, followed by the degradation of cohesin at the centromeres at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishiguro and Watanabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watanabe, 2005</xref>). This allows sister chromatids to segregate in mitosis.</p><p>Meiosis contains a single round of DNA replication, but, in contrast to mitosis, is followed by two successive cell divisions. Nonetheless, while the loading mechanism of cohesin is very similar to the analogous process during mitosis, the cohesin degradation during meiosis occurs in two steps: from the chromosome arms during the first meiotic division, and from the centromeres during the second meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>). During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are linked by chiasmata that separate at metaphase I. At this stage, cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms while the two sister chromatids remain closely together because centromeric cohesin is preserved. Subsequently, the sister chromatids separate at anaphase II due to the complete cohesin disassociation at both chromosome arms and centromeres. During this process, sister chromatid cohesin is protected by shugoshin from cleavage by separases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), which ensures the correct separation of sister chromatids during meiosis.</p><p>Notably, the cohesin complex plays additional functional roles in meiosis. Specifically, cohesin on chromosome arms is crucial for normal progression of meiosis I, while centromeric cohesin plays a more prominent role in meiosis II by geometrically orientating the sister chromatids. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are segregated in opposite directions to halve the chromosome number, but sister chromatids remain temporarily mono-oriented and move to the same pole. In meiosis II, sister chromatid pairs become bi-oriented and separate towards opposite spindle poles through similar mechanisms as those observed in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</xref>). In this process, centromeric cohesin plays a crucial role in establishing kinetochore geometry and thus determining sister kinetochore orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gryaznova et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the cohesin complex affects the formation of chromosome axial elements (AE) and the assembly of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostinho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujiwara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Llano et al., 2012</xref>). The cohesin complex is now emerging as a key player in mediating homolog bias of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phipps and Dubrana, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, the cohesin complex regulates gene expression in eukaryotes, acting as a transcriptional co-activator in humans that is recruited by sequence-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lara-Pezzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Remeseiro et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To date, the relationship between discrete cohesin subunits and their role in promoting sister chromatid cohesion remains elusive. In yeast, SCC1 ensures sister chromatid cohesin in mitosis and is associated with chromosomes during the S phase, dissociating during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. The expression of SCC1 gradually decreases at the beginning of meiosis, suggesting a reduced role for SCC1 during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). Instead, REC8, a specialized meiotic-specific cohesin component, replaces SCC1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>). REC8 also plays a crucial role in establishing sister kinetochore orientation in yeast, mice, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogushi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tóth et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, <italic>rec8</italic> mutants in flowering plants exhibit sticky chromosomes, which severely affects the localization of other key meiotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). SCC3 acts as an important component of the cohesin complex, which has been rarely studied in plants. The only research in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shows that SCC3 is responsible for maintaining centromeric orientation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which SCC3 regulates the assembly of sister chromatid cohesion and its function in meiosis remain poorly understood. Whether SCC3 is similar to REC8 in regulating meiotic chromosome behavior in flowering plants remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we investigated the functional roles of SCC3 in rice, elucidating its participation in both mitosis and meiosis. Through our examination of chromosome 12 replication during interphase, we confirmed SCC3’s role in stabilizing the chromosome structures, which is pivotal for sister chromatid cohesion in both mitosis and meiosis. Additionally, we explored the dynamics of cohesin loading and degradation on chromosomes using the antibody of SCC3 during mitosis and meiosis. SCC3 emerges as an axial element intricately involved in homologous pairing, synapsis, recombination progress, and crossover (CO) formation. Our findings also shed light on the regulation of SCC3 localization by REC8. Meanwhile, our investigation revealed the efficient repair of meiotic DSBs in <italic>scc3</italic>, utilizing sister chromatids as repair templates. We propose that SCC3 acts as a constituent of the cohesin complex, which plays an indispensable role in meiotic homologous pairing and synapsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCC3 causes both vegetative and reproductive growth defects</title><p>Considering SCC3 is a highly conserved protein in different species, we performed a BLAST search in the Rice Genome Annotation Project database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgibin/gbrowse/rice">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgibin/gbrowse/rice</ext-link>) and found a single hypothetical homolog of SCC3 proteins (<italic>A. thaliana</italic> SCC3, <italic>M. musculus</italic> STAG3 and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> SA1). This candidate protein is encoded by the <italic>Os05g0188500</italic> gene and shares the highest similarity with <italic>AtSCC3</italic>. The full-length cDNA of <italic>SCC3</italic> is 3755 nucleotides long and comprises 22 exons and 21 introns. SCC3 contains a 3345-nucleotide-long ORF that encodes an 1116 amino-acid protein. In higher eukaryotes, SCC3 is an evolutionary conserved protein that contains a highly conserved STAG domain (140-239aa), as predicted by SMART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Multiple alignments of full-length SCC3 protein sequences and its homologs in other plants revealed the STAG domain is highly conserved across both monocotyledons and dicotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Homology modeling indicated that the structure of the SCC3 protein is strongly conserved among different species, which also possess similar STAG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with full-length SCC3 amino-acid confirming that this protein is conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also performed multiple sequence alignments of these proteins used in the evolutionary tree analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>A previous study in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>) identified a T-DNA insertion at the boundary between intron 5 and exon 6 of <italic>SCC3</italic> that caused lethality, whilst a weak allele was able to survive albeit with some developmental defects. To clarify the function of SCC3 in rice, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate three transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The first allele (<italic>scc3-1</italic>) contains a frameshift ‘GA’ deletion in exon 2 and the second allele (<italic>scc3-2</italic>) contains a frameshift ‘ACCGA’ deletion in exon 11. We tested for allelism between these two <italic>scc3</italic> mutants by crossing <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> (male) and <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> (female). Of the 78 F<sub>1</sub> plants, 18 were <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, 26 were <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, 34 were wild-type for both loci. Thus, these two mutants are allelic and the heterozygous <italic>scc3-1/scc3-2</italic> is lethal. We were unable to isolate homozygous mutants in these two allelic progenies (n=128, 87 plants were <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and 41 were wild-type; n=116, 80 plants were <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and 36 were wild-type). These results suggest that <italic>scc3-1</italic> and <italic>scc3-2</italic> mutants are both embryo-lethal.</p><p>In addition, we obtained a weak transgenic line (<italic>scc3</italic>) containing a frameshift ‘T’ insertion in exon 19 leading to premature termination of translation. We found the <italic>scc3</italic> weak mutant exhibits abnormal vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and proceeded with further investigation of its other phenotypic effects. This revealed that <italic>scc3</italic> decreases plant height, tiller number, and panicle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B–E</xref>). To investigate the patterns of <italic>SCC3</italic> expression, we employed RT-PCR in various tissues and found the gene is ubiquitously expressed, particularly in roots, leaves, and panicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

To clarify the relationship between different subunits in rice, we performed Y2H assays between core cohesin proteins. Surprisingly, we found that SCC3 only interacts with SCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which was further confirmed by BiFC assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, it is worth noting that SCC3 could not interact with other cohesin proteins, including REC8, SMC1, and SMC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that SCC3 could function directly in combination with SCC1 in the cohesin complex.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that cohesins regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuadrado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gligoris and Löwe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Remeseiro et al., 2012</xref>).

Here, we show that SCC3 is a conserved cohesin subunit affecting sister chromatid assembly in both mitosis and meiosis. Crucially, our results also indicate that SCC3 is a component of LE/AE that is required for homologous pairing and synapsis during meiosis, which is essential for the recombination process and CO formation.</p><p>Most research on the cohesin complex predominantly emphasizes its role during mitosis, attributed to the challenges associated with observing the morphology of sister chromatids throughout meiosis. In human cells, the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis occurs in the absence of the <italic>SCC3</italic> homologs, <italic>SA1</italic> and <italic>SA2</italic>. SA1 is indispensable for the cohesion of telomeres and chromosomal arms, while SA2 is crucial for centromeric cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canudas and Smith, 2009</xref>). In rice, <italic>SCC3</italic> has only a single copy, therefore, we observed all kinds of multifaceted defects in <italic>scc3</italic>. SCC3 is paramount not only for the stability of sister chromatid’s structure but also for facilitating the loading of cohesin. In yeast, the cohesin complex comprising SCC1, SMC1, and SMC3 remains intact in <italic>scc3</italic>. However, its chromosomal localization is impeded, most likely due to SCC3’s role in maintaining the stability of cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pathania et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, SCC3 harbors a conserved DNA binding domain in the SCC3-SCC1 subcomplex, essential for the chromatin association of cohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>). In yeast, the DNA-binding domain of the SCC3-SCC1 facilitates the recruitment of cohesin complexes to chromosomes, thus enhancing cohesin’s functionality during mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kulemzina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2018a</xref>). These findings suggest that the interaction between SCC3 and SCC1 is vital for the stability of the cohesin ring and its continued association with DNA. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, SCC3 is also involved in vegetative growth of plants, but its role in mitosis remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>). Leveraging these antecedent insights, our investigation corroborates that SCC3 is integral to the initial formation of cohesion during mitosis. In the rice <italic>scc3</italic> mutant, vegetative growth was severely inhibited. Our analyses indicate an aberration in the chromosomal structure during interphase in <italic>scc3</italic> mutants, possibly due to SCC3’s necessity for stable chromosomal cohesin binding. Although an augmentation in the distance between sister chromatids was observed during prometaphase, the sister chromatids remained partially dissociated, suggesting the residual functionality of other cohesin subunits. Collectively, our findings underscore SCC3 as a conserved and pivotal cohesin protein within the mitotic process.</p><p>SCC3 not only functions in mitosis but also affects meiotic chromosome structure and function. In vertebrates, <italic>SCC3</italic> is encoded by two paralogous genes, including the meiosis-specific subunit <italic>STAG3</italic>. Investigations utilizing SIM analysis on human <italic>stag3</italic> have elucidated that chromosomal axes are regionally dissociated, and there is a substantial reduction in the synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biswas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hopkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Llano et al., 2012</xref>). These observations suggest that STAG3 is required for synapsis between homologous chromosomes. In comparison, the morphological characteristics of meiocytes during meiosis are more discernible in plant cells. Specifically, in <italic>Arabidopsis scc3</italic>, a complete absence of fertility has been observed, underscoring the pivotal role of SCC3 in meiotic process, including unstable homologous pairing at the pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>). In analogous studies with other cohesin mutants, <italic>Atscc2</italic> has been identified as essential for the recruitment of the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit REC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that mutations in cohesin-associated genes could potentially compromise the cohesin complex’s chromosome-binding capacity. Accordingly, in our investigation on meiosis, it has been determined that rice SCC3 facilitates the maintenance of the structure of sister chromatids during the preleptotene. More importantly, SCC3 is localized between homologous chromosomes as a critical AE, ensuring accurate homologous pairing and synapsis. SCC3’s presence is crucial for the normal localization of DMC1, RAD51, ZIP4, and HEI10, elements vital for progression of recombination and the formation of CO. Our proposed model suggests that SCC3 is a part of the cohesin ring, and functions in specific association with SCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Given SCC3’s multifaceted roles in cohesion dynamics and meiotic processes, we hypothesize that SCC3 may function as an axial element to stabilize loop boundaries in meiosis, thereby promoting the homologous pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Notably, it has been proposed that the facilitation of meiotic inter-homolog recombination is attributed to an inhibition of inter-sister-chromatid recombination, which is enforced by meiosis-specific constituents of the chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldfarb and Lichten, 2010</xref>). In <italic>scc3</italic> mutants, meiotic DSBs seemed to utilize sister chromatids as repair templates exclusively. Although essential meiotic proteins such as COM1, DMC1, and RAD51 were decreased in <italic>scc3</italic>, these proteins may still function in facilitating the inter-sister chromatid repair pathway, as DMC1 and RAD51 are also involved in the repair process of inter-sister chromatids. We postulate that the presence of cohesin predisposes meiotic recombination towards an inter-homolog bias for repair. Conversely, in the absence of cohesin and when homologous recombination is compromised, recombination is biased towards inter-sister repair.</p><p>Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that plays an indispensable role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion and the high-order chromosome architecture in both somatic and germ cells. Distinct meiosis-specific subunits likely execute divergent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuadrado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishiguro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that SCC3 and REC8 assume differential roles during mitosis and meiosis, respectively. REC8 was identified as a meiosis-specific protein, assuming the role of SCC1 in meiosis to constitute the cohesin complex. Our investigation reveals that although REC8 and SCC3 exhibit similar localization patterns, but they show many differences. Significantly, REC8 is completely absent in mitotic cells. Conversely, our data indicate that SCC3 is operative in both mitosis and meiosis, potentially playing a role in the loading of cohesins onto sister chromatids during interphase. It is noteworthy that the cohesin loading mechanism onto chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis remains consistent. Meiotic cohesin is loaded onto chromosomes during interphase, likely coinciding with the replication and meiotic fate acquisition of sporogenous cells. This indicates that REC8 does not participate in cohesion establishment at this juncture. Furthermore, we observed SCC3 signals at centromeres from diakinesis to metaphase I, whereas REC8 was undetectable at metaphase I. These distinct localization patterns further imply they may have divergent functional roles in meiosis. Previous research on <italic>Arabidopsis rec8</italic> mutants highlighted chromosomes exhibiting a sticky phenotype that remained challenging to elucidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambing et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, rice <italic>rec8</italic> meiocytes exhibited defective chromosomes with a pronounced sticky phenotype from diakinesis to metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, chromosomes in <italic>scc3</italic> did not display the stickiness observed in <italic>rec8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, the majority of meiotic proteins (including SCC3) failed to localize in <italic>rec8</italic>. This indicates the normal localization of SCC3 and other meiotic proteins depends on REC8, highlighting REC8 as a pivotal meiotic protein essential for the loading of other meiotic proteins. Additionally, we observed that the end processing of DSBs and the inter-sister/homolog strand invasion processes were profoundly impaired in <italic>rec8</italic>, leading us to speculate that the sticky chromosome phenotype in <italic>rec8</italic> could be attributed to an unknown repair pathway. Our results underscore that SCC3 serves as a cohesin component and plays a significant role in cohesion establishment during both mitosis and meiosis. In contrast, the function of REC8 is only restricted to meiosis. While both proteins operate independently in mitosis, they are interrelated in meiosis, with REC8 emerging as a more critical factor in the meiotic process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Meiotic chromosome preparation</title><p>Young rice panicles were fixed in Carnoy’s solution (ethanol: acetic acid, 3: 1, v/v).

To bolster this conclusion, I recommend that the authors perform whole-genome sequencing on parental and F1 individuals from two rice variants, subsequently calculating the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites in the F1 individuals. If SCC3 indeed inhibits inter-sister chromatid repair in the wild type, we would anticipate a higher frequency of inter-homologous chromosome repair (i.e., gene conversion). This should be manifested as a bias away from the Mendelian inheritance ratio (50:50) in the offspring of the wild type compared to the offspring of the scc3+/- mutant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94180.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yangzi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Lijun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tai an</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Tingting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tai an</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>Hanli</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yangzhou University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Yongjie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Huixin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bingxin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yafei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Zhukuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yangzhou University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Yangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We express our sincere appreciation for your insightful comments and constructive suggestions.

We deeply appreciate receiving both positive feedback and constructive criticism on our manuscript. In light of the reviewers’ comments, we have diligently undertaken substantial revisions to improve the manuscript. The revised version comprehensively addresses all the points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Below, we provide a detailed point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Line 170- looking at pollen formation does not specifically evaluate whether SCC3 is involved in meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this advice. We totally agree with your point of view that pollen formation defects only indicate the problem of gametogenesis. We are sorry for not accurately describing this sentence. It has been revised in the manuscript (Lines 167-176).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 203-205- this seems more like discussion and is pure speculation. Another possibility described above is that the truncated SCC3 protein is partially functional and what they see is due to this partial functionality. Have the authors considered the possibility that a partially functional version of SCC3 is produced that alters its function or the function of the cohesin complex? How much of the protein epitope remains in the truncated protein?</p></disp-quote><p>We are so grateful for the insightful suggestions provided. We concur with the proposition that a partially functional SCC3 may indeed be synthesized, contributing to the survivability of the mutant. Notably, the truncated version of the protein retains approximately 60% to 70% of the epitope, which ostensibly maintains a residual functionality within the weak <italic>scc3</italic> mutant. In this manuscript, the loss of C-terminal 910-1116 aa of SCC3 contains a special protein epitope and a certain protein secondary structure, which may alter the protein’s folding and its subsequent roles within the cohesin complex.</p><p>In this study, we encountered challenges in generating null alleles of the <italic>scc3</italic> mutants in rice utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Consequently, it is plausible that the <italic>scc3-1</italic> and <italic>scc3-2</italic> variants represent null alleles of SCC3, resulting in embryonic lethality. We posit that the identification of weak alleles is paramount to facilitating the survival of the organism. Thus, selecting some weak mutants, particularly those exhibiting the most pronounced phenotype, is advantageous for conducting further research. Our findings indicate that the diminished <italic>scc3</italic> mutant lacks only a segment of the C-terminal, yet this deficiency is adequate to ensure the plant's survival while significantly impeding the meiotic process. We cannot dismiss the likelihood that these observed defects are attributable to the unique truncated proteins. We extend our sincerest thanks once again.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 212- I question whether what the authors see in Figure 2 is chromosome fragmentation. It could just as well be alterations in chromosome structure. Likewise, the authors provide little to no evidence that the mutation affects the replication process. Rather, the presence of replicated chromosomes later in mitosis and meiosis would argue that replication is not disrupted.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for highlighting this critical inquiry. Contrary to the scenario of chromosome fragmentation, as you astutely observed, the preservation of normal sister chromatids during prometaphase indicates that the replication process remains uninterrupted. In alignment with your insights, our study embarked on an extensive series of full-length fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments to elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to the observed increase in the distance between sister chromatids, particularly during interphase. The preponderance of our findings corroborates the hypothesis that the chromosomes exhibit alterations in structure, as depicted in Figure 2A. Intriguingly, our data suggest that cohesin, upon interaction with other chromatin-bound proteins, may facilitate loop extrusion, anchoring itself in a manner that potentially alters chromosomal architecture. These alterations in chromosome structure and the subsequent defects in genome folding and cohesion establishment, particularly rely on SCC3. In response to your valuable suggestions, we have meticulously revised the relevant sections of our manuscript. We extend our sincere thanks for your insightful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 230- what does the sentence SCC3 may enhance the interaction with DNA mean, the interaction of the cohesin complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the ambiguity in our initial description and wish to clarify that SCC3 indeed plays a pivotal role in augmenting the interaction between the cohesin complex and DNA. Our observations revealed an upsurge in the signal intensity of SCC3 as cells transition from interphase to prophase, as depicted in Figure 2B. This enhancement correlates with the observed defects in <italic>scc3</italic> mutants during prophase, suggesting that SCC3’s functional significance is particularly pronounced at this stage of the cell cycle. We have revised our manuscript to reflect these insights more accurately, in accordance with your valuable suggestions. We express our sincere gratitude for your guidance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Oddly, and unexplainably the authors present data indicating that SCC3 interacts with RAD21.1, but not SMC1, SMC3, or REC8. The fact that the authors report that SCC3 only interacts with RAD21.1 but no other cohesin proteins is quite hard to explain.</p></disp-quote><p>As argued in the point above, the available data do not provide compelling evidence supporting the interaction between SCC3 and other cohesin proteins. We have repeated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments yielding consistent outcomes, which also surprised us initially. In the revised manuscript, we further added the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) results between SCC3 and other cohesin proteins in rice protoplast (Figure S10). These supplementary data affirm that SCC3 predominantly interacts with RAD21.1, excluding interactions with other cohesin proteins. While the absence of such interactions is perplexing, our investigations have failed to detect any binding between SCC3 and other cohesin proteins.</p><p>A weak interaction between SCC3 and REC8 has been reported in Arabidopsis (Kuttig et al. bioRxiv <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.20.496767">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.20.496767</ext-link>). We speculate that either these proteins do not interact or the yeast-hybrid assays may be inadequate for detecting their interaction, as several factors can impede interaction in a heterologous system. In Figure 7, we could only detect the interaction between SCC3 and RAD21.1 in both Y2H and BiFC experiments. This suggests potential alterations in protein folding or conformation, or the involvement of additional regulatory factors modulating the interaction between SCC3 and other cohesin proteins. Notably, given RAD21.1’s pivotal role as a core component in the cohesin complex, our supplementary findings demonstrate the interactions between SMC1/3 and RAD21.1 (data not shown). Consequently, our current data propose a model wherein RAD21.1 and SMC1/3 form a circular structure, with SCC3 positioned on the outer periphery of the ring complex, associating specifically with RAD21.1 (Figure 8A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>The authors did not consider creating heterozygous mutants for the replication fork. Moderate English language editing may be required.</p></disp-quote><p>We extend our gratitude to the reviewer for their valuable suggestions. Initially, we did not explore the potential relationship between SCC3 and the replication fork. Cohesin, as we understand, becomes associated with DNA prior to DNA replication. The phenomenon of sister chromatid co-entrapment arises as replication forks traverse through cohesin rings, a process intricately linked to DNA replication dynamics. In this study, we exclusively observed aberrant chromosome structures in the <italic>scc3</italic> mutant during interphase (Figure 2). We conjecture that these anomalies may stem from alterations in chromosome structure, such as genome folding and loop extrusion, rather than being directly attributable to the DNA replication fork. However, the precise nature of these chromosome structural aberrations during interphase in the <italic>scc3</italic> mutant remains elusive, necessitating further comprehensive investigation in future studies. We have refined the language of our manuscript in accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions. Once again, we express our sincere appreciation for the invaluable suggestions provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>While the paper's conclusions are generally well-supported, further substantiation is needed for the claim that SCC3 inhibits template choice for sister chromatids. To bolster this conclusion, I recommend that the authors perform whole-genome sequencing on parental and F1 individuals from two rice variants, subsequently calculating the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites in the F1 individuals. If SCC3 indeed inhibits inter-sister chromatid repair in the wild type, we would anticipate a higher frequency of inter-homologous chromosome repair (i.e., gene conversion). This should be manifested as a bias away from the Mendelian inheritance ratio (50:50) in the offspring of the wild type compared to the offspring of the scc3+/- mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our sincere appreciation for your insightful suggestions. It is really a good suggestion. We have arranged to do this experiment. As it takes long time to prepare plant materials and sequence analysis, we hope the ongoing sequencing work will get some important information supporting those hypotheses. As we have not obtained the direct evidence that SCC3 involved in sister chromatid repair, we changed the title as “SCC3 is an axial element essential for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis”. Once again, we really extend our gratitude for your invaluable suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A point that warrants consideration is the placement of the protein interaction experiments involving SCC3 within the paper. It is presented relatively late in the manuscript. If the authors possess information regarding the interaction between RAD21.1 and SCC3 and how it relates to the functional study of RAD21.1, it could contribute to a more comprehensive analysis. However, if this information is unrelated to the current study, it might be advisable to omit it, as it appears to diverge from the main focus of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our sincere gratitude for your invaluable suggestions. It has been documented in yeast that the interaction between SCC3 and SCC1 is indispensable for the efficient loading of cohesin. In our study, we endeavored to elucidate the intricate relationships among various cohesin subunits. Through our investigations, we have discerned that RAD21.1 serves as a pivotal core subunit within the cohesin complex, facilitating interactions with both SMC1/3 and SCC3 (data not shown). Additionally, our findings indicate that the interaction between RAD21.1 and SCC3 is imperative for maintaining the stability of the cohesin ring and its association with DNA (data not shown). Consequently, the interaction between these two proteins assumes paramount importance for our subsequent analyses. This study holds significant promise for future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's worth noting that while the title of the study claims that &quot;SCC3 inhibits inter-sister chromatids repair during rice meiosis,&quot; the last sentence of the abstract weakens this conclusion by using the word &quot;seems.&quot; A study's title should ideally reflect the most definitive and conclusive findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your valuable suggestions. In response, we have revised the description in our manuscript to enhance its rigor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 8C, it appears that cohesin is depicted between two DNA strands.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8C illustrates the process of sister chromatid repair during meiosis in the <italic>scc3</italic> mutant. Two gray lines and two blue lines represent the four sister chromatids of two homologous chromosomes, respectively. In the wild type, cohesin plays a crucial role in tethering together the two sister chromatids. As per your reminder, cohesin should indeed encircle the two sister chromatids, as depicted in Figure 8B.
