The koji-fungus <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, traditionally used in Japanese brewing and fermentation for over a thousand years, is now widely utilized in modern biotechnology as a host for enzyme production. We discovered that, over time in culture, hyphae become thicker, resulting in a tenfold increase in cell volume, and the number of nuclei in hyphal cells also increases tenfold, exceeding 200. The increase in cell volume and nuclear number is unique among the investigated <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species and correlates with its high enzyme production capabilities. Since nuclear number and cell volume are correlated, both must increase simultaneously for either to expand. Our analyses identified genetic factors and nutritional environmental signals involved in each of these increases. Increases in nuclear number and cell volume were also observed in other fungi bred for industrial use. This study not only deepens our understanding of the evolutionary processes that promote high enzyme productivity through fungal breeding, but also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cell volume and nuclear number in multinucleate organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic></kwd><kwd>koji-fungus</kwd><kwd>fermentation</kwd><kwd>enzyme production</kwd><kwd>nuclei</kwd><kwd>cell volume</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H02095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K19062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25K01927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H04878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018732</institution-id><institution>Ohsumi Frontier Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010157</institution-id><institution>Noda Institute for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/jpmjer1502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeshita</surname><given-names>Norio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>More nuclei and cell volume, more enzymes in koji-fungus <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In unicellular organisms, cell volume is tightly regulated in coordination with nuclear division timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amodeo and Skotheim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nurse, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jorgensen et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, in multinucleated filamentous fungi, a correlation exists between cell volume and nuclear number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dynesen and Nielsen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dundon et al., 2016</xref>). However, the number of nuclei varies across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roper et al., 2011</xref>), the factors governing nuclear number and cell volume remain largely unknown. Filamentous fungi are industrially significant microorganisms, and the strains selected through breeding provide ideal research models for studying these evolutionary processes.</p><p>Filamentous fungi secrete a variety of hydrolytic enzymes to support their growth, and humans have long harnessed this enzyme secretion ability for the production of a wide range of fermented foods and beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurst, 2023</xref>). <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> has been used in Japan for over a thousand years to produce traditional fermented foods like sake, soy sauce, and miso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichishima, 2016</xref>). A distinctive feature of the fermentation techniques is solid-state cultivation using substrates like rice, soybeans, and wheat bran. The inoculum of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> used in fermentation, known as ‘koji’, has been commercially produced for around 700 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita, 2021</xref>). Koji is created by cultivating koji-fungus on grains, and koji starter manufacturers have selected and bred strains to improve the flavor and color of various fermented products. The <italic>A. oryzae</italic> strains currently in use are mainly preserved and managed by koji manufacturers and research institutions. A notable characteristic of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> is its high ability to secrete starch-degrading enzymes and proteases, which has led to extensive research into its genome and gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Machida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka and Gomi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishida et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kitano et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>A. oryzae</italic> shares 99.5% genomic similarity with <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, which produces the carcinogenic aflatoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rokas et al., 2007</xref>), there have been no reports of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> producing aflatoxins, and its safety has been confirmed at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kusumoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>).

Over the following millennia, human use of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> is thought to have driven significant genomic recombination, resulting in its evolution into a ‘cell factory’ specifically optimized for the breakdown of sugars and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbons et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, modern biotechnology utilizes filamentous fungi as cell factories to produce organic acids, enzymes, and pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>A. oryzae</italic> also shows high production capacity as a host for both homologous and heterologous protein production in modern biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christensen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito et al., 2024</xref>).

While the mechanisms governing the G1/S phase transition remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dörter and Momany, 2016</xref>), the G2/M phase transition has been shown to involve the following: During the interphase of <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, NimX (CDK1) binds to NimE (cyclin B), and its activity is regulated through phosphorylation by AnkA (Wee1 kinase) and NimT (Cdc25 phosphatase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould and Nurse, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ye et al., 1997</xref>). The activated NimX–NimE complex subsequently dephosphorylates by NimT and activates NimA (Never-in-Mitosis A) protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen and Osmani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osmani et al., 1987</xref>).

Although the targets of RseA are unknown, RseA could be involved in the cell wall integrity by modifying glycosyl chains on enzymes responsible for cell wall synthesis and degradation. Mutations in <italic>rseA</italic> may impair the regulation of cell wall loosening at the branching site, resulting in the formation of thicker hyphae. In fact, in the thick hyphae of RIB40, localized imbalances in cell wall components have been demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and AFM.</p><p>Thicker hyphae can only form if high turgor pressure is maintained within the hyphae, in addition to changes in cell wall remodeling during branching. <italic>msyA</italic> and <italic>msyB</italic>, whose orthologues are calcium channels involved in the regulation of cell volume, were identified among the genes that show a significant increase in expression in thicker hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakayama et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of the knockout strains demonstrated the function of cell volume regulation adapted to increased turgor pressure in hypoosmotic conditions. The function of these calcium channels is likely crucial for maintaining the balance of turgor pressure and cell volume.</p><p>The TOR pathway is a central regulator of cellular growth, responding to a variety of nutrients, such as amino acids, and carbon sources, as well as environmental factors like oxygen levels, osmotic pressure, pH, and temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Urban et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Virgilio and Loewith, 2006</xref>). Upon sensing these inputs, the TOR pathway influences translation activity, metabolic flow, and cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Virgilio and Loewith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>). In both yeast and mammalian models, amino acids like branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, and alanine are crucial for nutrient sensing, forming the basis for TOR signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Guan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). These amino acids are like those contributing to nuclear increase in the RIB915 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, TOR inhibition by rapamycin in the RIB40 strain suppressed the formation of hyphae with increased nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). Consistent with the activation of translation by the TOR pathway, the expression of ribosome-related genes was elevated in thicker hyphae . The TOR pathway directly regulates mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Düvel et al., 2010</xref>). Thick hyphae exhibited heightened mitochondrial density and activity , suggesting that the TOR pathway supports the high ATP demand associated with rapid biosynthesis.</p><p>Cell volume and nuclear number mutually regulate each other, meaning that thicker hyphae always possess more nuclei. For the formation of thicker hyphae with numerous nuclei, an increase in cell volume and a corresponding increase in nuclei must occur simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In our model, cell wall loosening at a branching site and regulation of cell volume by turgor pressure constitute necessary conditions for increasing cell volume and maintaining thick hyphae. RseA and MsyA may be involved in these processes. At the same time, enhanced translational capacity, possibly due to increased expression of ribosomal genes associated with TOR activation, and mechanisms that accelerate the cell cycle represent another essential condition that enables an increase in nuclear number. Both genetic potential and nutritional environmental signals are likely required for the formation of thick hyphae with a high number of nuclei. In the <italic>A. oryzae</italic> RIB915 strain, the number of nuclei and cell volume increased in response to specific amino acids, whereas in the <italic>A. oryzae</italic> RIB40 and other strains, both increased even without the addition of such amino acids, suggesting that they possess the genetic potential to respond independently of nutritional signals. When thick hyphae were cultured on fresh medium, thin hyphae initially emerged, suggesting the necessity of sustained high metabolic activity. Weakening the cell wall by treatment with a low concentration of calcofluor white did not lead to hyphal thickening or an increase in nuclear number. On the contrary, thick hyphae have thicker cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref>), which are necessary to maintain the increased cell volume.</p><p><italic>A. nidulans</italic> and <italic>A. flavus</italic> did not exhibit an increase in nuclear number. <italic>A. sojae</italic> displayed increased nuclear numbers, whereas <italic>A. kawachii</italic> and <italic>A. luchuensis</italic> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The 20 strains of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> selected from different clades showed an increase in nuclear number in the minimal medium supplemented with yeast extract. In the medium without yeast extract, there were strains that showed an increase in nuclear number and others that did not. These differences might be due to variations in their applications or the selection of strains with diverse characteristics, such as not only enzyme activity but also their impact on the flavor, aroma, and color of the final products. Additionally, there might be dominant mutations that activate the TOR pathway even in the minimal medium. Multiple gene mutations were identified as contributing to the phenotype of increased hyphal volume and nuclear number, suggesting that the phenotype was not the result of a single mutation but rather the gradual accumulation of mutations through breeding. The koji-fungus strains used to produce high-quality sake and soy sauce have been selectively bred over many years, long before the advent of modern biotechnology, to enhance their saccharolytic and proteolytic activities. Modern biotechnological bred strains such as <italic>T. reesei</italic> QM9414 and <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic> IFO4688 also exhibit a phenotype of thicker hyphae with increased nuclear numbers under nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This consistency suggests that by breeding naturally multinucleate filamentous fungi under nutrient-rich conditions, it is possible to obtain strains with increased nuclear numbers and enhanced enzyme or compound production.</p><p>A previous study reported an increase in the number of nuclei in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clutterbuck, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinck et al., 2005</xref>).

This suggests that differentiation to aerial hyphae may be involved in the increase of hyphal volume and nuclear number.</p><p>We investigated whether the reduction in nuclear size observed in thick hyphae was due to a change from diploid to haploid status. However, no difference in GFP-histone fluorescence intensity was detected between thick and thin hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In both RIB40 and RIB915 strains, no significant difference in conidial size was observed despite the large difference in the number of nuclei within the hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These results suggest that both thick and thin hyphae remain haploid, and that the smaller nuclear size observed in thick hyphae is likely due to a higher nuclear density. This is likely related to the phenomenon in which a decrease in cell size is accompanied by a reduction in nuclear size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemière et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The number of nuclei in filamentous fungi varies greatly among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roper et al., 2011</xref>). For example, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> hyphal cells can exceed 100 nuclei, which correlates with its exceptionally rapid growth rate and high protein secretion capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Havlik et al., 2017</xref>). An increase in the number of nuclei per cell is expected to enhance transcription and translation per cell, thereby improving enzyme production and secretion capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Whereas maintaining a high nuclear number requires a substantial amount of energy, and in conditions where external nutrient supply is insufficient, cells rapidly die. Thus, the tendency to maintain a high nuclear number could be a selective pressure unlikely to occur in nature. The regulation of nuclear number and its ecological strategy are intriguing in other fungi such as <italic>N. crassa</italic>, which rapidly spreads after wildfires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobson et al., 2004</xref>), and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi that form symbiotic relationships with plants and contain thousands of nuclei within hyphae lacking septa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kokkoris et al., 2020</xref>). In any case, koji-fungus strains were bred specifically for high enzyme production in nutrient-rich environments, and we propose that some of them acquired the specialized trait of increased cell volume and nuclear number through selection. This study elucidates the evolutionary processes driven by breeding selection in <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and the underlying mechanisms contributing to high enzyme productivity.

The syringe was then replaced with another containing medium, and the medium was delivered at the minimum flow rate using a syringe pump (YSP-101, YMC). The device was incubated at 30°C on a thermal stage (TOKAI HIT) and imaged using an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss). α-Amylase activity in the device was measured using the EnzChek Ultra amylase assay kit (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Enzyme activity assays</title><p>Fungal conidia 10⁴ were inoculated onto 25 ml of medium in a petri dish and statically cultured at 30°C for 4 days. Protein concentration and enzymatic activities in the culture supernatant were measured. Protein quantification was performed using the Bradford assay (Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad), with bovine gamma globulin as the standard. Carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity was determined by measuring reducing sugars using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. CMCase activity was assayed at 50°C for 15 min in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and 1% carboxymethyl cellulose. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of reducing sugar (as glucose equivalent) per minute. α-Amylase activity was measured using an α-Amylase Assay Kit (Kikkoman Biochemifa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Acid carboxypeptidase activity was determined using the Acid Carboxypeptidase Assay Kit (Kikkoman Biochemifa) following the provided protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>Sterilized cellophane was placed on agar plates, and conidia were inoculated. After culturing at 30°C for 3 days, samples were frozen, homogenized with a mortar and pestle, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Library preparation, sequencing, and partial data analysis were performed by the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba. Sequencing was conducted using 36 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NextSeq 500, and reads were mapped to the <italic>A. oryzae</italic> RIB40 reference genome using the CLC Genomic Workbench (QIAGEN). For laser microdissection, sterilized membrane slides (Carl Zeiss) were immersed in MM liquid, and conidia were inoculated onto the membrane. After static culturing at 30°C for 3 days, sections were collected using a PALM MicroBeam laser microdissection system (Carl Zeiss). RNA was extracted from 500 to 700 sections, respectively, using the RNeasy Mini Kit. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by Takara Bio Inc, using 150 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Reads were mapped to the <italic>A. oryzae</italic> RIB40 reference genome using the CLC Genomic Workbench. Genes showing a ≥4-fold change in expression were considered significant, and GO enrichment analysis of biological processes was performed using ShinyGO 0.81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2020</xref>). Heatmaps were visualized using the Python Seaborn package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waskom, 2021</xref>). Gene annotations were obtained from FungiDB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Low osmotic pressure shock analysis</title><p>Conidia were spot inoculated onto the minimal medium containing 1 M NaCl and cultured at 30°C for 3 days. Colony tips were treated with distilled water for 3 min, and the number of tip ruptures was counted. Hyphal tip swelling was assessed by staining hyphae cultured in the minimal medium liquid for 3 days with FM4-64, mounting them on a coverslip with a small volume of medium, and adding an equal volume of distilled water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Raman spectroscopy</title><p>The conidia were inoculated into minimal medium liquid in a glass-bottom dish and cultured at 30°C for 3 days. Raman spectra were acquired using an XploRA PLUS Raman microscope, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maini Rekdal et al., 2024a</xref>). Hyphae attached to the dish bottom were irradiated with a 532-nm laser at 0.93 mW for 30 s. Spike artifacts caused by cosmic rays were manually removed. Ten spectra were averaged, and background signals attributed to the medium and glass were subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Protein structure analysis</title><p>RseA protein structure was predicted using AlphaFold2 and visualized with PyMOL (v1.20).

We used a JPK Nanowizard 4 (Bruker) equipped with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon). The temperature was maintained at 30°C using a dish heater integrated into the stage. BL-AC40TS-C2 cantilevers (Olympus, spring constant approximately 0.1 N/m) were used for AFM imaging under the following conditions: QI mode, 1.5 × 1.5 μm or 0.5 × 0.5 μm scan size, 128 × 128 pixels, Z-length 1 μm, setpoint 0.1 nN, and Z speed 166 μm/s. The Young’s modulus was calculated using JPKSPM Data Processing software (Bruker). After averaging and baseline subtraction, Young’s modulus was calculated using a Hertz model with a triangular pyramid half-cone angle of 35°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>SNP analysis</title><p>The genome data of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> required for SNP identification was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and mapped to <italic>A. oryzae</italic> RIB40 reference sequence using BWA-MEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vasimuddin et al., 2019</xref>).

We agree that the genetic analysis in the latter part is relatively weaker compared to the imaging analysis in the first half. Rather than a single mutation causing a dramatic phenotypic change, we believe that the accumulation of various mutations through breeding leads to the observed phenotype, making it difficult to clearly demonstrate causality. Since transcriptome and SNP analyses have revealed key pathways and phenotypes, it would be gratifying if these insights could contribute to future applications utilizing filamentous fungi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I was wondering what happens if thick hyphae were taken as inoculum for a new colony or thin hyphae. Is it possible to enrich for one or the other type of hyphae? Perhaps in the presence of yeast extract or certain amino acids.</p></disp-quote><p>Added an explanation in the discussion.</p><p>L304-306. When thick hyphae were cultured on fresh medium, thin hyphae initially emerged, suggesting that sustained metabolic activity is required for the formation of thick hyphae with a high number of nuclei.</p><p>L120-121. In some cases, thick hyphae emerged by branching from thick hyphae (Fig. 2D, left), while in other cases, thin hyphae emerged from thick hyphae (Fig. 2D, right). Thin hyphae emerge in the early stage of cultivation even in the presence of yeast extract or certain amino acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, they hypothesize that the primary effect could be on cell wall rigidity. I am wondering if that hypothesis could be tested by adding, for instance, sublethal concentrations of cytochalasin to hyphae of A. nidulans to weaken the cell wall.</p></disp-quote><p>The question is reasonable. To ensure accurate understanding, we moved Fig. S6 to Fig. 6 and revised the discussion as follows.</p><p>L294-295. In our model, cell wall loosening at a branching site and regulation of cell volume by turgor pressure constitute necessary conditions for increasing cell volume and maintaining thick hyphae. L306-309. Weakening the cell wall by treatment with a low concentration of calcofluor white did not lead to hyphal thickening or an increase in nuclear number. On the contrary, thick hyphae have thicker cell walls (Fig. 2H-K), which are necessary to maintain the increased cell volume.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I recommend including some older literature. It was described already 20 years ago that A. nigerdifferentiates hyphae with different capacities to secrete proteins (PMID: 16238620). In addition, there are old reports in A. nidulans reporting high numbers of nuclei (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1099/00221287-60-1-133">https://doi.org/10.1099/00221287-60-1-133</ext-link>). Perhaps it is worth trying to reproduce those cultural conditions. At least this should be discussed. In the same line, the number of nuclei increases a lot in the stalk of conidiophores in A. nidulans. These observations could be used as examples that the phenomenon observed in A. oryzae may be of general importance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. It is a very interesting proposal. We checked the nuclei distribution of A. nidulans on the media and added the following discussion.</p><p>L328-334. A previous study reported an increase in the number of nuclei in A. nidulans (62, 63). Here, we examined the nuclear distribution of A. nidulans grown on the culture media, however, did not find class III hyphae as observed in A. oryzae. Even in A. nidulans, conidiophore stalks contain a high number of nuclei. It has been shown that A. oryzae has a taller conidiophore stalk (64). In the thick hyphae of A. oryzae, the expression level of flbA, an early regulator of conidiophore development (65), was elevated.

Have the authors checked whether all the nuclei are haploid or diploid?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the very important question. We added new results to Fig. S5D and S5E and the following discussion.</p><p>L335-340. We investigated whether the reduction in nuclear size observed in thick hyphae was due to a change from diploid to haploid status. However, no difference in GFP-histone fluorescence intensity was detected between thick and thin hyphae (Fig. S5D). In both RIB40 and RIB915 strains, no significant difference in conidial spore size was observed despite the large difference in the number of nuclei within the hyphae (Fig. S5E). These results suggest that both thick and thin hyphae remain haploid, and that the smaller nuclear size observed in thick hyphae is likely due to a higher nuclear density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In this context, the biological relevance of the increase in the number of nuclei should also be discussed in more detail. It remains to be clarified whether in hyphae with a high number of nuclei all nuclei are functionally active or whether many nuclei are possibly &quot;inactive&quot;. Studies on the transcriptional activity of individual nuclei or on DNA replication (e.g., by EdU labeling) could clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Added the explanation below.</p><p>L102-105. The transcriptional activity of each nucleus is unknown. However, a previous study (Yasui et al., FBB 2020) demonstrated that nuclear division is synchronized even when there are more than 200 nuclei. This suggests that DNA replication occurs similarly in most nuclei. Furthermore, since the germination rate of conidia and the colonies formed from individual conidia show no significant abnormalities, it is suggested that nearly all nuclei possess normal genomes and chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It becomes not entirely clear what the underlying signal is that causes a thin hypha to branch into a thick multinucleated cell. This needs to be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We clarified the signal to increase nuclear number and cell volume.</p><p>L294-309. Although it is speculative, we propose a model to aid interpretation in the discussion. We have clarified that both genetic potential and environmental signals such as nutrients are important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is increased branching always correlated with an increased number of nuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>It is not an increase in branching, but rather the thickening of hyphae and an increase in cell volume that is consistently associated with an increase in nuclear number. Approximately 40 hours after inoculation, within 400 μm from the tip, the number of branches was 3.4 (SD=2.4) in thin hyphae and 2.6 (SD=0.5) in thick hyphae, suggesting that branching does not increase (n=4). Since thick hyphae elongate faster, it seems that fewer branches are present near the tip, even if the branching frequency itself remains unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The abstract does not summarize the many findings of the manuscript in an adequate way.</p></disp-quote><p>abstract change</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Lines 49-50: Why italics?</p></disp-quote><p>corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 179: process.</p></disp-quote><p>corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 313-314: Do not forget (and discuss) in this context mycorrhiza fungi with up to thousands of nuclei that were apparently selected during evolution for this high number of nuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the very interesting suggestion.

The classification is described in the Methods section: Class I – nuclei are distributed at regular intervals without overlapping; Class II – nuclei are aligned but occasionally overlap; Class III – nuclei are scattered throughout the hyphae without alignment.

Due to variation in the distance from the hyphal tip to the septum, we counted the number of nuclei within 100 μm from the hyphal tip.

That is, if the ratio of cytoplasmic volume per nucleus is constant, does the same apply to the secreted product? Knowing this would help to clarify whether the key feature in enhanced secretion is nuclear (e.g., gene expression) versus a cytoplasmic trait (e.g., vesicle trafficking).</p></disp-quote><p>Enzyme activity was measured across the entire mycelium, which includes a mixture of hyphae with high and low numbers of nuclei. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the correlation between enzyme activity and nuclear number. Enzyme activity was normalized by fungal biomass. The size of each colony is shown in Fig. 1B. Additionally, the correlation between the proportion of hyphae with increased nuclear number and enzyme activity is shown in Fig. 3H. In the experiment where enzyme activity was measured in a single hypha, we attempted to measure the number of nuclei; however, we could not use the nuclear GFP strain because the substrate exhibits green fluorescence. DAPI staining also failed due to limited dye access to the microfluidic channel.

The role of RseA seems very broad based on the strong deletion phenotype. How would the removal of RseA be regulated to limit its effect to the branch site? Also, the msyA deletion phenotype isn't entirely consistent with what you would expect if it were necessary to maintain thick hyphae. Lastly, the authors do not show that translational capacity is enhanced in thick hyphae. I would suggest that these statements be tempered to some degree.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We agree that it was too speculative, whereas we believe that some explanatory interpretation is necessary. Therefore, we have revised the text as follows, L294-300. In our model, cell wall loosening during branching and regulation of cell volume by turgor pressure constitute necessary conditions for increasing cell volume and maintaining thick hyphae. RseA and MsyA may be involved in these processes. At the same time, enhanced translational capacity by increased expression of ribosomal genes, possibly due to associated with TOR activation by specific amino acids, and mechanisms that accelerate the cell cycle represent another essential condition that enables an increase in nuclear number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) General: how do the authors reconcile the observation that YE and amino acids stimulate the formation of thicker hyphae, yet the time lapse imaging (Figure 2E) suggests that these hyphae arise at a later time during colony development when these resources might be limiting? The authors should consider providing some insight into this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>L300-305. Added a discussion below.</p><p>Both genetic potential and nutritional environmental signals are likely required for the formation of thick hyphae with a high number of nuclei. When thick hyphae were cultured on fresh medium, thin hyphae initially emerged, suggesting the necessity of sustained high metabolic activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
