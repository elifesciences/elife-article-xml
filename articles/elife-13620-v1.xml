xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about the reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/">citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells” by Garnett and colleagues, published in <italic>Nature</italic> in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20. Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel interaction they identified in which Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines showed an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation, the hallmark of Ewing’s sarcoma family tumors, exhibited increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown mediated by siRNA of <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4F).

This study leveraged a collection of over 600 cell lines screened across 130 drugs, with the aim to uncover new interactions between known cancers and known drugs in order to identify new potential therapeutic avenues using extant drugs. They captured a large number of known gene-drug interactions of clinically active drugs and identified several novel gene–drug associations. The ability to accurately capture a large number of known clinically relevant drug response biomarkers as well as preferential cancer type sensitivities known to occur in the clinic, such as decreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant colorectal cancers relative to melanomas, demonstrated the effectiveness of this large-scale pharmacogenomic approach. A similar approach of interrogating a large panel of human cancer cell lines of diverse lineages to predict drug sensitivity was conducted and reported by Barretina and colleagues at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Garnett and colleagues identified an unexpected highly significant association between the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation and sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation is a defining cytogenetic characteristic of Ewing’s sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs). ESFTs are highly malignant tumors that occur in the bone and soft tissue, usually in children. The translocation event combines part of the EWS protein to a member of the <italic>ETS</italic> transcription factor family; in 90% of cases, this is FLI1. This creates a novel transcription factor, EWS-FLI1, whose oncogenic actions and mechanisms are still being fully explored. The translocation event is thought to be the initiating event for the development of ESFTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erkizan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lessnick and Ladanyi, 2012</xref>).</p><p>PARP1 has diverse functions in chromatin modification, mitosis and cell death, but it is most well studied in the context of DNA repair and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sonnenblick et al., 2014</xref>). PARP1 is a key component of single stranded break (SSB) repair; however, loss of PARP1 activity can be compensated for through DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR). This makes PARP1 an interesting therapeutic target in the context of malignancies with deficient HR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant breast and ovarian cancers. In these cancers, loss of PARP activity results in synthetic lethality; with both SSB and HR impaired, the accumulation of DNA damage eventually kills the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sonnenblick et al., 2014</xref>). PARP inhibitors (PARPi), such as olaparib, are now at the forefront of treatment for breast and ovarian cancers, as well as other malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In Figure 4C, a predicted interaction between Ewing’s sarcoma cells and the PARP inhibitor olaparib was tested. PARP inhibitors target BRCA-deficient cells that rely on alternative DNA damage repair pathways involving PARP. A panel of cell lines representing Ewing’s sarcoma, a BRCA-deficient line, as well as other osteosarcomas and cancers of soft tissue and epithelium were treated with a range of concentrations of olaparib. The concentration of olaparib required to reduce colony formation by 90% or more was much less for Ewing’s sarcoma cells (on par with the concentration required for the BRCA-deficient cell line) than for the non-Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 1.</p><p>In Figure 4E, the hypothesis that mouse mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that had been transformed with the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation would confer sensitivity to olaparib was tested. The sensitivity of these cells to olaparib were compared to MPCs transformed with a related translocation (<italic>FUS-CHOP</italic>) as well as to SK-N-MC cells, which have the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> translocation endogenously. Treatment with olaparib did not inhibit the viability of the <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> transformed MPCs, but did inhibit the viability of the SK-N-MC cells. Olaparib also inhibited the viability of the <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> transformed MEFs compared to the <italic>FUS-CHOP</italic> translocation. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 2.</p><p>In Figure 4F, the effects of <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic> depletion on a cell line carrying the translocation endogenously was tested. A673 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting <italic>EWS-FLI1</italic>, which resulted in a partial rescue of sensitivity to olaparib compared to control siRNA transfected cells. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3.</p><p>A paper published at the same time as Garnett and colleagues’ work also confirmed that Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). In a previous paper, Brenner and colleagues reported that in prostate cancer PARP was a cofactor for wild-type <italic>ETS</italic> transcription factors, which makes up one half of the defining translocation-based fusion transcription factor of Ewing’s sarcoma, and that PARPi treatment of <italic>ETS</italic> positive prostate cancers disrupted their growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brenner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Legrand et al., 2013</xref>). Based on this finding, they examined the role of PARP1 and PARPi in Ewing’s sarcoma. Using immunoprecipitation, they detected a direct interaction between the EWS-FLI1 fusion transcription factor and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). Further, they reported that transforming a cell line (in this case, PC3 cells) with the <italic><bold>EWS-FLI1</bold></italic> translocation conferred sensitivity to treatment with olaparib, and that siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic><bold>EWS-FLI1</bold></italic> inhibited transwell migration of ESFT derived cell lines, but not osteosarcoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple groups have also reported the unique sensitivity of EWS-FLI1 carrying Ewing’s sarcoma derived cell lines to olaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Norris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ordóñez et al., 2015</xref>). Additional work then demonstrated that, similar to breast and ovarian cancers harboring <italic><bold>BRCA1/2</bold></italic> mutations, Ewing’s sarcomas may also have defects in DNA repair mechanisms, rendering them sensitive to PARP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>). This has led to the start of clinical trials treating Ewing’s sarcoma patients with combination therapies targeting multiple DNA damage pathways and PARP inhibition. Results from a small scale nonrandomized phase II human trial failed to show clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent Ewing sarcoma treated with only olaparib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choy et al., 2014</xref>), but other trials are underway to explore the efficacy of PARP inhibition in combination with chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information and references were derived from the original paper or information obtained directly from the authors.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protocol 1: Colony formation assay of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines with olaparib</title><p>This experiment assesses the sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines to the PARP inhibitor olaparib.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Registered report: Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This Registered report aims at assessing the reproducibility of the results of a large-scale pharmacogenomic study published in Nature in 2012. The study leverages a collection of over 600 cell lines screened across 138 drugs.</p><p>One of the major hurdles in assessing the reproducibility of this study is its scale. In the registered report the authors propose to reproduce a single finding that was presented in one of the main figures of the original report. While this finding is indeed an important part of the original study it does not embody a large part of the original conclusions: The original paper demonstrated that a drug screen performed across a large collection of cell lines was able to capture accurately a large number of known clinically relevant drug response biomarkers as well as preferential cancer type sensitivities known to occur in the clinic (for example that <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant colorectal cancers are less responsive to BRAF inhibitor than melanomas). It also showed that genomic modeling of the drug response could yield biological insights into drug mechanism of action (Elastic Net analysis outputs). This was distinct from previous smaller scale efforts (and also valuable for other uses) that had been reported prior to the original report (NCI60 results, for example). The reviewers encourage this Reproducibility Report after addressing the following concerns:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction of the registered report should better reflect this challenge and the breadth of the results presented in the original report.</p><p>For example: &quot;To confirm their high throughput approach Garnett and colleagues explored one novel interaction…&quot;. This is similarly an over simplification. Several results &quot;Confirmed&quot; the high throughput approach capability of capturing clinically and biologically relevant drug responses: Chiefly a large number of known gene-drug interactions for clinically active drugs.</p><p>End of Introduction: It should be further clarified that the clinical results reported for Olaparib in Ewing's sarcoma correspond to single agent olaparib only. Combinations with olaparib are currently explored but no results have been made public.</p><p>Technical aspects:</p><p>2) Protocol 1; Procedure; 1: Authors should employ duplicate plates.</p><p>3) Protocol 1; Procedure; 4a: The assay (fix and stain) should be stopped when the control (untreated plates) contain at least 100 colonies (ideally over 200).</p><p>4) Protocol 1; Known differences from the original study: It is not clear why the authors have chosen not to include all the controls that were presented in the original study. Positive and negative control in a consistent disease background (breast) of <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> deficient and proficient cell lines are important to show that the assay is correctly capturing differential sensitivity to PARP inhibitors across genotypes.</p><p>5) Protocol 2, first paragraph: As PARP inhibitor sensitivity relies on replication/proliferation of the cells mechanistically it will be important to show that all cell lines are in good health and proliferative in no drug condition. This is particularly important for MPCs that can be more challenging than average cell lines to maintain in culture. The protocol should include a test for appropriate proliferation.</p><p>6) Protocol 2; Procedure; 1: Related to the point above: All assays should include a measurement of proliferation to show that drug treatment occurred while cells were replicating since PARP inhibitor sensitivity depends on replication. Furthermore, differential replication across lines can yield over or underestimate of sensitivity.</p><p>7) Protocol 2; Procedure; 6: What level of knock down would be deemed sufficient to declare that the gene expression was affected but no biological effect observed?</p><p>8) It is unfortunate that some of the cell lines originally used in Garnett et al. were not available in this Reproducibility Project. However, it will be very useful to the scientific community that this Reproducibility Project and the related reagents and cell lines will be made available for other researchers to reproduce this work.</p><p>9) Regarding the statistical analyses, the authors should be aware that repeating the experiment twice or three times on the same cell lines will not give completely independent results which may impact on the results. However, it seems that the power calculations (at least for protocol 1) are conducted using only one run of the experiment. Secondly the power calculation assumes that the observed results will be as strong as those seen in Garnett et al. Even for a real finding, this may be optimistic due to the large number of tests carried out by Garnett and the &quot;winner's curse&quot;, i.e. the fact that the most striking findings in a multiple testing context tend to be upwardly biased.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13620.004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The Introduction of the registered report should better reflect this challenge and the breadth of the results presented in the original report.</italic> </p><p><italic>For example: &quot;To confirm their high throughput approach Garnett and colleagues explored one novel interaction…&quot;.

We have included additional measurements at 24 and 48 hr after treatment (in addition to the originally planned 72 hr measurement) for cells not treated with drug. This will occur for the seeding optimization (Step 1) and for each replicate of the assay (Steps 2-7).</p><p><italic>6) Protocol 2; Procedure; 1: Related to the point above: All assays should include a measurement of proliferation to show that drug treatment occurred while cells were replicating since PARP inhibitor sensitivity depends on replication.

We have added a test for proliferation for each biological replicate in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) Protocol 2; Procedure; 6: What level of knock down would be deemed sufficient to declare that the gene expression was affected but no biological effect observed?</italic></p><p>We do not have information about what level of knock down is necessary in order to observe a biological effect in this assay. The original study does not indicate a threshold, but does report the level of knock down (Supplemental Figure 20). Whether the replication attempt is capable of achieving the same degree of knockdown is important to consider as is the ability to observe a biological effect. Instead of declaring a threshold of knock down we plan to compare our gene expression levels to those of the original study as well as the viability assay results. This will allow the research community to assess this question.</p><p><italic>8) It is unfortunate that some of the cell lines originally used in Garnett et al. were not available in this Reproducibility Project. However, it will be very useful to the scientific community that this Reproducibility Project and the related reagents and cell lines will be made available for other researchers to reproduce this work.</italic></p><p>We agree and for any reagent or cell line not already available to the research community through a commercial supplier or repository we will work to make these valuable reagents available for other researchers.</p><p> <italic>9) Regarding the statistical analyses, the authors should be aware that repeating the experiment twice or three times on the same cell lines will not give completely independent results which may impact on the results. However, it seems that the power calculations (at least for protocol 1) are conducted using only one run of the experiment. Secondly the power calculation assumes that the observed results will be as strong as those seen in Garnett et al. Even for a real finding, this may be optimistic due to the large number of tests carried out by Garnett and the &quot;winner's curse&quot;, i.e. the fact that the most striking findings in a multiple testing context tend to be upwardly biased.</italic></p><p>We agree that while repeating the experiment multiple times on the same cell lines does not give complete independence. However, we plan to perform the experiment on several independent samples derived from the same population of cells. While not complete independence, it is as much as can be obtained for a given cell line based experiment – similar to using multiple mice all of which have the same inbred genetic background. However, for Protocol 1 the cell line is the biological replicate, opposed to the random sample from a given cell line. The power calculations were conducted to determine how many Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines and how many osteosarcoma cell lines are necessary to conduct the proposed test. Since each cell line is independent of each other, the number of cell lines of a given disease type were determined to achieve at least 80% power.</p><p>Regarding the approach used for the power calculations, we agree there are approaches one could take to guard against inflated effect sizes, such as utilizing the 95% confidence interval of the effect size. However, the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is designed to conduct replications that have 80% power to detect the point estimate of the originally reported effect size. While this has the limitation of being underpowered to detect smaller effects than what is originally reported, this standardizes the approach across all studies to be designed to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power.</p></body></sub-article></article>
