proteins (OMPs) are crucial for the maintenance of the envelope permeability barrier to some antibiotics and detergents. In Enterobacteria, envelope stress caused by unfolded OMPs activates the sigmaE (σ<sup>E</sup>) transcriptional response. σ<sup>E</sup> upregulates OMP biogenesis factors, including the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) that catalyses OMP folding. Here we report that DolP (formerly YraP), a σ<sup>E</sup>-upregulated and poorly understood outer membrane lipoprotein, is crucial for fitness in cells that undergo envelope stress. We demonstrate that DolP interacts with the BAM complex by associating with outer membrane-assembled BamA. We provide evidence that DolP is important for proper folding of BamA that overaccumulates in the outer membrane, thus supporting OMP biogenesis and envelope integrity. Notably, mid-cell recruitment of DolP had been linked to regulation of septal peptidoglycan remodelling by an unknown mechanism. We now reveal that, during envelope stress, DolP loses its association with the mid-cell, thereby suggesting a mechanistic link between envelope stress caused by impaired OMP biogenesis and the regulation of a late step of cell division.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Envelope stress</kwd><kwd>Outer membrane biogenesis</kwd><kwd>BAM</kwd><kwd>OMPs</kwd><kwd>DolP</kwd><kwd>YraP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ATIP-Avenir</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ieva</surname><given-names>Raffaele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bikard</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PostDoc Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranava</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>677823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bikard</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007649</institution-id><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rousset</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yiying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004792</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orenday-Tapia</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The envelope stress factor DolP associates with the outer membrane protein assembly machinery and supports proper folding and functioning of BamA contributing to preserve envelope integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria forms a protective barrier against harmful compounds, including several antimicrobials. This envelope structure surrounds the inner membrane and the periplasm that contains the peptidoglycan, a net-like structure made of glycan chains and interconnecting peptides. During cell division, the multi-layered envelope structure is remodelled by the divisome machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">den Blaauwen et al., 2017</xref>). At a late step of division, septal peptidoglycan synthesized by the divisome undergoes splitting, initiating the formation of the new poles of adjacent daughter cells. Finally, remodelling of the OM barrier completes formation of the new poles in the cell offspring. The mechanisms by which cells coordinate OM remodelling with peptidoglycan splitting, preserving the permeability barrier of this protective membrane, are ill-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Egan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Integral outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are crucial to maintain the OM permeability barrier. OMPs fold into amphipathic β-barrel structures that span the OM and carry out a variety of tasks. Porins are OMPs that facilitate the diffusion of small metabolites. Other OMPs function as cofactor transporters, secretory channels, or machineries for the assembly of proteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a structural component of the external OM leaflet that prevents the diffusion of noxious chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calmettes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). The β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) is a multi-subunit complex that mediates the folding and membrane insertion of OMPs transiting through the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ranava et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schiffrin et al., 2017</xref>). The essential and evolutionarily conserved BamA insertase subunit is an OMP consisting of an amino (N)-terminal periplasmic domain made of polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA or P) motifs and a carboxy (C)-terminal 16-stranded β-barrel membrane domain that catalyses OMP biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ranava et al., 2018</xref>). The flexible pairing of β-strands 1 and 16 of the BamA β-barrel controls a lateral gate connecting the interior of the barrel towards the surrounding lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>). Conformational dynamics of the BamA β-barrel region proximal to the lateral gate is thought to locally increase the entropy of the surrounding lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doerner and Sousa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>) and to assist the insertion of nascent OMPs into the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle and Bernstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminal periplasmic portion of BamA from the enterobacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> contains five POTRA motifs that serve as a scaffold for four lipoproteins, BamBCDE, which assist BamA during OMP biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The N-terminal POTRA motif is also the docking site for the periplasmic chaperone SurA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>). Together with the chaperones Skp and DegP, SurA contributes to monitor unfolded OMPs transported into the periplasm by the inner membrane general secretory (Sec) apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane and Randall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rizzitello et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Defective OMP assembly causes periplasmic accumulation of unfolded protein transport intermediates. This envelope stress is signalled across the inner membrane to induce the sigmaE (σ<sup>E</sup>)-mediated transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walsh et al., 2003</xref>). In the absence of a stress, σ<sup>E</sup> is sequestered by the inner membrane-spanning RseA factor. By-products of misfolded OMP turnover activate degradation of RseA, liberating σ<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ades, 2008</xref>). The σ<sup>E</sup> response copes with stress (i) by upregulating genes involved in OMP biogenesis, such as the <italic>bam</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rhodius et al., 2006</xref>), and (ii) by lowering the OMP biogenesis burden via a post-transcriptional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guillier et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas σ<sup>E</sup> is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Las Peñas et al., 1997a</xref>), a tight control of cytosolic σ<sup>E</sup> availability is necessary for optimal cell fitness and to prevent a potentially detrimental effect on the envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Las Peñas et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Missiakas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicoloff et al., 2017</xref>). Remarkably, the functions of a number of genes upregulated by σ<sup>E</sup> remain unknown. Among those, <italic>dolP</italic>/<italic>yraP</italic> (recently renamed division and OM stress-associated lipid-binding protein) encodes an ~20 kDa OM-anchored lipoprotein largely conserved in γ and β proteobacteria that is crucial for OM integrity and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Onufryk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seib et al., 2019</xref>). DolP consists of two consecutive BON (bacterial OsmY and nodulation) domains, a family of conserved folding motifs named after the osmotic stress-induced periplasmic protein OsmY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeats and Bateman, 2003</xref>). During a late step of cell division, DolP localizes at the mid-cell where it contributes to the regulation of septal peptidoglycan splitting by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). A recent structural analysis of DolP reveals a phospholipid-binding site in the C-terminal BON domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>). It remains unclear, however, why DolP is upregulated in response to σ<sup>E</sup> activation and how this lipoprotein helps coping with envelope stress.</p><p>By using a genome-wide synthetic-defect screen, we show that DolP is particularly important when the BAM complex is defective and under envelope stress conditions. We demonstrate that DolP interacts with the BAM complex in the OM and supports the proper folding and functioning of the BamA subunit. Taken together our results indicate that DolP functions as a fitness factor during activation of the σ<sup>E</sup> response and that BamA is a molecular target of the fitness role of DolP. We also reveal that, upon envelope stress, DolP loses its association with the mid-cell, thus suggesting a possible link between the envelope stress response and septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis during a late step of cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide synthetic-defect screen identifies <italic>dolP</italic> genetic interactions</title><p>The mutant allele Δ<italic>dolP::kan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baba et al., 2006</xref>) was introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 by P1 transduction.

The ABC transporter-like complex FtsE/FtsX has multiple roles in organizing the cell divisome, including the recruitment of periplasmic EnvC, a LytM domain-containing factor required for the activation of amidases that hydrolyse septal peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pichoff et al., 2019</xref>). This peptidoglycan remodelling reaction is mediated by two sets of highly controlled and partially redundant amidases, AmiA/AmiB and AmiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas AmiA and AmiB are activated at the inner membrane/peptidoglycan interface by the coordinated action of FtsE/FtsX and EnvC, activation of AmiC requires the OM-anchored LytM domain-containing lipoprotein NlpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uehara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Under laboratory conditions, the activity of only one of these two pathways is sufficient for septal peptidoglycan splitting, whereas inhibition of both pathways leads to the formation of chains of partially divided cells, i.e., cells that have begun to divide but that are blocked at the step of septal peptidoglycan splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uehara et al., 2010</xref>). A recent report showed that <italic>dolP</italic> is necessary for completion of septal peptidoglycan splitting and cell separation when the AmiA/AmiB pathway is inactive, somehow linking DolP to AmiC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the reduced fitness caused by silencing of <italic>envC, ftsE, or ftsX</italic> in Δ<italic>dolP</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) can be explained by the impaired cell separation when both the AmiA/AmiB and the AmiC pathways are not active.

The detrimental effect of BAM overproduction was caused by the overaccumulation of BamA in the OM, as the overproduction of an assembly-defective BamA variant, BamA<sup>ΔP1</sup>, that lacks the N-terminal POTRA1 motif and that largely accumulates in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>), did not impair growth to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). Strikingly, the growth defect caused by the overproduction of BamA was fully rescued by the concomitant overproduction of DolP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating a dose-dependent positive-fitness effect of DolP. Most importantly, we noticed that a lower induction of BamA expression (50 μM IPTG) did not cause any major growth defect but determined a marked sensitivity of wild-type cells to vancomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Even under these conditions, the concomitant overproduction of DolP was beneficial and restored growth, thus revealing that DolP contributes to rescue an OM integrity defect caused by increased BamA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>To better understand this phenotype, we analysed the levels of heat-modifiable (properly folded) versus non-heat-modifiable (improperly folded) BamA in cells overproducing equal amounts of BamA and lacking or expressing different levels of DolP. A large fraction of overproduced BamA in wild-type or Δ<italic>dolP</italic> cells was non-heat-modifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 1–4). Given that overproduced BamA did not accumulate in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we deduce that improperly folded BamA is associated with the OM. In contrast to BamA, OmpA that was overproduced with a similar plasmid and the same amount of inducer was quantitatively heat-modifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that this degree of protein expression did not saturate the OMP biogenesis machinery. We noticed that cells overproducing BamA had reduced OMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 5–8), suggesting that improperly folded BamA may interfere with the OMP biogenesis activity of the endogenous BAM complex. Strikingly, when DolP was concomitantly overproduced with BamA, virtually all BamA was found to be heat-modifiable, suggesting that it could properly fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lanes 5–8). The overproduction of DolP partially rescued the wild-type level of OMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 9–12), indicating some degree of restoration of the BamA function. The fact that the wild-type OMP levels were not fully restored probably owes to the lack of stoichiometric amounts of the BAM lipoproteins compared to the amount of BamA in these cells. Taken together these results suggest that the detrimental effects inherent to incremental BamA expression correlate well with the observed BamA folding defect. Most importantly, DolP can restore proper folding of BamA rescuing OM integrity. We could not detect the non-heat-modifiable form of BamA produced at endogenous levels in a Δ<italic>dolP</italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is possible that low levels of improperly folded BamA would be promptly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narita et al., 2013</xref>), whereas when BamA is produced at higher levels, the larger fraction of improperly folded BamA may not be degraded as efficiently and is thus detected. Overall, these results indicate that DolP supports proper folding and functioning of BamA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DolP interacts with BamA assembled in the OM</title><p>We wished to investigate whether DolP physically interacts with the BAM complex.

Under these conditions, BamA was efficiently co-eluted together with DolP<sup>His</sup>, demonstrating that BamA and DolP can interact even in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of the BAM lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Coomassie staining). To assess if the interaction of DolP and BAM takes place at the OM, DolP<sup>His</sup> was overproduced together with the assembly-defective form BamA<sup>ΔP1</sup>. When expressed together with DolP<sup>His</sup>, assembly-defective BamA<sup>ΔP1</sup> was highly depleted in the corresponding eluate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 7), even though BamA<sup>ΔP1</sup> was only marginally reduced in the crude envelope fraction with respect to wild-type BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3). In contrast to BamA<sup>ΔP1</sup>, the BamA<sup>ΔP2</sup> variant, which is efficiently assembled into the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), was co-eluted to a similar extent as wild-type BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 8). We conclude that DolP has affinity for OM-assembled BamA.</p><p>To verify the proximity of DolP to BamA in living cells, we performed in vivo site-directed photo-crosslinking. A photo-activatable amino acid analog, p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa), was introduced by amber suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chin et al., 2002</xref>) at 17 distinct positions in DolP, three in the linker between the N-terminal lipid-modified cysteine residue and the first BON domain (BON1), eight in BON1, and six in the second BON domain (BON2). Bpa can crosslink with other amino acids at a distance of 3–4 Å, possibly revealing direct protein–protein interactions. Upon UV irradiation and Ni-affinity purification of DolP, several crosslink products were identified by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using both anti-DolP and anti-BamA antibodies, a crosslink product of approximately 115 kDa was detected with samples containing Bpa at positions V52, V72 and, to a lower extent, V101. Notably, positions V52, V72, and V101 are proximal in the three-dimensional structure of DolP with their side chains exposed on the surface of BON1 and oriented away from BON2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, these results identify in BON1 a site of interaction of DolP with BamA. In addition, a major crosslink product with an apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa was detected with Bpa at several DolP positions, and most prominently V52, I64, V72, and V101 of BON1. This product is approximately 35 kDa larger than the mass of DolP. When analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, tryptic peptides of DolP and OmpA (37 kDa) were identified in the 55 kDa crosslink products obtained with Bpa at position V41 and V52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). LC-MS/MS analysis further identified a peptide of the C-terminal domain of OmpA, which localizes in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>), to be crosslinked by Bpa at position V52 of DolP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–2F</xref>). Thus, whereas OmpA could not be detected in native pull-downs of affinity-tagged DolP, it was efficiently crosslinked. Compared to Δ<italic>dolP</italic>, cells lacking OmpA are not susceptible to vancomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and can tolerate the overproduction of BamA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that OmpA is not required for DolP function. Finally, a series of crosslink products with molecular weights approximately two to six times the mass of DolP were detected with anti-DolP antibodies when Bpa was introduced at position F157 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that DolP can form oligomers.</p><p>In seeking a detergent that would interfere with the interaction of BAM and DolP, and allow their purification as separate components, we solubilized the envelope fraction with increasing amounts of n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), a detergent previously used to isolate the native BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>). At concentrations of DDM between 0.3% (w/v) and 1% (w/v), we observed a drastic reduction in the amounts of BAM subunits that were co-eluted with DolP<sup>His</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the BAM–DolP interaction is sensitive to DDM. We thus used 1% (w/v) DDM to extract and purify His-tagged DolP or His-tagged BAM as separate components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). When analysed by blue native-PAGE and immunoblotting, purified DolP gave rise to a diffused signal at around 450 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lane 1), suggesting a dynamic multimeric organization of this protein. Purified BAM migrated as expected at 250 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lane 7). When roughly equimolar amounts of purified BAM and DolP were pre-incubated in the presence of a low DDM concentration and subsequently resolved by blue native-PAGE, a complex with an apparent molecular weight higher than that of the BAM complex was detected with both anti-BamA- and anti-DolP-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lanes 3–6), suggesting that DolP can associate with the penta-subunit BAM complex. Taken together our results demonstrate that DolP can interact with the BAM complex, making direct contacts with OM-assembled BamA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BamA overaccumulation in the OM reduces DolP mid-cell localization</title><p>In light of our observation that DolP interacts with BAM, we asked whether the envelope localization patterns of DolP and BAM are reciprocally linked. First, we monitored the effect of DolP expression on the localization of the chromosomally encoded BamD<sup>mCherry</sup> subunit of the BAM complex. This protein generated a fluorescence signal throughout the envelope that was not affected by the lack or the overproduction of DolP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we checked the effect on DolP localization of BAM overaccumulation in the OM. DolP associates with the OM and accumulates at mid-cell during a late step of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). To monitor the localization of DolP, we used a strain harbouring a chromosomal <italic>dolP-gfp</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The localization of the DolP<sup>GFP</sup> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) was analysed concomitantly with two other chromosomally encoded markers of the division septum, ZipA<sup>mCherry</sup> or NlpD<sup>mCherry</sup>. ZipA is involved in an early step of divisome assembly and accumulates at division sites before, as well as, during envelope constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hale and de Boer, 1997</xref>). Instead, NlpD is a late marker of cell division involved in the activation of AmiC and accumulates at septa that are already undergoing constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uehara et al., 2010</xref>). DolP<sup>GFP</sup> accumulated at mid-cell sites where the envelope appeared invaginated, showing a localization pattern similar to that of NlpD<sup>mCherry</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). We investigated the effect of short-lived (1 hr) BAM overproduction on DolP<sup>GFP</sup> localization. Strikingly, we found that BAM overproduction depleted DolP<sup>GFP</sup> from mid-cell sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, plot, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>, left). In contrast, no obvious effects on cell division nor on mid-cell recruitment of ZipA<sup>mCherry</sup> and NlpD<sup>mCherry</sup> were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The overproduction of BamA alone was sufficient to alter the distribution of the DolP<sup>GFP</sup> fluorescence signal in constricting cells, with its intensity being reduced at constriction sites but enhanced at decentred positions along the cell axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

To address this question, we made use of an inactive BamA mutant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>) harbouring a polyhistidine peptide extension at its C-terminal β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartmann et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to the overaccumulation of the BAM complex or BamA, the overaccumulation of BamA<sup>His</sup> interfered with DolP mid-cell localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>), without affecting ZipA<sup>mCherry</sup> and NlpD<sup>mCherry</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), indicating that the cellular localization of DolP does not depend on the OMP-assembly activity of BamA. In contrast, the ability of BamA to assemble into the OM was a critical determinant of the observed septal depletion of DolP. In fact, the periplasm-accumulating BamA<sup>ΔP1/His</sup> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>) did not impair DolP<sup>GFP</sup> mid-cell localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>, centre), whereas the OM-overaccumulating BamA<sup>ΔP2/His</sup> did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>, right, 4C and 4D).

To this end, first we analysed the localization of DolP<sup>GFP</sup> in strains lacking either the OMP chaperone SurA or the lipoprotein BamB. Both Δ<italic>surA</italic> and Δ<italic>bamB</italic> strains are defective in OMP biogenesis and produce higher levels of BAM complex due to activation of the σ<sup>E</sup> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rouvière and Gross, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vertommen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, the frequency of mid-cell labelling by DolP<sup>GFP</sup> was reduced in Δ<italic>surA</italic> cells both in minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>, centre) and LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) culture media. In contrast, lack of SurA did not affect septal recruitment of the late cell division marker NlpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The analysis of the fluorescence plot profiles of constricted cells clearly showed a marked reduction of the DolP<sup>GFP</sup> signal at mid-cell sites and higher fluorescence levels at decentred positions along the cell axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right plot). As for the Δ<italic>surA</italic> strain, DolP<sup>GFP</sup> accumulated at the mid-cell with a lower frequency when <italic>bamB</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>, bottom). Together, these results indicate that, during envelope stress, DolP is depleted at mid-cell sites.</p><p>Because the levels of OmpA and OmpC are reduced under envelope stress conditions, we investigated if these OMPs are required for the mid-cell localization of DolP. In both <italic>ompA</italic> or <italic>ompC</italic> deletion strains, we observed marked DolP<sup>GFP</sup> intensities at cell constriction sites, indicating that neither OmpA nor OmpC are crucial for DolP mid-cell localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Nevertheless, the plot collective profile of DolP<sup>GFP</sup> in Δ<italic>ompA</italic> showed a marginal reduction of fluorescence intensity at the mid-cell and a similarly small increment at non-septal positions. Like BamA, OmpA was crosslinked with DolP at position V52. By monitoring this crosslink reaction, we found that the DolP-BamA association is enhanced in the absence of OmpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that OmpA competes with BamA for an interaction with DolP. Hence, the depletion of OmpA in stressed cells might favour the interaction of DolP with BamA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Upon envelope stress, the BAM complex and other OM biogenesis factors are upregulated to meet the cellular demand for OMP assembly. The role of DolP, which is also upregulated by the envelope stress response, was unclear. In our study, we uncover that DolP supports cell fitness under envelope stress conditions and we demonstrate that the BAM complex, in particular its central catalytic subunit BamA, is a direct target of such fitness function.</p><p>First we have shown that in cells that lack BamB and undergo envelope stress, DolP is important to maintain the levels of BamA. Next, we have exploited the observation that, when overproduced, BamA impairs OM integrity, causing a detrimental effect dependent on its accumulation in the OM. Under these conditions, a significant portion of membrane-embedded BamA is improperly folded and OMP biogenesis is reduced. We have shown that an increment of DolP expression rescues proper folding of BamA and, to some extent, efficient OMP biogenesis. Finally, we have demonstrated that DolP directly interacts with the BAM complex in the OM, making contacts to BamA. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that DolP contributes to preserve the OM integrity by supporting the function of BamA, thus shedding some light on how DolP copes with envelope stress.</p><p>In addition to promoting efficient OMP biogenesis, proper folding of BamA may be necessary to regulate the dynamics of this protein in the OM. As part of the mechanism by which BAM functions in OMP biogenesis, BamA is predicted to interfere with the organization of the surrounding lipid bilayer and to generate an energetically favourable environment for the insertion of nascent OMPs in the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fleming, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horne et al., 2020</xref>). BamA-mediated destabilization of a lipid bilayer was shown by molecular dynamics simulations, as well as by reconstituting both BamA into proteoliposomes and the BAM complex into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iadanza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinnige et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, when reconstituted into a lipid bilayer, BamA can form pores characterized by variable conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stegmeier and Andersen, 2006</xref>). With an improperly folded conformation, these features of BamA may be uncontrolled and potentially detrimental for OM integrity. The finding that DolP supports proper folding of BamA provides an explanation as to how DolP helps preserving OM integrity. This role of DolP is reminiscent of the chaperone function attributed to a different dual BON-domain protein, OsmY, which promotes the folding of a specific subclass of OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that, by associating with BamA, DolP directly contributes to its folding in the OM. The evidence that DolP associates but does not form a stoichiometric complex with BAM is consistent with the hypothesis that DolP may transiently act on BamA similar to a chaperone. Notably, although the chaperone SurA is not required for BamA assembly in the OM, it was shown that in the absence of this factor a portion of BamA is proteolytically degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennion et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narita et al., 2013</xref>). It is thus tempting to explain the quasi-lethal phenotype of a double <italic>surA</italic> and <italic>dolP</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Onufryk et al., 2005</xref>) with a scenario where at least SurA or DolP must be expressed to maintain BamA in a properly folded conformation. Further studies will be warranted to determine in detail the molecular bases of how DolP helps preserving the proper folding of BamA in the OM.</p><p>The observation that DolP binds anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>), is particularly interesting in the contest of the BAM–DolP interaction. Phospholipid binding is mediated by residues in BON2 of DolP, away from to the site of interaction with BamA that we have identified in BON1. Conceivably, the binding of BamA may not interfere with the ability of DolP to interact with phospholipids. However, whether phospholipid binding by DolP plays a role in supporting proper folding and activity of BamA remains to be determined. In an in vitro experimental set-up, the OMP-assembly activity of BamA is only marginally dependent on the surrounding lipid content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hussain and Bernstein, 2018</xref>). It is intriguing however that amino acid residues of the BamA POTRA domains can make contact with the lipid head-groups on the periplasmic surface of the OM and that BamE interacts with an anionic phospholipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fleming et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Knowles et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, two non-mutually exclusive scenarios should be considered: (i) enriching the BAM sites with negatively charged phospholipids may be part of the mechanism by which DolP contributes to maintain BamA in a properly folded conformation; (ii) DolP may interact with phospholipids in proximity of the BAM complex and form a structure that helps preserving the integrity of these sites. Of note, we have obtained some evidence that DolP can form oligomers, but it remains to be established whether these DolP structures form in proximity of the BAM complex.</p><p>Whereas we have shown that DolP restores an OM integrity defect inherent to BamA expression, we cannot exclude that also other OM features determined by the activation of the envelope stress response require the activity of DolP. In any event, a key finding of our study is that DolP mid-cell localization is sensitive to envelope stress conditions. During envelope stress, the OM undergoes a significant alteration of its protein composition, with a marked downregulation of porins and OmpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rhodius et al., 2006</xref>). OMPs are largely arranged in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jarosławski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rassam et al., 2015</xref>) embedded by highly organized LPS molecules in the external leaflet of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nikaido, 2003</xref>) and the rigidity of their β-barrel structures contributes to the mechanical stiffness of the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lessen et al., 2018</xref>). Downregulation targets of σ<sup>E</sup> also include the lipoproteins Pal and Lpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gogol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), which are critical for OM integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asmar and Collet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cascales et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, we have shown that the overaccumulation of BAM in the OM influences DolP localization, suggesting that during stress the upregulation of BamA contributes to deplete DolP from cell constriction sites. We have also obtained evidence that OmpA competes with BamA for an interaction with DolP. A role of OmpA in buffering the function of an envelope stress factor has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dekoninck et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that during envelope stress, the depletion of OmpA might enhance the interaction of DolP with BamA.</p><p>Distinct biogenesis and surveillance pathways are required to maintain the protective function of the multi-layered envelope of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Egan et al., 2020</xref>). The hits of our CRISPRi synthetic-defect screen in Δ<italic>dolP</italic> cells include mainly genes involved in efficient transport and assembly of OMPs or in the activation of the σ<sup>E</sup>-mediated envelope stress response, which is consistent with the notion that DolP supports the high demand for OMP biogenesis during stress. In addition, genes involved in the activation of the AmiA pathway of septal peptidoglycan splitting were identified. This result is in line with the conclusions of a previous study implicating DolP in the regulation of the NlpD-mediated activation of AmiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). Cells lacking both NlpD and AmiC have reduced OM integrity, which contributes to explain the vancomycin sensitivity of Δ<italic>dolP</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, our observation that mid-cell localization of DolP is reduced under envelope stress conditions points to a possible role of DolP in linking envelope stress to septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Reduced levels of DolP at mid-cell sites, and thus impaired AmiC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>), could play an important role in coping with envelope stress, for instance by regulating the window of time available to restore efficient OMP biogenesis prior to completing the formation of the new poles in the cell offspring.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal an unprecedented function for DolP in supporting the correct folding of BamA, providing an explanation as to how DolP promotes OM integrity and why this factor is upregulated during envelope stress. The identified role of DolP in supporting the BamA function represents a potentially exploitable target in the development of alternative antibacterial therapies. The re-localization of DolP during stress points to a mechanistic link between activation of the envelope stress response and a late step of cell division that will be interesting to investigate in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Consistent with previous studies showing that DolP is required for envelope integrity, the authors show that a dolP deletion strain is sensitive to vancomycin. They then use an elegant CRISPRi-based synthetic phenotype screen to show that the silencing (or partial silencing) of genes that encode factors that promote cell division, regulate the σ<sup>E</sup> stress response, or promote efficient assembly of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) exacerbate defects associated with the deletion of dolP. In the second half of the paper, they show that although DolP does not play a direct role in OMP assembly, it becomes important when OMP assembly is impaired or when BamA, a major subunit of the OMP assembly machinery (BAM) that binds to DolP, is overexpressed and thereby titrates DolP away from the septum.</p><p>Although the experiments presented in this study were nicely executed and the data are of a high quality, I had trouble fitting all of the experimental observations into a convincing model that explains the function of DolP. The authors propose that DolP is a cell division factor that also prevents detrimental effects of excessive BAM production during cell stress. This is a nice idea that is supported by the data, but it does not explain why the deletion of dolP causes an outer membrane defect that increases sensitivity to vancomycin in unstressed cells.

The explanation as to why DolP is important for OM integrity is likely to be multifactorial. It was proposed that the OM integrity defect of Δ<italic>dolP</italic> cells could be caused, at least in part, by the impaired NlpD-mediated activation of AmiC (Tsang et al., Plos Genetics 13:e1006888, 2017). In our revised manuscript, we reveal that DolP supports BamA folding, providing additional insight into why DolP is critical form OM integrity.</p><p>In response to comments of all three reviewers, we have further addressed the mechanism by which DolP promotes envelope integrity. To this end, we have carried out new sets of experiments:</p><p>– We have shown that, in a strain that undergoes envelope stress such as Δ<italic>bamB,</italic> lack of DolP causes a reduction of the levels of BamA, inferring that DolP is critical for BamA stability, at least under stress conditions (new Figure 2D).</p><p>– We had already revealed in our first submission that the overaccumulation of the BAM complex in the OM is particularly detrimental in cells lacking DolP. This experimental setup was exploited to assay the function of DolP under an envelope stress condition. In the revised version of our manuscript we extend this analysis. We show that a more marginal accumulation of BamA, which does not cause toxicity, enhances the OM permeability to vancomycin (new Figure 3E). We also demonstrate that OM integrity is restored by the concomitant increase of the levels of DolP expression (new Figure 3E). Overall, the fact that DolP opposes the detrimental effects of BamA overproduction (new Figures 3D and 3E) suggests that DolP is critical for the correct functioning of BamA.</p><p>– We have carried out additional experiments to obtain insight into the molecular bases of how DolP influences BamA. First we have investigated why the accumulation of BamA causes a detrimental effect. Fractionation of cells that overproduce BamA and heat-modifiability analysis of their protein content have revealed that overproduced BamA efficiently accumulates in the OM, however a large portion of this protein is improperly folded (new Figure 3F and Figure 3-figure suppl. 1D). To understand how DolP opposes the BamA detrimental effect, we have conducted the same experiment with cells that overproduce both BamA and DolP. Notably, we found that the increased expression of DolP restores proper folding, and to some extent functioning, of BamA (new Figures 3F and 3G).</p><p>– As discussed in another response to a point of the reviewers, we have used site-directed photo-crosslinking to prove the proximity of DolP to BamA in vivo (new Figure 4C).</p><p>Taken together our work demonstrates that DolP interacts with BamA and supports its proper folding in the OM. These observations provide a plausible explanation as to why DolP is critical for OM integrity and to cope with envelope stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. Based on structural data, the BAM lipoproteins bind to the POTRA domains of BamA that are close to the membrane and likely hinder the access of other proteins, so it is not entirely clear how a small lipoprotein like DolP would interact with BamA. Does DolP prevent the binding of the lipoproteins or force their dissociation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the organization of DolP with the BAM subunits is a very interesting point to investigate. We have addressed the interaction of DolP with the BAM complex using different methodologies, in vivo and in vitro. Our native pull-down analysis reveals that at least BamA, BamD, BamC and BamE can be co-isolated with DolP (Figure 4A). We could not address whether BamB was also co-isolated with DolP as we do not have an antiserum that specifically recognizes this subunit of the BAM complex. However, to investigate if DolP can interact with the BAM holo-complex (including all its 5 core subunits), we have reconstituted the interaction in vitro and we have analyzed the product of this reaction by blue native gel electrophoresis. We have compared the molecular mass of the purified BAM complex alone to that of the BAM complex supplemented with DolP (Figures 4D and 4E). Our immunoblots with either DolP or BamA antibodies have revealed a complex that migrates slower than BAM in samples supplemented with DolP. Because DolP (20 kDa) is significantly smaller than BamB (42 kDa), the slower migration of the BAM-DolP complex compared to BAM alone strongly suggests that DolP interacts with the BAM holo-complex. In the revised manuscript, we have slightly modified the description of this result to better highlight this important nuance in the interpretation of our blue native analysis of the BAM-DolP complex.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that previous biochemical and structural studies have reported <italic>i</italic>) that both the β-barrel and the periplasmic domains of BamA are highly dynamic; <italic>ii</italic>) that the BAM lipoproteins interact with BamA mainly via interactions with POTRA3 in proximity of the linker with POTRA2 (in the case of BamB), and via POTRA 5 (in the case of BamCDE). In particular, a domain-dissection analysis of the BamA periplasmic POTRA motifs indicated that POTRA5, but not the other POTRA motifs, is a key requirement for the association of BamCDE to BamA (Kim et al., Science 317:961-4, 2007). Together, these observations suggest that several subdomains of BamA may be available for an interaction with a relatively small protein, such as DolP (20 kDa), without necessarily causing the dissociation of the BAM lipoproteins. Thus, in our opinion, it does not appear surprising that the association of DolP with BamA does not abolish its interaction with the other lipoproteins of the complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further information on the site of interaction would help to address this question and perhaps provide further insight into DolP function.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much agree with the reviewer that mapping of the DolP-BamA interaction can be potentially insightful. To address this point, we have performed in vivo site-directed photo-crosslinking, showing that DolP positions V52, V72 and, to a lower extent, V101, are proximal to BamA (new Figure 4C and Figure 4-figure suppl. 1B). Although we have used mass-spectrometry in the attempt to identify the amino acid residues of BamA crosslinked by DolP, this approach was not successful. Nevertheless, we have obtained information on the site of the DolP three-dimensional structure that makes contact to BamA. In fact, positions V52, V72 and V101 are proximal in the three-dimensional structure of DolP with their side chains oriented away from the BON2 domain and exposed on the surface of the BON1 domain (new Figure 4C). Thus, these results identify in BON1 a site of interaction with BamA. Whereas the C-terminal BON2 domain of DolP was shown to bind phospholipids (Bryant et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 9, 2020), the role of the BON1 domain was unclear. Our result provides an additional piece of information on the organization of DolP at the BAM complex suggesting that BON1 can be important for the association of DolP with BamA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some of the genes that are silenced in the CRISPRi screen are essential or nearly essential for cell viability (e.g., BamD, FtsEX), so presumably they are only partially silenced. The authors should clarify this point and perhaps add some data that indicates how effectively the levels of expression are reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>The efficiency of gene silencing by dCas9 depends on the guide RNAs that targets specific genetic features. To address the point raised by the reviewer, we have conducted a western blot showing the silencing effect by 2 guide RNAs specific for BamD (essential gene) and BamE (non-essential gene), respectively. Upon expressing dCas9 for 17 generations, (as conducted in the genome-wide screen presented in Figures 1B and 1C), the expression of both <italic>bamD</italic> and <italic>bamE</italic> was reduced (new Figure 1-figure suppl. 2D), although the silencing effect was more prominent for <italic>bamE</italic>. A residual production of BamD explains why repression of <italic>bamD</italic> was not lethal in our drop tests. However, this degree of <italic>bamD</italic> repression was sufficient to cause a synthetic growth defect when combined with the deletion of <italic>dolP</italic> (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript relates to the regulation of bacterial outer membrane remodelling and biogenesis.

Subsequently, we have mimicked a feature of the OM of cells undergoing envelope stress and monitored the DolP-BamA interaction.</p><p>– First, DolP positions V52, V72 and, to a lower extent, V101, were found to be crosslinked to BamA.

The mass spectrometry analysis identified in the C-terminal periplasmic domain of OmpA the site of interaction of DolP (new Figure 4-figure suppl. 2D-F). Importantly, by mimicking a feature of the envelope stress response (depletion of OmpA), we have obtained evidence that OmpA competes with BamA for an interaction with DolP (new Figure 5D). Thus, during envelope stress the depletion of OmpA might play an important role by favouring the association of DolP with BamA. The notion that OmpA plays a role in buffering the function of a stress response factor was recently suggested in another study. OmpA was proposed to modulate the signalling function of a periplasmic stress response factor (RcsF) via a competition mechanism (Dekoninck et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 9, 2020). In light of those and our results, we like to believe that OmpA may play a more general role in buffering the function of envelope stress response factors that would become readily available as soon as the levels of OmpA are reduced as a consequence of stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer would be very interested to know how the interactions and properties of DolP affect outer membrane biogenesis and exactly what role it plays in the response to envelope stress and cell division.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we shown that cells that accumulate improperly folded BamA in their membrane fraction present an OM integrity defect which is rescued by the overproduction of DolP (Figure 3E). We have obtained some mechanistic insights into this rescuing function of DolP. First, the accumulation of improperly folded BamA causes a reduction of the levels of OmpA and OmpC (new Figure 3G). Second, overproduced DolP restores proper folding of BamA and to some extent the normal levels of OmpA and OmpC (new Figures 3E and 3G). These results suggest that, by improving the folding of BamA in the OM, DolP indirectly promotes efficient OMP biogenesis, thereby restoring OM integrity. We believe these results are revelatory of a mechanism by which DolP supports the BAM complex in meeting the high demand for OMP assembly under a stress condition.</p><p>Finally, we have demonstrated that envelope stress as well as the overaccumulation of BamA impairs the recruitment of DolP at cell constriction sites during a late step of cell division, and that this effect is specific for DolP. Reduced levels of DolP at cell constriction sites have a negative effect on the regulation of septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis (Tsang et al., Plos Genetics 13:e1006888, 2017). Further studies will be warranted to better understand how DolP influences septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis. In our work, however, we have focused mainly on the role of DolP during envelope stress and in particular we have addressed the function of the DolP-BamA interaction. In addition to the new results that we have incorporated in the revised manuscript, we have modified the Abstract, the final paragraph of the Introduction and the Discussion to highlight our new mechanistic findings and to better focus our revised manuscript on the role of DolP during envelope stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and interesting. The experiments are well done, with the appropriate controls. Overall, the work is very solid and the data convincing. However, although the authors report interesting observations and raise intriguing hypothesis on the function of DolP, they fail to identify it and provide little mechanistic insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments of the reviewer on the quality of our work and on the clarity of our manuscript. We have taken into consideration the criticism of this reviewer and we have conducted new experiments to address the function of DolP.</p><p>In response to comments of all three reviewers, we have further addressed the mechanism by which DolP promotes envelope integrity. To this end, we have carried out new sets of experiments:</p><p>– We have shown that, in a strain that undergoes envelope stress such as Δ<italic>bamB,</italic> lack of DolP causes a reduction of the levels of BamA, inferring that DolP is critical for BamA stability, at least under stress conditions (new Figure 2D).</p><p>– We had already revealed in our first submission that the overaccumulation of the BAM complex in the OM is particularly detrimental in cells lacking DolP. This experimental setup was exploited to assay the function of DolP under an envelope stress condition. In the revised version of our manuscript we extend this analysis. We show that a more marginal accumulation of BamA, which does not cause toxicity, enhances the OM permeability to vancomycin (new Figure 3E). We also demonstrate that OM integrity is restored by the concomitant increase of the levels of DolP expression (new Figure 3E). Overall, the fact that DolP opposes the detrimental effects of BamA overproduction (new Figures 3D and 3E) suggests that DolP is critical for the correct functioning of BamA.</p><p>– We have carried out additional experiments to obtain insight into the molecular bases of how DolP influences BamA. First we have investigated why the accumulation of BamA causes a detrimental effect. Fractionation of cells that overproduce BamA and heat-modifiability analysis of their protein content have revealed that overproduced BamA efficiently accumulates in the OM, however a large portion of this protein is improperly folded (new Figure 3F and Figure 3-figure suppl. 1D). To understand how DolP opposes the BamA detrimental effect, we have conducted the same experiment with cells that overproduce both BamA and DolP. Notably, we found that the increased expression of DolP restores proper folding, and to some extent functioning, of BamA (new Figures 3F and 3G).</p><p>– As discussed in another response to a point of the reviewers, we have used site-directed photo-crosslinking to prove the proximity of DolP to BamA in vivo (new Figure 4C).</p><p>Taken together our work demonstrates that DolP interacts with BamA and supports its proper folding in the OM. These observations provide a plausible explanation as to why DolP is critical for OM integrity and to cope with envelope stress.</p><p>We have simplified Figure 2-figure suppl. 1, the scope of which is to show that DolP does not play a direct role in OMP assembly. As we show in the subsequent part of the manuscript, this role is linked to proper BamA folding and functioning, which might be particularly important to meet the high demand for OMP assembly under a stress condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interaction between DolP and the Bam machinery is mostly shown using immunoblots, which are very sensitive. The authors used periplasmic and inner membrane proteins as controls (also OmpA in one of the experiment). However, they need to include additional outer membrane (lipo)proteins as controls.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point of the reviewer, we have included additional controls for the immunoblots of our pull-downs (OmpA immunoblot in Figure 4A and LamB immunoblot in Figure 4-figure suppl. 1A). Most importantly, the concern of the reviewer about the specificity of the DolP-BamA interaction has been addressed by proving the vicinity of DolP to BamA with an in vivo site-directed photo-crosslinking method (new Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The depletion of DolP from mid-cell under stress is interesting; the authors need to show that this correlates with an increase in the levels of the DolP-BamA complex (using cross-linking for instance).</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate this comment that we have addressed with new experiments. First we have used in vivo site-directed photo-crosslinking and we have identified in the BON1 domain of DolP a site of interaction with BamA. We found also that the same site of DolP interacts with the C-terminal periplasmic domain of OmpA (new Figure 4C, Figure 4-figure suppl. 1B, Figure 4-figure suppl. 2). Our crosslink experiment is conducted in a strain deleted of chromosomal <italic>dolP</italic> and harbouring plasmid-borne <italic>dolP</italic><sup>amber</sup> (conditionally expressed when Bpa is supplemented to the growth medium). Given that lack of DolP causes a strong fitness defects under envelope stress conditions, performing the same crosslinking experiment upon inducing stress, as suggested by the reviewer, would pose a number of important experimental challenges. Instead, we have conducted our crosslink experiment in a strain that mimics a feature of the envelope stress response, and in particular the depletion of OmpA. Our results indicate that OmpA competes with BamA for the interaction with DolP (new Figure 5D). In cells lacking OmpA, we have also noticed a slight reduction of the DolP<sup>GFP</sup> signal at the mid-cell as well as a small increment of the signal at non-septal position. Under envelope stress conditions, the drastic reduction of the levels of OmpA might favour the association of DolP with BamA.</p><p>As stated in response to reviewer 2, the notion that OmpA plays a role in buffering the function of a stress response factor was recently suggested in another paper. OmpA was proposed to modulate the signalling function of the periplasmic stress response factor (RcsF) via a competition mechanism (Dekoninck et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 9, 2020). In light of those and our results, we like to believe that OmpA may play a more general role in buffering the function of a periplasmic stress-response factors that would become readily available as soon as the levels of OmpA are reduced as a consequence of stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should comment more on the link with the amidases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the link with amidases is very interesting. We demonstrate that envelope stress, as well as the overaccumulation of BamA, impair the recruitment of DolP at cell constriction sites during a late step of cell division, and that this effect is specific for DolP. Presumably, reduced levels of DolP at cell constriction sites may have a negative effect on the regulation of septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of DolP in the regulation of septal peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Our revised work, however, focuses mainly on the role of DolP during envelope stress and in particular addresses the function of the DolP-BamA interaction. We have modified the Abstract, the final paragraph of the Introduction and the Discussion to highlight our new mechanistic findings and to better focus our manuscript on the role of DolP during envelope stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should normalise the levels of BamA and BamA∆P1 used in the experiment shown in Figure 4C (difficult to compare lanes 2-3 to 6-7)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have quantified these results, normalizing the amount of BamA in the elution to the amount of BamA in the total fractions. Our quantifications clearly confirm our initial conclusion that the deletion of POTRA1 reduces the amount of BamA that is assembled into the OM. The new data are shown in the legend of the Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The plots shown in Figure 5 B and C are convincing. They should also be shown in Figure 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>The fluorescence collective profile plot of cells overproducing all the BAM subunits has been added to Figure 5A. Similarly to BamA, the overproduction of all BAM subunits impairs the localization of DolP at cell constriction sites, thus confirming our initial conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
