In <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species, transcription of rRNA is activated by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) accessory transcription factor CarD, which interacts directly with RNAP to stabilize the RNAP-promoter open complex formed on rRNA genes. The functions of CarD have been extensively studied, but the mechanisms that control its expression remain obscure. Here, we report that the level of CarD was tightly regulated when mycobacterial cells switched from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deprived conditions. At the translational level, an antisense RNA of <italic>carD</italic> (AscarD) was induced in a SigF-dependent manner to bind with <italic>carD</italic> mRNA and inhibit CarD translation, while at the post-translational level, the residual intracellular CarD was quickly degraded by the Clp protease. AscarD thus worked synergistically with Clp protease to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress. Altogether, our work elucidates the regulation mode of CarD and delineates a new mechanism for the mycobacterial starvation response, which is important for the adaptation and persistence of mycobacterial pathogens in the host environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>starvation response</kwd><kwd>global regulator CarD</kwd><kwd>Clp protease</kwd><kwd>antisense RNA</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019M662654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xinfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galperin</surname><given-names>Michael Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Under starvation conditions, anti-<italic>carD</italic> antisense RNA and Clp protease work together to decrease the CarD level to mediate the adaptation and survival of mycobacterial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial starvation response refers to the physiological changes occurring in bacteria due to the lack of external nutrients during their growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morita, 1982</xref>). Under starvation conditions, bacterial cells usually reduce the synthesis of rRNA and ribosome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gourse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paul et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanisms of starvation response that have been elucidated in such bacteria as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> work primarily by reducing rRNA transcription via decreasing the stability of the transcription initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauryliuk et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium</italic> is a widespread genus of Gram-positive bacteria that comprises several important pathogens, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, which kills ~1.5 million people every year. One of the main difficulties in eliminating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is that it usually responds to various host stresses, such as nutritional starvation, low oxygen, and low pH, by entering into a dormant state, which renders the organism extremely resistant to host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gengenbacher and Kaufmann, 2012</xref>). This genus also includes nonpathogens, such as <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, which is widely used as a model organism for mycobacterial research. At present, the starvation response mechanisms of mycobacterial cells remain obscure.</p><p>Mycobacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is usually less efficient in forming RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo) than <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP on the rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2015</xref>), and the RPo formed is rather unstable and readily reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rammohan et al., 2015</xref>). To overcome this deficiency, mycobacterial cells have evolved two accessory transcription factors, CarD and RbpA, that help RNAP form a stable RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rammohan et al., 2016</xref>). Both are global transcription factors that interact directly with RNAP to regulate the transcription of many downstream genes, including those of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rammohan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sudalaiyadum Perumal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). CarD stabilizes mycobacterial RPo via a two-tiered kinetic mechanism. First, CarD binds to the RNAP-promoter closed complex (RPc) to increase the rate of DNA opening; then, CarD associates with RPo with a high affinity to prevent the DNA bubble collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rammohan et al., 2015</xref>). Although binding of CarD to RNAP tends to increase the stability of RPo, it may also delay the dissociation of RNAP from the promoter region and thus hinder transcription progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, CarD may also inhibit the expression of certain genes. Whether CarD activates or inhibits the expression of a specific target gene appears to be determined by the kinetics of the initiation complex formation among CarD, RNAP, and the specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). CarD was found to be essential for the survival of mycobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>) and weakening the interaction between CarD and RNAP rendered mycobacterial cells more sensitive to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and the effect of some antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiss et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study showed that CarD regulates (either activates or inhibits) the expression of approximately two-thirds of genes in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the fact that CarD plays such a critical role in mycobacteria, the mechanisms that regulate its cellular levels remain largely uncharacterized.</p><p>It is worth noting that CarD was initially thought to inhibit the transcription of rRNA genes, and the transcription of <italic>carD</italic> was upregulated in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>). However, more recently, it was reported that CarD is a transcriptional activator of rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rammohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2013</xref>) and the growth rates of mycobacterial cells positively correlate with the CarD content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiss et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the expression of CarD is still considered to be upregulated in response to starvation. If this was the case, the increased CarD would accelerate rRNA synthesis and mycobacterial growth under the starvation condition, which seems to contradict the current consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Irving and Corrigan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rasouly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is important to clarify the regulation of CarD expression under starvation conditions. In the current study, we found that although <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels were upregulated in response to starvation, its protein levels dramatically decreased. Further, we found that the reduction of CarD protein level under starvation conditions is a common regulatory mechanism that depends upon the functioning of both antisense RNA and Clp protease. This study describes the mechanisms behind the apparent contradiction between CarD mRNA and protein levels and reveals a new mechanism of mycobacterial response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CarD protein level increases under genotoxic stresses but dramatically decreases under starvation conditions</title><p>CarD is an essential RNAP-interacting protein that regulates the transcription of rRNA genes and many related genes by stabilizing the RPo. While Stallings et al. found that the <italic>carD</italic> gene is upregulated in response to starvation and genotoxic stresses in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strain mc<sup>2</sup>155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>), they only monitored the transcriptional level but not the translation of <italic>carD</italic>, which may not truly reflect the CarD protein content. Therefore, to clarify the dynamics of CarD content under the starvation condition and genotoxic stresses, we examined both the <italic>carD</italic> transcript and CarD protein levels in the mc<sup>2</sup>155 strain by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot experiments, respectively.

This observation indicates that the <italic>carD</italic> transcript level is upregulated in response to starvation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>), but there are other mechanisms that down-regulate CarD protein level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes of CarD transcript and protein levels under starvation and genotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The transcript and protein levels of CarD, respectively, under different stress conditions.

We first cultured mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells to mid-exponential phase (MEP), harvested the cells, and then transferred these cells to the normal medium, carbon-limited, nitrogen-limited, and phosphorus-limited medium, followed by detecting the respective mRNA and protein levels of CarD. It is worth noting that although the <italic>carD</italic> transcript level increased in response to starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the CarD protein level decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When the nutrient-limited media were supplemented with the corresponding nutrients, CarD returned to normal levels.</p><p>Since the mycobacterial cells in the stationary phase are in the state of nutritional starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeulders et al., 1999</xref>), we also measured the CarD protein levels at different growth periods of mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the CarD level remained relatively constant in the exponential phase but dropped sharply in the early stationary phase (marked by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is consistent with the above starvation experiments. To further verify this result, we constructed a <italic>carD</italic> overexpressing strain (<italic>carD</italic><sub>OE</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) and measured CarD protein levels at different growth periods. Interestingly, despite <italic>carD</italic> overexpression, the CarD protein level still decreased dramatically when the mycobacterial cells entered the stationary phase (marked by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since the carbon source in the culture medium was likely depleted when the mycobacterial cells entered the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smeulders et al., 1999</xref>), we speculated that the decrease in the CarD protein level could be caused by carbon starvation. To verify this hypothesis, we added 1% glycerol (glycerol is the main carbon source under normal culture conditions of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>) to the mc<sup>2</sup>155 culture at the stationary phase and measured the CarD protein level 3 and 6 hr thereafter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the CarD level significantly increased after the glycerol addition, and the mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells resumed normal growth. Considering that CarD activates the transcription of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rammohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava et al., 2013</xref>), and that cells need to reduce rRNA levels in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>), we believe that the reduction in the CarD level under starvation conditions may be an adaptive response of mycobacterial cells. Yet, when nutrients became available, CarD quickly returned to its normal level to allow the cells to resume growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CarD levels are dramatically decreased in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> under host-like stress conditions</title><p>To investigate whether the significant reduction of CarD levels under starvation conditions also happens in other mycobacterial species, we carried out starvation experiments in two other mycobacteria, <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra.

This result is consistent with the experimental data described above, allowing us to conclude that Clp protease was responsible for the degradation of CarD under starvation conditions.</p><p>Moreover, mycobacterial CarD contains a highly conserved C-terminal ‘LAAAS’ sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is similar to the Clp protease recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallego-García et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins and Wickner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lunge et al., 2020</xref>). To study whether this region mediates the degradation of CarD by Clp protease under stress conditions, we deleted the ‘AAAS’ coding sequence from the <italic>M. smegmatis carD</italic> gene and checked the CarD protein levels under stationary phase and starvation conditions. The results show that CarD in mc<sup>2</sup>155 is almost completely degraded under stress conditions, while CarD in the ‘AAAS’ deletion mutant (AAAS_del) is still highly retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). This indicates that the deletion of the ‘AAAS’ motif largely prevented the Clp protease from degrading CarD. These results further strengthen the notion that Clp protease degrades CarD under starvation conditions.</p><p>Additionally, the efficient degradation of large proteins by Clp protease requires their unfolding in the presence of an AAA<sup>+</sup> unfoldase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akopian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz and Sauer, 2014</xref>). Mycobacteria harbor two functional Clp-associated unfoldases, ClpX and ClpC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz and Sauer, 2014</xref>). Previous proteomics data showed that the CarD protein level is significantly upregulated when ClpC1 is depleted, suggesting that CarD is a substrate of ClpC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lunge et al., 2020</xref>). To further confirm this result, we carried out an additional pull-down assay. The results showed that CarD does interact directly with ClpC1, but not with ClpX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Therefore, we believe that ClpC1 specifically mediated the degradation of CarD. Furthermore, to clarify why CarD was more effectively degraded in the stationary phase, we monitored the protein levels of ClpP1, ClpP2, and ClpC1. The results showed that the protein levels of ClpP1 and ClpP2 were relatively constant throughout the growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), while the level of ClpC1 protein was significantly upregulated during the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Since ClpC1 is the ATPase required for CarD recognition, unfolding, and translocation, its content likely determines the degradation efficiency of CarD.

To determine the inhibition mode, we measured the transcript level of <italic>carD</italic> in the <italic>ascarD</italic><sub>OE</sub> strain. The <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels were significantly higher in the <italic>ascarD</italic><sub>OE</sub> strain than those in the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), illustrating that overexpressed AscarD increases, rather than decreases, the stability of <italic>carD</italic> transcripts. Since AscarD only reduces the CarD protein level, but not the transcript level, we speculated that AscarD inhibits <italic>carD</italic> expression at the translational level.</p><p>Under starvation conditions, AscarD was highly induced to inhibit CarD protein synthesis. Since CarD protein levels are not only reduced during nutrient starvation, but also reduced under hypoxic and acidic conditions, we wanted to know whether <italic>ascarD</italic> is also induced under such stress conditions. To address this question, we monitored the RNA level of AscarD under the two stress conditions by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the AscarD level increased by 4.5 and 2.3 times in response to hypoxia and acid stress, respectively. These data indicate that AscarD was upregulated in response to a variety of stimuli to inhibit the protein synthesis of CarD and help mycobacterial cells adapt to the stress environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>AscarD and Clp protease coregulate CarD-mediated mycobacterial adaptive response</title><p>AscarD and Clp protease regulate CarD at different levels. To explore which of these two regulations is dominant and whether there is a synergistic effect between the two, we examined the changes in CarD levels and bacterial survival rates in different mutant strains. As mentioned earlier, deletion of the ‘AAAS’ motif blocked the degradation of CarD by Clp protease. To block the regulation of CarD by AscarD, we mutated the promoter of <italic>ascarD</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> genome and constructed a mutant strain, referred as AsM. In addition, to block the regulation of CarD by both AscarD and Clp protease, we also constructed a double mutant strain AsM/AAAS_del with a mutation in the promoter of <italic>ascarD</italic> and the deletion of the ‘AAAS’ motif of CarD. Next, we investigated the changes in CarD levels and bacterial survival of these strains under stress conditions. The Western blot results showed that, compared to the wild-type strain, CarD levels in the AsM strain slightly increased, while CarD levels in the AAAS_del strain increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

These results indicate that AscarD and Clp protease are both important for the survival of mycobacterial cells under stress conditions. While Clp protease is responsible for the rapid reduction of CarD protein levels, AscarD further reduces CarD protein levels by inhibiting <italic>carD</italic> translation. Their combined action helps mycobacterial cells save energy in the stress conditions by preventing the futile cycle of CarD synthesis and its degradation by Clp protease. Moreover, AscarD could prevent mycobacterial cells from overaccumulating CarD in the absence of the expression of Clp protease, which is essential for their survival under stress conditions.

However, when external nutrition gets scarce, SigF-regulated expression of AscarD is induced and it hybridizes with <italic>carD</italic> mRNA to prevent the translation of CarD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Meanwhile, the residual CarD protein is effectively degraded by the Clp complex to keep CarD at a very low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), which potentially reduces the stability of RPo and diminishes the synthesis of rRNA; these processes combine to slow down the rate of transcription and translation in mycobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right). When nutrients are available, AscarD transcription is inhibited and <italic>carD</italic> mRNA gets translated to resume the normal CarD level and ensure the regrowth of mycobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of mycobacterial adaptation to starvation and provide certain clues that might help in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mycobacterial CarD defines a distinct adaptive response mechanism</title><p>Before this work, the best-known starvation response mechanism in <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> was the stringent response mediated by (p)ppGpp. Yet, its detailed mechanism is still not entirely clear today, although it is considered similar to the well-characterized stringent response mechanisms reported in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">China et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prusa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss and Stallings, 2013</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, (p)ppGpp is synthesized in large quantities in response to starvation and directly interacts with RNAP to destabilize the RPo formed on rRNA genes and consequently reduces the rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>). However, (p)ppGpp in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> does not directly interact with RNAP but instead decreases the intracellular GTP content to destabilize the RPo formed on the genes that start from guanine, such as the rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kriel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tojo et al., 2010</xref>). In mycobacteria, the exact effect and role of ppGpp on rRNA transcription are unclear, but (p)ppGpp likely inhibits the transcription of mycobacterial rRNA by affecting the stability of RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prusa et al., 2018</xref>), which is similar to the CarD-mediated starvation response. Of course, these two mechanisms also have their unique features. First, (p)ppGpp reduces the stability of RPo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">China et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tare et al., 2013</xref>), while CarD enhances its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rammohan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rammohan et al., 2015</xref>). Second, (p)ppGpp is rapidly synthesized in response to starvation, while CarD is effectively degraded under starvation conditions. Despite the differences between the two mechanisms, they basically work in the same way and ultimately help the mycobacterial cells adapt to starvation by reducing the rRNA synthesis. It should be noted that Stallings et al. previously reported that CarD is required for stringent response in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>). However, our data showed that CarD is effectively degraded under starvation conditions where stringent response usually occurs. This may seem to contradict the previous study, but since both CarD and (p)ppGpp interact with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stallings et al., 2009</xref>), the two molecules might have complex effects on RNAP that remain to be disentangled.</p><p>In addition, our study found that mycobacterial cells reduce CarD levels in response to hypoxic conditions. By analyzing the RNA-seq data for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), we found that 18 of the top 20 upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in CarD<sup>K125A</sup> strain (a mutant with predicted weakened affinity of CarD to DNA) belong to the previously identified dormancy regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voskuil et al., 2003</xref>), and 31 out of 48 dormancy regulon genes are significantly upregulated. These data indicate that CarD represses the expression of dormancy regulon genes, and the reduction of CarD level during starvation or hypoxia may derepress these genes and facilitate mycobacterial dormancy. Since pathogenic mycobacteria usually live in a nutrient-deprived and hypoxic environment after infecting the host, we believe that CarD plays an important role in the dormancy and persistence of pathogenic mycobacteria in the host cells. Taken together, the CarD-mediated mycobacterial adaptive response mechanism is multifaceted; the reduction of CarD not only downregulates the transcription of rRNA to help mycobacterial cells adapt to nutritional starvation, but also enhances the expression of dormancy regulon genes to help pathogenic mycobacteria entering into a dormant state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Efficient degradation of CarD during the stationary phase</title><p>The efficient degradation of CarD in the stationary phase may be caused by the increased expression of ClpC1. Notably, the increase in ClpC1 level during the stationary phase is also observed in <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enany et al., 2021</xref>), and the content of ClpC or other AAA<sup>+</sup> unfoldases (ClpA, ClpX, etc.) in many bacteria also increases significantly during the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaussee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laakso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sowell et al., 2008</xref>). This indicates that upregulation of Clp protease may be a conserved regulatory mechanism for bacteria to cope with starvation stress. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz and Sauer, 2014</xref> previously suggested that binding of an AAA<sup>+</sup> unfoldase strongly stimulates the peptidase activity of ClpP1P2 and stabilizes the conformation of the active complex. Therefore, the increased ClpC1 level during the stationary phase not only accelerates the unfolding of CarD, but also enhances the proteolytic activity of ClpP1P2, which ultimately mediates the effective degradation of CarD.</p><p>Considering the complexity of intracellular regulation, we speculate that there may be other reasons for the efficient degradation of CarD during the stationary phase. First, in the exponential phase, CarD may be protected by a certain protein complex. Garner et al. previously suggested that CarD–RNAP interaction protects CarD from proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garner et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, RNAP (or other proteins) may protect CarD in the exponential phase. Then, after the mycobacterial cells enter the stationary phase, CarD would be detached from RNAP (or other proteins) through unknown mechanisms and be effectively degraded by Clp protease. Second, besides Clp protease, degradation of CarD may require an adaptor protein. For example, in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, CpdR directly controls PdeA degradation by acting as a phosphorylation-dependent adaptor protein for the ClpXP protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that there is possibly an adaptor protein that recognizes CarD under the starvation condition and delivers it to the Clp protease for degradation. Third, degradation of CarD by Clp protease may be affected by its modification. For example, certain protein substrates in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> are degraded by Clp protease only after their arginine residues are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trentini et al., 2016</xref>). CarD might undergo a similar structural modification under the starvation condition, which is specifically recognized and degraded by Clp protease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of AscarD in inhibition of the synthesis of CarD protein</title><p>The inhibitory effect of antisense RNAs on target genes generally occurs at the post-transcriptional level and/or the translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georg and Hess, 2011</xref>). At the translation level, antisense RNAs mainly regulate the initiation of translation by blocking the SD sequence or adjacent regions of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georg and Hess, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saberi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sesto et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we found that AscarD inhibited the synthesis of CarD protein but at the same time increased the stability of <italic>carD</italic> mRNA. Therefore, we speculated that the inhibition of CarD protein synthesis by AscarD is likely to occur at the translation level. So how does AscarD inhibit <italic>carD</italic> mRNA translation? Does its 3′-end cover the SD sequence of <italic>carD</italic> mRNA? It should be noted that we failed to identify the 3′-end of AscarD through 3′-RACE, but some of our results showed that AscarD does extend to the region that blocks the SD sequence of <italic>carD</italic> mRNA. We think this may be the main way that AscarD affects CarD protein synthesis. Of course, in addition to inhibiting the translation of <italic>carD</italic> mRNA, AscarD may also affect the synthesis of CarD protein in other ways. For example, transcription and translation in mycobacteria appear to be coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>), such that the lead ribosome potentially contacts RNAP and forms a supramolecular complex. Therefore, a head-on RNAP on the antisense strand may become an obstacle to the RNAP on the sense strand and the trailing ribosomes, which may affect the synthesis of CarD protein.</p><p>Clp protease degrades CarD at the post-translational level, while AscarD inhibits CarD synthesis at the translational level. This two-tier mechanism allows mycobacterial cells to tightly control the CarD level. For example, when the content of Clp is insufficient or its function is lost, CarD may not be efficiently degraded; in that case, AscarD could prevent overaccumulation of CarD by inhibiting its synthesis. In fact, Clp protease is responsible for degrading unfolded/misfolded proteins that accumulate during stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LaBreck et al., 2017</xref>) and contributes to the clearance of truncated peptides from stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gottesman et al., 1998</xref>). The amount of these ‘competitive substrates’ increases under stress, for example, at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujihara et al., 2002</xref>), which may result in the insufficient degradation of CarD by Clp protease. Furthermore, some natural compounds have been reported to inhibit the activity of Clp protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreno-Cinos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raju et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that mycobacterial cells may face reduced or lost activity of Clp during in vitro growth or after infection of the host. In such situations, AscarD would be particularly important. Additionally, the presence of AscarD also helps mycobacterial cells save energy by preventing the futile cycle of CarD synthesis in the starvation condition and its degradation by Clp protease, which may be harmful to mycobacterial survival. Taken together, our data show that AscarD works together with Clp protease to maintain CarD at the minimal level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Regulation of <italic>carD</italic> at the transcriptional level</title><p>Previous reports showed that the transcription of <italic>carD</italic> is regulated by SigB, but <italic>carD</italic> can still be effectively transcribed in the <italic>sigB</italic> knockout strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurst-Hess et al., 2019</xref>). Since the −10 elements recognized by SigA and SigB are somewhat similar in mycobacteria, we speculate that SigA and SigB jointly regulate the <italic>carD</italic> expression, with SigA as the primary <italic>σ</italic>-factor responsible for the basal transcription of <italic>carD</italic>, and SigB as an alternative <italic>σ</italic>-factor responsible for the stimulated transcription of <italic>carD</italic> under stress conditions, which may also be the reason for the increasing <italic>carD</italic> expression after treatment with DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>In addition, in <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>, CarD negatively regulates its own promoter, and the negative effect mainly depends on the extended −10 element (TGN) and the adjacent spacer of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henry et al., 2021</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether mycobacterial CarD is autoregulated. After analyzing <italic>carD</italic> promoters from 91 different mycobacterial species, we found that mycobacterial <italic>carD</italic> also contains a conserved extended −10 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Considering that only a few ‘TANNNT’ motifs in mycobacteria are preceded with extended −10 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry et al., 2020</xref>), we speculate that the highly conserved extended −10 element in the <italic>carD</italic> promoter may play an important role in the maintaining and regulating its basal activity. Moreover, a specific feature (T-rich) in the spacer immediately upstream of the extended −10 element contributes greatly to the autoregulation of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> CarD. In <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, there is no similar spacer, but there is a highly conserved dinucleotide ‘CG’ immediately upstream of the extended −10 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on this limited information, it is difficult to determine whether mycobacterial CarD is autoregulated. In addition, it is worth mentioning that there are two conserved regions upstream of the <italic>carD</italic> core promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that these sequences may play a role in regulating the expression of <italic>carD</italic>, but to our knowledge, no potential transcription factor that can bind to these two sequences has been identified. Future studies to explore the function of these conserved elements will help to fully elucidate the regulatory mechanism of CarD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth condition</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains were cultivated in lysogeny broth medium at 37°C. <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) and its derivatives were grown at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 0.5% (vol/vol) glycerol and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80, or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with 0.5% (vol/vol) glycerol. <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) were grown at 37°C in 7H9 medium supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80% and 10% OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase), or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% OADC.

For <italic>ascarD</italic> overexpression, we cloned the <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter and coding region into the pMV261 vector between the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III restriction sites. For <italic>carD</italic> overexpression, we cloned the coding sequence into pMV261 between the <italic>EcoR</italic>I and <italic>EcoR</italic>V restriction sites, which allowed <italic>carD</italic> to be transcribed from the <italic>hsp60</italic> promoter on the vector. The overexpression plasmids were then transformed into mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells to obtain the overexpression strains.

Briefly, pRH2502 plasmid-containing <italic>int</italic> and <italic>dcas9</italic> genes was integrated into the mc<sup>2</sup>155 genome to generate Ms/pRH2502 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). pRH2521 plasmid containing the small guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting <italic>ascarD</italic> was transformed into Ms/pRH2502 strain to obtain the final AscarD<sub>KD</sub> strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The expression of both <italic>dcas9</italic> and sgRNA requires the induction by ATc. The transcription of the target gene (<italic>ascarD</italic>) was inhibited with the induction by 50 ng/ml of ATc, and the inhibition efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR. It is worth noting that dCas9:sgRNA complex exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the expression of a gene after it combines with the coding strand of the gene, but almost does not affect the expression of the gene when it combines with the template strand. The sgRNA we designed is combined with the coding strand of <italic>ascarD</italic> (i.e., the template strand of <italic>ispD</italic>), so it has a strong inhibitory effect on the transcription of <italic>ascarD</italic> (reduced 18.8 ± 2.6 times as quantitated by qRT-PCR) but has almost no effect on the transcription of <italic>ispD</italic>. The inhibition efficiency is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, and all related primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated mutagenesis</title><p>CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). For <italic>clpP2</italic> conditional mutant (<italic>clpP</italic>2CM) construction, an exogenous <italic>clpP</italic>2 gene amplified with <italic>clpP2</italic>-F/R primer pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was ligated to the pRH2502 integration plasmid to obtain pRH2502-<italic>clpP2</italic> recombinant plasmid, in which <italic>clpP2</italic> is under the control of ATc-inducible promoter P<sub>UV15tetO</sub>. The pRH2502-<italic>clpP2</italic> plasmid was then transformed and integrated into the mc<sup>2</sup>155 genome by <italic>attB–attP-</italic>mediated site-specific recombination, to obtain Ms/pRH2502-<italic>clpP2</italic> strain. Finally, the endogenous <italic>clpP2</italic> gene on Ms/pRH2502-<italic>clpP2</italic> genome was mutated (pretranslational termination) using the CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated mutagenesis. Thus, <italic>clpP</italic>2 could be expressed normally in the <italic>clpP</italic>2CM strain only upon the addition of 50 ng/ml ATc, but could not do so when ATc was absent. It should be noted that, in principle, the <italic>clpP2</italic>CM strain cannot grow in the 7H9 medium without ATc. But when we first cultivated the <italic>clpP2</italic>CM cells to exponential phase in ATc-containing 7H9 medium, then harvested the cells, washed them, and inoculated them into ATc-free 7H9 medium, <italic>clpP2</italic>CM cells can grow slowly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>β-Galactosidase experiment</title><p>For PUCP construction, the −213 to +1090 region of <italic>carD</italic>, containing the <italic>carD</italic> promoter, 5′-UTR, <italic>carD</italic> CDS, and <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter on the antisense strand, was translationally fused to <italic>lacZ</italic>; for PUCP<sub>mut</sub> construction, the modified −213 to +1090 region of <italic>carD</italic>, containing the <italic>carD</italic> promoter, 5′-UTR, <italic>carD</italic> CDS, and the mutated <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter (GGGTAC was mutated to GGGCGC) on the antisense strand, was translationally fused to <italic>lacZ</italic>. Then the two plasmids were transformed into the mc<sup>2</sup>155 strain to measure the β-galactosidase activity. The detailed steps for β-galactosidase activity determination were carried out according to references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends</title><p>To identify the TSS of <italic>ascarD</italic>, 5′-RACE analysis was performed with RNA extracted from mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells at midstationary phase grown in 7H9 medium.

In the stress stimulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), SigA was used as an internal control because its level is not affected by the test stimuli. However, the SigA protein level in the stationary phase is significantly lower than that in the log phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gottesman et al., 1998</xref>), so when we studied the protein levels in several growth phases, SigA was not used as an internal control. After many tests, we found that the protein level of KatG remained basically unchanged throughout the growth stage, so KatG was used as an internal control in those experiments. (Note: KatG is highly induced under oxidative stress conditions, so it was not suitable for use as an internal control in the stress stimulation experiments.) CarD or KatG was detected using the CarD- or KatG-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared by Dia-An Biotech, Inc (Wuhan, China). For SigA detection, His × 6 tag was fused to the C-terminus of SigA by inserting its coding sequence immediately upstream of the <italic>sigA</italic> stop codon in the mc<sup>2</sup>155 genome, and the modified SigA-His × 6 protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody to His × 6 (Yeasen Biotech Co., Shanghai, China). For Western blot assays, the amount of total protein loaded in each lane was the same, and the detailed procedures were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hnasko and Hnasko, 2015</xref>). For quantification of Western blot results, Image J software was used. The intensities of bands in each lane were individually measured, and the intensities of the target protein were normalized with respect to their corresponding loading control. In each panel, the normalized value of the first sample was set to 1, and the values of other samples were represented by the fold changes of their normalized value relative to the first sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pull-down assay</title><p>The His × 6 tagged ClpC1 (ClpC1-His) and ClpX (ClpX-His) recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3).

For pull-down assay, the resin-bound ClpC1-His or ClpX-His protein was separately incubated with lysate extracted from exponential mc<sup>2</sup>155 cells at room temperature for 30 min. The resins were washed with 50 mM imidazole for five times and eluted with 500 mM imidazole.

levels of which are important for controlling gene expression in mycobacteria during various stress conditions. This study reports two mechanisms that regulate levels of CarD under stress conditions, including starvation. The authors report that CarD levels are tightly regulated and that there was a dramatic decrease in the levels of CarD when cells switched from the nutrient-rich to the starvation condition. They discovered two synergistic mechanisms that led to this dramatic decrease in CarD. The first is SigF-dependent induction of antisense RNA of CarD (AscarD), which inhibits CarD translation and a second mechanism involving Clp protease-mediated degradation of intracellular CarD. The work will be of interest to researchers studying non-coding RNAs, microbial gene expression, physiology and stress response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73347.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Krishan Gopal</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology Chandigarh-160036, India</institution><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.15.439805">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439805v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Krishan Gopal Thakur (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. From the study, it appears likely that SigF plays a key role in stress adaption by upregulating AscarD transcription. However, quantification of the expression of SigF under stress conditions is missing. Including data on SigF expression under starvation and other stress conditions will strengthen this study further.</p><p>2. Similarly, how transcript levels are being measured and normalized should be described where presented in the text/legend with perhaps more detail referenced in the Methods. As normalized data is provided, changes could technically be due either to increases of CarD transcript or decreases in the sigA transcript. Evidence or measurements that the sigA transcript doesn't change appreciably under these conditions needs to be provided. The same is technically true of the gel-based measurements of protein levels. If one assumes that the amount of material loaded in each lane is the same, then the data clearly shows what the authors suggest. However, this was not specifically mentioned anywhere leaving open the possibility that the over-expression of the control proteins results in an apparent repression of CarD. Please address this.</p><p>3. The authors have shown data that suggests that Clp proteases degrade CarD under stress conditions. CarD contains the &quot;AAAS&quot; sequence motif at the C-terminal region, which is recognized by Clp proteases. Mutating this sequence motif and quantifying mutant vs wild type CarD levels in cells under normal and stress conditions will further strengthen the claim that Clp proteases degrade CarD under stress conditions.</p><p>4. Although the paper presents a clear picture of two mechanisms (Proteolytic degradation and anti-sense) individually on CarD levels, the effects of these mechanisms on cellular phenotypes is less completely explored. For example, for the stationary phase dependent regulation of CarD, does this mechanism effect stationary phase survival? Similarly, what about survival/expression chages under the stress conditions examined? Some data is given, but more exploration of the cellular effects of these mechanisms would make the paper more appealing to a broad audience. With their ability of tune CarD levels via graded manipulation of asCarD or Clp, the authors could learn much more about the physiologic and global transcriptional effects of these regulatory mechanisms and this would be a major advance for the field. Relevant assays would include, (I) stationary phase survival assays and (I) RNA sequencing of cells with different levels of asCarD or Clp in different conditions to look at the global effects of these manipulations.</p><p>5. Although the individual effects of Clp and asCarD are documented, the paper would be stronger if it explored the relative importance and interaction of these two mechanisms in different conditions. Are they simply additive as the model figure suggests? Does the relative importance of each mechanism differ depending on the condition studied? Relevant experiments that could strengthen this point are: (1) explore conditions in which one mechanism is dominant (2) changing asCarD levels or ClpP in the same cell during different stress conditions to see if one mechanism is dominant.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. In Figure 1B the transcript levels of CarD under ciprofloxacin and H2O2 appears comparable. However, there was about a three-fold increase in the levels of CarD in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Can authors comment on this?</p><p>2. It will also be interesting to see the temporal increase and decrease in the levels of CarD and AscarD transcripts during normal and stress conditions.</p><p>3. The statement in the paper that ClpP2 dependence can be interpreted directly as the involvement of P1P2 is only true if ClpP2 never functions alone. The authors essentially state that, but could this assumption be misleading?</p><p>4. The abbreviation PUPC should be explained.</p><p>5. A study in Rhodobacter sphaeroides suggests that CarD negatively regulates its own promoter (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34152199/). Do the authors have any data on whether or not this is true in mycobacteria? What is known, if anything, about direct transcriptional control of the CarD promoter? In the absence of AscarD (which may physically interfere with CarD transcription), what happens to CarD transcript levels?</p><p>6. Can the authors comment on whether the proteolytic degradation of CarD will have an effect on the production of CarD in a feed-back loop?</p><p>7. RT-qPCR: No documentation of no RT reactions is given. This is important to exclude dna contamination.</p><p>8. Some justification of the use of KatG as a loading control in the western blots is needed, since this is unusual and subject to regulation under stress.</p><p>9. The rnaseq data presented in the discussion should be moved to results if it is new data. If it is previously published it can be discussed, but the table should be moved to Supplementary information.</p><p>10. A question that arises is whether CarD itself has any effect on the levels of AscarD or whether in published ChIP-seq data, CarD can be seen on the AscarD promoter. Do the authors have any data or comments here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The major conclusions of the study are well supported by the experimental data provided in the manuscript. However, I have the following comments and suggestions:</p><p>1.

We have measured the <italic>sigF</italic> transcript levels in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> under different conditions and found that there is no significant induction of <italic>sigF</italic> expression under the various tested conditions including the stationary phase, which is similar to the previous report (Singh and Singh, 2008). However, previous studies have shown that SigF is active under stress conditions, especially in stationary phase. In this work, we also found that the SigF-dependent expression of AscarD is highly induced in the stationary phase. Moreover, based on the published transcriptome data of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (Li et al., 2017), we identified 39 genes with strict SigF recognition motif (GTTT-N(15-17)-GGGTA) in their promoter regions, and importantly, 37 of these genes are upregulated at least 5-fold in the stationary phase. All these cues suggest that SigF does function at stationary phase. As for the lack of coordination of SigF expression and function, we believe that it is caused by post-translational regulation. As reported, the σ factors are post-translationally regulated by a partner switching system, in which the anti-σ factors sequester the σ factor from the transcription machinery, and the anti-σ factor antagonists release the repression of σ factors. In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, the SigF partner switching system contains an anti-σ factor RsbW and several anti-σ factor antagonists (RsfA, RsfB, RsbW3, MSMEG_0586, MSMEG_5551, and MSMEG_6541) (Humpel et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2020). We have compared the transcript levels of these genes at different growth phases by analyzing our published transcriptome data (Li et al., 2017) and found that the expression of some anti-σ factor antagonists (especially RsbW3) is significantly upregulated at the mid-stationary phase (MSP) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that under normal conditions, the function of SigF is inhibited by RsbW, and in response to stationary phase and/or environmental cues, the anti-SigF antagonists interact with RsbW in a negative manner, derepressing SigF and allowing it to interact with RNAP and express its regulon.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Transcript levels of genes in the SigF partner switching system.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gene</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Locus tag</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Function</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">RPKM value</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Fold change(MSP/MEP)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MEP</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sigF</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_1804</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNAP σ factor F</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">463</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">573</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rsbW</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_1803</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-σ<sup>F</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">593</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3,410</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5.75</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rsbW3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_1787</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6,055</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">356.18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rsfA</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_1786</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">128</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">473</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rsfB</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_6127</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1,764</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">298</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MSMEG_0586</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_0586</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Putative anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1,401</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7,051</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MSMEG_5551</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_5551</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Putative anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">45</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6.85</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MSMEG_6541</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSMEG_6541</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Putative anti-σ<sup>F</sup> antagonist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">126</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">272</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.16</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The authors have shown data that suggests that Clp proteases degrade CarD under stress conditions. CarD contains the &quot;AAAS&quot; sequence motif at the C-terminal region, which is recognized by Clp proteases. Mutating this sequence motif and quantifying mutant vs wild type CarD levels in cells under normal and stress conditions will further strengthen the claim that Clp proteases degrade CarD under stress conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this important suggestion. We have deleted the &quot;AAAS&quot; motif from the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> CarD and measured CarD levels under stationary phase and starvation conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, in mc<sup>2</sup>155, CarD is almost completely degraded under stress conditions, while in the &quot;AAAS&quot; deletion mutant (AAAS_del), a large amount of CarD is still retained, meaning that the deletion of &quot;AAAS&quot; motif prevents the CarD degradation by Clp protease. These results further strengthen the notion that Clp protease degrades CarD under stress conditions. We have added this content to the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in CarD protein levels in different strains under (A) starvation condition or (B) stationary phase.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73347-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although the paper presents a clear picture of two mechanisms (Proteolytic degradation and anti-sense) individually on CarD levels, the effects of these mechanisms on cellular phenotypes is less completely explored. For example, for the stationary phase dependent regulation of CarD, does this mechanism effect stationary phase survival? Similarly, what about survival/expression chages under the stress conditions examined? Some data is given, but more exploration of the cellular effects of these mechanisms would make the paper more appealing to a broad audience. With their ability of tune CarD levels via graded manipulation of asCarD or Clp, the authors could learn much more about the physiologic and global transcriptional effects of these regulatory mechanisms and this would be a major advance for the field. Relevant assays would include, (I) stationary phase survival assays and (I) RNA sequencing of cells with different levels of asCarD or Clp in different conditions to look at the global effects of these manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that the effects of CarD on cellular phenotypes were not fully explored. To address this question, we have added some experiments. We mutated the <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter (AsM) in the genome, which relieved AscarD’s regulation of CarD; we also knocked out the AAAS motif of CarD in the genome (AAAS_del), which relieved the degradation of CarD by Clp protease. In addition, we also constructed a double deletion strain with <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter and CarD AAAS motif (AsM/AAAS_del), which relieved the regulation of CarD by both AscarD and Clp protease. Next, we investigated the survival of these strains under stationary phase and stress conditions. The results showed that relieving the AscarD regulation of CarD has a weaker impact on the survival of mycobacterial cells, while relieving the regulation of Clp protease of CarD has a moderate impact on the survival of mycobacterial cells. However, simultaneous removal of the two regulatory mechanisms strongly affects the survival of mycobacterial cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). These results suggest that AscarD and Clp protease are both important for the survival of mycobacterial cells under stress conditions, and they work synergistically to maintain CarD at a minimal level to help mycobacterial cells respond to various stresses.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The survival rate of different mycobacterial cells under various stress conditions.</title><p>AsM, AAAS_del, and AsM/AAAS_del respectively represent AscarD promoter mutant, AAAS motif deletion, and double mutant strains.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73347-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As for RNA sequencing experiment, we carried out RNA-seq on an AscarD overexpression strain and a <italic>clpP2</italic> conditional mutant strain. RNA-seq analysis of the AscarD overexpression strain and its control strain revealed 482 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; Fold change&gt;2, FDR&lt;0.05), whereas RNA-seq of the <italic>clpP2</italic> conditional mutant strain and its control strain revealed 2487 DEGs (Fold change&gt;2, FDR&lt;0.05). These high numbers are not surprising, as both CarD and ClpP2 are global regulators in mycobacteria. We also classified the affected genes according to their involvement in major cellular pathways (using the KEGG pathway tool), but again, both overexpression of AscarD and depletion of ClpP2 were shown to affect multiple pathways in mycobacteria. It should be noted that the main goal of this work is to prove the regulation of CarD by anti-<italic>carD</italic> antisense RNA and Clp protease, and we believe we have proved that. Considering that a brief analysis of the RNA-seq data may not contribute much to the main conclusions, and an in-depth study of RNA-seq data may distract attention from the subject of this manuscript, we intend to report this result in future communications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although the individual effects of Clp and asCarD are documented, the paper would be stronger if it explored the relative importance and interaction of these two mechanisms in different conditions. Are they simply additive as the model figure suggests? Does the relative importance of each mechanism differ depending on the condition studied? Relevant experiments that could strengthen this point are: (1) explore conditions in which one mechanism is dominant (2) changing asCarD levels or ClpP in the same cell during different stress conditions to see if one mechanism is dominant.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your suggestion, we have investigated the changes of CarD levels of different strains (including mc<sup>2</sup>155, AsM, AAAS_del, and AsM/AAAS) under stationary phase and stress conditions. The results showed that, compared to the wild-type strain, the level of CarD in the AsM (AscarD promoter mutation) strain slightly increased, while the level of CarD in the AAAS_del (CarD “AAAS” motif deletion) strain increased significantly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). This indicates that under the stress conditions tested, Clp protease dominates the regulation of CarD levels. Combined with the bacterial survival assays, we suggest that Clp protease is responsible for the rapid reduction of CarD protein levels, while AscarD further reduces CarD protein levels by inhibiting <italic>carD</italic> translation. Their combined action helps mycobacterial cells save energy in the stress conditions by preventing the futile cycle of CarD synthesis and its degradation by Clp protease. Moreover, AscarD could prevent mycobacterial cells from over-accumulating CarD in the absence of the expression of Clp protease, which is essential for their survival under stress conditions. Altogether, AscarD and Clp protease work synergistically to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells respond to various stresses.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Changes in CarD protein levels of different strains under various stress conditions.</title><p>AsM, AAAS_del, and AsM/AAAS_del represent, respectively, AscarD promoter mutant, AAAS motif deletion, and the double mutant strains.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73347-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. In Figure 1B the transcript levels of CarD under ciprofloxacin and H2O2 appears comparable. However, there was about a three-fold increase in the levels of CarD in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Can authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>The changes in <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels in the original Figure 1A were measured after 4 hours of stimulation. Considering that some stimulation conditions may have instantaneous effects on gene expression levels, we have shortened the stimulation time. The changes in <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels were therefore measured at 0.5 hour and 1 hour after stimulation. The results show that <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels were upregulated to varying degrees under these stimuli, which is similar to the results presented in the original Figure 1A. After 1 hour of ciprofloxacin stimulation, the transcription level of <italic>carD</italic> was upregulated ~4.3 times, which is significantly higher than the degree of <italic>carD</italic> induction by several other stimulation conditions. We believe that such a significant increase in CarD protein levels is due mainly to the increase in its transcript level. In addition, ciprofloxacin may also regulate the CarD protein levels through other unknown mechanisms (such as affecting the degradation of CarD by Clp protease). The specific mechanisms of protein level changes need to be further addressed. We have now replaced Figure 1A with the new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

A study in Rhodobacter sphaeroides suggests that CarD negatively regulates its own promoter (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34152199/). Do the authors have any data on whether or not this is true in mycobacteria? What is known, if anything, about direct transcriptional control of the CarD promoter? In the absence of AscarD (which may physically interfere with CarD transcription), what happens to CarD transcript levels?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, CarD negatively regulates its own promoter, and the negative effect mainly depends on the extended -10 element (TGN) and the adjacent spacer of the promoter, which are highly conserved in the <italic>Rhodobacter carD</italic> promoters. To explore whether mycobacterial <italic>carD</italic> also auto-regulates, we analyzed <italic>carD</italic> promoters from 91 different mycobacterial species. The results showed that all analyzed <italic>carD</italic> promoters contain a “TANNNT” -10 elements and a “TGN” extended -10 elements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>). Considering that only few conserved “TANNNT” motifs in mycobacteria are preceded by an extended -10 element (Cortes et al., 2013; Henry et al., 2020), we speculate that the highly conserved extended -10 element in mycobacterial <italic>carD</italic> promoter may play an important role in maintaining and regulating its basal activity. Moreover, a specific feature (T rich) in the spacer immediately upstream of the extended -10 element contributes greatly to the autoregulation of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> CarD. In <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, there is no similar spacer, but there is a highly conserved dinucleotide &quot;CG&quot; immediately upstream of the extended -10 element (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>). However, based on this limited information, it is difficult to determine whether mycobacterial CarD negatively regulates its own promoter.</p><p>As for the direct transcriptional regulation of the <italic>carD</italic> promoter, the transcriptional factor that can regulate its expression has not yet been identified. By analyzing mycobacterial <italic>carD</italic> promoters, we found two conserved regions upstream of the <italic>carD</italic> core promoter regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>). We speculate that these sequences may play a role in regulating the expression of <italic>carD</italic>, but to our knowledge, there is no potential transcription factor that can bind to these two sequences. In addition, previous reports showed that the transcription of <italic>carD</italic> is regulated by SigB, but <italic>carD</italic> can still be effectively transcribed in the <italic>sigB</italic> knockout strain (Hurst-Hess et al., 2019). Since the -10 elements recognized by SigA and SigB are somewhat similar in mycobacteria, we speculate that SigA and SigB jointly regulate the <italic>carD</italic> expression, with SigA as the main σ-factor responsible for the basal transcription of <italic>carD</italic>, and SigB as an alternative σ-factor responsible for the stimulated transcription of <italic>carD</italic> under stress conditions, which may also be the reason for the increasing <italic>carD</italic> expression after treatment with DNA-damaging agents (Figure 1A, B).</p><p>As for the change of <italic>carD</italic> transcript levels in the absence of AscarD, we have, in fact, shown this result in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, where there is no significant change in <italic>carD</italic> transcription in the AscarD knockdown strain. Furthermore, during this revision process, we successfully constructed an <italic>ascarD</italic> promoter mutant strain that hardly expressed AscarD; when we measured the transcription of <italic>carD</italic> in this mutant strain, we found that the <italic>carD</italic> transcript level did not change significantly.

We have described this in the Methods and Materials section as follows.</p><p>For internal reference protein, we used SigA or KatG as indicated. In the stress stimulation experiments (Figure 1B), SigA was used as an internal control because its level is not affected by the test stimuli. However, SigA protein level in the stationary phase is significantly lower than that in the log phase (Gomez et al., 1998), so when we studied the protein levels in several growth phases, SigA was not used as an internal control. After many tests, we found that the protein level of KatG remained basically unchanged throughout the growth period; therefore, KatG was used as an internal control in experiments at different growth phases. (Note: KatG is highly induced under oxidative stress conditions, so it is not suitable for use as an internal control in the stress stimulation experiments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
