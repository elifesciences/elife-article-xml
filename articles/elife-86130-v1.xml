Here, we study mice to assess the response of each of the major meningeal cell types to early postnatal <italic>E. coli</italic> infection using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), immunostaining, and genetic and pharamacologic perturbations of immune cells and immune signaling. Flatmounts of the dissected leptomeninges and dura were used to facilitiate high-quality confocal imaging and quantification of cell abundances and morphologies. Upon infection, the major meningeal cell types – including endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and fibroblasts – exhibit distinctive changes in their transcriptomes. Additionally, ECs in the leptomeninges redistribute CLDN5 and PECAM1, and leptomeningeal capillaries exhibit foci with reduced blood-brain barrier integrity. The vascular response to infection appears to be largely driven by TLR4 signaling, as determined by the nearly identical responses induced by infection and LPS administration and by the blunted response to infection in <italic>Tlr4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Interestingly, knocking out <italic>Ccr2</italic>, encoding a major chemoattractant for monocytes, or acute depletion of leptomeningeal macrophages, following intracebroventricular injection of liposomal clodronate, had little or no effect on the response of leptomeningeal ECs to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. Taken together, these data imply that EC responses to infection are largely driven by the intrinsic EC response to LPS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meninges</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>bacterial infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><name><surname>Rattner</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY018637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A model of early postnatal bacterial meningitis in the mouse demonstrates the transcriptome responses of each of the major meningeal cell types and should prove useful in dissecting the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis in human infants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain and spinal cord are protected, both physically and immunologically, by the meninges, a multi-layered tissue that occupies the space between the CNS parenchyma and the surrounding bone (Figure 1A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coles et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weller et al., 2018</xref>). Starting from the surface of the brain and moving toward the skin, the meninges consists of: (1) the pia, a thin and semi-permeable layer of cells that allows passage of small molecules and proteins between the CNS parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (2) the sub-arachnoid space, a highly vascularized region containing fibroblasts and immune cells that is filled with CSF and supported by a web of trabeculae; (3) the arachnoid, including an outer epithelial barrier layer that serves as the outer boundary of the CSF-accessible space; and (4) the dura, a fibrous layer containing draining sinuses (veins), lymphatics, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Layers 1–3 together comprise the leptomeninges.</p><p>The meninges hosts a diverse collection of immune cells, including macrophages [referred to as barrier-associated macrophages (BAMs) or CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs)], monocytes, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and immuno-phenotyping have revealed distinctive layer-specific types and abundances of these immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rua and McGavern, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves de Lima et al., 2020</xref>). Macrophages are especially abundant, and they can be divided into several molecularly distinct classes that are characterized by different half-lives and capacities for self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mrdjen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kierdorf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masuda et al., 2022</xref>). Layer specific diversity is also observed among meningeal fibroblasts, with molecularly distinctive pial, arachnoid, and perivascular fibroblasts, as well as two types of dural fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derk et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A wide variety of CNS injuries and disease processes involve the meninges, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves de Lima et al., 2020</xref>). Disease and injury responses have been observed among meningeal immune cells, fibroblasts, and vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rua and McGavern, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derk et al., 2021</xref>). Recent experiments with animal models imply that some of these changes play a causal role in injury or disease pathology. For example, in mouse models of stroke, genetic ablation of meningeal mast cells reduces infarct size and brain swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arac et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The oldest and best-established pathophysiologic role for the meninges is as a site of bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uiterwijk and Koehler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williamson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohil et al., 2021</xref>). Bacterial meningitis is most common among young children and the elderly, and it is generally initiated by a blood-borne infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGill et al., 2016</xref>). The annual incidence of bacterial meningitis ranges from ~2 per 100,000 people in Western Europe and North America to 100–1000 per 100,000 people in the Sahel region of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">GBD 2016 Meningitis Collaborators, 2018</xref>). In Western Europe and North America, mortality from bacterial meningitis is 10–20%, with &gt;30% of survivors experiencing residual neurologic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisen et al., 2022</xref>). The molecules and mechanisms that mediate bacterial adhesion to and invasion of the meningeal vasculature are objects of active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coureuil et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Meningitis in the neonatal period, when the immune system is immature, typically results from bacterial infection during or immediately prior to delivery. Bacteria, most commonly Group B <italic>Streptococci</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, are introduced into the bloodstream through breaks in the infant’s skin or via intra-amniotic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaschignard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shane et al., 2017</xref>). The incidence of bacterial meningitis in neonates is ~0.3 per 1000 live births in developed countries and ~4 per 1000 live births in less developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ku et al., 2015</xref>). Among survivors of neonatal meningitis, 20–70% (the number depending on the country) are left with long-lasting neurologic sequelae, including hearing loss, epilepsy, and learning and/or behavioral disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peltola et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we describe the molecular and cellular responses of meningeal cells in a mouse model of neonatal <italic>E. coli</italic> meningitis. Responses to infection were observed in every major meningeal cell type, including endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and fibroblasts. We have also used genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of immune cells and pathways to explore communication networks responsible for this complex multi-cellular response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single nucleus sequencing and flatmount imaging of the mouse meninges</title><p>Our point of departure in studying the murine meninges was to utilize a simple protocol for dissecting the leptomeninges and the dura free from adjacent tissues. When the skull and brain are separated in the absence of fixation, the natural cleavage plane is between the leptomeninges and dura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The leptomeninges can then be peeled from the brain surface and the dura can be peeled from the inner surface of the skull. In our hands, the separation of the unfixed leptomeninges from the brain parenchyma works best with tissue from young mice: it is efficient with tissue harvested at postnatal day (P)6 but, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref> and confirmed by us, it fails with adult tissue. Separation of the leptomeninges is also more readily accomplished if the brain is first chilled in ice-cold PBS for several minutes. Immunostaining of the isolated leptomeninges, the isolated dura, and the denuded brain reveals ECs (expressing PECAM-1/CD31) and macrophages (expressing CD206/MRC1) in both leptomeninges and dura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). The arachnoid epithelium expresses E-cadherin (ECAD). Leptomeningeal ECs, but not dura ECs, express GLUT1, a blood-brain barrier (BBB) marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These and all other analyses in this study were conducted at P6.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dissection and single nucleus (sn) RNAseq of mouse meninges.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the tissue layers between brain and skin, corresponding to the red rectangle in the coronal section through the brain and skull (upper right).

Therefore, we avoided enzymatic tissue dissociation followed by single cell analysis and, instead, purified nuclei following tissue homogenization. The meninges were obtained from P6 mice, either without infection (“control”) or following a single subcutaneous injection of <italic>E. coli</italic> K1 at P5 (‘infected’), as described more fully in the next section. Each sequencing library, two control and three infected, was produced from a single mouse and consisted of the pooled leptomeninges plus dura tissues. All experiments, except for those shown in Figure 6C-F and 7, were conducted with FVB/NJ mice. Single nucleus (sn)RNAseq data were obtained from 14,356 and 34,585 nuclei from control and infected mice, respectively, with a mean of 1,320 transcripts sequenced per nucleus, using the 10 X Genomics Chromium platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Pairwise Pearson correlations among the five snRNAseq datasets (two control and three infected) shows correlations of 0.98–1.00 within the same group and 0.90–0.93 between infected vs. control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Fourteen principal cell clusters were identified with Seurat, and their identities were assigned by immunostaining and with reference to published data, as seen in the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). One cluster, labeled ‘macrophages’, consists largely of macrophages but also encompasses other immune cells, as described in detail below. Two clusters represent neurons and glia, presumably brain contaminants. One small cluster derives from mitotic fibroblasts, and two small clusters (U1 and U2) are unidentified. Strikingly, five large clusters represent fibroblasts – one pial, one arachnoid, and three dural, as determined by a comparison with published data on meningeal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derk et al., 2021</xref>). A dot plot of 61 transcripts that exhibit cell-type-specific patterns of enrichment supports these cell cluster assignments and also illustrates a pattern of partial overlap in gene expression among the five fibroblast clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Comparing UMAP plots of control and infected datasets reveals shifts in the positions of the immune cell and fibroblast clusters with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Flatmounts of the isolated leptomeninges and dura permit confocal imaging across the full depth of each of these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, the dura can be imaged as a flatmount while it remains attached to the inner surface of the skull, although this arrangement reduces tissue access to antibody and washing solutions. Leptomeninges flatmounts show a high density of macrophages marked by (1) co-expression of macrophage markers CD206 and LYVE1, which localize to distinct cytoplasmic/surface compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). These cells, as well as other non-macrophage immune cells, also express SPI1/PU.1, which localizes to the nucleus, and CD45/PTPRC, a general marker for hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Flatmounts of the peripheral dura (i.e. outside the sinuses) show elongated perivascular macrophages expressing CD206 and LYVE1, as well as additional immune cells expressing CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>The vasculature can be visualized in leptomeninges and dura flatmounts by immunostaining for PECAM-1, and, in leptomeninges flatmounts, by immunostaining for tight junction markers Occludin (OCLN), Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and Claudin-5 (CLDN5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> and below). In dura flatmounts with the bone attached, perivascular fibroblasts express FOXP2, and osteoblasts express SATB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The bacterial meningitis model</title><p>To model human neonatal meningitis, we inoculated P5 mice with <italic>E. coli</italic> strain RFP-RS218 (O18:K1:H7).

At this age, the immaturity of the adaptive immune system and the rapidity of infection imply that the host response depends largely, and perhaps exclusively, on the innate immune system. In response to bacterial infection, all of the major meningeal cell types – including ECs, macrophages, and fibroblasts – exhibit large and distinctive changes in their transcriptomes. In addition, ECs in leptomeningeal capillaries redistribute CLDN5 and PECAM1, leptomeningeal capillaries become enlarged and disorganized and they exhibit foci of reduced BBB integrity, and ECs in leptomeningeal capillaries and veins lose nuclear LEF1. These capillary responses to infection appear to be largely driven by TLR4 signaling, as determined by the response to LPS administration and by the blunting of these responses to bacterial infection in the absence of TLR4. This simple and robust model of bacterial meningitis in infancy should prove useful in dissecting mechanisms of pathophysiology. In the future, it would be interesting to modify the mouse model by including antibiotic treatment at different times after infection to parallel the clinical course of treated meningitis and to explore the neurologic sequelae that are commonly seen in human survivors of bacterial meningitis.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the analyses focused on the response at 22 hr post-infection and earlier and later events have not been studied. Second, the movements, if any, of immune cells between compartments have not been studied, and therefore it is unclear whether some of the changes in transcriptome profiles should be ascribed to changes in cell state – that is the same cells as were present prior to infection, but with an altered transcriptional program – or the ingress of immune cells from non-meningeal pools. Interestingly, previous cell tracing analyses have shown that the pool of myeloid cells that supplies the meninges includes cells that are locally sequestered in the skull bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herisson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cugurra et al., 2021</xref>). The modest increases in macrophage density in the leptomeninges following infection, with or without clodronate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C and D</xref>), imply a correspondingly modest influx of cells from non-meningeal reservoirs. Third, most of the transcriptomic changes are, at present, of unknown functional significance, and, more specifically, the clinical significance of the observed cellular and molecular changes is also not clear. Future work will be aimed at defining the physiologic significance of the observed transcriptome changes. For example, increases or decreases in the abundance of particular SLC transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) imply corresponding changes in the transmembrane movement of a defined set of small molecules.</p><p>Comparisons with previously published single cell (sc) RNAseq data from mouse meninges emphasize the challenges of correlating data from tissues harvested at different ages, prepared by different methods, and subject to undefined batch effects. For example, in the present study we have divided dura fibroblasts into three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, H and I</xref>), with clusters Fb-d1 and/or Fb-d3 likely derived from embryonic day (E)14 dura fibroblast clusters M4-1 and M4-2, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeSisto et al., 2020</xref>. Based on a comparison to scRNAseq of mouse coronal sutures dissected at E15.5 and E17.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>), cluster Fb-d2 likely corresponds to Farmer et al.’s MG2 (<italic>Matn4</italic> +and <italic>Nppc</italic>+, and occupying the outer dura) and Fb-d3 likely corresponds to Farmer et al.’s MG3 (<italic>Matn4</italic>- and <italic>Nppc</italic>+, and occupying the inner dura). Additional challenges attend comparisons between human and mouse meninges datasets, as scRNAseq of adult human dura reveals an even more complex landscape, with subdivision of dural fibroblasts into either six or 14 clusters, depending on the analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Comparisons between P6 and adult macrophage subtypes in the mouse meninges, the latter defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Hove et al., 2019</xref>, are challenging as adult meningeal macrophages were subdivided based on MHC class II (e.g. H2-Aa) transcript levels, which are uniformly low in P6 meningeal macrophages.</p><p>The role of LPS in mediating BBB breakdown has been intensively studied, primarily in the context of the vasculature within the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wispelwey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banks et al., 2015</xref>). In the brain, LPS treatment leads to a reduction in EC tight junctions secondary to a decrease in tight junction protein abundance and changes in tight junction protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2021</xref>). In multiple cell types, TLR4 signaling (i.e. LPS-induced signaling) activates the NF-kappa B pathway, and that connection presumably accounts for the NF-kappa B reporter activation in meningeal ECs observed here. Although the infection-induced down-regulation of transcripts coding for cell-cell junction proteins in ECs, arachnoid barrier cells, and other cell types did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), the altered localization of CLDN5 and the spatial correlation between this mis-localization and BBB disruption (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) suggests that increased plasma membrane protein internalization and/or degradation could play a role in EC barrier defects.</p><p>The NF-kappa B and WNT pathways can exhibit either positive and negative cross-regulation, depending on cell type and developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Hottiger, 2016</xref>). By comparing BETA-CATENIN level, localization, and signaling in WT mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and in MEFs homozygous for inactivating mutations in IKKalpha or IKKbeta (the inflammation-activated kinases that phosphorylate the inhibitory binding partner of NF kappaB, leading to NF kappaB activation), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamberti et al., 2001</xref> found that IKKalpha and IKKbeta phosphorylate BETA-CATENIN on different sites and with opposite effects. IKKalpha phosphorylation leads to BETA-CATENIN stabilization and increased WNT signaling, whereas IKKbeta phosphorylation leads to BETA-CATENIN destabilization and decreased WNT signaling. These precedents in other cell types suggest that reduced LEF1 – and presumably reduced canonical WNT signaling – in ECs in the infected leptomeninges could reflect BETA-CATENIN down-regulation via the activated NF kappaB pathway. Reduced canonical WNT signaling in ECs would be predicted to reduce BBB integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rattner et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The flat geometry of the meninges and its superficial location between the brain and the skull present unusually favorable opportunities for both in vitro and in vivo microscopy. For in vitro analyses, the relative thinness of the dissected mouse leptomeninges and dura provide excellent access to antibodies and also facilitate high quality confocal imaging without the need for chemical clearing agents, as described here. In vivo, thinned skull preparations that permit two-photon imaging of the mouse meninges have been described, and this approach can be applied to mice with fluorescent immune cells that have been inoculated with fluorescent bacteria to allow single-cell resolution in vivo imaging of bacterial meningitis in a native context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kjos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coles et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manglani and McGavern, 2018</xref>). A largely unexplored opportunity also exists for ex vivo culture and live imaging of the dissected leptomeninges and dura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glimcher et al., 2008</xref>). Such preparations could permit high-resolution imaging of (1) bacterial movement across the vascular wall, (2) interactions between bacteria and immune cells, and (3) interactions between host cells. The use of fluorescent reporters of signaling pathway activity would further increase the value of such analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite decades of research, numerous gaps remain in our understanding of the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis. These include: (1) the ways in which the imature immune system differs from the more mature immune system in its response to infection, (2) the relative importance and the precise roles of different immune cells and immune modulators, and (3) the roles played by changes in gene expression and cell behavior among non-immune cell types. In each of these areas, mouse models of meningitis, together with new technologies for interrogating these models, can provide insights that inform the understanding of human meningitis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The following mouse lines were used: FVB/NJ (JAX#001800); C57BL/6 J (JAX#000664); Tie2-GFP (JAX#003658); B6(Cg)-Tlr4tm1.2Karp/J (JAX#029015); B6.129S4-Ccr2tm1Ifc/J (JAX#004999); and <italic>Rosa26-NF-kappaB</italic> reporter mice (described below).

Using a fine tweezers, the leptomeninges was gently peeled from the surface of the brain and either used for protein extraction, or immersion fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS at room temperature for 1 hr for subsequent immunostaining. The dura was gently peeled from the skullcap and immersion fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS at room temperature for 1 hr for subsequent immunostaining. Alternately, the skullcap and attached dura were immersion fixed overnight in 2% PFA/PBS at 4 °C without further dissection. Following immersion fixation, each sample was washed three times in PBS. For vibratome sections, the brain and attached leptomeninges was fixed overnight in 2% PFA/PBS at 4 °C, washed the following day in PBS at 4 °C for at least 3 hr, embedded in 3% agarose, and sectioned at 150 µm thickness using a vibratome (Leica).</p><p>For analysis of vascular leakage, P6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with Sulfo-NHS-biotin (30 µl of 20 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS per mouse) 10–15 min before sacrifice.

The depths of the Z-stacked flatmount images from the confocal series were chosen to capture the full thickness of the tissue: (1) 40–60 µm for the dura sinus region, (2) 15–20 µm for the dura peripheral region, and (3) 20–30 µm leptomeninges. Each point in the quantification of immunofluorescent data represents the analysis of a single Z-stacked confocal image from a flatmount that encompasses the full depth of the tissue (leptomeninges or dura), unless noted otherwise. For Sulfo-NHS-biotin detection with streptavidin, ~twofold animal-to-animal variability is typically seen in the overall intensity of the strepatvidin signal, most likely due to variable uptake of Sulfo-NHS-biotin from the site of IP injection. To permit a clearer comparison between images of Sulfo-NHS-biotin leakage, this intensity variation has been minimized by manually adjusting the brightness of the Sulfo-NHS-biotin channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Leptomeninges tissue lysate</title><p>To prepare leptomeninges proteins for western blotting, anesthetized mice were perfused with PBS and their brains were dissected in PBS.

The combined dura and leptomeninges were minced with a razor blade and Dounce homogenized using a loose-fitting pestle in 5 mL homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine-KOH,pH 7.8) supplemented with 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche 11836 170 001), and 60 U/mL RNasin-Plus RNase Inhibitor (Promega N2611). A 5% IGEPAL-630 solution was added to bring the homogenate to 0.3% IGEPAL CA-630, and the sample was further homogenized with ten strokes of a tight-fitting pestle. The sample was filtered through a 50 μm filter (CellTrix, Sysmex, 04-004-2327), underlayed with solutions of 30% and 40% iodixanol (Sigma D1556) in homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000×<italic>g</italic> for 18 min in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4 °C.

The data were normalized using a regularized negative binomial regression algorithm implemented in the SCTransform function as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>. UMAP dimensional reduction was performed using the R uwot package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot">https://github.com/jlmelville/uwot</ext-link>) integrated into the Seurat R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melville, 2022</xref>). To compare cell types across treatments, the data was integrated using the strategy described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuart and Satija, 2019</xref>. This pipeline involves splitting the dataset by treatment using the Seurat SplitObject function and integrating the subset objects using FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions. Data for the various scatter plots were extracted using the Seurat AverageExpression function, and differential gene expression was analyzed using the Seurat FindMarkers function. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to calculate p-values. The p-values were adjusted with a Bonferroni correction using all genes in the dataset. Data exploration, analysis, and plotting were performed using RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020), the tidyverse collection of R packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wickham, 2017</xref>), and ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wickham, 2009</xref>).

More specifically, flatmount images of representative regions that were populated by capillaries, but not by large veins or arteries, were overlayed in Adobe Illustrator with arrays of 10 parallel and evenly-spaced straight white lines. The length of each line corresponds to 166 µm on the image and the first and tenth lines in each array are separated by a distance that corresponds to 150 µm on the image. Thus, the 10 lines define a 166 µm x 150 µm rectangle. Along each white line, the widths of all of the regions in the image that were not covered by blood vessels were manually scored by drawing (in Adobe Illustrator) a straight line across the vessel-free region. When all of the vessel-free line segments had been drawn for a given square array, the sum of their lengths was calculated with Fiji-ImageJ and divided by the sum of the lengths of the ten white lines to generate an estimate for the fraction of the area not covered by blood vessels. The fraction of the area covered by blood vessels equals one minus the fraction of the area not covered by blood vessels. Each data point in a blood vessel area plot represents the area estimate from one set of white lines, that is the estimate obtained from sampling a length of 10x166 µm=1.66 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical values are presented as mean ± SD.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Resident Ccl2+ and Ccl2- macrophages should be better characterised/described in</p><p>infected state and uninfected state.</p><p>2. A clearer definition of arachnoid as reviewer think that the authors investigated arachnoid+pia, which represent leptomeninges.</p><p>3. Comparative analysis of dural versus leptomeningeal response: To measure the bacterial load and its dissimination in dura+arachnoid+pia+parenchyma in WT, TLR4-/-, CCR2KO and clodronate-treated mice (d1, 4, 10 if possible).</p><p>4. Immunofluorescence images should be quantified throughout the manuscript.</p><p>5. Time points of analysis, repetitions and number of mice used should be clearly stated in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The definition of the arachnoid is the manuscript is unclear. It seems that the authors studied and peeled the leptomeninges (pia+arachnoid) so it is possible that the manuscript is mainly focusing on the pia or leptomeninges, not the arachnoid. There also seems to be some controversy in the literature as to, when removing the skull cap, the arachnoid remains attached to the pia of the brain and/or to the dura of the skull. This should be better explained and justified.</p><p>2. In the RNAseq data, how can the authors know that the clusters of cells (e.g. macrophages) define cell types versus cell states? Without lineage tracing, it seems impossible to clearly define distinct population of macrophages and to follow their trajectory and transcriptomic changes. It is likely that after activation, some macrophages of population A fall into another cluster of population B, thus biasing the analysis of cluster B transcriptomic changes. Thus the quantification of populations and DEG based should be avoided when the population' clusters are not clearly distinct. This applies for Fibro dura (Figure 1), Macrophage (Figure 3A) and Ec dura (Figure 4A). Only the whole population/cluster can be analyzed.</p><p>3. It would be interesting to have a bigger picture about each of the 3 cell types of interest (macrophages, endothelium, fibroblasts) by comparing leptomeningeal versus dural response. For each cell type, how many DEG are shared between leptomeningeal versus dural tissue? How many are unique to each cell type/cell location?</p><p>4. The authors should quantify by histo or RTqPCR the bacterial load in the dural versus leptomeninges.</p><p>5. All this is 1 day post-infection. There should be an important monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the dura and the leptomeninges. Does the data show it? Could infiltrates contribute to the transcriptomic changes through cytokine release?</p><p>6. Did collagen stain decrease upon infection, as suggested by RNAseq? The authors should also validate their markers for endothelial subtypes by IF. Also, it's unclear how veins and arteries were distinguished, and SMA stain should be used to confirm.</p><p>7. What was the consequence of TLR4 KO, CCR2 KO and clodronate on bacterial load? Maybe 1 day post infection is too early.</p><p>8. The discussion would need to incorporate all the data and show the big picture: are meningeal layers similarly 1/infected, 2/responsive, 3/leaky? What could be the consequence of the transcriptomic changes (collagen, slc transporters, etc.)?</p><p>9. What happens at later time points? Which barrier breaks the most and lets bacteria invade the tissue?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– It is not clear what the 'Ccl2+ and Ccl2-' resident macrophages are. Do they correlate to the MHCII+ and MHCII- dural macrophages? Which other markers that were previously identified by these subsets in adult mice, do they express? Are they present in both the dura and the arachnoid/pia mater? In the dura, do they localize to the sinus region? How does this compare to adult mice?</p><p>– They mention that IL-6 was expressed by fibroblasts. However, in the image provided in Figure 2H, it cannot be concluded which cells express IL-6, apart from being negative for CD206.</p><p>– In Figure 3, it is difficult to see the changes across immune cells in infected vs. control. Why not show a pie chart, or also UMAPs of infected vs. control side by side, or overlayed with a color (as in Figure 4A).</p><p>– For snRNA-seq, n=? how many mice were used?</p><p>– Figure 4, does this include both meningeal compartments together?</p><p>– it is difficult to quantitively assess the frequencies of the cell populations from the sequencing data. To validate the dynamics of different cell types, validation using flow cytometry (total cell counts) would be nice to include.</p><p>– The authors explain the increase of macrophages in infection due to conversion of resident macrophages to inflammatory macrophages. Fate-mapping resident macrophages or monocytes prior to infection would be helpful to substantiate this claim.</p><p>– Figure 7, the difference of CLDN5 between Ccr2-/- control and infected is not evident in the images (A), yet the quantification shows a highly significant difference (B). This should be explained. In the images in (A), a WT control for both infected and non-infected should be shown.</p><p>– Figure 7C, Tlr4-/- mice have fewer meningeal macrophages already at steady state. Can they speculate why and discuss this?</p><p>– Also, in Ccr2-/- mice, fewer macrophages (CD206+ or PU.1+ cells) were found in the meninges, of both infected and non-infected mice. Is there a difference between the subsets they identified?</p><p>– In Tlr4-/- and Ccr2-/- or clodronate-treated mice, bacteria dissemination in the meninges and brain should also be analyzed.</p><p>– They suggest that Tlr4 is important on non-macrophages. Can they show in their snRNA-seq data which cell types express it?</p><p>– It should be discussed that killing of macrophages (by clodronate) treatment, may also lead to inflammation and changes in ECs (as seen in Figure 8E).</p><p>– Immunofluorescence images should be quantified throughout the manuscript. (For example, this is lacking in Figure 2F,G, Figure 5E,F).</p><p>– Figure 5G, for LEF, n=2, this would need to be increased to show statistical significance</p><p>– Time point of analysis, repetitions and number of mice used is not always clear in the figure legends.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86130.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Putting this information in the figure legends is going to clutter the legends, so we have put together a new Supplementary Table (Supplementary Table 4) that has this information for the entire manuscript. We also define more precisely in the legend to Figure 2 and in the Methods section exactly what is being represented by each data point: “Each point in this and other quantifications of immunofluorescent data represents the analysis of a single Z-stacked confocal image that encompasses the full depth of the tissue (leptomeninges or dura), unless noted otherwise.” The time points are all P6.

The reviewer is correct – it is leptomeninges, not arachnoid.</p><p>This has now been changed throughout the text and figures. Regarding the dissection, at the start of the Results section, the text addresses this issue. When the skull cap is removed, the arachnoid and pia (=leptomeninges) remains with the brain and the dura remains with the skull – i.e. the tissue splits between the arachnoid and the dura. Figure 1B-E demonstrates this. At the start of the Results section, the text now states: “When the skull and brain are separated in the absence of fixation, the natural cleavage plane is between the leptomeninges and dura (Figure 1A). The leptomeninges can then be peeled from the brain surface and the dura can be peeled from the inner surface of the skull.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the RNAseq data, how can the authors know that the clusters of cells (e.g. macrophages) define cell types versus cell states? Without lineage tracing, it seems impossible to clearly define distinct population of macrophages and to follow their trajectory and transcriptomic changes. It is likely that after activation, some macrophages of population A fall into another cluster of population B, thus biasing the analysis of cluster B transcriptomic changes. Thus the quantification of populations and DEG based should be avoided when the population' clusters are not clearly distinct. This applies for Fibro dura (Figure 1), Macrophage (Figure 3A) and Ec dura (Figure 4A). Only the whole population/cluster can be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a general issue with any cluster analysis. Here are two general comments as a prelude to the more specific response in the next paragraph. First, it is important to remember that the UMAP plots are dimensionally reduced representations that allow high dimensional data sets to be approximated and visualized in a 2D plot, and that these plots under-represent the distinctions between clusters in the same way that principal component analysis under-represents distinctions when one looks only at the first two components. The real data, which is the basis for the clustering, is a very large matrix that cannot be visualized. Second, the reviewer correctly notes that we have not performed a lineage tracing analysis to determine the dynamics of cell movements. Our data is silent on that issue. This limitation is now noted in both the Results and the Discussion sections.</p><p>The clusters in Figures 1F, 3A, and 4A are generated by Seurat, using default parameters – the result is that some clusters are obvious and others are less obvious when visualized in a dimensionally reduced form with a UMAP plot. The distinction between clusters is supported by the specificity of expression of individual transcripts, as illustrated in Figures 1I, 3B, 4C, and Supplemental Figure 8A. To address the reviewer’s comment with respect to macrophages, the distinction between the four macrophage subtypes within the large macrophage cluster in the UMAP plot in Figure 3A is not visually apparent – they all seem to be part of a single large cluster when the N-dimensional space is reduced to two dimensions. However, the dot plot in Figure 3B shows that the subdivisions delineated by Seurat are based on objective differences in gene expression. Additionally, the UMAP plots in Figure 3F show a compact crescent-shaped macrophage cluster in the control samples that changes to a broad disc shaped cluster in the infected state, indicative of substantial changes in gene expression. Our conclusion is that these changes in macrophage gene expression are real. That said, we agree with the reviewer’s general point that the macrophage clustering is relatively subtle, which is not entirely surprising, since these clusters represent subtypes or, perhaps more accurately, gene expression substates of macrophages. We have added the following sentence to the Results section: “These data are consistent with a model in which infection promotes the appearance of new macrophages “states”, as defined by novel patterns of gene expression that are distinct from those of resting macrophages.”</p><p>In the final analysis, clustering is simply a heuristic tool, a way of organizing the data so that we can more easily think about it. We note that this issue is one that neurobiologists have been wrestling with for decades in their analyses of neuronal classes (an example is below).</p><p>Brain Behav Evol 1983;23(3-4):121-64.</p><p>R W Rodieck, R K Brening</p><p>Retinal ganglion cells: properties, types, genera, pathways and trans-species comparisons Abstract.</p><p>This article attempts to develop an empirical foundation for the notion of 'cell type', and to use this notion to clarify the issues involved in the classification, pathways, and trans-species comparisons of retinal ganglion cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be interesting to have a bigger picture about each of the 3 cell types of interest (macrophages, endothelium, fibroblasts) by comparing leptomeningeal versus dural response. For each cell type, how many DEG are shared between leptomeningeal versus dural tissue? How many are unique to each cell type/cell location?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now done this in Supplemental Figure 5, which shows DEG genes (in this case, any gene with a log2-fold change greater than or equal to 2.5 in any of the listed cell types) for leptomeninges and dura endothelial cells (ECs), for leptomeninges and dura fibroblasts, and for arachnoid barrier cells. There are a core of DEGs with shared responses, as well as DEG differences that distinguish ECs from fibroblasts. A more comprehensive visualization of DEGs is shown in scatterplots in Supplemental Figure 4, and the actual data is tabulated in Supplemental Tables 3, 5, and 6. We have not separated macrophages based on location (dura vs. leptomeninges) because we did not perform the snRNAseq with these two tissues separately, and there are no published markers for macrophages at P6 that distinguish macrophages between these tissues. We have not directly answered the question “how many DEGs are shared” because the answer depends on the (arbitrary) cut-off for the fold-difference that constitutes a DEG. With a cut-off of log2-fold change &gt;2.5, Supplemental Figure 5 gives a reasonable sense of the relatedness of the responses. This is now described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should quantify by histo or RTqPCR the bacterial load in the dural versus leptomeninges.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been now been done by counting the number of bacteria in tissue – since the bacteria express RFP, they are readily seen in the confocal images. These data are presented in Supplemental Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. All this is 1 day post-infection. There should be an important monocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the dura and the leptomeninges. Does the data show it? Could infiltrates contribute to the transcriptomic changes through cytokine release?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have not addressed the movement of immune cells between compartments. We agree that some cells in both the leptomeninges and the dura could be recent arrivals, but our data present only a static image, and without a cell tracing analysis one cannot assess the dynamics of cell movement. We note that a cell tracing analysis in the meninges is technically non-trivial as there is good evidence that the pool of myeloid cells that supplies the meninges is not equivalent to the circulating pool of cells, but includes cells that are locally sequestered in the skull bones (Herisson et al., 2018; Cugurra et al., 2021). Thus an experimental design in which peripheral immune cells (e.g. monocytes) are labeled and infused may not fully capture the local cell dynamics. This limitation of the study is now stated in the revised Discussion.</p><p>In response to the second question (“Could infiltrates contribute to the transcriptomic changes through cytokine release?”), the answer is “yes”. We have tested one cytokine, CCR2, by gene KO and found that the effect of the KO on the number of leptomeningeal macrophages is modest (Figure 7). This question, and the larger question of immune cell trafficking, are now addressed in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>Cugurra et al.

The immunostaining showed no change with 1 day of infection (we quantified the result; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), although the mRNA level is greatly reduced, based on the RNAseq data (see the COL14A1 UMAP in Supplemental Figure 9B and the Col14a1 dot plot in Supplemental Figure 10A). Our guess is that the high stability of extracellular collagen accounts for the failure to see a change at the protein level after only one day.

The transcripts that serve as the basis for all of the cell cluster assignments are tabulated (with references) in Supplemental Table 2. We have validated the leptomeminges vs. dura endothelial cell (EC) subtypes by immunostaining. Leptomeningesal ECs are CLDN5+,LEF1+, GLUT1+, and PLVAP-, as expected for vasculature with a blood-brain barrier (BBB), whereas dural ECs are CLDN5-, GLUT1-, and PLVAP+, as expected for non-barrier vasculature. This is in agreement with the expression of the corresponding transcripts by snRNAseq. This is now noted in the Results section. We did not see a distinct cell cluster for veins in the snRNAseq – they are presumably part of the large cluster that encompasses veins and capillaries. The artery cluster is distinct in the snRNAseq and, as described in Supplemental Table 2, it uniquely expresses known artery markers Bmx and Fbln5. Histologically, we confirmed our assignment of arteries and veins by smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining, which is abundant on arteries. This is now noted in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What was the consequence of TLR4 KO, CCR2 KO and clodronate on bacterial load? Maybe 1 day post infection is too early.</p></disp-quote><p>Counting of RFP-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic>, showed no statistically significant differences in the number of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the leptomeninges between WT, TLR4 KO, and CCR2 KO mice at one day postinfection. Similarly, the number of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the leptomeninges did not differ significantly between mice that received control vs. clodronate liposomes. This data has been added to Supplemental Figure 3C. As the reviewer notes, this may reflect the fact that we are studying an acute model of meningitis at one day post-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The discussion would need to incorporate all the data and show the big picture: are meningeal layers similarly 1/infected, 2/responsive, 3/leaky? What could be the consequence of the transcriptomic changes (collagen, slc transporters, etc.)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that comment. We have expanded the Discussion as indicated. At present, the physiologic significance of the many observed transcriptome changes remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. What happens at later time points? Which barrier breaks the most and lets bacteria invade the tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding later time points, the model of acute early postnatal meningitis that we use is uniformly fatal by two days after bacterial inoculation. Therefore, we restricted our analyses to 22 hours after <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation. We have now included a Kaplan-Meier survival curve as part of Supplemental Figure 3, and have expanded the Results section to more fully describe the natural history of this meningitis model. The clinical course of the mouse meningitis model parallels the natural history of untreated bacterial meningitis in humans, as seen in Figure 2 of Eisen et al. (2022) [Eisen et al. (2022)] Longer than 2 hours to antibiotics is associated with doubling of mortality in a multinational community acquired bacterial meningitis cohort. Sci Rep 12:672}. In that paper, the authors show that, in humans with bacterial meningitis, no delay from diagnosis to the start of antibiotics is associated with 10% mortality, whereas a 12 hour delay is associated with 40% mortality, with intermediate mortality values for intermediate delays in the start of antibiotic therapy. Presumably, the mortality would be even higher with no antibiotic treatment, consistent with historical accounts from the pre-antibiotic era that describe the high mortality and rapidly fatal course of bacterial meningitis.</p><p>Bacterial invasion. Current evidence points to trans-endothelial movement across the meningeal vasculature, but we have not studied that aspect of the model. For example, see Coureuil et al. (2017) A journey into the brain: insight into how bacterial pathogens cross blood-brain barriers. Nat Rev Microbiol 15:149-159.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– It is not clear what the 'Ccl2+ and Ccl2-' resident macrophages are. Do they correlate to the MHCII+ and MHCII- dural macrophages? Which other markers that were previously identified by these subsets in adult mice, do they express? Are they present in both the dura and the arachnoid/pia mater? In the dura, do they localize to the sinus region? How does this compare to adult mice?</p></disp-quote><p>In the P6 dataset, we did not observe MHCII (e.g. H2-Aa) expression in macrophages. MHCII is expressed in a small number of monocytes (Ccr2+ cells). This differs from what has been reported for adult meningeal macrophages (Van Hove et al., 2019; see text excerpt below). We also cannot see any clear patterns among the P6 macrophages based on the other markers described by Van Hove et al. Presumably, these differences reflect the relative immaturity of meningeal macrophages at P6. This is now noted in the Discussion section. “Similarly, comparisons between P6 and adult macrophage subtypes in the mouse meninges, the latter defined by Van Hove et al. (2019), are challenging as adult meningeal macrophages were subdivided based on MHC class II (e.g., H2-Aa) transcript levels, which are uniformly low in P6 meningeal macrophages.”</p><p>Below are quotes from the relevant passages of Van Hove et al. &quot;A single-cell atlas of mouse brain macrophages reveals unique transcriptional identities shaped by ontogeny and tissue environment.&quot; <italic>Nature neuroscience</italic> 22.6 (2019): 1021-1035.</p><p>“BAMs fell into two main groups: MHCIIlo and MHCIIhi, which exhibited many differentially expressed genes (for example, Mrc1, Cd163, Gas6 versus H2-Aa, Cd74, Klra2). BAMs also exhibited clear tissuespecific signatures. Signature genes were identified that specifically marked meningeal MHCIIlo BAMs (for example, Clec4n, Clec10a, Folr2) or were enriched in SD-BAMs (for example, Lyve1, P2rx7, Egfl7), individual dural BAM subsets (for example, Pla2g2d, Ccl8) or CP BAMs (for example, Lilra5, Ttr). CPepiBAMs also exhibited a unique transcriptional profile, which included expression of Cst7, Gm1673 and Clec7a.”</p><p>“BAM subsets exhibit a mixed ontogeny and a postnatal development that is highly dependent on the border region. To investigate how BAM heterogeneity develops over time, we performed flow cytometry on dissected borders starting from postnatal day 0 (Figure 7a,b). Most BAMs shared a similar phenotype at birth, being MMR<sup>hi</sup> and MHCII−. While the SD-BAM pool remained relatively stable, the phenotype and composition of dural and CP-BAMs dramatically changed from postnatal day 21 onwards.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– They mention that IL-6 was expressed by fibroblasts. However, in the image provided in Figure 2H, it cannot be concluded which cells express IL-6, apart from being negative for CD206.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. The immunostaining only tells us that there are cells in the infected dura that express IL-6. The conclusion that these are fibroblasts rests on the snRNAseq data, as shown in Supplemental Figure 6A, which shows a dotplot (with IL-6 transcripts second from the left), and Supplemental Figure 8B, which shows an IL-6 UMAP plot (central pair of panels, second panels from the bottom). Thus is now stated in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 3, it is difficult to see the changes across immune cells in infected vs. control. Why not show a pie chart, or also UMAPs of infected vs. control side by side, or overlayed with a color (as in Figure 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3D is essentially the same as what a pie chart would show – the abundances of each class of immune cell in infected and uninfected samples. Figure 3D has an advantage over a pie chart in that it plots the values from each of the three replicates for infected and uninfected samples so that one can see the reproducibility of the replicate data. The upper panel in Figure 3D plots all of the major cell types, and the lower panel plots the individual immune cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For snRNA-seq, n=? how many mice were used?</p></disp-quote><p>For snRNA-seq, we used 2 control (uninfected) mice and 3 infected mice, i.e. one mouse per library. This is now stated in the Results and Methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4, does this include both meningeal compartments together?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. That is now added to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– it is difficult to quantitively assess the frequencies of the cell populations from the sequencing data. To validate the dynamics of different cell types, validation using flow cytometry (total cell counts) would be nice to include.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be interesting to compare snRNAseq and FACS – something that we have not done. That said, there is good reason to think that snRNAseq is robust for quantification because the protocol is so simple: one collects the tissue, homogenizes in gentle detergent, and then collects nuclei in an iodixanol gradient by centrifugation. There is no enzymatic cell dissociation and there is minimal time involved in the tissue processing protocol relative to more involved protocols. We think that snRNAseq is especially advantageous when the cells come from a complex tissue like the meninges that includes cell types with different sizes, shapes, and adhesive properties. The isolated nuclei are probably more homogenous in their properties than are the cells from which they came. The important points to take from the data plotted in Figures 3D and 4B are not so much the absolute numbers, but the relative changes (or lack thereof) in cell type abundances in comparing uninfected and infected samples.</p><p>Our approach to cell quantification in Figures 2 and 5-8 has been to quantify cells by immunostaining of flatmounts in which the Z-stacked image spans the full thickness of the tissue. This immunostaining approach has the advantage that (1) no cells are lost or escape imaging, and (2) we see the spatial arrangements of the cells in the context of tissue architecture (this is lost in FACS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors explain the increase of macrophages in infection due to conversion of resident macrophages to inflammatory macrophages. Fate-mapping resident macrophages or monocytes prior to infection would be helpful to substantiate this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The increase in macrophage numbers in the leptomeninges with infection is modest: ~20% in FVB mice and &lt;5% with C57 (Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 12). We have not attempted to address the movement of immune cells between compartments. We agree with the reviewer that some cells in both the leptomeninges and the dura could be recent arrivals. Our data present only a static image, and without a cell tracing analysis one cannot assess the dynamics of cell movement. We note that in the meninges a cell tracing analysis is technically non-trivial as there is good evidence that the pool of myeloid cells that supplies the meninges is not equivalent to the circulating pool of cells, but includes cells that are locally sequestered in the skull bones (Herisson et al., 2018; Cugurra et al., 2021). We have added the following sentence to the Results section to underscore this uncertainty: “Whether this increase reflects in situ proliferation, ingress from other tissue compartments [e.g. blood and/or skull bone marrow (Herisson et al., 2018; Cugurra et al., 2021)], or a combination of the two, remains to be determined.”</p><p>Herisson F, Frodermann V, Courties G, Rohde D, Sun Y, Vandoorne K, Wojtkiewicz GR, Masson GS, Vinegoni C, Kim J, Kim DE, Weissleder R, Swirski FK, Moskowitz MA, Nahrendorf M.

Science 373:eabf7844.</p><p>Further support for the conclusion that relatively few macrophages have migrated into the leptomeninges wihin one day of infection comes from the data in Figure 8C and D, which show that after clodronate depletion of CNS macrophages at P3, there are very few macrophages in the leptomeninges at P6 and with infection this number increases only modestly (to ~10% of the value of untreated controls). This is now noted in the Results section describing the clodronate experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7, the difference of CLDN5 between Ccr2-/- control and infected is not evident in the images (A), yet the quantification shows a highly significant difference (B). This should be explained. In the images in (A), a WT control for both infected and non-infected should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Close inspection of Figure 7A shows that, with infection, the Ccr2 KO leptomeninges vasculature has CLDN5 clusters and also that a larger fraction of the image area is occupied by the vasculature. This is more obvious in the lower set of images (CLDN5 + Sulfo-NHS biotin) than in the upper set of images (CLDN5 + CD206). Quantification shows that the increase in area covered by blood vessels is 15-20% – not a huge difference, but statistically significant because the sample size was fairly large (we quantified &gt;10 images for each condition).</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion to show the WT images. We have expanded Figure 7A to show them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7C, Tlr4-/- mice have fewer meningeal macrophages already at steady state. Can they speculate why and discuss this?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, the uninfected Tlr4 KO has only ~70% as many leptomeningeal macrophages as does the uninfected C57 control. We don’t know why this is, and we have not explored it. One naïve thought is that postnatal pups are exposed to a low amount of LPS from their GI tract and skin microbiomes and from feces in the cage, which leads to a low level of constitutiveTLR4-dependent signaling. In Tlr4 KO mice, the absence of that “background” level of TLR4 signaling might lead to reduced macrophage proliferation. This possibility is now noted in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also, in Ccr2-/- mice, fewer macrophages (CD206+ or PU.1+ cells) were found in the meninges, of both infected and non-infected mice. Is there a difference between the subsets they identified?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not done detailed phenotyping (e.g. snRNAseq) of the macrophages in the Ccr2 KO or Tlr4 KO mice – i.e., we did not analyze macrophage subsets in the context of these experiments. We have simply visualized and quantified them with CD206 and PU.1 immunostaining. Related to this: Supplemental Figure 13 now explicitly compares the numbers of leptomeningeal macrophages determined by counting PU.1+ cells vs. counting CD206+ cells for WT, Tlr4 KO, and Ccr2 KO. Ccr2 KO mice have ~20% fewer leptomeningeal macrophages compared to the C57 control. Given that CCR2 is the receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2), it is not entirely surprising that a mouse lacking that receptor might have a modest reduction in macrophage abundance in the leptomeninges. This is now noted in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Tlr4-/- and Ccr2-/- or clodronate-treated mice, bacteria dissemination in the meninges and brain should also be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the bacterial load and the data are shown in Supplemental Figure 3.
