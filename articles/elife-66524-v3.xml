treatment and poor patient outcomes. Here, we aimed to model this transition to define underlying biological mechanisms and identify potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is neuroendocrine in identity and, in contrast to non-SCLC (NSCLC), rarely contains mutations that drive the MAPK pathway. Likewise, NSCLCs that transform to SCLC concomitantly with development of therapy resistance downregulate MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between pathway activation and lineage state. To test this, we activated MAPK in SCLC through conditional expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR, which revealed suppression of the neuroendocrine differentiation program via ERK. We found that ERK induces the expression of ETS factors that mediate transformation into a NSCLC-like state. ATAC-seq demonstrated ERK-driven changes in chromatin accessibility at putative regulatory regions and global chromatin rewiring at neuroendocrine and ETS transcriptional targets. Further, ERK-mediated induction of ETS factors as well as suppression of neuroendocrine differentiation were dependent on histone acetyltransferase activities of CBP/p300. Overall, we describe how the ERK-CBP/p300-ETS axis promotes a lineage shift between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine lung cancer phenotypes and provide rationale for the disruption of this program during transformation-driven resistance to targeted therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>lineage transformation</kwd><kwd>ERK

leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, is divided into two main histological classes, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC is notable due to its highly aggressive and lethal clinical course, defined by rapid tumor growth, early dissemination, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazdar et al., 2017</xref>). SCLC is a neuroendocrine (NE) tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Travis et al., 2015</xref>), and recent studies have demonstrated that it is a molecularly heterogeneous disease comprising discrete tumor subtypes defined by expression of different transcriptional regulators, namely achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) and neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1), which together account for approximately 80% of SCLC cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borromeo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>). ASCL1 and NEUROD1, along with insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) and POU class 3 homeobox 2 (BRN2), are recognized as important master regulators for NE differentiation in SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishii et al., 2013</xref>). Besides NE differentiation, SCLC is further distinguished from other major NSCLC subtypes such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma by its unique cellular morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>) and genetic hallmarks including frequent inactivation of tumor suppressors <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>). SCLC is also characterized by the absence of EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamou et al., 1987</xref>) and low activity of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byers et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, activating alterations in <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic>, which are highly prevalent in LUAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>), are rarely identified in SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>) (Summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Despite developing in the same organ and having exposure to the same etiological agent in most instances, no biological rationale aside from cell of origin has been provided to explain these divergent molecular characteristics. Therefore, elucidating the factors that underlie the selection of specific genetic drivers in different lineage contexts may yield insights toward the development and progression of these lung cancer types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of mutant KRAS or EGFR expression on phenotype and neuroendocrine markers in small cell lung cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of representative somatic alterations, protein expression profiles, MAPK pathway activity, and neuroendocrine differentiation in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and transformed SCLC from <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated LUAD.

Further, we anticipated that understanding this interplay would reveal the factors that underpin the selection of specific genetic alterations in the development of the different lung cancer subtypes and acquisition of drug resistance. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the consequences of LUAD oncogene expression and activation of MAPK pathway signaling in SCLC cells in order to potentially provide mechanistic insight into the programs driving small cell lineage transformation in the context of EGFR-TKI resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutually exclusive association between MAPK activation and NE marker expression in lung cancer</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that SCLC and LUAD differ in their expression and activation of MAPK signaling components, and that SCLC-transformed LUAD loses EGFR expression. To first assess the relationship between EGFR status and NE marker expression in lung cancer, we performed western blot analysis across a diverse panel of lung cancer cell lines. Lysates from eight <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant, four <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant, and two <italic>EGFR</italic>/<italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type LUAD, as well as two large cell carcinoma and four SCLC cell lines were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). All the SCLC cell lines completely lacked EGFR protein expression and a large cell carcinoma with NE differentiation cell line, H1155, weakly expressed EGFR, whereas all other cell lines universally expressed high levels of EGFR. Inversely, expression of four NE transcription factors (TFs) – INSM1, BRN2, ASCL1, and NEUROD1 – as well as NE markers CD56 and synaptophysin (SYP) were largely specific to SCLC cell lines. Thus, there was a clear inverse association between NE differentiation and EGFR expression in lung cancer. We also observed a mutually exclusive expression pattern between ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in the five NE cell lines, whereas INSM1 and BRN2 were broadly expressed in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We next explored mutation and copy number alteration status of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> using publicly available whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets. As reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>), the prevalence of genomic alterations in these two oncogenes in SCLC was low. In particular, genomic alterations in the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene were never identified in SCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR in SCLC induces trans-differentiation into a NSCLC-like state with suppressed NE differentiation</title><p>To determine whether the inverse association between MAPK activity and NE differentiation is due to differences in cell of origin for the specific cancer types or instead attributed to the direct signaling pathways regulated by the mutated oncogenes, we conditionally expressed either EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> or KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, which are the most prevalent drivers in LUAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</xref>), as well as a GFP control in three SCLC cell lines; H2107 (ASCL1-high; SCLC-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>), H82 (NEUROD1-high; SCLC-N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>), and H524 (SCLC-N). Western blots confirmed successful induction of these oncoproteins under the tight control of an inducible TetO promoter using doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Consistent with the results shown in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falco et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calbo et al., 2011</xref>) in which HRAS or RAS<sup>V12</sup> were retrovirally transduced in SCLC cell lines, the SCLC-N cell lines both demonstrated a phenotypic transition from a suspended to adherent state after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction, with the most striking change occurring in H82 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>). However, in contrast to a previous study where the cell lines representing the classic subtype of SCLC, which are currently classified as SCLC-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>), showed no discernible phenotypic changes in response to HRAS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mabry et al., 1988</xref>), we found that H2107 SCLC-A cells also demonstrated this phenotypic transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). While EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> transduction also induced a shift to an adherent state in H2107 and H82 cells, this growth pattern was more modest than that observed with KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). Furthermore, the phenotypic effect of EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> expression was temporally delayed compared to KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> with cells forming suspension clusters first, then subsequently migrating to become adherent, whereas KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induced direct formation of adherent cells that were diffusely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The impact of oncogene induction on cell viability was also assessed, and we observed variable effects across the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Concordant with the positive effect of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> on cell viability in H82 cells, forced expression of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). There was a clear increase in cleaved PARP after doxycycline treatment in H2107 cells (both EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>) as well as in H524 cells (EGFR<sup>L858R</sup>), suggesting that cell death, at least partially, accounts for the decreased cellular viability in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>).</p><p>Given that established SCLC cell lines typically grow in suspension as aggregated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gazdar et al., 1980</xref>) and the NE type H1155 large cell carcinoma cells also grow partly in suspension clusters, we considered that there might be a relationship between a suspended cellular growing phenotype and NE differentiation. Thus, shift in cell growth patterns of SCLC cells from suspension to an adherent state after induction of LUAD mutant oncogene expression suggested that oncogenic signaling may lead to lineage transformation in SCLC. To further assess this, we determined the impact of induced mutant EGFR or KRAS on the expression of the main neuroendocrine transcription factors (NETFs) - including INSM1, BRN2, ASCL1, and NEUROD1 – in the SCLC cell lines. The four NETFs were all downregulated by the oncoproteins, which was again more prominently observed with KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> expression than with EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). To globally assess lineage status, we profiled the transcriptional changes in H2107 and H82 cells following doxycycline treatment to induce EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> or KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> for both acute (24 hr) and long-term (7 days) durations and compared to respective GFP controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using a 50-gene lung cancer-specific NE expression signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) revealed a shift from high NE differentiation at baseline to low NE differentiation after induction of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> at the day seven time point, with genes associated with NE status becoming downregulated and those typically low in SCLC demonstrating high expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>). Importantly, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) were more strongly phosphorylated by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> than EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting a potential rationale for the differential effects of induction of these oncoproteins on phenotype and NE marker expression. Based on these results, we used the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> transduction model for further experiments.</p><p>Recent evidence has demonstrated that MYC can dynamically drive a shift of master NETFs of SCLC from ASCL1 to NEUROD1 to YAP1 in the context of RB and p53 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ireland et al., 2020</xref>). We found that MYC protein levels were downregulated by EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) despite previous reports that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of MYC prevents MYC degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sears et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, GSEA indicated downregulation of an MYC target gene set in H82-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells compared with GFP control cells on day 7 of doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f</xref>). To further determine whether the downregulation of NETFs after oncogene induction is in the context of MYC-driven master NETF shift, we next evaluated YAP1 expression in SCLC cell lines after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> transduction, as YAP1 is a marker of non-NE SCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>). Despite all three SCLC cell lines demonstrating suppression of NETFs after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction, <italic>YAP1</italic> was significantly upregulated only in H82-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells treated with doxycycline for 7 days (3.3-fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which was mirrored by the weakly detectable YAP1 protein level in the same cell line by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2g</xref>). These results suggest that the mutant EGFR- and KRAS-induced shift from a high to low NE phenotype in SCLC cell lines is unlikely to be a subclass transition driven by a MYC-YAP1 axis.</p><p>We noted that mutant EGFR or KRAS-induced SCLC cell lines showed a mixed phenotype comprising both suspended and adherent cells after doxycycline treatment. Thus, we asked whether this heterogeneity in growth pattern was derived from the polyclonal nature of transduced cells. To address this, we established single cell-derived clones and found that clonal cells also showed a mixture of adherent and suspended cells after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). We also profiled the expression status of the NE factors in adherent, suspended, or mixed populations, separately, in the subacute (doxycycline day 3) and chronic (doxycycline day 28) phases after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction using polyclonal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Despite relatively similar induced levels of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> as well as phospho-ERK1/2 in the subacute phase, adherent cells lost NE factors to a greater degree than suspended cells. In terms of the growth state, isolated adherent cells gave rise to both adherent and suspended cells after serial passages under doxycycline treatment; however, the proportion of adherent cells became lower with each passage, with a dramatic reduction observed after 2 weeks. Nonetheless, NE markers were still suppressed in the remaining adherent cell population. Importantly, isolated suspended cells did not give rise to adherent cells after serial passages and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> expression was highly attenuated in this subset of cells, even in H82 cells in which forced expression of mutant-KRAS exhibited an advantageous effect on cell proliferation. This suggests negative selection of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-positive cells or epigenetic silencing of transduced <italic>KRAS<sup>G12V</sup></italic> in the long-term (28 day) culture driven by the incompatibility of <italic>KRAS</italic> activation in SCLC biology. Together, these data suggest that constitutive activation of MAPK pathway by mutant KRAS and EGFR affects the growth phenotype and suppresses NE differentiation program in SCLC in a heterogenous manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ERK activation inhibits expression of NETFs in SCLC</title><p>ERK is the central pathway node of MAPK signaling and acts to phosphorylate hundreds of downstream targets and control many fundamental cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoon and Seger, 2006</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that ERK may be the main mediator of the multiple effects observed in SCLC cells after mutant EGFR or KRAS induction. This was suggested by the differential effects of mutant EGFR versus mutant KRAS transduction in SCLC cells, where the latter induced more prominent changes and was associated with increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We tested this by treating TetO-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-transduced SCLC cells with an ERK1/2 inhibitor, SCH772984, and found that this compound rescued the suppression of NETFs after doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

To test whether this pathway was also involved in suppression of NE factors in SCLC cells after oncogene induction, we treated KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-induced cells with an AKT-inhibitor, MK-2206.

To minimize the bias from potential toxicities of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction combined with drug treatments, we used an acute incubation time of 72 hr. In H82 and H524 cells, the combined inhibition of ERK and AKT reversed the suspended-to-adherent phenotypic transition which was not seen with either ERK or AKT inhibition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). To exclude the possibility that applied drugs might have a lethal impact on cells, resulting in less adhesion in a non-specific manner, we also assessed the viability of the whole cell population after the combination drug treatment and observed no obvious adverse effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast to H82 and H524, KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-induced cell attachment was significantly enhanced by ERK inhibition in H2107 cells, which was not completely rescued by additional AKT inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we aimed to determine potential downstream effectors of ERK that are responsible for mediating the cellular phenotypic state change in conjunction with AKT after mutant KRAS induction in SCLC. We assessed mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK)/ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) for this purpose as they are direct downstream effectors of ERK1/2 and inhibited these alone or in combination with AKT after doxycycline induction. Interestingly, cell attachment was not reversed by the combined MSK/RSK and AKT inhibition but was instead enhanced in the context of MSK/RSK suppression, particularly in H2107 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). We conducted phospho-kinase profiling with or without MSK/RSK inhibition using H82- and H2107-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells under doxycycline treatment and this revealed that phospho-AKT as well as phospho-ERK1/2 levels were increased after MSK/RSK inhibition, particularly in H2107-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This feedback activation explains why MSK/RSK inhibition did not rescue the phenotypic change after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction and suggests that other ERK effectors mediate these effects in conjunction with AKT.

Mirroring the differential activation of ERK and NE suppression by the oncogenes, there were fewer genes differentially expressed in the cell lines upon EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>), and therefore, we focused on the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> model system to identify candidates. Among the commonly upregulated genes in the two cell lines after 7 days of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction, hairy and enhancer of split 1 (<italic>HES1</italic>) was one of the top differentially expressed genes in H2107 cells. <italic>HES1</italic> was of interest as a candidate gene suppressing NE differentiation in our model as it functions as a critical transcriptional repressor of neuronal differentiation under control of NOTCH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iso et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, decreased <italic>HES1</italic> expression was recently shown to be associated with NE differentiation upon osimertinib resistance in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roper et al., 2020</xref>). Immunoblots validated the strong induction of HES1 protein in H2107 and H524 cells by mutant EGFR and KRAS, while the activated form of NOTCH1, cleaved NOTCH1, was paradoxically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Further, HES1 was weakly induced without the presence of cleaved NOTCH1 in H82 cells, which harbor a <italic>NOTCH1</italic> missense mutation (V776M), while induction of HES1 was completely suppressed by pharmacological ERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d</xref>).

Furthermore, ETS TFs – including the PEA3 family of ETS TFs, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 – were upregulated at the mRNA level by activation of MAPK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), suggesting that an ETS TFs-mediated program may play a role in suppressing NE differentiation. Indeed, microarray data of SCLC and LUAD cell lines indicated the clear inverse relationship of expression of PEA3 family ETS TFs with that of NETFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). At the protein level, we found that mutant KRAS upregulates ETV4 in H82 and H524 cells and ETV5 in all the three SCLC lines, which was completely reversed by ERK inhibition with SCH772984 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). As ETS TFs bind to a common motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>), we anticipated that overexpression of any one of these proteins in SCLC cells may phenocopy the effects of ERK activation and potentially lead to downregulation of NE factors. To test this, we conditionally expressed ETV1 in the three SCLC cell lines, which led to suppression of specific NETFs – notably ASCL1 in H2107, INSM1 and NEUROD1 in H82, and BRN2 in H524 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Conditional expression of ETV5 also significantly downregulated INSM1 and NEUROD1 in H82, and NEUROD1 in H524 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Furthermore, ETV1- or ETV5-overexpressing cells unexpectedly transformed to an adherent phenotype, with this morphological change most strongly observed in H82 cells, similar to what is observed with KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

When the MAPK pathway is activated, ERK and RSK phosphorylate CIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissanayake et al., 2011</xref>), which is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimm et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore assessed whether CIC is required to maintain the suppression of ETS factors in SCLC and whether its inactivation downstream of ERK modulates NE marker suppression. We confirmed that nuclear CIC was expressed in SCLC cells and downregulated after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction, which was restored by ERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). siRNA knockdown of <italic>CIC</italic> led to downregulation of INSM1, NEUROD1, and to a lesser extent BRN2 in H82 cells and potentiated the effects of mutant KRAS induction on NE factor suppression in H82 and H524 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2b</xref>). However, <italic>CIC</italic> knockdown was not sufficient to induce ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Likewise, overexpression of CIC did not inhibit suppression of NE factors after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2c</xref>), as exogenous CIC was putatively inactivated following immediate phosphorylation by activated ERK. These results suggest that ERK-mediated upregulation of the PEA3 family of ETS TFs does not occur via CIC inhibition in SCLC cells. However, as we demonstrated that the PEA3 family of ETS TFs are – at least in part – a mediator of ERK-induced suppression of NETFs, we next asked if CBP/p300 activation by ERK regulates PEA3 TFs in a CIC-independent manner. Indeed, we found that A-485 treatment downregulates ERK-induced ETV4 and ETV5 in H82-KRAS cells but not in H2107- and H524-KRAS cells, providing a potential biological explanation why CBP/p300 inhibition rescues ERK-mediated suppression of NE differentiation only in H82 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, it has been reported that oncogenic fusion proteins produced by chromosomal translocations are the major mechanism of genetic activation of ETS family proteins in cancer. In prostate cancer, the ETS family members <italic>ERG</italic> as well as <italic>ETV1</italic> are commonly rearranged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomlins et al., 2005</xref>) and ectopic ERG expression by <italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic> fusion blocks NE differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mounir et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these findings, we treated KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-inducible SCLC cells with an ERG inhibitor, ERGi-USU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mohamed et al., 2018</xref>), with or without MSK/RSK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>). ERG was not basally expressed in the three SCLC cell lines but was induced by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in H82 and H524 cells. Inhibition of ERG in H82 cells after KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> activation provided modest restoration of INSM1, BRN2, and NEUROD1 at the optimal concentration of 0.6 μM, which synergized with MSK/RSK co-inhibition. Interestingly, treatment of H82-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells with different combinations of inhibitors targeting MSK/RSK, CBP/p300, or ERG revealed that suppression of MYC by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> was well rescued by combined MSK/RSK and ERG inhibition that did not rescue suppressed expression of key NETFs, suggesting that oncogene-mediated ERK activation in SCLC modulates essential TFs through multiple regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b</xref>). It should be noted that ERGi-USU treatment also inhibited ETV5 expression in a dose-dependent manner in H2107 and H82 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>), showing that this compound may work broadly on ETS factors and not exclusively through ERG. Together, these results suggest that ERK-induced ETS factor expression suppresses NE lineage factors in SCLC and that induction of the PEA3 family of ETS TFs is mediated by the HAT activity of CBP/p300 in H82 cells but not in H2107 and H524 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>CIC inactivation in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD upon osimertinib resistance suppresses SCLC transformation in p53/RB-inactivated cells</title><p>Using the information obtained from expression of mutant EGFR and KRAS in SCLC, we aimed to assess the potential clinical importance of these mechanisms in driving the transformation of LUAD to SCLC during EGFR-TKI resistance.

These data collectively suggest that recurrently observed resistance mechanisms that reactivate the ERK/CIC/ETS axis might suppress the NE differentiation program during chronic inhibition of drivers even in the context of p53/RB loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Inhibition of ERK and MSK/RSK in stem cell culture media induces neuronal-like differentiation and suppression of EGFR in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma</title><p>Based on our findings that ERK, MSK/RSK, and CBP/p300 play critical roles in the regulation of NETFs in SCLC cell lines, we treated <italic>EGFR</italic>/<italic>TP53</italic>/<italic>RB1</italic> triple-mutant H1975 cells with inhibitors for EGFR, ERK, MSK/RSK, and/or CBP/p300 to inhibit effectors that suppress NE differentiation with the anticipation that it would eventually cause histological transformation into SCLC. To this end, we cultured cells using stem cell culture media (SCCM) as well as RPMI 1640, as a previous study used SCCM in conjunction with genetic manipulations to reprogram normal human lung epithelial cells to neuroendocrine lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2018</xref>). When cultured in SCCM, H1975 cells grew in suspension as floating clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5a</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of ERK and MSK/RSK in SCCM inhibited the phenotypic change into floating suspension. Furthermore, cells developed a neuronal-like appearance showing bipolar or multipolar cells with axonal processes after combined inhibition of ERK and MSK/RSK regardless of <italic>RB1</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5a</xref>), which was coupled with suppression of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5b</xref>). Immunoblotting showed that phospho-AKT was highly upregulated after combined inhibition of ERK and MSK/RSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5b</xref>), highlighting the potential importance of AKT signaling in cell morphology and growing phenotype. However, the triple-mutant cells, including the neuronal-like cells, showed no induction of NETFs over 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5b</xref>) or 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5c</xref>) days of culture with different combinations of inhibitors, both in normal media and SCCM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to differences in RB and p53 status, SCLC differs from LUAD in the absence of activating mutations in the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, LUAD tumors that transform to SCLC during TKI resistance lack MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between the activity of this pathway and NE differentiation. Here, we have investigated how constitutively activated MAPK signaling driven by exogenous expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR affects the NE program in SCLC cell lines. We found that activation of the downstream signaling node of MAPK pathway, ERK2, suppresses the expression of crucial NE lineage master regulators in SCLC. Furthermore, we found that chromatin regions bound by NETFs were rendered less accessible by activated ERK and that this chromatin remodeling was associated with activation of CBP/p300 HAT activity and corresponding changes in H3K27ac-marked regions. ETS transcription factors were also upregulated as a result of this remodeling, which we showed was an additional mechanism of ERK-mediated suppression of NETFs. Together, this suggests that an ERK-MSK/RSK-CBP/p300-ETS axis, acting through multiple points, synergizes to suppress NE differentiation, providing biological rationale for the absence of MAPK pathway activation in SCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the mechanism of ERK-mediated repression of neuroendocrine differentiation through chromatin dysregulation in small cell lung cancer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>c</bold>) Different mechanisms according to cell lines ((<bold>a</bold>), for H82; (<bold>c</bold>), for H2107 and H524) are depicted.

This likely relates to differences in expression of master NE regulators such as ASCL1 and NEUROD1, mutation status of epigenomic modifiers including <italic>CREBBP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jia et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>EP300</italic>, basal ERK activity, cell-specific mechanisms in MAPK pathway feedback loops, and cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Indeed, H2107 and H524 harbor mutations in <italic>EP300</italic> while H82 is <italic>EP300</italic> wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), which might contribute to relatively low NE differentiation in H82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and its increased permissiveness to ERK-induced CBP/p300 HAT activity and NE factor suppression. Furthermore, MYC status has been attributed to phenotypic diversity of SCLCs, with MYCL- and MYC-driven SCLC cell lines differing in numerous aspects from transcriptional signatures, super enhancer usage, metabolic regulation, and therapeutic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ireland et al., 2020</xref>). As H2107 expresses MYCL while H82 and H524 are MYC high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), this could also underlie the differential response to ERK induction, such as those seen on cell growth and the involvement of CBP/p300 activation and H3K27ac in mediating NETF suppression. Nevertheless, our work clearly demonstrated that ERK2 kinase activity plays a central role in inhibition of NE differentiation in all SCLC cell lines assessed. As ERK2 is known to directly shift transcriptional machinery in a kinase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Göke et al., 2013</xref>), direct enhancer regulation by ERK2 may be involved in our model, with ERK-mediated chromatin remodeling independent of CBP/p300 activity also playing an important role in specific contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>Our findings provide biological bases for the mutual exclusivity between gene alterations in MAPK pathway and NE differentiation in lung cancer. We showed that mutant-KRAS induction in SCLC more robustly suppresses NE differentiation and affects growth morphology than mutant-EGFR induction. The former is explained by the different potency of ERK activation between these two LUAD oncoproteins and is in line with the fact that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations are not detected in SCLC specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a recent study highlighted the potentially deleterious effect of activated ERK in NE tumors by demonstrating that loss of <italic>ERK2</italic> and negative ERK2 expression are specific features of the neuroendocrine carcinoma component of gastric mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Although one major exception for this scenario is <italic>FGFR</italic> amplification that is observed in 6% of SCLC cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>) and is anticipated to activate the MAPK pathway, another recent study showed that FGFR1 is disadvantageous for the development of typical central SCLC with NE differentiation using a <italic>Rb1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Trp53<sup>flox/flox</sup>;LSL-Fgfr1<sup>K656E</sup></italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferone et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The recurrently observed inactivating gene alterations of <italic>CREBBP</italic>/<italic>EP300</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peifer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">George et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rudin et al., 2012</xref>) in SCLC, as well as in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD tumors that subsequently undergo TKI-induced SCLC transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Offin et al., 2019</xref>), suggest that a global or local increase in H3K27ac is incompatible with SCLC. Indeed, HDAC inhibitor treatment, which was shown to inhibit SCLC growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jia et al., 2018</xref>), strongly suppressed NETFs in SCLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), despite potential specificity issues related to these inhibitors. However, we were unable to conclusively demonstrate that CBP/p300 inhibition promotes SCLC transformation in conjunction with loss of p53 and RB in EGFR-TKI-treated <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD cells as hypothesized. Given that CBP/p300 involvement was observed in only H82 cells, other mechanisms may be required to cause SCLC transformation of <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD. It may also be attributed to the concentrations of A-485 (100–400 nM) and C646 (10 μM) tested. Although these ranges of the drugs most potently restored NETFs which were suppressed in mutant KRAS-transduced H82 cells, complete elimination of H3K27ac by higher-doses of A-485 paradoxically downregulated NETFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), highlighting the challenges of using A-485 to induce NETFs, particularly when combined with additional compounds that inhibit RTK-MAPK components that also downregulate H3K27ac levels. The optimal decrease of H3K27ac level required to restore suppressed NETFs by ERK activation is likely cell-line-specific and context-dependent, making it difficult to employ genomic methodologies such as CRIPSR and shRNA for such rescue experiments. Nevertheless, our results imply that the use of HDAC inhibitors during treatment with EGFR-TKIs might be an option to prevent SCLC transformation in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant LUAD at a high risk of SCLC transformation.</p><p>Our results revealed that ERK-mediated upregulation of the PEA3 family of ETS TFs as well as ERG suppresses NE differentiation in SCLC. Because ETS TFs recognize the same ETS DNA-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>), upregulation of these factors is likely to work in collaboration. However, it is notable that even ETV1 or ETV5 overexpression alone or knockdown of <italic>ETV4</italic> or <italic>ETV5</italic> alone showed effects on NETFs expression. Surprisingly, a well-described upstream repressor of these factors, CIC, was not involved in the ERK-mediated upregulation of ETV4 and ETV5 in SCLC cells. Similar to the observation of NOTCH-independent HES1 upregulation observed in the present and a previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stockhausen et al., 2005</xref>) studies, oncogene-activated ERK in SCLC induces ETS TFs independent of CIC inhibition, which will require further investigation. Nonetheless, we found that <italic>CIC</italic> knockdown suppressed NETFs in H82 cells. Given that CBP/p300 inhibition restored ERK-mediated suppression of NETFs only in H82 cells, an ETS-independent repressor function of CIC, perhaps the previously reported role of interacting with the SIN3 deacetylation complex and recruiting HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weissmann et al., 2018</xref>), may be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we provide the first reported biological rationale for why alterations in MAPK pathway are rarely found in SCLC and describe the molecular underpinnings of how the central node in this pathway, ERK2, suppresses the NE differentiation program. However, we could not force <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated LUAD to transform to SCLC as a resistance mechanism to osimertinib, despite our attempts to reverse engineer this process based on this knowledge. Our strategy using extensively passaged established cell lines might not be suitable to cause lineage transformation, and applications of patient-derived tumor organoids or genetically engineered mouse models that potentially possess the ability of differentiation into different lineage might be promising options in the future. In addition, there are a number of reported mechanisms of SCLC transformation in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerasuolo et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting genetic heterogeneity may complicate efforts to model this process in lung cancer. We propose that SCLC transformation from LUAD requires specific conditions in the background of p53/RB loss, including lack of both second site <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations and bypass pathway mutations that reactivate MAPK signaling and ETS TFs, and alterations in epigenetic modifiers such as CBP/p300 to reduce H3K27ac levels and alter chromatin accessibility, rendering gene expression suitable for NE differentiation. While this work provides fundamental information regarding lineage plasticity in lung cancer, further studies are required to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting histological trans-differentiation between LUAD and SCLC in the context of EGFR-TKI resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Osimertinib was refreshed every 3 or 4 days. To capture possible SCLC-transformed cells which were anticipated to be likely in suspension, we passaged both adherent and suspended cells together during making cells resistant to osimertinib. Resistant cells were maintained as polyclonal populations under constant exposure to the drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Analysis of acquired genomic alterations by MSK-IMPACT</title><p>Cell lines were profiled by the MSK-IMPACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) platform which is a hybridization capture-based next generation sequencing (NGS) assay for targeted deep sequencing of exons and selected introns of 468 cancer-associated genes and gene fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). The assay detects mutations and copy-number alterations. Genomic DNA was extracted from osimertinib-resistant cells as well as matched parental cells using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). We reviewed all candidate alterations identified in resistant cells as well as parental cells and considered those identified only in resistant cells as candidate acquired resistance genomic alterations to osimertinib.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Subcellular fractionation</title><p>H2107, H82, and H524 cell lines were subjected to subcellular fractionation using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

H82-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells were treated with the following chemicals: doxycycline; doxycycline +SCH772984 (1 μM); doxycycline +SB-747651A (5 μM); doxycycline +A-485 (400 nM); or doxycycline +SB-747651A (5 μM)+A-485 (400 nM). After 72 hr treatment, these cells as well as corresponding non-treated control cells were collected and frozen. ATAC-seq was performed using the Omni-ATAC protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) with slight modifications as below. In brief, cells were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl; 3 mM MgCl2; 0.1% NP-40 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% Digitonin) on ice, then spun down in a cold centrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min, resuspended in RSB Tween and nuclei were quantified using Trypan Blue (Invitrogen) on a Countess II Counter (Invitrogen). An aliquot of 50,000 nuclei per sample was transferred to a fresh tube, spun down, resuspended in transposition solution and transposed for 30 min at room temperature as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). Libraries were prepared using standard Illumina Nextera indices. Library cleanup and dual-sided size selection was performed using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter) with 0.4X and 1.2X ratios. Sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with 150 cycles on a high-output cartridge in paired-end mode at the Center for Genomics and Health Informatics (CHGI) at the Cumming School of Medicine (University of Calgary). On average, 73,950,218 reads were generated for each library (range: 50,913,762–94,506,244 reads). Data has been deposited in GEO (GSE160204).</p><p>Sequencing data were aligned using bwa (0.7.17) to the hg38 assembly of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Extraneous chromosomes and low-quality reads were removed using SAMtools (v 1.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools (Broad Institute). Peaks were called using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) using the following parameters: -g hs -q 0.05 --<monospace>shift</monospace> −100 --<monospace>extsize</monospace> 200 --<monospace>nomodel</monospace> -B --<monospace>keep-dup all</monospace>, followed by pileup construction and fold-change graph generation using macs2 bdgcmp. A union peaklist across all samples was generated using BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), and absolute signal at each peak was extracted from each sample. These counts tables were analyzed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref>) in R to identify differentially accessible regions, with the following cut-offs: absolute log fold change greater than 1.5, p&lt;0.01, and minimum peak signal of 20,000. Motif analysis of differentially accessible regions was performed using the findMotifsGenome function of HOMER (v4.11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Motif profiles were generated using HOMER. Motif enrichment rankings were computed using a method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, for each condition, motif enrichment lists in regions of lost and increased accessibility were arranged by fold change and p value, assigning each a separate rank for regions of lost and increased accessibility. Motif ranks in regions of lost and increased accessibility were averaged over all samples. Final score was obtained by subtracting the rank order of each motif in the increased accessibility regions from rank order in the regions of lost accessibility, and motifs were arranged in descending order by score. Permutation analysis was conducted using regioneR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gel et al., 2016</xref>), with 500 permutations, using publicly available H3K27ac data for human lung from the Roadmap Epigenomics consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>) (GEO ID: GSM906395).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in continuous variables were analyzed by the Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests or one-way ANOVA followed by the Holm’s multiple comparisons post-test.

This is consistent with the frequent loss in small cell lung carcinoma of CBP/p300. The authors show that Ras-Erk signaling induces multiple ETV family members in an ERK-dependent manner. They provide data that ETVs can suppress neuro-endocrine differentiation, and that knockdown of ETVs can provide rescue of Ras/Erk-mediated neuro-endocrine suppression. This manuscript will be of interest to cancer biologists studying cell fate transitions, particularly adenocarcinoma-to-small cell transitions that occur in prostate and lung cancer.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extracellular signal-regulated kinase mediates chromatin rewiring and lineage transformation in lung cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Igor Astsaturov (Reviewer #1); Trudy Oliver (Reviewer #2); John Minna (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a copious amount of careful work that will be important for the field. In addition, this appears to be an important new area for SCLC work, with potential therapeutic implications. Addressing as many as possible of the major concerns below is encouraged; it is at the authors discretion as to which concerns they will choose to address experimentally, and which they choose to address in the text. A revised manuscript that addresses at least some of the concerns below experimentally is anticipated, and might be expected to fare well upon re-review.</p><p>1) The manuscript is densely, and at times confusingly, written. The authors need to edit their manuscript to make it easier to read and understandable for non-experts in the field. While they have some summary figures, I think the manuscript, in terms of editing, would benefit from having a main summary figure, or discussion that clearly depicts the overarching conclusions from the experiments.</p><p>2) The paper provides no conclusive evidence that epithelial -to-NE transdifferentiation is possible to model in vitro. Even the opposite NE-to-epithelial trans-differentiation is only partial. The authors are encouraged to provide data which demonstrate the existence of dynamic switch from the epithelial to neuroendocrine differentiation based on the model proposed; the idea that withdrawal of upstream signaling and shutting down the MAPK pathway leads to de-repression of NE TFs should be illustrated. One model, for example, is the iKRAS mouse model, either Tet-ON or Tet-OFF. There are also many cell lines available derived from these tumors. The authors could potentially pull back KRAS expression and show acquired NE features. Other alternatives may include using DN-MEK to address this issue. In addition, the authors do not really demonstrate that this mechanism takes place in vivo. For example, the authors could use Tet-regulated KRAS model to illustrate a morphological switch to adenocarcinoma from SCLC upon KRAS upregulation.</p><p>3) Despite zeroing in on ETVs downstream of ERK1/2, the paper does not go as far as showing the direct effect of these TFs as repressors of NE differentiation (ASCL1, BRN2, NEUROD1 etc.). The authors should be encouraged to demonstrate an association of ETS-high profile with adenocarcinoma and a negative association with SCLC. Can the authors address the question, would overexpression of ETV (ETV5 in one of their cell lines) produce similar results to KRAS overexpression?</p><p>4) The authors are encouraged to add some biologically relevant data regarding therapeutics (that is, data that MAPK ERK activation inhibits the in vitro or in vivo growth of SCLC), for example as xenografts or in colony formation assays. For example, what are the effects of EGFR, KRAS oncogene activation in vivo in xenografts or in colony formation assays?</p><p>5) There is an excessive amount of data and some of the negative data detracts from the focus of the story. I would suggest the authors remove some figures that are either irrelevant to the key points and are not further validated like Supp Figures S5, S6, S7, or are simply confirmatory of what should be known such as Supp Figure S17. S9 could easily be combined with S8. Lines 279-286 discuss &quot;data not shown&quot; related to HEY1 that could easily be omitted.</p><p>6) One recurring issue in the manuscript is that the observations are often not consistent across the three cell lines and are context-specific effects, and the potential reasons could be better explained. The cell lines chosen unfortunately (but interestingly) represent some of the major cell states of SCLC. H2107 represents the ASCL1+ NE-high subset of SCLC (and has some MYCL). H82 and H524 represent the C-Myc (MYC)-high subset of SCLC, with H82 having a MYC amplification, and both representing the NEUROD1 subtype (which tend to be associated with more MYC). Assessment of NE score using a common approach in the field (Zhang et al., TLCR) shows that H82 cells are already considerably NE-low, with H524 as NE-intermediate/high, and H2017 as NE-high. So, this may be related to why H82 seemed to be the most permissive cell line to change NE fate in multiple assays. In addition, H2107 and H524 appear to have EP300 mutations, which may contribute to their NE-high nature and contribute to the refractory response to A485 treatment based on the author's model. It's known that MYCL and MYC-driven cell lines differ in numerous aspects from transcriptional signatures, super enhancer usage, metabolic regulation, therapeutic response, etc. This information could be mentioned in the results and discussed when mentioned as a factor near line 540.</p><p>7) Related to Figure 4, the authors show that p300 pharmacological inhibition can restore NE fate in presence of Kras. Given that drugs can have off-target effects, it would be helpful to know if genetic knockdown/knockout of p300 phenocopies these effects. Given that CREBBP (CBP) or EP300 (p300) mutations are common in SCLC, it is also relevant whether any of these cell lines have CREBBP (CBP) or EP300 (p300) mutations. It appears H2107 and H524 may have EP300 mutations. Have they tried to restore EP300 function?</p><p>8) Related to Figure 6, did the authors test whether ETV4 is sufficient to reduce NE markers? Given that multiple ETV family members can repress NE markers, it seems plausible that it might take knockdown of all of them to rescue Kras-induced NE suppression. This could be understandably technically difficult, so perhaps the authors could just make this point clear in the text.</p><p>9) Related to FiguresS8/S10, did the authors look at REST protein levels in S8 and/or S10? The functional studies for REST knockdown appear performed in only 1 of the 3 cell lines?</p><p>10) Related to Figure S18e and S18g: This figure is confusing and could better explained in the text. In S18e, the mutation status of these genes in parental/sgControl cells prior to Osimertinib treatment should be included. Mutation status appears to be presented only after two different types of Osimertinib exposure. Second, in S18g, sgControl resistant cell lose expression of CIC protein expression entirely in the stepwise and initial exposure conditions. Consistently, sgControl Resistant cells seem to increase ETV4 and ETV5 protein levels compared to sgControl parental cells. The authors could explain whether this is due to the gain of the specific nonsense mutation. Since gain of ETV4/5 presumably inhibits NE fate conversion; does ETV knockout induce NE fate in this context?</p><p>11) The authors may need to address certain aspects of the principal observation that the MAPK blockade resistant cells acquire NE features. Specifically, these differentiation switches typically occur in complex multiclonal populations of cancer cells in vivo, not in established cell lines. Using human PDX models or mouse models of KRAS/EGFR-driven lung cancers, the authors could have the opportunity to demonstrate the existence of such clonal shifts. Starting with in vitro established stable NE or epithelial clones could be an exceedingly difficult model in which to observe these differentiation switches. Can the authors address this point in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extracellular signal-regulated kinase mediates chromatin rewiring and lineage transformation in lung cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A few revisions are requested for clarity; these are detailed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors largely addressed the critical points raised in the review process. While the study was designed to determine the effect of MAPK pathway activation on NE differentiation, a more clinically relevant epithelial-to-NE switch upon MAPK blockade with TKI in lung adenocarcinoma has not been modeled here, which is the limitation of this paper. With this limitation in mind, the presented work has shown several important regulatory mechanisms, namely, that hyperactive ERK signaling is a default repressor of neuroendocrine differentiation transcriptional regulators. ERK2 appears to be the dominant kinase in this process, and the downstream-induced ETV family TFs are important in executing this mechanism.</p><p>1. Certain statements in the text of the paper need to be made more consistent. For example, in line 252 and below, the authors state that both, AKT and ERK are important &quot;for the phenotypic transition&quot;, whereas the preceding discussion (line 225) states the opposite.</p><p>2. In the results and discussion, the authors should explicitly state that long-term induction with Doxy of KRAS has been toxic as early as day 7. Longer cultures (day 28) showed complete loss of KRAS suggesting a negative selection.</p><p>3. Since many Western blot images are not statistically processed (which would be a reasonable request to the authors), explain if the figure legends whether the presented changes are representative of a certain number of repeats. It remains unclear how robust and reproducible are the results at the protein level. Certainly, concordant changes in transcriptional signatures and Westerns is a plus.</p><p>4. Figure 1e presents &quot;viability of adherent cells&quot;: please explain or correct the label to reflect exactly what was measured. If this is colony or adherent cell density based on the colony formation, then it should be stated. Unclear if the non-adherent population was simply removed in the process of staining.</p><p>5. As relevant to most Western blot images, the Method section should state if an effort was made to retain the non-adherent population during cell collection for lysates, and if the presented lysates are representative of the total or adherent population only. This technical detail is important to interpret the results since the authors noticed growth pattern changes with introduction of MAPK-activating oncogenes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, Inoue et al. have significantly improved the manuscript by consolidating and removing some figures, and making the data more organized and concise. The Discussion is also significantly improved by detailing the caveats and considerations of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have responded appropriately to all of the reviewers' comments including extensive editing and providing additional new data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66524.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a copious amount of careful work that will be important for the field.

As I am sure the reviewers appreciate, despite great effort in the lung cancer research community, this has been a very difficult process to model to date, either in vitro or in vivo. While our initial intent was to use the information from the NE to epithelial switch to “reverse engineer” the reciprocal process in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, the combination of molecular changes and treatments we employed, in addition to specific culture conditions, was insufficient to initiate this process. We argue that this highlights the complex nature of this transformation, and suggests that multiple factors, potentially occurring in a specific order, are required for LUAD to SCLC transformation to occur. However, we feel that our findings regarding the NE to epithelial transformation process will be essential for modeling this process in the future as it indicates a key role for ERK and CBP/p300 suppression in mediating this shift, along with <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> mutation. The multifactorial nature of this process is also why we have focused on cell models for the current studies. While the experiments that the reviewers propose, specifically inducible mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> mouse models of LUAD, have the potential to investigate the impact of ERK signaling on NE differentiation, our results suggest that they would likely require additional genetic alterations, including <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> knockout and CBP (<italic>CREBBP</italic>)/p300 (<italic>EP300</italic>) mutation, for a phenotype to be observed. However, generating mouse model systems with such a background (TetO-Mutant-KRAS, p53 knockout, RB knockout, CBP/p300 knockout) is unfeasible for the timeline of this manuscript, and the experiments with these systems will likely take many months to conduct. For example, our in house TetO-KRAS-G12D mouse models take upwards of 10 months to establish LUAD tumors. Our future plans will employ these models as well as TetO-Mutant-EGFR mice combined with clinically relevant treatments (osimertinib etc) and genetic alterations based on our current work to explore this concept in greater detail.</p><p>Along with issues related to clonality and heterogeneity (Comment 12) we have now stated the potential limitations of our focus on established cancer cell lines for this work and described experimental systems that may provide useful for future studies in the Discussion section. However, we feel that despite our inability to achieve LUAD to SCLC transformation, our work still provides extremely valuable information regarding the factors that control cell state transformations in lung cancer that will be useful to the research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Despite zeroing in on ETVs downstream of ERK1/2, the paper does not go as far as showing the direct effect of these TFs as repressors of NE differentiation (ASCL1, BRN2, NEUROD1 etc.). The authors should be encouraged to demonstrate an association of ETS-high profile with adenocarcinoma and a negative association with SCLC. Can the authors address the question, would overexpression of ETV (ETV5 in one of their cell lines) produce similar results to KRAS overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ encouragement to further define the association between ETVs and NE differentiation and have added substantial experimental data to address this as part of the revised Figure 6. First, using expression data for a panel of lung adenocarcinoma and SCLC cell lines, we demonstrate the exclusivity between ETV1/4/5 expression – which are upregulated in adenocarcinomas – and NE transcription factors (ASCL1, BRN2, NEUROD1 and INSM1) – which are up in SCLC – as suggested (Figure 6B). Furthermore, we have now conditionally expressed ETV1 in all three SCLC cell lines (H82, H2107 and H524) and ETV5 in two SCLC cell lines (H82 and H524) which both induced the downregulation of NE transcription factors, similar to the results with forced mutant KRAS expression (Figures 6D and 6E). Together, we feel this additional work clearly demonstrates the association between ETV expression and suppression of the NE differentiation program, further defining these factors as primary downstream drivers of ERK in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are encouraged to add some biologically relevant data regarding therapeutics (that is, data that MAPK ERK activation inhibits the in vitro or in vivo growth of SCLC), for example as xenografts or in colony formation assays. For example, what are the effects of EGFR, KRAS oncogene activation in vivo in xenografts or in colony formation assays?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an interesting point regarding the therapeutic potential of our findings for SCLC treatment. While we do demonstrate that activation of mutant KRAS has inhibitory effects in some of the cell lines tested, namely the ASCL1+ H2107 cell line (Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and c), it also had a stimulatory effect on the NEUROD1+ H82 cell line, despite the downregulation of NE differentiation. Thus, it is possible that there are distinct SCLC contexts in which ERK activation may be lethal, and this warrants further investigation, especially given our previous observation that hyperactivation of ERK is also lethal in NSCLC (Unni et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2018). However, despite differences in regard to cell growth, the transdifferentiation phenotype upon ERK induction was consistent across all SCLC cell lines, which is why we focused on this aspect for the study. Given the reviewers have already suggested that the manuscript is very dense, and contains copious amounts of data, we feel that further exploring the therapeutic potential of ERK induction in a larger panel of SCLC cells is better suited as a focus for a follow up study.</p><p>However, as suggested by the reviewers, we have now added soft agar colony formation assay data for all three SCLC cell lines with activated KRAS, demonstrating similar results as those seen in proliferation assays. This is now presented as Figure 1—figure supplement 2d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is an excessive amount of data and some of the negative data detracts from the focus of the story. I would suggest the authors remove some figures that are either irrelevant to the key points and are not further validated like Supp Figures S5, S6, S7, or are simply confirmatory of what should be known such as Supp Figure S17. S9 could easily be combined with S8. Lines 279-286 discuss &quot;data not shown&quot; related to HEY1 that could easily be omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that some of the supplemental data was excessive and likely not needed to assert the conclusions of our study. As suggested, we have now revised the Supplemental Figures (including renaming in accordance with e<italic>Life</italic> guidelines), removing original Supplemental Figures S5 and S17 as well as panels from original Supplemental Figure S13. In addition, the original Supplemental Figure S9 was combined with Supplementary Figure S8 as suggested by the reviewers. Finally, we have minimized or removed much of the results related to negative data, mainly the data and section in reference HEY1 that were highlighted as a distraction from the reviewers. Together, we feel these changes have streamlined the manuscript, allowing the reader to better follow the main premise and findings of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One recurring issue in the manuscript is that the observations are often not consistent across the three cell lines and are context-specific effects, and the potential reasons could be better explained.

As mentioned above (Response 4), we also see a variable growth phenotype upon KRAS induction depending on SCLC subtype. We have now addressed this important information, including the <italic>EP300</italic> mutation status, in results and in the discussion – with appropriate citations – where indicated by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Related to Figure 4, the authors show that p300 pharmacological inhibition can restore NE fate in presence of Kras. Given that drugs can have off-target effects, it would be helpful to know if genetic knockdown/knockout of p300 phenocopies these effects. Given that CREBBP (CBP) or EP300 (p300) mutations are common in SCLC, it is also relevant whether any of these cell lines have CREBBP (CBP) or EP300 (p300) mutations. It appears H2107 and H524 may have EP300 mutations. Have they tried to restore EP300 function?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an interesting experiment we had previously considered. Once identifying H3K27ac as a major change upon KRAS/ERK induction in SCLC, we originally considered genetic knockout to determine whether it could rescue transdifferentiation. However, using a different compound, C646, which only inhibits p300, we saw modest rescue of NE factor suppression upon KRAS induction, suggesting that dual p300/CBP inhibition was necessary (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). For this reason, we decided to use A-485, which inhibits both p300 and CBP, as opposed to a genetic approach of dual knockdown which would prove more complicated to achieve.</p><p>As mentioned above in Response 6, we have now clearly indicated the mutation status of <italic>EP300</italic> in the SCLC cell lines used in the study, and the potential influence these mutations could have on the results observed. Restoring <italic>EP300</italic> function in these mutant SCLC cell lines is a very interesting experiment that would be predicted to increase H3K27ac levels mimicking the effects of ERK induction, leading to the downregulation of NE factors. While we have not tried this specific experiment, the same logic was behind our experiments using the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A to increase H3K27ac in SCLC. We found that HDAC inhibitors could increase this histone mark, leading to downregulation of NE factors in all SCLC cell lines, even the <italic>EP300</italic> mutant H2107 and H524 cells (Figure 4D). We have modified the text to better reflect this result and feel that greater exploration of this mechanism through re-expression of <italic>EP300</italic> is better suited for follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Related to Figure 6, did the authors test whether ETV4 is sufficient to reduce NE markers? Given that multiple ETV family members can repress NE markers, it seems plausible that it might take knockdown of all of them to rescue Kras-induced NE suppression. This could be understandably technically difficult, so perhaps the authors could just make this point clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>While we exogenously expressed ETV1 and ETV5 individually and found that they can recapitulate the effects of mutant KRAS induction on NE factor suppression in SCLC cells, we did not express ETV4. We hypothesized that, given their similar function, overexpression of anyone of these PEA3 transcription factors would phenocopy the effects of mutant KRAS induction on NE factor downregulation. Furthermore, we predicted – as highlighted by the reviewers – that it would likely require knockdown of all the ETV family members to rescue KRAS-induced NE suppression and attributed the partial rescue in suppression upon <italic>ETV5</italic> knockdown alone to this reasoning.</p><p>However, as ETV4 and ETV5 were the most dramatically increased upon mutant KRAS induction, we have now optimized dual knockdown to observe the combined effect on the rescue of NE factor suppression. While technically challenging as indicated by the reviewers, this experiment revealed increased rescue of NE suppression after mutant KRAS induction upon dual <italic>ETV4</italic>/<italic>5</italic> knockdown compared to knockdown of <italic>ETV4</italic> or <italic>ETV5</italic> alone. These results have been added to manuscript as Figure 6f and are further described in the text. We feel this new experimental data addresses the questions posted by the reviewers regarding the effects of ETV4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Related to FiguresS8/S10, did the authors look at REST protein levels in S8 and/or S10? The functional studies for REST knockdown appear performed in only 1 of the 3 cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an important point regarding REST protein levels that we had originally tried to assess. However, despite multiple attempts using two different antibodies (Millipore [07-579] and Abcam [ab21635]), we were unable to sufficiently optimize REST detection by western blot. In the absence of protein assessment, we relied on qRT-PCR to validate the induction of <italic>REST</italic> after KRAS activation in SCLC as originally discovered through microarray profiling (Figure 2—figure supplement 5b). Further, we performed siRNA mediated knockdown of <italic>REST</italic> in H2107 cells as this cell line demonstrated the greatest increase in <italic>REST</italic> mRNA levels upon mutant KRAS induction as indicated by the microarray experiments. Knockdown of <italic>REST</italic> was confirmed by qRT-PCR and demonstrated no effect on the suppression of NE factors (Figure 2—figure supplement 5b). As no effects were observed in the line with greatest <italic>REST</italic> induction, we did not knockdown <italic>REST</italic> in additional cell lines and focused our efforts on exploring other mechanisms of action, namely the effects on chromatin modification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Related to Figure S18e and S18g: This figure is confusing and could better explained in the text. In S18e, the mutation status of these genes in parental/sgControl cells prior to Osimertinib treatment should be included. Mutation status appears to be presented only after two different types of Osimertinib exposure. Second, in S18g, sgControl resistant cell lose expression of CIC protein expression entirely in the stepwise and initial exposure conditions. Consistently, sgControl Resistant cells seem to increase ETV4 and ETV5 protein levels compared to sgControl parental cells. The authors could explain whether this is due to the gain of the specific nonsense mutation. Since gain of ETV4/5 presumably inhibits NE fate conversion; does ETV knockout induce NE fate in this context?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding this figure. All mutations indicated in this figure panel have been identified through comparison to the respective parental (drug naïve) cell line counterpart. Thus, only genes that have mutated in the resistant cells are indicated, as these would be predicted to potentially drive drug resistance. We have better explained this now in both the text and the respective figure legend.</p><p>For the second part of the comment, the reviewers again bring up an important potential experiment that we had previously considered. We had anticipated that knockdown of <italic>ETV4</italic>/<italic>5</italic> or re-expression of CIC in the resistant cell lines with <italic>CIC</italic> mutation would lead to a potential shift to a NE line state. However, our attempts to accomplish this through pharmacological means – using the pan-ETS inhibitor YK-4-279 – was complicated by a great deal of toxicity, likely due to the dependence of the resistant lines on ETV expression in the absence of ERK activity. Therefore, future experiments that circumvent this issue will be required to further explore this concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors may need to address certain aspects of the principal observation that the MAPK blockade resistant cells acquire NE features. Specifically, these differentiation switches typically occur in complex multiclonal populations of cancer cells in vivo, not in established cell lines. Using human PDX models or mouse models of KRAS/EGFR-driven lung cancers, the authors could have the opportunity to demonstrate the existence of such clonal shifts. Starting with in vitro established stable NE or epithelial clones could be an exceedingly difficult model in which to observe these differentiation switches. Can the authors address this point in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important consideration that needs to be highlighted. We have now elaborated on the potential caveats of our in vitro experiments in more detail in the discussion to address this point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors largely addressed the critical points raised in the review process. While the study was designed to determine the effect of MAPK pathway activation on NE differentiation, a more clinically relevant epithelial-to-NE switch upon MAPK blockade with TKI in lung adenocarcinoma has not been modeled here, which is the limitation of this paper. With this limitation in mind, the presented work has shown several important regulatory mechanisms, namely, that hyperactive ERK signaling is a default repressor of neuroendocrine differentiation transcriptional regulators. ERK2 appears to be the dominant kinase in this process, and the downstream-induced ETV family TFs are important in executing this mechanism.</p><p>1. Certain statements in the text of the paper need to be made more consistent. For example, in line 252 and below, the authors state that both, AKT and ERK are important &quot;for the phenotypic transition&quot;, whereas the preceding discussion (line 225) states the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this inconsistency and have reworded the second sentence to accurately reflect the results as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the results and discussion, the authors should explicitly state that long-term induction with Doxy of KRAS has been toxic as early as day 7. Longer cultures (day 28) showed complete loss of KRAS suggesting a negative selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the following to the Results section: “This suggests negative selection of KRAS<sup>G12V-</sup>positive cells or epigenetic silencing of transduced KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in the long-term (28 day) culture driven by the incompatibility of KRAS activation in SCLC biology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Since many Western blot images are not statistically processed (which would be a reasonable request to the authors), explain if the figure legends whether the presented changes are representative of a certain number of repeats. It remains unclear how robust and reproducible are the results at the protein level. Certainly, concordant changes in transcriptional signatures and Westerns is a plus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this information to the figure legends where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1e presents &quot;viability of adherent cells&quot;: please explain or correct the label to reflect exactly what was measured. If this is colony or adherent cell density based on the colony formation, then it should be stated. Unclear if the non-adherent population was simply removed in the process of staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the methodology used in the representative legend for Figure 1e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. As relevant to most Western blot images, the Method section should state if an effort was made to retain the non-adherent population during cell collection for lysates, and if the presented lysates are representative of the total or adherent population only. This technical detail is important to interpret the results since the authors noticed growth pattern changes with introduction of MAPK-activating oncogenes.</p></disp-quote><p>The methods section now states that the lysates are representative of the total cell population (adherent and non-adherent).</p></body></sub-article></article>
