Mineral oil (MO) also causes inflammation, but not lupus or DAH. Since monocyte depletion prevents DAH, we examined the role of monocytes in the disease. Impaired bone marrow (BM) monocyte egress in <italic>Ccr2−</italic>/− mice abolished DAH, confirming the importance of monocyte recruitment to the lung. Circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice exhibited increased annexin-V staining in comparison with MO-treated controls without evidence of apoptosis, suggesting that pristane alters the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane before or shortly after monocyte egress from the BM. Plasma membrane asymmetry also was impaired in Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> ‘patrolling’ monocytes, which are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors. Patrolling Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes normally promote endothelial repair, but their phenotype was altered in pristane-treated mice. In contrast to MO-treated controls, Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice were CD138<sup>+</sup>, expressed more TremL4, a protein that amplifies TLR7 signaling, and exuberantly produced TNFα in response to TLR7 stimulation. TremL4 expression on these novel CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes was regulated by Nr4a1. Thus, monocyte CD138, high TremL4 expression, and annexin-V staining may define an activated/inflammatory subtype of patrolling monocytes associated with DAH susceptibility. By altering monocyte development, pristane exposure may generate activated Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes, contributing to lung microvascular endothelial injury and DAH susceptibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocyte</kwd><kwd>NR4A1</kwd><kwd>pristane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR44731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reeves</surname><given-names>Westley H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By altering monocyte development, pristane exposure could generate activated Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes, contributing to lung microvascular endothelial injury and DAH susceptibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monocytes are derived from bone marrow (BM) macrophage (Mϕ) and dendritic cell progenitor cells (MDPs), which develop into common monocyte progenitor cells (cMoPs) and then Ccr2<sup>+</sup>Ccr4<sup>lo</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes.

Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes may represent a form of intravascular macrophage (Mϕ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ginhoux and Jung, 2014</xref>), as suggested by the expression of genes typical of tissue-resident Mϕ such as <italic>Apoe</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>).

A subset of the Ly6C<sup>−</sup> peritoneal Mϕ expresses CD138 (syndecan-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ from MO-treated mice have an anti-inflammatory phenotype and are highly phagocytic for dead cells. The significance of CD138 expression by Mϕ is unclear and it is not known whether CD138 is expressed by monocytes.

Circulating Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes increased substantially after pristane, but not MO, treatment, and were more abundant in B6 (DAH susceptible) vs. BALB/c (DAH resistant) mice. In contrast to pristane-treated mice, Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes in MO-treated mice were CD138<sup>−</sup>. Thus, Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>−/lo</sup> ‘patrolling’ monocytes from pristane- vs. MO-treated mice were distinguishable by the presence or absence, respectively, of CD138 surface staining. Monocytes (both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>−/lo</sup>) from pristane- vs. MO-treated also were distinguished by the intensity of annexin-V staining, suggesting that pristane treatment causes a breakdown of plasma membrane asymmetry, which could have functional implications for the pathogenesis of pristane-induced lupus and alveolar hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Although i.p. pristane injection induces lupus autoantibodies and renal disease in both B6 and BALB/c mice, only B6 mice develop DAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeves et al., 2009</xref>).

CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the blood of both pristane- and MO-treated B6 mice at 14 days, but were considerably more abundant in pristane-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, peritoneal CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> Mϕ were more abundant in MO-treated mice than pristane-treated mice. BALB/c mice and B6 mice lacking B cells (μMT) do not develop pristane-induced DAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2011</xref>). Like MO-treated B6 mice, both B6 μMT and BALB/c mice generally had fewer circulating CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and more peritoneal CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> Mϕ than wild-type B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations suggested that circulating CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells were recruited to the peritoneum and developed into CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> Mϕ or alternatively, that CD138<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> Mϕ were generated locally in the peritoneum.

Peritoneal Mϕ also consisted of R1, R2, and R3 populations. Circulating R3 cells had a phenotype compatible with that of ‘patrolling’ monocytes but also had higher F4/80 staining than circulating R1 or R2 cells, consistent with early Mϕ differentiation.

In contrast, R1 monocytes (deficient but not absent in <italic>Ccr2</italic>−/− mice) appeared to be required. R3 monocytes also were deficient in <italic>Ccr2−</italic>/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sunderkötter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Nr4a1−</italic>/− mice had normal numbers of R1 monocytes and were susceptible to pristane-induced DAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). R3 monocytes were greatly reduced (but not absent) in <italic>Nr4a1</italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that they are not involved in DAH or are needed in only small numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, circulating R1 monocytes were numerous in MO-treated B6 mice and pristane-treated B6 µMT and BALB/c mice, but they do not develop DAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Thus, R1 monocytes were not sufficient to induce DAH. One explanation is that the R1 subset might differ in pristane- vs. MO-treated mice, as suggested by the altered annexin-V staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Alternatively, the Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes might differ. Consistent with previous studies in untreated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mildner et al., 2017</xref>), Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> (R6) cells in MO-treated mice were CD138<sup>−</sup> and are likely to be patrolling monocytes monitoring the microvascular endothelium for damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CD138 expression may be a marker for Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes that have lost the ability to promote vascular repair. Consistent with this hypothesis, Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes express higher levels of <italic>Tlr7</italic> and <italic>Treml4</italic> than Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>−</sup> monocytes and produce large amounts of TNFα in response to R848 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Annexin-V staining provided further evidence that circulating monocytes are different in pristane- vs. MO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Annexin-V staining was substantially higher on Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> as well as Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes from pristane- vs. MO-treated mice, suggesting that plasma membrane asymmetry is altered by pristane treatment at an early stage (prior to the differentiation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors into Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes), with increased phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) exposure in the outer leaflet. Annexin-V staining of monocytes from pristane-treated mice was uniformly shifted to the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, neutrophils from the same mice exhibited two populations of cells, one annexin-V<sup>lo</sup> and the other annexin-V<sup>hi</sup>. The annexin-V<sup>hi</sup> population was more prominent in pristane- vs. MO-treated mice, suggesting that pristane causes neutrophil apoptosis. Staining with an antibody against activated caspase-3 was not increased in monocytes from pristane-treated mice, suggesting that pristane may not induce apoptosis in these cells.</p><p>Plasma membrane asymmetry is maintained by flippases, such as ATP11C, and phospholipid scramblases, such as ANO6 (TMEM16F) and XKR8, which help retain PtdSer in the inner leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segawa and Nagata, 2015</xref>). In apoptotic cells, cleavage by caspases irreversibly inactivates ATP11C flippase and activates XKR8 scramblase, resulting in increased PtdSer exposure on the cell surface. However, in activated cells, increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can reversibly activate TMEM16F and inactivate ATP11C, resulting in transiently increased concentrations of PtdSer in the outer leaflet without apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segawa and Nagata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doktorova et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of plasma membrane asymmetry plays a role in immune signaling, including the release of cytokine-loaded microvesicles from monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>). We conclude that pristane may selectively alter the activation state of monocytes, leading to a reversible loss of plasma membrane asymmetry. Increased CD138 expression may be marker for this activated state, which is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), possibly via a mechanism similar to that reported for IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes are not precursors of peritoneal CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ</title><p>Studies in <italic>Ccr2−</italic>/− and <italic>Nr4a1</italic>−/− mice strongly suggested that Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> peritoneal Mϕ were not derived from Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Migration of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to the peritoneum in pristane-treated mice requires Ccr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).

The inability of the remaining circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to enter the peritoneum suggests that both BM egress and migration to the peritoneum were Ccr2 dependent. Following monocyte/Mϕ depletion with clodronate liposomes, the peritoneum is repopulated by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, which differentiate into Ly6C<sup>−</sup> Mϕ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). The absence of both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ in the peritoneum of <italic>Ccr2</italic>−/− mice suggests that CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte precursors. Moreover, although Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes were reduced in <italic>Nr4a1−</italic>/− mice, percentages of Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), confirming that peritoneal CD138<sup>+</sup> Mϕ were not likely to be derived from circulating CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What is the role of CD138?</title><p>The function of CD138 (syndecan-1, <italic>Sdc1</italic>) in myeloid cells is uncertain.

There are several plausible explanations. First, the antibody we used might cross-react with another target in myeloid cells.

Relevant to the role of Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes in monitoring endothelial damage, TremL4 binds late apoptotic and necrotic cells and sensitizes myeloid cells to TLR7 signaling by recruiting MyD88 to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hemmi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2015</xref>).

However, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes also increased in MO-treated mice without DAH, suggesting that Ly6C<sup>−</sup> monocytes play a secondary role. Our data suggest that patrolling monocytes from pristane- and MO-treated mice assume alternative, proinflammatory vs. proresolving phenotypes, respectively. Circulating Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>−</sup> monocytes in MO-treated mice were associated with resistance to DAH, whereas Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes were associated with susceptibility. CD138 may be a marker for an activated subtype of patrolling monocytes, as also suggested by the increased annexin-V staining of monocytes from pristane- vs. MO-treated mice. In pristane-treated mice annexin-V staining also was higher in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, the precursor of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> patrolling monocytes. Thus, pristane may alter the precursors of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> patrolling monocytes, either in the BM or immediately upon egress of those cells from the marrow. Patrolling Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup>annexinV<sup>hi</sup> monocytes with high Treml4 expression may cause an exaggerated inflammatory response to damaged lung endothelial cells. In contrast, Ly6C<sup>−</sup>CD138<sup>−</sup>annexinV<sup>lo</sup> monocytes with low Treml4 expression may be less inflammatory, facilitating the repair of lung vascular damage and protecting from DAH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6), B6.129S4-<italic>Ccr2<sup>tm1Ifc</sup></italic>/J (<italic>Ccr2−</italic>/−), B6.129S2-<italic>Nr4a1<sup>tm1Jmi</sup></italic>/J (<italic>Nr4a1−</italic>/−), B6(Cg)-Ifnar1<sup>tm1.2Ees/J</sup> (<italic>Ifnar1−</italic>/−), B6.129S2-<italic>Ighm<sup>tm1Cgn</sup></italic>/J (μMT), and BALB/cJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions were injected i.p. with 0.5 ml of pristane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or MO (E.R.

All of the animals were handled according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols (#201704493) of the University of Florida. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Florida. Mice were euthanized by exposure to 100% carbon dioxide in an approved administration chamber before removal of tissue. This method is approved by the AVMA panel on Euthanasia. Thoracotomy will be done after CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis, and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-76205-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>There are no datasets generated in this current manuscript.

pristane-treated mice, one CD138- and Nr4a1-independent and the other CD138+ and Nr4a1-dependent. The latter is believed to be produced during pristane-induced microvascular lung injury in an ineffectual effort to maintain vascular integrity in the face of ongoing endothelial damage. This is a model of lung injury with relevance to autoimmunity. Should this CD138+ Nr4a1-dependent population be a hallmark of vascular injury as the authors suggest this work could be relevant for many fields.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76205.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pammg90</institution-id><institution>Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.09.475578">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.09.475578v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This representation of MFI and running stats between different tissues is not ideal, as it doesn't take into account cell preparation, autofluorescence, etc. It would be better to show the data as a fold change in MFI over the MFI of a control cell population deemed negative in each tissue (maybe neutrophils if they show dimmer expression of CD138) to show background MFI.</p><p>– Figure 2F.

It is unclear what this statement refers to on the Figure pane.</p><p>– Figure 6D. Details for this figure are lacking from the text and the legend. Are these WT mice given pristane?

The data can be summarized as follows (we also summarize the data in a new Figure 11):</p><p>1) In pristane-treated Ccr2-/- mice, circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes as well as Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes are nearly absent and the mice do not develop hemorrhage (Figure 3, Figure 4E, Figure 11). In contrast, the Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>-</sup> monocyte subset is unaffected by the absence of CCR2, and therefore is dispensable for DAH.</p><p>2) In pristane-treated Nr4a1-/- mice, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>-</sup> monocytes are present in normal numbers, but the number of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> is reduced substantially (Figure 4, Fig, 11). Since a) monocyte depletion prevents DAH (see Ref. 17) and b) Nr4a1-/- mice develop hemorrhage whereas Ccr2-/- mice do not (Figure 4E), it is likely that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are required for DAH. However, the role of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes is less clear because these cells are not completely absent in Nr4a1-/- mice (Figure 4C). Moreover, the number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in mineral oil (MO)-treated mice is comparable to that in pristane-treated mice (Figure 5A-B), yet MO-treated mice do not develop DAH. However, the Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocyte subset is nearly absent in MO-treated mice, suggesting that it has a role in DAH.</p><p>3) From the data summarized in 1) and 2) above, we conclude that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are required for DAH to develop, either because they directly cause lung injury or because they are the precursors of Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes (see Refs. 6 and 9), which in pristane-treated mice are CD138<sup>+</sup>. If Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes are involved in alveolar hemorrhage, they apparently are not required in large numbers (as suggested by the data in Nr4a1-/- mice).</p><p>4) Adding complexity to our data, additional experiments we carried out in response to the reviewers’ comments indicate that both the Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> subset and the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> subset are different in pristane- vs. MO- treated mice. Single cell RNA-Seq is an obvious approach to further define these differences, but was beyond what could be done in the context of the present study. Instead, we more extensively phenotyped the various monocyte subsets by flow cytometry (see Figures 5-7). In MO-treated B6 mice, pristane-treated BALB/c, and pristane-treated B6 μMT mice, lung hemorrhage does not develop despite the presence of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. We found a subset of Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>-</sup> monocytes in these DAH-resistant mice, and propose that they may protect the lung from the induction of lung hemorrhage by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. An alternative explanation is that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are different in pristane- vs. MO- treated mice. In our previous bulk RNA-Seq studies of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells from the peritoneum (derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, but undergoing Mϕ differentiation), we did not observe substantial differences in gene expression between MO vs. pristane treated mice. However, in the additional experiments we carried out for the current paper, we found that circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> as well as Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice exhibit higher annexin-V staining than those from MO-treated mice (Figure 7D). We think this shift to the right of annexin-V staining represents increased monocyte activation (rather than early apoptosis) in the pristane-treated group because these cells did not express activated caspase-3. Increased annexin-V staining intensity was seen on all Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes, but not on the majority of neutrophils, from pristane-treated mice, suggesting that monocyte activation is present immediately upon egress of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes from the bone marrow. It appears to persist after the differentiation of these “inflammatory” Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors into Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes with a patrolling function.</p><p>5) The new data may suggest that CD138 on Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes (along with increased annexin-V staining) may serve as a marker for cell activation. The activated phenotype of the Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocyte subset also is supported by the high level of TremL4 expression on these cells (Figure 7B). Consistent with the known enhancement of TLR7 signaling by TremL4, R848-stimulated Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice produced as much TNFα as the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (Figure 7C).</p><p>6) The model that has emerged from these studies is fairly complex, and we therefore included a summary figure (Figure 11). Our model proposes that there are two types of Nr4a1-dependent, Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>, patrolling monocytes. In MO-treated B6 mice (as well as pristane-treated μmt and BALB/c mice), they are predominantly CD138<sup>-</sup> and may promote the repair of lung injury. Conversely, in pristane-treated B6 mice, they are CD138<sup>+</sup> (and annexin-V<sup>hi</sup>) with an activated (proinflammatory) phenotype that may perpetuate lung injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract: The abstract was a bit difficult to get through.
