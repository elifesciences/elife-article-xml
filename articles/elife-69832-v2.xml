The mechanisms allowing CPPs to enter cells are ill-defined. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based screening, we discovered that KCNQ5, KCNN4, and KCNK5 potassium channels positively modulate cationic CPP direct translocation into cells by decreasing the transmembrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>). These findings provide the first unbiased genetic validation of the role of V<sub>m</sub> in CPP translocation in cells. In silico modeling and live cell experiments indicate that CPPs, by bringing positive charges on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, decrease the V<sub>m</sub> to very low values (–150 mV or less), a situation we have coined megapolarization that then triggers formation of water pores used by CPPs to enter cells. Megapolarization lowers the free energy barrier associated with CPP membrane translocation. Using dyes of varying dimensions in CPP co-entry experiments, the diameter of the water pores in living cells was estimated to be 2 (–5) nm, in accordance with the structural characteristics of the pores predicted by in silico modeling. Pharmacological manipulation to lower transmembrane potential boosted CPP cellular internalization in zebrafish and mouse models. Besides identifying the first proteins that regulate CPP translocation, this work characterized key mechanistic steps used by CPPs to cross cellular membranes. This opens the ground for strategies aimed at improving the ability of cells to capture CPP-linked cargos in vitro and in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a drug can have its desired effect, it must reach its target tissue or organ, and enter its cells. This is not easy because cells are surrounded by the plasma membrane, a fat-based barrier that separates the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane contains proteins that act as channels, shuttling specific molecules in and out of the cell, and it also holds charge, with its inside surface being more negatively charged than its outside surface.</p><p>Cell-penetrating peptides are short sequences of amino acids (the building blocks that form proteins) that carry positive charges. These positive charges allow them to cross the membrane easily, but it is not well understood how.</p><p>To find out how cell-penetrating peptides cross the membrane, Trofimenko et al. attached them to dyes of different sizes. This revealed that the cell-penetrating peptides enter the cell through temporary holes called water pores, which measure about two nanometres across. The water pores form when the membrane becomes ‘megapolarized’, this is, when the difference in charge between the inside and the outside of the membrane becomes greater than normal. This can happen when the negative charge on the inside surface or the positive charge on the outer surface of the membrane increase. Megapolarization depends on potassium channels, which transport positive potassium ions outside the cell, making the outside of the membrane positive. When cell-penetrating peptides arrive at the outer surface of the cell near potassium channels, they make it even more positive. This increases the charge difference between the inside and the outside of the cell, allowing water pores to form. Once the peptides pass through the pores, the charge difference between the inside and the outside of the cell membrane dissipates, and the pores collapse.</p><p>Drug developers are experimenting with attaching cell-penetrating peptides to drugs to help them get inside their target cells. Currently there are several experimental medications of this kind in clinical trials. Understanding how these peptides gain entry, and what size of molecule they could carry with them, provides solid ground for further drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-penetrating peptides</kwd><kwd>water pores</kwd><kwd>potassium channels</kwd><kwd>membrane potential</kwd><kwd>TAT</kwd><kwd>In silico modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_154420 IZCSZ0-174639</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Widmann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>158116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chevalier</surname><given-names>Nadja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_170062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amati</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030-184759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) enter cells through ~2 (–5)-nm-wide water pores induced by the strong negative plasma membrane potential that CPPs and the activity of potassium channels generate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short non-toxic sequences of 5–30 amino acids present in proteins able to cross membranes such as homeoproteins and some viral components.

CPPs enter cells through a combination of two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Illien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bechara et al., 2013</xref>): endocytosis and direct translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bechara and Sagan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Futaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guidotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Jones and Sayers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Koren and Torchilin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Madani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Ruseska and Zimmer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Trabulo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>). The nature of these entry mechanisms is debated and not fully understood at the molecular level. The vesicular internalization of CPPs has been suggested to occur through clathrin-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bechara and Sagan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Futaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guidotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Jones and Sayers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Koren and Torchilin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Madani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Trabulo et al., 2010</xref>). However, recent data indicate that CPP endocytosis proceeds via a newly discovered pathway that is Rab14-dependent but Rab5- and Rab7-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Trofimenko et al., 2021</xref>). When CPPs are endocytosed, access to the cytosol requires that the CPPs break out of endosomes through a poorly understood process called endosomal escape.</p><p>Direct translocation allows the CPPs to access the cytosol through their ability to cross the plasma membrane. There is currently no unifying model to explain mechanistically how direct translocation proceeds and no genes have yet been identified to modulate the manner by which CPPs cross cellular membranes. Direct translocation across the plasma membrane often seemed to originate from specific areas of the cells, suggesting discrete structures on the plasma membrane involved in CPP entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allolio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duchardt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hirose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wallbrecher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Ziegler et al., 2005</xref>).

Inhibition of KCNN4 activity with TRAM-34 in KCNK5 knock-out cells did not further protect the cells against TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>-induced death. In HeLa cells, TRAM-34, but not XE-991, inhibited TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> internalization and subsequent death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, in HeLa cells, KCNN4 channels regulate the membrane translocation of the peptide. This was confirmed by knocking out KCNN4 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Compared to their respective wild-type controls, the percentage of cells with diffuse cytosolic location of FITC-TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> was drastically diminished in cells lacking one of the CRISPR/Cas9 screen-identified potassium channels in the respective cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>).

At a 20 μM concentration, TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> is readily taken up by wild-type Raji cells but not by KCNQ5 knock-out cells. At this concentration, peptide binding was slightly lower in knock-out than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>, upper graph). However, augmenting the peptide concentrations in the extracellular medium of KCNQ5 knock-out cells to reach surface binding signals equivalent or higher than what was obtained in wild-type cells still did not result in peptide cellular internalization unless ≥80 μM of the peptides were used and even in this case, the uptake remained inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Difference in peptide binding is therefore not the cause of the inability of potassium channel knock-out cells to take up TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>.</p><p>We then assessed whether the role of potassium channels in cellular internalization also applied to TAT cargos other than RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>. TAT-PNA is an oligonucleotide covalently bound to TAT, which can correct a splicing mutation within the luciferase-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kang et al., 1998</xref>). This can only occur if TAT-PNA reaches the cytosol. The luciferase activity triggered by TAT-PNA was diminished in the presence of potassium channel inhibitors and in potassium channel knock-out cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Cytosolic access of TAT-Cre, which can recombine a loxP-RFP-STOP-loxP-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">D’Astolfo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wadia et al., 2004</xref>) gene construct, was then assessed. Switch from red to green fluorescence occurs only when TAT-Cre reaches the nucleus. This took place in wild-type Raji cells but not in the KCNQ5 knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We finally tested a clinical phase III therapeutic D-JNKI1 compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guidotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vasconcelos et al., 2013</xref>) used in the context of hearing loss and intraocular inflammation. The internalization of this peptide was completely blocked in Raji cells lacking KCNQ5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>, left). D-JNKI1 internalization was also diminished in SKW6.4 cells lacking KCNN4 and KCNK5 channels, as well as in HeLa cells lacking the KCNN4 potassium channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>, middle and right panels).

Additionally, cells such as primary rat cortical neurons that naturally have a low V<sub>m</sub> (–48 mV) take up the CPP in their cytosol more efficiently than cells with higher V<sub>m</sub> such as HeLa cells (–25 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the V<sub>m</sub> modulates internalization of TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> in various cell lines. This internalization can be manipulated through cellular depolarization to block it and through hyperpolarization to increase it, confirming earlier results obtained for the R8 CPP in Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Rothbard et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We then assessed whether the entry of TAT, nanomeric arginine (R9), and Penetratin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), three commonly used cationic CPPs in biology and medicine, was regulated by the plasma membrane potential as shown above for TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>. Similarly to TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>, these CPPs are taken up by HeLa cells by both direct translocation and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Depolarization, induced by either gramicidin or high extracellular potassium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), led to decreased cytosolic fluorescence of these CPPs, while valinomycin-mediated hyperpolarization favored their translocation in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>). Although the cellular membrane composition of neurons may differ from the other cell lines used in this study, the V<sub>m</sub> also controlled peptide translocation in non-transformed rat primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, depolarization had no impact on the ability of the cells to endocytose these CPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom graphs), further confirming that CPP endocytosis is not affected by V<sub>m</sub>. Finally, we note that CPP membrane binding was only minimally affected by depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Hence, the reason why depolarized cells do no take up CPPs is not a consequence of reduced CPP binding to cells, confirming our earlier observation obtained with TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Altogether the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> show that direct translocation of cationic CPPs is modulated by the V<sub>m</sub> of cells and that specific potassium channels are involved in this modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CPP direct translocation modeling</title><p>To further study the mechanism of CPP cellular entry through direct translocation, we took advantage of coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) technique and MARTINI force field 2.2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Marrink and Tieleman, 2013</xref>).

The use of very high V<sub>m</sub> values, typically used in computational studies, is required to capture nanosecond occurring events. This protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) allowed us to observe CPP translocation across membranes within a few tens of nanoseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). In presence of ~2 V V<sub>m</sub>, the CPPs approached the membrane on the extracellular side and this led to the formation of a water column within the membrane that the CPP then used to move to the intracellular space (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The movement of the positive charges carried by the CPPs, as well as extracellular cations, to the intracellular compartment via the water pore induced membrane depolarization. This depolarization provoked the collapse of the water pore and membrane resealing. Even though CPPs play an active role in their internalization, the mere presence of the CPP in the absence of a sufficiently low V<sub>m</sub> was not enough to trigger water pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right graph and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

The free energy barriers recorded in depolarized membranes (V<sub>m</sub> = 0) and polarized membranes (V<sub>m</sub> = –80 mV) were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). The obtained value of about 200 kJ/mol is in line with recent estimation of the free energy barrier associated with CPP translocation at a V<sub>m</sub> = 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Only at much lower V<sub>m</sub> values (–150 mV) was a marked decrease in free energy barrier recorded. This indicates that hyperpolarization values found in resting cells (down to about –80 mV in neurons and higher in many other cells types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Yang and Brackenbury, 2013</xref>) are not more favorable than fully depolarized membranes to establish conditions for the formation of water pores. It appears therefore that cells need to decrease their V<sub>m</sub> to much lower values (e.g. –150 mV or lower) to reach conditions compatible with water pore formation. This in silico observation may appear contradictory with our results obtained in live cells showing direct translocation at –25 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as well as with the experiment demonstrating that CPP cytosolic internalization was more efficient in cortical neurons in comparison to less negatively charged HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We therefore postulate that the presence of CPPs on the cell surface induces locally a substantial voltage drop from the resting V<sub>m</sub>. To test this assumption, we analyzed the electrostatic potential map in a molecular system composed of the R9 peptide in contact with the plasma membrane in the absence of an external electrostatic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This simulation indicated that the presence of CPPs at the cell surface is sufficient to decrease locally the transmembrane potential to about –150 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was not observed in the absence of the CPP. In conclusion, our data support a model where CPPs further decrease the V<sub>m</sub> of resting cells to very low values (equal to or less than –150 mV) that are compatible with spontaneous water pore formation and that we coin megapolarization.</p><p>Our model also predicts that the electric force exerted on CPPs when cells are megapolarized permit CPPs to accumulate in the cytosol and reach concentrations that are higher than in the extracellular milieu. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> shows indeed that cells can concentrate TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> in the cytosol of Raji and HeLa cells, up to 100 times in extreme cases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural characterization of the pore allowing CPP entry in live cells</title><p>Propidium iodide (PI), with a diameter of 0.8–1.5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bowman et al., 2010</xref>) or fluorophore-labeled 3, 10, and 40 kDa dextrans, with diameters (provided by Thermo Fisher) of 2.3 ± 0.38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Thorne and Nicholson, 2006</xref>), 4.5, and 8.6 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), were used to estimate the size of the water pores formed in the presence of CPPs in live cells. These molecules by themselves did not translocate in the cytosol of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). They were then co-incubated with different FITC-labeled CPPs and their uptake monitored by confocal microscopy. While PI and CPPs efficiently co-entered cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>), there was only marginal co-entry of the dextrans with the CPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The marginal dextran co-entry was inversely correlated with the dextran diameters (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>): ~2.3-nm-wide dextrans entered cells better than ~4.5-nm-wide dextrans and ~8.6-nm-wide dextrans mostly remained outside cells. The entry of PI and CPPs in cells occurred with identical kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further supporting the notion that they enter cells together. The PI/CPP co-entry was prevented by cell depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is expected if PI accesses the cytosol via the megapolarization-induced pores used by CPP to enter cells. CPPs do not need to be labeled with a fluorophore to allow PI co-entry into cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ‘unlabeled TAT+ PI’ condition), ruling out phototoxicity as a confounding effect. Similar results were obtained in primary rat cortical neurons, where PI cytosolic signal was observed in cells that took up the selected CPPs through direct translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data are compatible with the notion that water pores triggered by CPPs allow molecules up to ~2 nm in diameter to efficiently enter cells. They are also in line with the in silico prediction of the water pore diameter of 1.6±0.26 nm obtained by analyzing the structure of the pore at the transition state (i.e. when the CPP is crossing the cell membrane; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Molecules in the 2–5 nm diameter range, such as 3 and 10 kDa dextrans, can still use this entry route to a limited extent.

These include the formation of pores made of the CPPs themselves that they use for their own entry, the formation of inverted micelles in the plasma membrane that translocate the CPPs, or diffusion of the CPPs across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bechara and Sagan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Futaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guidotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Koren and Torchilin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Trabulo et al., 2010</xref>). Our simulation and cellular data, while providing no evidence for such models, demonstrate that CPP cellular internalization is potassium channel- and V<sub>m</sub>-dependent in vitro and in vivo. Potassium channels are required to establish a basal low V<sub>m</sub>, subsequently permissive for CPP direct translocation. Hyperpolarizing drugs, such as valinomycin, enhance permissiveness. When CPPs come into contact with the plasma membrane, they decrease even more the V<sub>m</sub>, resulting in a locally megapolarized membrane. This increases the likelihood of water pore formation that the CPPs then use to penetrate into cells according to their electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Water pores are created by a combination of lipid head group reorientation coupled to intrusion of a column of water in the membrane bilayer. Water movement plays therefore an active role in the formation of the pore and is not merely occurring once the pores are formed. The movement of the positive charges carried by the CPPs into the cell, as well as the transport of extracellular cations (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>), dissipates the V<sub>m</sub>, resulting in the collapse of the water pores and sealing of the plasma membrane. CPP-mediated formation of water pores is therefore transient and does not affect cell viability. Multiple rounds of CPP-driven water pore formation and CPP translocation into cells can lead to intracellular accumulation of the CPP to concentrations higher than found outside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) direct translocation through water pores.</title><p>Cationic CPP translocation across cellular membranes is favored by the opening of potassium channels or by hyperpolarizing drugs, such as valinomycin. This sets a sufficiently low membrane potential permissive for CPP direct translocation. When cationic CPPs bind to these already polarized membranes, they induce megapolarization (i.e. a membrane potential estimated to be –150 mV or lower). This leads to the formation of water pores that are then used by CPPs to enter cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69832-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It has not been possible to measure directly the precise values of the V<sub>m</sub> that allow the formation of water pores used by CPPs to enter cells. Using an indirect calculation mode based on the uptake of PI alongside CPPs, we have estimated that a V<sub>m</sub> in the order of –150 mV is required for water pores to be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This might be an underestimation however as modeling data indicate that, at –150 mV, the free energy barrier, while being markedly diminished compared to those calculated at –80 or 0 mV, is not fully abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Possibly therefore, the local V<sub>m</sub> where CPPs interact with the plasma membranes is much lower than –150 mV and/or changes in CPP structures occur (e.g. refolding, aggregation) leading to further reduction in free energy barrier.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the applied coarse-grained MARTINI force field, as any other model, has a number of known limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Marrink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Marrink and Tieleman, 2013</xref>) such as the chemical and spatial resolution, which are both limited compared to atomistic models. There is also a shifted balance between entropy and enthalpy due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, the secondary structure is an input parameter of the model, which implies that secondary structure elements remain fixed during the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>). However, the coarse-grained approach has provided reliable results in the context of protein-membrane interactions and peptide translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Castillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Koch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Marrink et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Monticelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Periole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Periole et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ramadurai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Yesylevskyy et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the ability of MARTINI coarse-grained force field to model realistic and heterogeneous membranes has been repeatedly reported in literature, as summarized in a recent review paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Marrink et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our model posits that the number of positively charged amino acids influence the ability of CPPs to hyperpolarize cells and hence to form water pores that they take to translocate into cells. CPP hydropathy strongly correlates with penetration of water molecules in the lipid bilayer, thus supporting the hypothesis that the amount of water each CPP can route inside the membrane is modulated by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grasso et al., 2018</xref>). The nature of cationic amino acids in peptides determines their translocation abilities. It is known for example that peptides made of nine lysines (K9) poorly reaches the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and that replacing arginine by lysine in Penetratin significantly diminishes its internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>). According to our model, K9 should induce megapolarization and formation of water pores that should then allow their translocation into cells. However, it has been determined that, once embedded into membranes, lysine residues tend to lose protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">MacCallum et al., 2008</xref>). This will thus dissipate the strong membrane potential required for the formation of water pores and prevent lysine-containing CPPs to cross the membrane. In contrast, arginine residues are not deprotonated in membranes and water pores can therefore be maintained allowing the arginine-rich CPPs to be taken up by cells. This phenomenon was not modeled in our coarse-grained in silico simulations because the protonation state was fixed at the beginning of the simulation runs and was not allowed to evolve. An additional potential explanation for the internalization differences observed between arginine- and lysine-rich peptides is that even though both arginine and lysine are basic amino acids, they differ in their ability to form hydrogen bonds, the guanidinium group of arginine being able to form two hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fromm et al., 1995</xref>) while the lysyl group of lysine can only form one. Compared to lysine, arginine would therefore form more stable electrostatic interactions with the plasma membrane. According to previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kosuge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>), the optimal length of consecutive arginine residues appears to be between 9 and 16 amino acids, resulting in optimal CPP cytosolic acquisition. Shorter and longer peptides have decreased internalization efficiencies. The role of the V<sub>m</sub> presented in our model is consistent with the reduced uptake of short polyarginine peptides but the V<sub>m</sub> parameter of our model cannot explain why longer polyarginine peptides are less efficiently taken up by cells. Our work however also indicates that the water pores created by megapolarization have a diameter of about 2 (–5) nm. Molecules larger than 2 nm are therefore less efficiently transported through these water pores and if polyarginine peptides reach that size their internalization will be hindered. The efficiency of direct translocation of peptides is therefore likely modulated by their sizes, the secondary structures they adopt, and the number of positive charges they carry.</p><p>Cationic residues are not the only determinant in CPP direct translocation. The presence of tryptophan residues also plays important roles in the ability of CPPs to cross cellular membranes. This can be inferred from the observation that Penetratin, despite only bearing three arginine residues, can penetrate cells with similar propensities compared to R9 or TAT that contain 9 and 8 arginine residues, respectively. The aromatic characteristics of tryptophan is not sufficient to explain how it favors direct translocation as replacing tryptophan with the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine decreases the translocation potency of the RW9 (RRWWRRWRR) CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Derossi et al., 1994</xref>). Rather, differences in the direct translocation promoting activities of tryptophan and phenylalanine residues may come from the higher lipid bilayer insertion capability of tryptophan compared to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christiaens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jobin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">MacCallum et al., 2008</xref>). There is a certain degree of interchangeability between arginine and tryptophan residues as demonstrated by the fact that replacing up to four arginine residues with tryptophan amino acids in the R9 CPP preserves its ability to enter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Walrant et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, despite the importance of the membrane potential for CPP direct translocation into cells, other factors also appear to play a role in this process.</p><p>While the nature of the CPPs likely dictate their uptake efficiency as discussed in the previous paragraph, the composition of the plasma membrane could also modulate how CPPs translocate into cells. In the present work, we have recorded CPP direct translocation in transformed or cancerous cell lines as well as in primary cells. These cells display various abilities to take up CPPs by direct translocation and the present work indicates that this is modulated by their V<sub>m</sub>. But as cancer cells display abnormal plasma membrane composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Szlasa et al., 2020</xref>), it will be of interest in the future to determine how important this is for their capacity to take up CPPs.</p><p>We propose, based on the work described here, that hyperpolarization induced by drugs such as valinomycin represents a simple alternative or parallel approach to optimize CPP internalization. However, hyperpolarizing drugs may be toxic when systemically applied. For example, valinomycin at the concentrations used to induce hyperpolarization (10 μM) would be lethal if systemically injected in mice (LD50 in the low micromolar range; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daoud and Juliano, 1986</xref>). On the other hand, local administration of valinomycin is far less toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gad et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Waksman, 1953</xref>) as confirmed here in zebrafish and mice. Hyperpolarizing agents may therefore be preferentially used for local or topical applications, which is incidentally the case for the clinically approved CPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Strategies to improve CPP delivery are becoming increasingly elaborate through the use of nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bansal et al., 2018</xref>), double-coated nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Khalil et al., 2018</xref>), liposome-polycation-DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), branched peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>), etc. Our molecular characterization of the process of CPP direct translocation can be taken advantage of to (i) improve or optimize ‘old’ CPPs, (ii) design new CPPs, (iii) help explain the behavior of newly discovered CPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kauffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Yin et al., 2009</xref>), (iv) discriminate between target cells and cells that should be left unaffected based on V<sub>m</sub>, and (v) distinguish between direct translocation and endosomal escape. The present work indicates that the impact on megapolarization should be evaluated when chemical modifications are performed on cationic CPPs to augment their delivery capacities.</p></sec><sec

The manuscript represents an important contribution to the field of CPP translocation into cells. Based on the experiments and simulations CPP, they propose a mechanism that CPPs enter the cell thanks to the electrostatic membrane potential. The data are well presented, however, it seems to me that the authors overinterpret the data because the presented mechanism and its discussion have few flaws:</p><p>On page 21: The authors state: &quot;However, it has been determined that, once embedded into membranes, lysine residues tend to lose protons (Armstrong et al., 2016; Li et al., 2013). This will thus dissipate the strong membrane potential required for the formation of water pores and leave the lysine-containing CPPs stuck within the phospholipids of the membrane.&quot;</p><p>Lysine can indeed get neutral in the membrane, and the deprotonated state is the most favorable state in the middle of the membrane hydrophobic core (see MacCallum et al., 2008 for free energy profiles of lysine insertion). However, it is energetically unfavorable for lysine to be inside the membrane even when deprotonated. The most favorable state for lysin is to be protonated in solution (around neutral pH), i.e., lysine residue is hydrophilic, not hydrophobic. Therefore, lysine residues preferentially leave the membrane and not get stuck inside the membrane, as the authors state. Moreover, the proton will dissociate during the lysine insertion into the membrane, and thus it most likely stays outside of the cell. Note that when peptides are in the pore, they are not in the hydrophobic core of the membrane.</p><p>Page 22: &quot;…water pores created by megapolarization have a diameter of about 2(-5) nm. Molecules larger than 2 nm are therefore less efficiently transported through these water pores. Polyarginine peptides of 20 amino acids or more have a predicted spherical diameter greater than 2 nm and would travel less efficiency through the water pores than shorter peptides. The efficiency of direct translocation is therefore likely modulated by the number of positive charges of the peptide and the size of the peptides (not mentioning the role of the secondary structures adopted by the CPPs).&quot;</p><p>I agree with the general statement that the uptake of large molecules could be hindered or even prevented by the limited size of the pore size. However, the PEPFOLD-3 server, which the authors used for the prediction of peptide structures fixed in all simulations, predicts helical structure for polyarginine peptides with lengths 9 and even 20. Such helix has a diameter smaller than 2 nm along the helical axes and thus can easily get through the pore. Therefore, the presented data/discussion is not consistent with simulations.</p><p>Finally, the authors correctly state that arginine residues could be replaced by tryptophan residues in CPPs leading to similar translocation in cells. This possibility clearly demonstrates that there is more into the CPP translocation mechanism than the electrostatic membrane potential. The used explanation &quot;It appears that loss of positive charges that contribute to water pore formation can be compensated by acquisition of strengthened lipid interactions when arginine residues are replaced with tryptophan residues.&quot; is strange because the use of more residues with less hydrophobic character would then have the same effect (e.g., two phenylalanine residues instead of arginine or tryptophan). In addition, the membrane potential does not explain the experiments on GUVs. Therefore, despite a nice demonstration of the importance of the membrane potential for the CPP translocation into cells, the mechanism seems to be more complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really appreciate the efforts of the authors to provide new experimental data in response to the comments, which reinforce the quality of the manuscript. I fully agree that the time component should be critical at the level the whole cell population, which is not incompatible with an all or none mechanism at the single cell level, i.e.once reaching the favorable membrane potential. Surprisingly, fluorescent median intensity rather than the percentage of cells with high intensity signal seems to increase over time (Figure 1 sup4, error in axis title panel D) at least in HeLa cells. Inherent to most original studies, this work raises some interesting questions which remain unanswered or unclear but this would be part of another study. In particular, the use of genetic sensor instead of diBac to measure membrane potential might greatly help to dissect the translocation process on a single-cell basis.</p><p>In conclusion I would recommend the publication of this manuscript in its revised version</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69832.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We believe that your study is original and brings new data to the field.

The reviewer suggests that water pore formation mechanism is an “all or none” process, which could be the case. However, based on our results in Figure 1, another plausible interpretation to account for CPP uptake heterogeneity within the cell population is the difference in kinetics of water pore formation, indicating a need for a certain membrane potential threshold favorable to water pore formation. We have seen that over time there are more and more cells that acquire the CPP within the cytosol, which supports the time component of the process.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have now quantitated the percentage of cells with different CPP fluorescence intensity within the cytosol in non-treated, depolarized (gramicidin treatment) or hyperpolarized (valinomycin treatment) conditions (see Figure 3 – figure supplement 2D ). As seen previously (Figure 3C-D), Penetratin uptake is slightly less affected by membrane potential modulation than the uptake of TAT and R9, though the trend remains the same. For all three tested CPPs, in the control condition, there is a mixed population of cells where the CPP cytosolic signal is either absent, low or high. The fact that there is a mix of the CPP cytosolic uptake efficiency in the non-treated population could be due to differences in the basal membrane potential within the cell population. Upon depolarization, cells with high cytosolic signal were no longer observed. Most cells were actually unable to acquire the CPPs in their cytosol. However, when cells were hyperpolarized by valinomycin, the percentage of cells without cytosolic signal became negligible and the number of cells with high cytosolic CPP signal increased in comparison to the non-treated condition. These results confirm our previous results that cytosolic CPP access is membrane-potential dependent, which is reflected in the increased intensity of CPP cytosolic signal in hyperpolarized conditions. These results are now part of Figure 3 – figure supplement 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to link functional (toxicity) and live imaging analysis assays, one possibility would be to analyze the remaining living cells following long incubation (16-24h) with FITC-TAT RasGAP to estimate which staining category is actually killed (ideally with or without hyperpolarization).

Despite intensity differences, the appearance of the populations with high and low CPP fluorescence occurred with similar kinetics (panels A-B). There was an almost perfect correlation between:</p><p>i) the percentage of cells with low intensity peptide fluorescence detected by flow cytometry and the percentage of cells with vesicular staining and low CPP cytosolic signal visualized with confocal microscopy (panel C),</p><p>ii) the percentage of cells with high intensity peptide fluorescence detected by flow cytometry and the percentage of cells with high CPP cytosolic staining visualized with confocal microscope (panel D).</p><p>Cell death induced by TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> was mostly recorded in cells from the high-intensity fluorescent population (panel E), which, based on our results, corresponds to cells that had acquired the CPP through direct translocation across the cell membrane.

For the mechanism underlying the killing activity of TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub>, and why the TAT-RasGAP<sub>317-326</sub> mutant lacks this activity, please refer to the following reference: Serulla et al. PNAS 2020 117:31871.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional: To check whether the very large heterogeneity in the translocation efficiency within a same cell culture could be related to heterogeneities in membrane potential among cells, the membrane potential of each cell could be measured (using DiBAC4(3) labelling or any genetically encoded membrane potential sensor) together with CPP translocation (labelled TMR if using DiBAC).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting point. We, as well as others<sup>1-7</sup>, have regularly observed different abilities of cells within a culture to take up CPPs. Some take up the CPP by endocytosis, others by direct translocation, many using both eventually. There can also be cells in a population that do not take up CPPs at all. The observed variability is currently not understood and could be modulated by the metabolic state of the cell, by the extent of cell polarization, as well as in which stage of the cell cycle cells are (for the latter point, it is known indeed that cells close to mitosis become refractory to endocytosis). In our DiBac3(4) experiments performed with control cells, we have seen that the probe fluorescence follows a relatively broad Gaussian distribution (i.e. spanning about 1 ½ logs of fluorescence intensity) indicating that cells within a population can have very different Vm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Similar results were recently obtained using single cell membrane potential detection that showed that within a cell population the Vm vary between -100 mV to 0 mV <sup>8</sup>. We have attempted to co-incubate the cells with TMR-CPP and DiBac3(4). However, these two molecules seem to interact with each other, preventing adequate interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the heterogeneity in the CPP uptake could reflect the membrane potential differences within the cell population.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69832-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Ectopic expression of the potassium channel in &quot;heterologous&quot; context.</p><p>Although distinct types of potassium channels have been characterized in the screen, the authors only consider their action on the membrane potential, supported by the effects of specific drugs. However, translocation efficiency does not strictly correlate with membrane potential (e. g. KCNJ2 expression in WT and KCNN4 KO Hela figure 3B). It would be interesting to evaluate if KCNQ5 expression would rescue or even increase internalization (additive effect) in SKW6.4 and HeLa cells (WT and KCNN4 KO) and vice versa (KCNN4 expression in Raji). This would also avoid any potential interference of the CRISPR system on ectopic expression. Indeed, the kinetic of CPP uptake significantly differs between cell lines (Figure 1B, almost 100% negative cells for Raji at 20 minutes and only 20% for the 2 others), suggesting partially distinct mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion of potassium channel expression in “heterologous” context. Through these experiments (see Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) we have indeed been able to show that the KCNQ5 and KCNN4 CRISPR/Cas9-identified potassium channels modulate the cell membrane potential not only when present endogenously, but also when ectopically expressed. Ectopic expression of the identified potassium channels led to cell hyperpolarization (albeit to a lesser extent than what was observed in Figure 3B), which as expected resulted in increased CPP internalization. These results are now part of Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that CPP internalization in Raji cells is somewhat delayed in comparison to HeLa and SKW6.4 cells. It is possible that distinct mechanisms are used by different cell lines to acquire CPPs in their cytosol. However, since direct translocation, in all the tested cell lines, is inhibited by depolarization and increased by hyperpolarization, we rather suggest that direct translocation follows the mechanism described in our manuscript but with different kinetics and efficiencies between cell lines possibly due to differences in cell membrane composition affecting initial peptide surface binding and consequently modulating further water pore formation and CPP entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the simulations:</p><p>3) The limitations of the simulations should be discussed.

Thus, the in silico results should be viewed only as an indication (not proof), the folding issue should be mentioned in the manuscript and the authors should more clearly specify what the peptide structures are.</p></disp-quote><p>Martini forcefield, as any other model, has indeed a number of known limitations<sup>9,10</sup> such as the chemical and spatial resolution, which are both limited compared to atomistic models. There is also a shifted balance between entropy and enthalpy due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, as correctly mentioned by the Reviewer, the secondary structure is an input parameter of the model, which implies that secondary structure elements remain fixed during the simulation<sup>11</sup>, starting from the molecular model obtained through the PEPFOLD-3 server<sup>12-14</sup>. Tertiary structural changes, however, are allowed and in principle realistically described with Martini forcefield. The coarse-grained approach has demonstrated to provide reliable results in the context of protein translocation mechanism<sup>15</sup>, estimation of tilt angle of membrane spanning helices<sup>11</sup>, or helix-helix packing motifs<sup>16,17</sup>, H-NMR quadrupolar splitting of WALP peptides (reproduced to a better extent than atomistic simulations)<sup>18</sup>, structure prediction of the glycophorin A dimer compared to NMR data<sup>16</sup>, water transmembrane (TM) permeation rate<sup>11,19</sup>, propensity for interfacial versus TM peptide orientation<sup>11</sup>, lateral diffusion of peptides<sup>20</sup> and proteins<sup>21</sup>, and dimerization free energies of transmembrane helices<sup>22</sup>. Moreover, the ability of Martini Coarse-grained forcefield to model realistic, heterogeneous, membranes was widely demonstrated in literature. Extensive comparison of the performance of the Martini model with respect to a variety of experimental properties has revealed that the model performs generally very well in term of membrane thickness, area per lipid (typically reproduced to within 0.1–0.2 nm<sup>2</sup>)<sup>19,23</sup>, ternary phase behavior of lipid mixtures<sup>24</sup>, liquid densities<sup>19</sup>, accessible lipid conformations<sup>25</sup>, membrane bending modulus<sup>19</sup>, rupture tension<sup>23</sup>, diffusion rates of lipids<sup>19,23</sup>, time scales for lipid aggregation<sup>19</sup>, bilayer phase transition temperatures<sup>26,27</sup>, lipid desorption free energy<sup>23</sup>, membrane domain formation<sup>24,28</sup> data. The scientific literature in the field of coarse-grained molecular simulations of cell membranes is summarized in a recent review<sup>10</sup>. In the context of electroporation, the implementation of a polarizable water model for the coarse-grained MARTINI force field<sup>19,29</sup> allowed to induce pores in a membrane in a similar manner as it was done in atomistic simulations<sup>19,30</sup>. However, treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions with the PME method is a prerequisite to observe pores and therefore an increased computational effort is needed. For this reason, we applied the PME method to treat the electrostatic interactions (Please see the Material and Method section of the manuscript).</p><p>We’ve carefully discussed the limitations of the coarse-grained approach applied in the manuscript, as required by the Reviewer in the Discussion section of the manuscript. Moreover, we’ve also specified the version of the forcefield used. We would also specify that, as reported in Material and Methods section of the manuscript, the CPP molecular structure has been generated through the PEPFOLD-3 server<sup>12</sup>, as done in recent manuscripts in the field<sup>13,31</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Current simulations seem to mainly capture the effect of simple electrostatics; i.e. more charges, more penetration.

Such comparison would show what simulations actually detect.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct and we mention in the discussion that, according to our model, K9 should induce megapolarization and formation of water pores. This should then allow efficient K9 translocation into cells, contradicting the cellular observations made by us and others that K9 internalization if less efficient than that of R9 (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C). It has been determined that besides the differences in the formation of hydrogen bonds between the two CPPs, lysine and arginine differ in their protonation state. Once embedded into membranes, lysine residues tend to lose protons<sup>32,33</sup>. This will thus dissipate the strong membrane potential required for the formation of water pores and leave the lysine-containing CPPs stuck within the phospholipids of the membrane. In contrast, arginine residues are not deprotonated in membranes and water pores can therefore be maintained allowing the arginine-rich CPPs to be taken up by cells. This phenomenon however cannot be modeled by coarse-grained <italic>in silico</italic> simulations because the protonation state is fixed at the beginning of the simulation runs and is not allowed to evolve. Therefore, the uptake kinetics of lysine-rich peptides, such as MAP and K9, would appear artefactually similar as the uptake kinetics of arginine-rich peptides such as R9. This was discussed in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional:</p><p>– Further check experimentally the physical mechanism related to the membrane potential: compare the uptake effectiveness for different lengths of poly-arginines. If the mechanism is correct, the effectiveness will increase with increasing length.</p></disp-quote><p>Several previously published studies such as<sup>34,35</sup> have addressed this question by comparing the internalization efficiency of polyarginine peptides of various lengths. According to these studies the optimal length of consecutive arginine residues appears to be between 9-16 amino acids, resulting in optimal CPP cytosolic acquisition. Shorter and longer peptides have decreased internalization efficiencies. The role of the Vm presented in our model is consistent with the reduced uptake of short polyarginine peptides but the Vm parameter of our model cannot explain why longer polyarginine peptides are less efficiently taken up by cells. Our work however also indicates that the water pores created by megapolarization have a diameter of about 2(-5) nm. Molecules larger than 2 nm are therefore less efficiently transported through these water pores. Polyarginine peptides of 20 amino acids or more have a predicted spherical diameter greater than 2 nm and would travel less efficiency through the water pores than shorter peptides. The efficiency of direct translocation is therefore likely modulated by the number of positive charges of the peptide and the size of the peptides (not mentioning the role of the secondary structures adopted by the CPPs). This is now addressed in the discussion of the updated version of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors responded to all the raised issues and modified the manuscript accordingly.
