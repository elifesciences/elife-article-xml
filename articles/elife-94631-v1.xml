We have little insight into what activates the expression of these maternal factors. One candidate is the zinc-finger protein OVO. OVO is required for female germline viability and has been shown to positively regulate its own expression, as well as a downstream target, <italic>ovarian tumor</italic>, by binding to the transcriptional start site (TSS). To find additional OVO targets in the female germline and further elucidate OVO’s role in oocyte development, we performed ChIP-seq to determine genome-wide OVO occupancy, as well as RNA-seq comparing hypomorphic and wild type rescue <italic>ovo</italic> alleles. OVO preferentially binds in close proximity to target TSSs genome-wide, is associated with open chromatin, transcriptionally active histone marks, and OVO-dependent expression. Motif enrichment analysis on OVO ChIP peaks identified a 5’-TAACNGT-3’ OVO DNA binding motif spatially enriched near TSSs. However, the OVO DNA binding motif does not exhibit precise motif spacing relative to the TSS characteristic of RNA polymerase II complex binding core promoter elements. Integrated genomics analysis showed that 525 genes that are bound and increase in expression downstream of OVO are known to be essential maternally expressed genes. These include genes involved in anterior/posterior/germ plasm specification (<italic>bcd, exu, swa, osk, nos, aub, pgc, gcl</italic>), egg activation (<italic>png, plu, gnu, wisp, C(3)g, mtrm</italic>), translational regulation (<italic>cup</italic>, <italic>orb</italic>, <italic>bru1, me31B</italic>), and vitelline membrane formation (<italic>fs(1)N</italic>, <italic>fs(1)M3</italic>, <italic>clos</italic>). This suggests that OVO is a master transcriptional regulator of oocyte development and is responsible for the expression of structural components of the egg as well as maternally provided RNAs that are required for early embryonic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germ cells</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>embryonic development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many well-studied maternal developmental pathways that are required for embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are regulated by the transcription factor OVO in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryonic development is directed by events that take place during oogenesis. Germline stem cells (GSCs) asymmetrically divide to renew the stem cell population and send one daughter cell towards oogenesis. In the germarium, oogenesis is preceded by four rounds of incomplete mitotic divisions resulting in a 16-cell egg chamber. One cell is specified as the oocyte, which is arrested in prophase of meiosis I, while the rest of the 15 cells enter endoreplication cycles and become nurse cells (NCs). Once the 16-cell egg chamber buds from the germarium, the NCs begin to transcribe and translate a vast array of RNAs and proteins that serve diverse functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastock and St Johnston, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spradling et al., 2022</xref>). These roles include positioning maternal mRNAs and proteins in the correct spatial orientation to support anterior/posterior, and dorsal ventral axis specification, as well negative regulators of translation to ensure that the maternal mRNAs are not translated before fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lasko, 2012</xref>). The oocyte also contains a number of proteins and mRNAs that are needed for egg activation, completion of meiosis and initiation of embryonic development after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avilés-Pagán and Orr-Weaver, 2018</xref>). To repeat the process of oogenesis from generation to generation, germ cells in the developing embryo need to be specified and maintained separately from the rest of the developing somatic cell population. This requires maternally controlled localization of the germ plasm and early pole cell formation in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahowald, 2001</xref>). While the complex interactions between maternally supplied mRNAs and proteins have been well studied, transcriptional regulation driving the expression of these pathways are less well understood.</p><p>Few positive regulators of female-specific germ cell transcription have been identified. Genes such as <italic>grauzone</italic> (<italic>grau</italic>) and <italic>maternal gene required for meiosis</italic> (<italic>mamo</italic>) have been shown to activate the transcription of <italic>cortex</italic> and <italic>vasa</italic>, respectively, in the female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harms et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakamura et al., 2019</xref>). Active repression of male-specific transcription through the activity of <italic>egg</italic>, <italic>wde</italic>, and <italic>Su(var)205</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolko et al., 2018</xref>), or global repression of non-ovarian transcriptional networks through the function of <italic>sov</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benner et al., 2019</xref>), have shown the importance of heterochromatin formation in the female germline for cellular identity and oocyte development. In fact, recent work has shown the importance of transcriptional repression, mediated through changes in histone modifications, as a key regulator of egg chamber differentiation. GSCs have been shown to exist in a sort of ‘ground state’ of histone modifications. Characterized with modest non-canonical repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks at many genes, as well as transcriptionally active H3K27ac histone marks and open chromatin at others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>). As oocyte development continues, repressive histone marks associated with heterochromatin begin to increase in abundance resulting in fewer histone marks associated with transcription and open chromatin. This suggests that gene expression becomes more restricted throughout the differentiation process. However, it is unlikely that the female germline directs oocyte development solely through a repressive transcriptional model. Whether the female germline expresses paralogs of the RNA polymerase II complex, like the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), or if there are pioneering transcription factors involved in determining the open chromatin status for female germ cell-specific expression, or something else entirely, has yet to be determined.</p><p>Although few female-specific germline transcription factors have been identified, the conserved zinc-finger transcription factor OVO has long been known to be required for female germ cell viability. Female germ cells that are <italic>ovo<sup>–</sup></italic> do not survive into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oliver et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oliver et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). Hypomorphic <italic>ovo</italic> alleles, specifically ones that disrupt the transcriptional activator OVO-B, show an arrested egg chamber phenotype, indicating that wild-type OVO-B activity is required for oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). Germline OVO is expressed at all stages of oogenesis, where it is eventually maternally loaded into the egg. Maternal OVO becomes specifically localized to the developing germline and persists throughout embryogenesis until zygotic OVO is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, OVO is eternally expressed in the female germline, suggesting it may be a key regulator of female-specific germline transcription. However, only two downstream targets have previously been identified for OVO. OVO has been shown to positively regulate the expression of its own transcription, therefore executing an autoregulatory loop, as well as positively regulating the transcription of the gene <italic>ovarian tumor</italic> (<italic>otu</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>otu</italic> is also required in the female germline, where <italic>otu<sup>–</sup></italic> germ cells show viability and germline tumor phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bishop and King, 1984</xref>). The <italic>ovo</italic> phenotype is epistatic to that of <italic>otu</italic>, and ectopic <italic>otu</italic> expression cannot rescue female germ cell death due to loss of <italic>ovo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pauli et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, <italic>ovo</italic> must be responsible for activating the transcription of genes in addition to <italic>otu</italic> for female germ cell survival and differentiation.</p><p>We expanded our knowledge of OVO’s role in the female germline by determining genome-wide OVO occupancy and global transcriptional changes downstream of OVO. This allowed us to determine which genes OVO binds, and which genes transcriptionally respond to OVO in vivo. We show that OVO is directly regulating essential maternal pathways such as axis specification, primordial germ cell formation, egg activation, and maternal mRNA translation regulation. Together, we show that OVO plays a pivotal role in the positive transcriptional regulation of oocyte and early embryonic development. We show that OVO likely carries out this regulation by binding at or in close proximity to the promoters of the genes it regulates and that OVO DNA binding motifs are enriched at or near the transcriptional start site (TSS) of OVO-responsive genes, although the spacing of OVO-binding sites suggests that it is not a component of the RNA polymerase complex. OVO binding is also a signature of open chromatin status and active transcription throughout oocyte differentiation. Altogether, we suggest that OVO is required for the activity of a large number of female germline promoters and is likely a key regulator of oocyte maturation and RNAs and proteins that are required for early embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OVO binds promoters genome-wide</title><p>OVO-B, the predominant protein isoform expressed from the <italic>ovo</italic> locus in the female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>), is a positive regulator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2000</xref>) at both the <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>ovo</italic> locus. Transgenic reporter constructs of <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>ovo</italic> require OVO-binding sites both at and upstream of the TSS in order to recapitulate full reporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>). Females hemizygous for antimorphic dominant gain-of-function (<italic>ovo<sup>D</sup></italic>) or homozygous recessive (<italic>ovo<sup>D1rv</sup></italic>) <italic>ovo</italic> alleles lack germ cells in the adult ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oliver et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). True OVO-B null alleles created by deletion of the <italic>ovo-B</italic> promoter have the same germ cell loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). The phenotypes of <italic>otu<sup>–</sup></italic> females range from germ cell death to ovarian tumors depending on the allele and undefined stochastic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bishop and King, 1984</xref>). It is possible that the germ cell death phenotype in <italic>ovo<sup>–</sup></italic> female germ cells can solely be explained by failure of OVO to activate <italic>otu</italic> expression, however, this is highly unlikely. The <italic>ovo<sup>D1rv</sup></italic> phenotype is epistatic to <italic>otu<sup>–</sup></italic>, and ectopic <italic>otu<sup>+</sup></italic> in <italic>ovo<sup>–</sup></italic> germ cells does not rescue the germ cell death phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinson et al., 1999</xref>). This suggests that OVO regulates the expression of additional genes in the female germline.</p><p>We wanted to identify OVO target genes in the female germline by using two complementary genome-wide approaches to test for OVO presence and function.

The GFP pull down appeared to be more efficient, but nevertheless we found excellent agreement, as most OVO-HA peaks were also found in the OVO-GFP dataset. The OVO-GFP ChIP dataset had 7235 significant ChIP peaks according to peak enrichment analysis genome-wide, while OVO-HA ChIP dataset had 3393 significant peaks genome-wide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To determine the similarity in significant peak calling between the two datasets, we calculated a Jaccard index (intersection/union) between the significantly enriched peaks from the tagged <italic>ovo</italic> allele bearing ovaries. The Jaccard index between OVO-HA and OVO-GFP ChIP peaks was 0.64 (where 0=no overlap and 1=full overlap) with a total of 3094 ChIP peaks overlapping. Thus, almost all significant OVO-HA ChIP peaks were also found within the OVO-GFP ChIP dataset (91% of OVO-HA peaks overlapped OVO-GFP peaks). OVO-GFP pulldown was either more effective, or less likely, promiscuous. Regardless, we decided to use the conservative intersection of the two datasets (3094 peaks) for downstream OVO occupancy informatics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>OVO is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, but many transcription factors also have a more general affinity for DNA. Additionally, immunoprecipitation can capture indirect interactions due to nuclear topology in addition to direct sequence-specific binding. For example, in the particular case of OVO TSS binding, this could be direct, as shown in the case of <italic>ovo</italic> and <italic>otu</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>), or could be due to looping of an OVO-bound enhancer to the core promoter. Determining if there are canonical OVO-binding sites at peaks can help to distinguish direct and indirect binding. If OVO is directly binding to the TSS, we would expect to find OVO binding site enrichment at that location. To examine the sequences enriched in peaks, we looked directly for the known OVO-binding sites previously defined by footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>) and SELEX-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Garfinkel, 2000</xref>). We also did de novo motif finding on this substantial dataset to refine the sequence-specific motifs bound by OVO and perhaps other motifs associated with other transcription factors preferentially bound by OVO enhancers, or OVO proximal sites in 3D nuclear space. We performed novel motif enrichment analysis using STREME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey, 2021</xref>) with our overlapping ChIP peaks and found a number of significant motifs within our dataset. The most significant motif, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAACGGTAAA</named-content>-3’, was found in 49% of significant OVO ChIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, ‘Motif One’). This motif is highly similar to the OVO DNA binding motif that has been reported twice before, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGTAACNGT</named-content>-3’ (SELEX method, ‘Garfinkel OVO Motif’) and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGTAACNGT</named-content>-3’ (Footprinting method, ‘Oliver OVO Motif’). The only differences between motif one in our dataset and the literature, is that the de novo motif is two nucleotides shorter than the previously described motifs at the 5’ end, extends 3 nucleotides downstream, and includes a second G near the 3’-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, this is strong evidence that the core OVO-binding sequence is 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAACNGT</named-content>-3’. Some binding sites can be recognized by multiple transcription factors. To determine if other characterized transcription factors recognize this sequence, we searched for significant matches to motif one in the Jaspar database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castro-Mondragon et al., 2022</xref>) of known <italic>Drosophila</italic> motifs using Tomtom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>). The OVO DNA binding motif (‘Garfinkel OVO Motif’) was scored as a significant match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Along with the OVO DNA binding motif, other motifs were also significantly enriched in OVO ChIP peaks. The motif 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GWGMGAGMGAGABRG</named-content>-3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) was found in 18% of OVO ChIP peaks and is a significant match to the DNA binding motifs of the transcription factors GAF (<italic>Trl</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Omelina et al., 2011</xref>) and CLAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soruco et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Trl</italic> germline clones are not viable, indicating that GAF activity is required in the germline during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The possibility that OVO binds with and regulates genes alongside of GAF given the enrichment of both transcription factors DNA binding motifs is intriguing. Other significantly enriched motifs 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ACACACACACACACA</named-content>-3’ (29% of peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">RCAACAACAACAACA</named-content>-3’ (26% of peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAAGAAGAAGAAGAR</named-content>-3’ (17% of peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) were present in OVO ChIP peaks, however, these motifs did not significantly match known DNA binding motifs of other transcription factors. Determining the factors that bind to these sequences will certainly help elucidate our understanding of transcriptional control with relationship to OVO in the female germline.</p><p>Not every peak region had one of the consensus OVO DNA binding motifs. This does not mean a priori that they bound OVO indirectly. Motif enrichment can be driven by a few strongly enriched sequences, so that more minor enrichments of variants are missed. Therefore, we carefully examined the 51% of our overlapping OVO ChIP peaks where OVO DNA binding motif one was not found. This second round of de novo analysis revealed enrichment of OVO DNA binding motif derivatives. For example, the third most significant motif (found in 37% of peaks) was 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">RWMTAACGGV</named-content>-3’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, motif two). This motif had the core 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAACNGT</named-content>-3’ sequence found in all three aforementioned methods, however, the last nucleotide in the core sequence is unspecific and lacks the three 3’ nucleotides found in motif one. Two other derivative motifs, 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAACTGTTTT</named-content>-3’ (found in 17% of sequences, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, motif three), and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTACSGTAA</named-content>-3’ (found in 5% of sequences, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, motif four), vary within the central core motif (at positions 5 and 2 of the core sequence, respectively) and upstream and downstream ends. Searching for all variations of the OVO DNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) within our significant overlapping ChIP peaks indicated that 72% of peaks contained at least one variation of these four binding motifs. It is a reasonable hypothesis that OVO peaks are most often due to direct, rather than indirect OVO binding.</p><p>A prediction for direct OVO binding to motifs, is that the motif should be centered within the peak of fragmented input DNA sequences. Therefore, we plotted the significant ChIP (minus input) read density centered on the location of the motif. We found that the read density for all ChIP peaks that contain each one of the de novo OVO motifs, as well as the in vitro OVO motifs, are centered over the motif location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This suggests that all of these motifs from our analysis are bonafide OVO DNA binding sites in vivo. While it is possible that OVO comes into contact with regions of DNA in three-dimensional nuclear space non-specifically, the presence of OVO motifs within a large percentage of significant ChIP peaks in vivo and enrichment of OVO ChIP read density at the location of the motifs, strongly reinforces the idea that our OVO ChIP dataset contains regions centered on sequences specifically bound by OVO in the ovary.</p><p>Given the clear function of OVO occupancy near the TSS of its two known targets, <italic>ovo</italic> and <italic>otu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>), we were interested in determining if OVO peaks are generally near the TSS of other target genes as well. In addition to informing the biology of OVO function, this simplifies the problem of associating peaks to potential functional target genes. As a preliminary test of this idea, we determined if the fully overlapping OVO-HA and OVO-GFP peaks were spatially enriched with respect to the currently annotated gene model elements such as TSS, openreading frames (ORFs), or transcription termination sequences (TTS). If the TSS association of OVO at the two known targets reflects a general propensity then we expect OVO ChIP peaks to be more closely associated with TSS than other gene elements. To carry out this analysis, we normalized the genome for these three gene elements, such that the distance between adjacent loci was 1. If there is no enrichment for OVO peaks to a specific gene element then the peak location would have an equal frequency from 0.0 to 0.5 relative distance. Measuring the relative distance of our OVO ChIP peaks to TSS, ORFs, and TTS, showed that the OVO binding was highly enriched near TSS/promoter locations and was not correlated with ORF and TTS locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results confirmed that OVO is characterized by core promoter proximal binding. Since OVO ChIP peaks as a class are associated with TSS, we plotted the ChIP minus input read density of genes that overlap significant ChIP peaks to examine the full distribution. We found that the OVO ChIP read density was highly enriched over the TSS and was not due to a few highly enriched examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This builds on the idea that OVO is binding directly over, or in close proximity to the TSS of its target genes genome-wide. In other words, the previous work showing OVO binding the <italic>ovo-B</italic> and <italic>otu</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>) is typical. This very specific binding of OVO to the TSS is intriguing and unusual, as this region associates with the basal transcriptional machinery. It raises the possibility that OVO is not a typical transcription factor that acts primarily via enhancer binding but might be part of the core promoter binding complex or acts to precondition the core promoter region for example.</p><p>Although OVO ChIP peaks overlapping genes showed a strong read density enrichment over the TSS, we found that only 45% (1394/3094) of OVO ChIP peaks directly overlapped a TSS. 43% (1339/3094) of OVO ChIP peaks were found to overlap the gene body downstream of the TSS (intronic and exonic sequences) and 12% (366/3094) did not overlap any gene elements, indicating that they were intergenic. We were interested in the differences between OVO binding directly over the TSS or at more distal upstream and downstream sites. We decided to plot the OVO ChIP read density of these different classes of OVO-binding patterns and found that OVO bound over the TSS produced a sharp read density enrichment over the TSS which was consistent with what was found for all OVO-bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). OVO binding along the gene body surprisingly also showed a read density enrichment over the TSS, although the magnitude of read density enrichment was notably less than TSS OVO binding. Intergenic OVO binding also showed these same characteristics with a notable upstream read density enrichment possibly indicative of enhancer binding. This indicates that although the significantly called OVO ChIP peaks did not overlap the TSS, there was still a propensity for TSS sequences to be enriched with OVO ChIP over the input control. This could be due to weaker direct in vivo binding of OVO to these TSSs or indirect interactions between the upstream/downstream OVO bound sequences and the TSS, possibly through a looping enhancer-promoter interaction. However, regardless of the location of the OVO ChIP peak, OVO seemed to always be enriched at or in close proximity to TSSs.</p><p>The OVO ChIP read density was highly enriched over the annotated TSS of target genes, but TSS annotation is challenging and can be tissue specific. We were interested in empirically determining if the same enrichment was present in TSSs utilized specifically in ovarian tissue. The 5’ ends of mRNA are capped. In order to determine where these caps mapped to the genome, we analyzed Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE-seq) data from adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and extracted the dominant significant TSSs in the ovary. CAGEr predicted 6,856 significant TSSs in the ovary dataset, of which 1047 overlapped with OVO ChIP peaks. We plotted the OVO ChIP minus input read density centered on the significant ovary CAGE-seq TSSs for TSSs that overlapped or did not overlap OVO ChIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We found that OVO ChIP read density was highly enriched over the location of TSSs from ovary CAGE-seq that overlapped OVO ChIP peaks when compared to TSSs that did not overlap OVO ChIP peaks. Thus, OVO TSS binding is not due to poor annotation of ovarian TTSs. Furthermore, OVO is binding at or near TSSs of genes actively being transcribed in the ovary.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OVO binding is associated with open chromatin and transcriptionally active histone marks</title><p>Our OVO ChIP data indicated that OVO was binding at or in close proximity to promoters genome-wide. OVO could have a positive and/or negative effect on transcription at these locations. For example, OVO could help recruit or sterically hinder RNA polymerase binding to TSSs. However, previous <italic>ovo</italic> reporter constructs show positive effects of OVO binding near TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>). If OVO binding is generally promoting transcription then we hypothesize that it would be more closely associated with histone marks associated with active transcription, such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3, as well as lower nucleosome density that can be measured through ATAC-seq. In contrast, OVO binding would be expected to negatively correlate with repressive H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks and higher nucleosome density. It is technically difficult to determine changes in chromatin status and transcription in germ cells that lack OVO, as the phenotype is cell death (although we will return to this later for transcription profiling) but analyzing OVO binding in the context of ovarian chromatin was highly informative.</p><p>Recent work profiling nucleosome density and histone marks have shown that female GSCs have a ‘ground state’ chromatin profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>), similar to the histone mark profiles that are found in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>). This has been characterized to contain non-canonical H3K27me3 profiles and low H3K9me3 histone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>). As egg follicles differentiate, nurse cells begin to accumulate H3K9me3 marks, and H3K27me3 histone marks begin to accumulate over more traditional polycomb domains. This in turn leads to a decrease in the number of open chromatin peaks as well as H3K27ac histone marks, which are generally associated with active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>). Essentially, these data support the idea that egg chambers restrict gene expression competency as they differentiate.</p><p>In order to determine the relationship in our OVO ChIP data and other chromatin marks, we analyzed GSC H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K4me3, and ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>) with the same parameters used to establish significant OVO peaks in our OVO ChIP dataset. Our OVO ChIP data was from one day old ovaries, and we did not profile specific follicle stages. So we also analyzed 32 c (roughly stage 5 egg chambers) H3K27ac, H3K27me3, ATAC-seq, and 8 c H3K9me3 (32 c was not available) histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>) to see if there were any stage specific differences in comparison to OVO DNA binding. We focused specifically on GSC and 32 c egg follicles for these chromatin marks since that is when the <italic>ovo</italic> hypomorphic egg chambers arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). We first plotted the read density of each respective chromatin mark minus their input control centered on either the OVO ChIP peak local maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or OVO DNA binding motifs contained within significant OVO ChIP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

GSC H3K4me3 read density was, to a lesser extent, also enriched with OVO ChIP peak maximums and OVO DNA binding motifs. However, there was no read density enrichment for repressive GSC H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 histone marks. The same findings generally held true when looking at the overlap of OVO ChIP peaks and chromatin marks in differentiating egg chambers. Notably, there was an even higher read density enrichment over OVO ChIP peak maximum and DNA binding motifs for 32 c ATAC-seq data, while read density enrichment decreased for 32 C H3K27ac histone mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>OVO DNA binding is associated with open chromatin and transcriptionally active histone marks.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) OVO ChIP minus input control, GSC and 32 c ATAC-seq, GSC H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, 8 c NC H3K9me3, 32 c NC H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq read coverage density centered on each OVO peak maximum or OVO DNA binding motif located within a significant OVO ChIP peak.

To do this, we measured the relative distance of OVO ChIP peaks to the same datasets described above. We found that OVO ChIP peaks had a lower relative distance, and thus were spatially overlapping/closer in the genome, to 32 c NC ATAC, GSC ATAC, GSC H3K27ac, GSC H3K4me3, and 32 c NC H3K27ac peaks, in that order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While the relative distance between OVO ChIP peaks and H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, regardless of stage, showed no spatial association. There was also further support for this association with transcriptionally active histone marks/open chromatin when measuring the overlap between significant OVO ChIP peaks and the respective significant histone ChIP and ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A Fisher’s exact test indicated a significant enrichment in overlapping peaks genome-wide between OVO and GSC ATAC (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 75.9), 32 c NC ATAC (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = Infinite), GSC H3K27ac (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 31.7), GSC H3K4me3 (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 12.0), and 32 c NC H3K27ac (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 7.9) peaks. While there was a significant depletion in overlapping peaks genome-wide between OVO and 32 c NC H3K27me3 (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 0.6), GSC H3K9me3 (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 0.7), and 8 c NC H3K9me3 (p&lt;0.001, odds ratio = 0.5).</p><p>The association of OVO binding with active histone marks and open chromatin was striking, but open chromatin is likely a general phenomenon of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haines and Eisen, 2018</xref>). Indeed, when measuring the read density for GSC and 32 C ATAC-seq for OVO bound and OVO non-bound promoters, there is an enrichment for open chromatin at the TSS regardless of OVO binding. However, we did notice an increase in enrichment for OVO-bound promoters compared to OVO non-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), possibly suggesting that OVO-bound promoters are more open or have an increase in accessibility when compared to non-OVO bound promoters. This same relationship held true for the transcriptionally active histone mark H3K27ac in GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Since only 45% of OVO ChIP peaks overlapped TSSs, we plotted the read density of the above chromatin marks over OVO ChIP peak maximums for OVO bound over the TSS, gene body, or intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We found that OVO-bound regions that were not overlapping the TSS still showed the same propensity for enrichment of open chromatin and active histone marks. Intergenic regions were especially enriched for open chromatin measured through ATAC-seq. Altogether suggesting that OVO binding genome-wide is tightly associated with open chromatin regardless of germ cell stage, and active transcription in GSCs. In other words, chromatin state data suggests OVO is acting positively on its target genes and raises the possibility that OVO-binding and open chromatin are related.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>OVO DNA binding motifs are evenly distributed around promoters and are enriched for INR, DPE, and MTE elements</title><p>Our data thus far clearly indicates that OVO binding occurs at or very near the core promoter, a region recognized by an enormous collection of factors that associate with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyagi and Wassarman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngoc et al., 2019</xref>). The highly organized polymerase complex has sequence-specific DNA recognition sites with incredibly precise spacing between them, with an overall DNA footprint of a little less than 100 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rice et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohler et al., 2002</xref>). There are upstream binding sites such as TATA, sites at transcription start, such as the initiator (INR), and downstream promoter elements (DPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngoc et al., 2019</xref>). The combinations of these DNA motifs is not random in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>), and distinct combinations of different motifs at the TSS of genes expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are conserved over tens of millions of years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).

It is possible that OVO is a female germline specific TATA-associated factor, and if so, OVO-binding sites at core promoters should share precise spacing with other core promoter elements, suggesting it is likely part of the complex. If not, then OVO is more likely to facilitate binding of the basal transcriptional machinery. Because of the extended footprint of engaged RNA polymerase, OVO and the basal machinery would not be likely to occupy the same region at the same time.</p><p>Like OVO ChIP peaks, OVO DNA binding motifs were highly enriched at or near the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This could represent a functional class of promoters utilized for gene expression in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. Importantly, the distribution of OVO DNA binding motifs in ovary promoters is not fixed relative to TSSs or other core promoter elements. Thus, it is highly unlikely that OVO acts as a female germline RNA polymerase complex member that anchors the complex to the core promoter and helps determine the + 1 mRNA nucleotide. Rather, the imprecise location of OVO-binding sites might suggest that OVO is more likely to facilitate the binding of other basal transcriptional factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>OVO activates gene expression in the female germline</title><p>Occupancy is a requirement for activity, but occupancy does not equal activity. Understanding the transcriptional consequences of OVO occupancy genome-wide would allow us to investigate mechanisms. However, as we mentioned earlier, the fact that <italic>ovo</italic> is absolutely required for female germline viability greatly complicates this analysis. Measuring gene expression in dead or dying germ cells was unlikely to be informative. Previous work from our lab has identified a transheterozygous <italic>ovo</italic> allelic combination (<italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup></italic>) that greatly reduces OVO activity resulting in sterility, however, female germ cells are able to survive up until at least stage 5 of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic> is a CRISPR/Cas9 derived T2A-GAL4-3xSTOP insertion upstream of the splice junction of exon 3 in the <italic>ovo-RA</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this insertion in the extended exon 3 would disrupt roughly 90% of the <italic>ovo-B</italic> transcripts. However, since about 10% of <italic>ovo-B</italic> transcripts utilize an upstream splice junction in exon 3, these transcripts would not be disrupted with the T2A-GAL4-3xSTOP insertion and thus allow for enough OVO activity for germ cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>).

The adult female ovary contains somatic cells, germline stem cells, and germline derived nurse cells that would be profiled in a bulk ovary tissue RNA-seq experiment. Although OVO is only required and expressed in germline derived cell types, we chose to dissect 1-day-old post-eclosion <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> female ovaries to enrich for early stages of oogenesis and collected only ovarioles containing the germarium through previtellogenic egg chambers. <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-GFP</italic> ovaries were collected at the same age post-eclosion and we specifically collected ovaries that contained a visible ovariole structure (and therefore contained germ cells) to minimize comparing germ cells to somatic ovary structures, but rather germ cells to germ cells. We then performed RNA-seq in quadruplicate and measured the changes in gene expression between ectopic rescue OVO and hypomorphic OVO ovaries. We used a significance level of p-adj &lt;0.05 and a log2 fold change cutoff of &gt;|0.5| to call differential expression between these two sets of ovaries. We utilized these log2 fold change cutoffs for two reasons. Our control ovary genotype (<italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-GFP</italic>) has hypomorphic OVO activity, hence germ cells can survive but are arrested. With the addition of ectopic rescue OVO in <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> ovaries, we predicted that genes that were directly regulated by OVO would transcriptionally respond, however, we were unsure as to what degree the response would be in comparison to hypomorphic OVO. We reasoned that if the changes were not significant between genotypes, then minor changes in gene expression would not matter. Our second reason for using these cutoffs is we had an internal control between the two genotypes. We knew through immunostaining that Vas protein was present in the germline of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) and therefore was likely expressed at similar levels in the germline of both genotypes. Both genotypes also expressed <italic>GAL4</italic> under the control of <italic>ovo</italic> in the germline. We examined the expression levels of <italic>vas</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic> and found that <italic>vas</italic> had a log2 fold change of 0.15 (p-adj=0.03) and <italic>GAL4</italic> had a log2 fold change of 0.33 (p-adj=0.18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data suggest a slight underrepresentation of germline expression in <italic>ovo</italic> hypomorphic ovaries. Therefore, by using the greater than 0.5 and less than –0.5 log2 fold change cutoffs, and a less than 0.05 p-adj value cutoff, we would be conservative to not call genes differentially expressed due to differences in the relative abundance of germ cells and somatic cells.</p><p>We were able to reliably detect the expression of 10,804 genes in these early ovarioles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The differential expression analysis indicated that 1994 genes primarily expressed in the germline (see next paragraph) significantly increased in expression with ectopic rescue OVO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, cyan/purple dots) and 2924 genes primarily expressed in the soma (see next paragraph) significantly decreased in expression with ectopic rescue OVO expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, yellow/blue dots). A total of 5886 genes were not considered to be differentially expressed in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, gray dots). OVO is expressed in the germline, not the soma, and previous work has shown that OVO-B is a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2000</xref>), so we hypothesized that many of the genes increasing in expression in the presence of rescuing OVO were direct downstream targets. We found that 2,298 genes that were expressed in our RNA-seq data overlapped an OVO ChIP peak. 666 genes significantly increased in expression and were bound by OVO, which is a significant enrichment according to a Fisher’s exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, cyan dots, p&lt;0.01, odds ratio = 2.21). While conversely, 564 genes decreased in expression and were bound by OVO, indicating a significant depletion according to a Fisher’s exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, blue dots, p&lt;0.01, odds ratio = 0.85). This strongly suggests that genes that are bound by OVO, transcriptionally respond in a positive manner. This finding is fully consistent with our meta-analysis comparing OVO ChIP-seq and histone ChIP/ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). OVO binding was highly associated with transcriptionally active histone marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3, open chromatin, and increased expression.</p><p>There are genes that showed decreased expression in the OVO rescued ovaries, but we believe this is technical rather than biological. OVO is expressed only in the germline, but ovarioles contain germ cells and somatic cells. The presence of empty ovarioles, containing leftover strings of somatic cells, are evident even in <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-GFP</italic> ovaries that contain germ cells. Conversely, <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> ovaries are fully rescued, and therefore possess more germ cell containing ovarioles than <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-GFP</italic> ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). Despite our best efforts to dissect individual ovarioles with a full complement of germ cells and egg chambers, we wondered if there might be fewer germ cells and egg chambers in the <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-GFP</italic> ovaries. To confirm that genes increasing in expression in ectopic rescue OVO were germline derived, we cross-referenced the significantly expressed genes in our RNA-seq datasets with the modENCODE developmental RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graveley, 2010</xref>). We extracted the gene names of all genes that were considered to be ‘moderately expressed’ in 0–2 hr old embryos, which are produced during oogenesis and are deposited into the early embryo. We found that 71% of genes (1409/1994) that had a significant increase in expression in the presence of ectopic rescue OVO were found to be expressed in 0–2 hr old embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, green dots), while only 21% of genes (625/2,924) that had a significant decrease in expression were found in the same embryo dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, yellow dots). A total of 3448 genes from the 0–2 hr-old embryo dataset were not differentially expressed in our RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, purple dots). A Fisher’s exact test confirmed that there was a significant enrichment for genes that significantly increased in expression and were present in 0–2 hr old embryos (p&lt;0.01, odds ratio = 2.8). In comparison, there was a significant depletion for genes that significantly decreased in expression and were present in 0–2 hr old embryos (p&lt;0.01, odds ratio = 0.17). This result indicated that genes that significantly increased in expression were more likely to be expressed in the germline and that the presence of ectopic rescue OVO significantly increased the expression of genes that were maternally deposited in the early embryo. While the set of genes that significantly decrease in expression are not enriched in the embryo and are more likely specific to somatic cell gene expression. These genes are unlikely to be direct OVO targets due to the absence of OVO in those cells, although we certainly cannot rule out the possibility of a non-autonomous effect of OVO on somatic gene expression. In terms of the germline proper, OVO appears to be a positively acting transcription factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>OVO positively regulates essential oogenesis genes</title><p>We wanted to examine a subset of the OVO target genes in detail, and began with the known OVO targets, <italic>ovo</italic> itself and <italic>otu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>). Since the relationship between OVO binding to these two genes has been well-characterized, we validated the OVO ChIP, histone ChIP/ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq datasets by examining these two genes first. Since OVO positively regulates the expression of both these genes, then we would expect OVO to be physically bound at OVO motifs required for high transcription, the presence of transcriptionally active histone marks and open chromatin at these loci, as well as a positive transcriptional response in the presence of rescuing OVO-B. This is exactly what we observed. A significant OVO ChIP peak was found overlapping the TSS of <italic>ovo-B</italic>, with four significant OVO DNA binding motifs present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). ATAC-seq, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 peaks overlapped the <italic>ovo</italic> promoter. Transcriptionally, <italic>ovo</italic> RNA-seq reads are likely derived from the <italic>UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> cDNA rescue or are indistinguishable between the genomic locus and rescuing cDNA transgene. We found a non-significant increase in exon 3 to exon 4 intronic <italic>ovo</italic> reads with the expression of ectopic rescue OVO (log2 fold change = 0.76, p-adj=0.26). These intronic reads would be derived from the endogenous <italic>ovo</italic> locus, but it is difficult to conclusively determine if the endogenous <italic>ovo</italic> locus would respond transcriptionally to ectopic OVO downstream of <italic>UASp</italic> (for example, the pathway for <italic>ovo</italic> is no longer autoregulatory in <italic>ovo<sup>ovo-GAL4</sup></italic>/<italic>ovo<sup>ΔBP</sup>; UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> germ cells, there is an additional GAL4 &gt;<italic>UASp</italic> activation step).

However, when looking at the <italic>otu</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we found OVO occupancy over the TSS of both annotated <italic>otu</italic> promoters, with significant OVO DNA binding motifs overlapping and in close proximity to the TSSs. The <italic>otu</italic> locus contained similar ATAC-seq and activating histone mark peaks overlapping the TSS found at the <italic>ovo</italic> locus. It was also evident that <italic>otu</italic> had a positive transcriptional response to the presence of OVO rescue (log2 fold change = 2.41; p-adj &lt;0.001).

These genes are significant because they constitute a set of genes that are expressed in the germline and the encoded proteins are eventually incorporated into the vitelline membrane providing the structural integrity and impermeability of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mineo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ventura et al., 2010</xref>).

OVO has also been found to be eternally present in the female germline, attesting to its likely continual requirement for female germ cell viability and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benner et al., 2023</xref>). Our work here significantly expands our knowledge on OVO function in the female germline, showing that OVO binds and positively regulates a large array of genes required to build an egg and pattern the resulting embryo after fertilization. OVO accomplishes this by directly binding to the promoters of its targets, as well as more distant sites that could represent enhancers. Altogether, we suggest that OVO is a master transcriptional regulator coordinating a number of essential maternal pathways involved in oocyte and early embryonic development. Hints of these functions can be found in the hypomorphic and antimorphic <italic>ovo</italic> alleles which show egg chamber arrest, ventralized eggs, and permeable vitelline membranes. It is clear that OVO is required to activate multiple pathways involved in oocyte and early embryonic development.</p><p>The GO term enrichment analysis on genes that were bound by OVO and transcriptionally responded to OVO surprisingly indicated a large degree of overlap in oocyte and early embryonic developmental pathways. Also, OVO seemed to reinforce these pathways at multiple key genes within each pathway.

A similar story was found for genes such as <italic>cup</italic>, <italic>Me31b</italic>, <italic>bru1</italic>, and <italic>orb</italic>, indicating that OVO controls a battery of genes involved in the positive regulation of RNA binding proteins that negatively regulate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lasko, 2012</xref>). OVO also bound and positively regulated a number of posterior and germ plasm specification genes such as <italic>osk</italic>, <italic>nos</italic>, <italic>aub</italic>, <italic>gcl</italic>, and <italic>pgc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lasko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahowald, 2001</xref>). Given this plethora of famous maternal effect loci, it might be tempting to suggest that OVO is sufficient for egg production, but there are important exceptions. For example, other important germ plasm factors such as <italic>staufen</italic> and <italic>tudor</italic> were not bound by or transcriptionally responsive to OVO. This observation suggest that other transcription factors are responsible for regulating these genes.</p><p>OVO binds in close proximity to the TSS of genes it positively regulates; however, it is still unclear precisely how it regulates gene expression. The possibilities include integration into the RNA polymerase complex itself, a short distance sigma factor like function, a core promoter conditioning function (pioneering), and/or garden variety transcription factor. Although active core promoters specifically in the ovary are enriched for OVO DNA binding motifs, we did not find a strict spatial orientation for these motifs in relation to the TSS, such as is found with other DNA elements such as INR, DPE, and MTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim et al., 2004</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that OVO is a core component of the RNA polymerase complex in the female germline. This suggests that it is unlikely to be analogous to male specific TATA-associated factors that have been shown to activate gene expression in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore possible, and previously well supported, that OVO is an activator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>). One aspect of OVO DNA binding that showed differences with stage-specific histone ChIP and ATAC-seq, was OVO’s strong association with open chromatin. The role of repressors of transcription such as the polycomb complex, <italic>egg</italic>, <italic>wde</italic>, and <italic>Su(var)205</italic> in restricting gene expression through promoting heterochromatin formation in differentiating egg chambers is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLuca et al., 2020</xref>). OVO might ensure that the chromatin status of maternally expressed genes remains open. Evidence from our work points to OVO fulfilling that role.</p><p>In GSCs, OVO ChIP peaks largely overlap open chromatin and transcriptionally active histone marks. However, in stage 5 egg chambers, there was an even higher degree of association with open chromatin (almost all OVO ChIP peaks overlapped ATAC-seq peaks), while the significant association with H3K27ac marks was greatly reduced. This difference is likely significant. As GSCs differentiate they accumulate repressive chromatin marks while the number of ATAC-seq and H3K27ac peaks are reduced. This increase in association with open chromatin and OVO binding, even as the amount of open chromatin is reduced throughout egg chamber differentiation, might indicate that OVO binding helps to maintain chromatin accessibility, even when the locus in question is no longer actively transcribed. The loss of histone marks of active transcription at OVO-bound open chromatin in later differentiating egg chambers might mean that OVO does not influence the transcriptional potential of target genes as strongly as it influences the chromatin status in this second phase. Therefore, OVO might be more similar in function to pioneer factors/chromatin remodelers than it is to a transcription factor that is only involved in activating transcription.</p><p>The requirement for OVO at the TSS of target genes has been well characterized at its own locus as well as its downstream target <italic>otu</italic>. Our OVO ChIP and expression data confirm findings from previous work that OVO is binding to these target promoters, and in the case of <italic>otu</italic>, strongly responds transcriptionally to the presence of OVO. Although we did not test the requirement for OVO DNA binding motifs at other OVO-bound genes in this work, this has been extensively explored before, showing that removal of OVO DNA binding sites overlapping the TSS results in a strong decrease in reporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lü et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lü and Oliver, 2001</xref>). Removal of more distal upstream OVO DNA binding sites also reduces reporter expression to a lesser degree. However, for most cases tested, removal of OVO DNA binding sites while leaving the rest of the enhancer regions intact, never totally abolished reporter expression. These dynamics are highly similar to work that has been completed on the pioneer factor <italic>zelda</italic> (<italic>zld</italic>). Adding <italic>zld</italic> DNA binding motifs to a stochastically expressed transcriptional reporter increases the activity and response of the reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dufourt et al., 2018</xref>). Distally located <italic>zld</italic> DNA binding motifs influenced reporter expression to a lesser degree than proximal sites. A single <italic>zld</italic> DNA binding site adjacent to the TSS produced the strongest reporter activity. Importantly, just like the activity of OVO transgenic reporters, there is not an absolute requirement for <italic>zld</italic> DNA binding to activate reporter expression; however, the addition of TSS adjacent <italic>zld</italic> DNA binding motifs does strongly influence reporter response. We know that <italic>zld</italic> achieves this reporter response through its pioneering activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>), whether OVO achieves this similar effect on gene expression through a shared mechanism, or in cooperation with other transcription factors needs to be further explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All reagents used in this study can be found in the FlyBase recommended supplementary ART table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>All fly crosses were conducted at 25 °C with 65% relative humidity and constant light unless otherwise noted.

It was a tough decision on how to break up all the work we had completed on <italic>ovo</italic> to date. In our opinion, it was too much to put everything into a single manuscript unless we wanted a manuscript length supplement (we were also worried that supplemental data is often overlooked and sometimes poorly reviewed). We therefore decided to split the work into a developmental localization/characterization paper and a functional genomics paper. As it stands both papers are long. Certainly, readers of this manuscript will benefit from reading our previous OVO paper, which we submitted before this one. The earlier manuscript is under revision at another journal and we hope that this improved manuscript will be published and accessible shortly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Benner et al. interrogate the transcriptional regulator OVO to identify its targets in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline. The authors perform ChIP-seq in the adult ovary and identify established as well as novel OVO binding motifs in potential transcriptional targets of OVO. Through additional bioinformatic analysis of existing ATAC-seq, CAGE-seq, and histone methylation data, the authors confirm previous reports that OVO is enriched at transcription start sites and suggest that OVO does not act as part of the core RNA polymerase complex. Benner et al. then perform bulk RNA-seq in OVO mutant and &quot;wildtype&quot; (GAL4 mediated expression of OVO under the control of the ovo promoter in OVO mutants) ovaries to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the presence of OVO. This analysis supports previous reports that OVO likely acts at transcription start sites as a transcriptional activator. While the authors propose that OVO activates the expression of genes that are important for egg integrity, maturation, and for embryonic development (nanos, gcl, pgc, bicoid), this hypothesis is based on correlation and is not supported by in vivo analysis of the respective OVO binding sites in some of the key genes. A temporal resolution for OVO's role during germline development and egg chamber maturation in the ovary is also missing. Together, this manuscript contains relevant ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets of OVO targets in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary alongside thorough bioinformatic analysis but lacks important in vivo experimental evidence that would validate the high-quality datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for the appreciation of the genomics data and analysis. Some of the suggested in vivo experiments are clear next steps, which are well underway. These are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>Temporal analysis of <italic>ovo</italic> function in egg chamber development is not easy, as only the weakest <italic>ovo</italic> alleles have any egg chambers to examine. However, we will also point out the long-known phenotypes of some of those weak alleles in the text (e.g. ventralized chambers in ovoD3/+). We will need better tools for precise rescue/degradation during egg chamber maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript contains relevant ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets of OVO targets in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary alongside thorough bioinformatic analysis</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We went to great lengths to do our highly replicated experiments in multiple ways (e.g. independent pull-down tags) and spent considerable time coming up with an optimized and robust informatic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors propose that OVO acts as a positive regulator of essential germline genes, such as those necessary for egg integrity/maturation and embryonic/germline development. Much of this hypothesis is based on GO term analysis (and supported by the authors' ChIP-seq data). However accurate interpretation of GO term enrichment is highly dependent on using the correct background gene set. What control gene set did the authors use to perform GO term analysis (the information was not in the materials and methods)? If a background gene set was not previously specified, it is essential to perform the analysis with the appropriate background gene set. For this analysis, the total set of genes that were identified in the authors' RNA-seq of OVO-positive ovaries would be an ideal control gene set for which to perform GO term analysis. Alternatively, the total set of genes identified in previous scRNA-seq analysis of ovaries (see Rust et al., 2020, Slaidina et al., 2021 among others) would also be an appropriate control gene set for which to perform GO term analysis. If indeed GO term analysis of the genes bound by OVO compared to all genes expressed in the ovary still produces an enrichment of genes essential for embryonic development and egg integrity, then this hypothesis can be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that this work on OVO as a positive regulator of genes like <italic>bcd</italic>, <italic>osk</italic>, <italic>nos</italic>, <italic>png</italic>, <italic>gnu</italic>, <italic>plu</italic>, etc., is closer to a demonstration than a proposition. These are textbook examples of genes required for egg and early embryonic development. Hopefully, this is not lost on the readers by an over-reliance on GO term analysis, which is required but not always useful in genome-wide studies.</p><p>We used GO term enrichment analysis as a tool to help focus the story on some major pathways that OVO is regulating. To the specific criticism of the reference gene-set, GO term enrichment analysis in this work is robust to gene background set. We will update the GO term enrichment analysis text to indicate this fact and add a table using expressed genes in our RNA-seq dataset to the manuscript and clarify gene set robustness in greater detail in the methods of the revision. We will also try to focus the reader’s attention on the actual target genes rather than the GO terms in the revised text.</p><p>We have updated the GO term analysis by including all the expressed genes in our RNA-seq datasets as a background control. Figure 6 has been updated to include the significant GO terms. We have outlined changes in the methods section below.</p><p>Lines 794-801:</p><p>“Gene ontology enrichment analysis was completed with g:Profiler’s g:GOSt software (Raudvere et al. 2019) on the set of genes overlapping OVO ChIP peaks over the TSS and significantly upregulated in the presence of ectopic OVO (525 genes in total). All genes that were considered to be expressed in our RNA-seq datasets were used as a background control (10,801 genes in total). Default parameters were used for the enrichment analysis except for ‘statistical domain scope’ was set to ‘custom’ (our control background genes were uploaded here), ‘significance threshold’ was set to ‘Bonferroni correction’, and only GO biological process terms were searched for enrichment with the gene list. The GO terms listed in Figure 6 represent the 24 smallest GO term sizes according to Table S5.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors provide important bioinformatic analysis of new and existing datasets that suggest OVO binds to specific motifs in the promoter regions of certain germline genes. While the bioinformatic analysis of these data is thorough and appropriate, the authors do not perform any in vivo validation of these datasets to support their hypotheses. The authors should choose a few important potential OVO targets based on their analysis, such as gcl, nanos, or bicoid (as these genes have well-studied phenotypes in embryogenesis), and perform functional analysis of the OVO binding site in their promoter regions. This may include creating CRISPR lines that do not contain the OVO binding site in the target gene promoter, or reporter lines with and without the OVO binding site, to test if OVO binding is essential for the transcription/function of the candidate genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Exploring mechanism using in vivo phenotypic assays is awesome, so this is a very good suggestion. But, it is not essential for this work -- as has been pointed out in the reviews, in vivo validation of OVO binding sites has been comprehensively done for two target genes, <italic>ovo</italic> and <italic>otu</italic>. The “rules” appear similar for both genes. That said, we are already following up specific OVO target genes and the detailed mechanism of OVO function at the core promoter. We removed some of our preliminary in vivo figures from the already long current manuscript. We continue to work on OVO and expect to include this type of analysis in a new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors perform de novo motif analysis to identify novel OVO binding motifs in their ChIP-seq dataset. Motif analysis can be significantly strengthened by comparing DNA sequences within peaks, to sequences that are just outside of peak regions, thereby generating motifs that are specific to peak regions compared to other regions of the promoter/genome. For example, taking the 200 nt sequence on either side of an OVO peak could be used as a negative control sequence set. What control sequence set did the authors use as for their de novo motif analysis? More detail on this is necessary in the materials and methods section. Re-analysis with an appropriate negative control sequence set is suggested if not previously performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear on negative sequence controls in the methods. We used shuffled OVO ChIP-seq peak sequences as the background for the de novo motif analysis, which we will better outline in the methods of the revision. This is a superior background set of sequences as it exactly balances GC content in the query and background sequences. We are not fond of the idea of using adjacent DNA that won’t be controlled for GC content and shadow motifs. Furthermore, the de novo OVO DNA binding motifs are clear, statistically significant variants of the characterized in vitro OVO DNA binding motifs previously identified (Lu et al., 1998; Lee and Garfinkel, 2000; Bielinska et al., 2005), which lends considerable confidence. We also show that the OVO ChIP-seq read density are highly enriched for all our identified motifs, as well as the in vitro motifs. We provide multiple lines of evidence, through multiple methods, that the core OVO DNA binding motif is 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAACNGT</named-content>-3’. We have high confidence in the motif data.</p><p>We have added the below text to the methods section for further clarity on motif analysis parameters.</p><p>Lines 808-812</p><p>“The default parameters were used for de novo motif enrichment analysis, including the use of shuffled input sequences as a control. After identifying ‘OVO Motif One’, OVO ChIP peaks that contained that sequence were removed and the resulting ChIP peaks were resubmitted for STREME analysis deriving derivative OVO DNA binding motifs like above.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors mention that OVO binding (based on their ChIP-seq data) is highly associated with increased gene expression (lines 433-434). How many of the 3,094 peaks (conservative OVO binding sites), and what percentage of those peaks, are associated with a significant increase in gene expression from the RNA-seq data? How many are associated with a decrease in gene expression? This information should be added to the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>Not including the numbers of the overlapping ChIP peaks and expression changes in the text was an oversight on our part. The numbers that relate to this (666 peaks overlapping genes that significantly increased in expression, significant enrichment according to Fishers exact test, 564 peaks overlapping genes that significantly decreased in expression, significant depletion according to Fishers exact test) are found in figure 4C and will be added to the text.</p><p>We have modified the results section to include the overlap between the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.</p><p>Lines 463-468</p><p>“We found that 2,298 genes that were expressed in our RNA-seq data overlapped an OVO ChIP peak. 666 genes significantly increased in expression and were bound by OVO, which is a significant enrichment according to a Fisher’s exact test (Figure 4C, cyan dots, p &lt; 0.01, odds ratio = 2.21). While conversely, 564 genes decreased in expression and were bound by OVO, indicating a significant depletion according to a Fisher’s exact test (Figure 4C, blue dots, p &lt; 0.01, odds ratio = 0.85).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mention that a change in endogenous OVO expression cannot be determined from the RNA-seq data due to the expression of the OVO-B cDNA rescue construct. Can the authors see a change in endogenous OVO expression based on the presence/absence of OVO introns in their RNA-seq dataset? While intronic sequences are relatively rare in RNA-seq, even a 0.1% capture rate of intronic sequence is likely to be enough to determine the change in endogenous OVO expression in the rescue construct compared to the OVO null.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. The <italic>GAL4</italic> transcript is downstream of <italic>ovo</italic> expression in the hypomorphic <italic>ovoovo-GAL4</italic> allele. We state in the text that there is a nonsignificant increase in <italic>GAL4</italic> expression with ectopic rescue OVO, although the trend is positive. We calculated the RPKM of RNA-seq reads mapping to the intron spanning exon 3 and exon 4 in <italic>ovo-RA</italic> and found that there is also a nonsignificant increase in intronic RPKM with ectopic rescue OVO (we will add to the results in the revision). We would expect OVO to be autoregulatory and potentially increase the expression of <italic>GAL4</italic> and/or intronic reads, but the <italic>ovoovoGAL4</italic>&gt;<italic>UASp-OVOB</italic> is not directly autoregulatory like the endogenous locus. It is not clear to us how the intervening GAL4 activity would affect OVOB activity in the artificial circuit. Dampening? Feed-forward? Is there an effect on OVOA activity? Regardless, this result does not change our interpretation of the other OVO target genes.</p><p>We have added the analysis of intronic <italic>ovo</italic> RNA-seq to the results as outlined below.</p><p>Lines 512-520</p><p>“Transcriptionally, <italic>ovo</italic> RNA-seq reads are likely derived from the <italic>UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> cDNA rescue or are indistinguishable between the genomic locus and rescuing cDNA transgene. We found a nonsignificant increase in exon 3 to exon 4 intronic <italic>ovo</italic> reads with the expression of ectopic rescue OVO (log2 fold change = 0.76, p-adj = 0.26). These intronic reads would be derived from the endogenous <italic>ovo</italic> locus, but it is difficult to conclusively determine if the endogenous <italic>ovo</italic> locus would respond transcriptionally to ectopic OVO downstream of <italic>UASp</italic> (for example, the pathway for <italic>ovo</italic> is no longer autoregulatory in <italic>ovoovo-GAL4</italic>/<italic>ovoΔBP</italic>; <italic>UASp-3xFHA-OVO-B</italic> germ cells, there is an additional GAL4&gt;<italic>UASp</italic> activation step). So, we could not confidently assess whether <italic>ovo</italic> responded transcriptionally to ectopic rescue OVO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors conclude with a model of how OVO may participate in the activation of transcription in embryonic pole cells. However, the authors did not carry out any experiments with pole cells that would support/test such a model. It may be more useful to end with a model that describes OVO's role in oogenesis, which is the experimental focus of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not complete any experiments in embryonic pole cells in this manuscript and base our discussion on the potential dynamics of OVO transcriptional control and our previous work showing maternal and zygotic OVO protein localization in the developing embryonic germline. Obviously, we are highly interested in this question and continue to work on the role of maternal OVO. We agree that we are extended too far and will remove the embryonic germ cell model in the figure.

If they are TSS of genes not in the CAGE-seq data set, are these genes expressed in other tissues or just expressed at lower levels in the ovary?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a good point that prompted us to take a closer look at the characteristics of OVO binding and its relationships to promoters and other gene elements. 45% of OVO ChIP peaks overlapped the TSS while 55% were either non-overlapping downstream or upstream of the TSS. When plotting OVO ChIP read density, there was still a striking enrichment of OVO binding over the TSS, even though the ChIP peak was not overlapping the TSS (new figure 1K). This is possibly due to weaker direct OVO binding at the TSS that was not considered significant in the peak calling software or were indirect interactions of the distal OVO binding and the TSS. We outline this in the below text added to the results section on the OVO ChIP. To showcase these results, we have included a new panel in figure 1K. We removed the panel showing the enrichment over the cage-seq TSS, but this same data remains in the heatmap shown in figure 1L, so no information is lost. To directly answer the Cage-seq questions considering the OVO bound over the annotated TSS results, we found that 1,047 chip peaks overlapped CAGE-seq TSS, which is only 347 fewer than the annotated TSS overlap (1,394). Of the 1,394 genes that were bound by over the TSS, all of them were considered to be expressed in our RNA-seq dataset, indicating that these might just be more lowly expressed genes that for whatever reason were not considered to be enriched TSSs in the CAGE-seq data. This difference is likely not significant.</p><p>Lines 235-251</p><p>“Although OVO ChIP peaks overlapping genes showed a strong read density enrichment over the TSS, we found that only 45% (1,394/3,094) of OVO ChIP peaks directly overlapped a TSS. 43% (1,339/3,094) of OVO ChIP peaks were found to overlap the gene body downstream of the TSS (intronic and exonic sequences) and 12% (366/3,094) did not overlap any gene elements, indicating that they were intergenic.</p><p>We were interested in the differences between OVO binding directly over the TSS or at more distal upstream and downstream sites. We decided to plot the OVO ChIP read density of these different classes of OVO binding patterns and found that OVO bound over the TSS produced a sharp read density enrichment over the TSS which was consistent with what was found for all OVO bound genes (Figure 1K). OVO binding along the gene body surprisingly also showed a read density enrichment over the TSS, although the magnitude of read density enrichment was notably less than TSS OVO binding. Intergenic OVO binding also showed these same characteristics with a notable upstream read density enrichment possibly indicative of enhancer binding. This indicates that although the significantly called OVO ChIP peaks did not overlap the TSS, there was still a propensity for TSS sequences to be enriched with OVO ChIP over the input control. This could be due to weaker direct in vivo binding of OVO to these TSSs or indirect interactions between the upstream/downstream OVO bound sequences and the TSS, possibly through a looping enhancer-promoter interaction. However, regardless of the location of the OVO ChIP peak, OVO seemed to always be enriched at or in close proximity to TSSs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful for the authors to provide a bit more detailed analysis of chromatin states of OVObound regions in GSC, 8c NC, and 32c NC (or some more clarity in the current analysis). Are the regions that are bound by OVO accessible in all these cell types or specifically enriched for accessibility in a subset? The authors state that OVO binding is correlated with open chromatin, but whether these are regions that are open in all cell types analyzed or a subset is not clear from the data presented. Promoters are often accessible regardless of cell type, so it is unclear what exactly is to be concluded from this association. Also, is the proximity to open chromatin features for OVO-bound promoters (as shown in Figure 2C) different than non-OVO-bound promoters (the two classes shown Figure 1L, for example)?</p></disp-quote><p>We utilized previously published datasets of staged germ cell chromatin status to look at the association of chromatin status and OVO binding. Unfortunately, not all the same germ cell stages were profiled for each chromatin mark from the datasets derived for these two papers. For example, only H3K4me3 data exists for GSCs, and only gsc and 8c data exists for H3K9me3, while the other chromatin marks had more profiles, even including later stages. We focused specifically on gsc and 32c (essentially stage 5 egg chambers) for the other chromatin marks since that is when the <italic>ovo</italic> hypomorphic egg chambers arrest. A nice control would have been chromatin states in somatic follicle cells of the ovary, since we know germ cell genes such as <italic>ovo</italic> and <italic>otu</italic> are not expressed and presumably the chromatin states in somatic cell types would be different than germ cells. However, chromatin states for somatic follicle cells were not published in these two papers and we are not aware of any other existing datasets to compare too. Essentially, we need to determine the changes in chromatin states with and without OVO, which we are currently working on.</p><p>We did further analyze chromatin states and differential OVO binding in respect to gene elements, and found that OVO binding, regardless of the relationship to the gene element, is always open (gsc and 32c ATAC). OVO binding over the gene body shows the same enrichment for open chromatin and transcriptionally active histone marks. We compared the profiles of these chromatin marks and the promoters of OVO bound and not bound genes and consistent with the suggestion that promoters are generally open, we found that this was the case. However, there is an enrichment for open chromatin and transcriptionally active histone marks for OVO bound genes compared to non-OVO bound genes. This could be a consequence of OVO binding or indirect consequence of a downstream OVO target. Regardless, as has been suggested, future experiments directly measuring chromatin status and OVO needs to be performed. The below excerpts have been added to the text to supplement the comments provided above.</p><p>Lines 328-343</p><p>“The association of OVO binding with active histone marks and open chromatin was striking, but open chromatin is likely a general phenomenon of promoters (Haines and Eisen, 2008). Indeed, when measuring the read density for GSC and 32C ATAC-seq for OVO bound and OVO non-bound promoters, there is an enrichment for open chromatin at the TSS regardless of OVO binding. However, we did notice an increase in enrichment for OVO bound promoters compared to OVO non-bound promoters (Figure S1G), possibly suggesting that OVO bound promoters are more open or have an increase in accessibility when compared to non-OVO bound promoters. This same relationship held true for the transcriptionally active histone mark H3K27ac in GSCs (Figure S1H). Since only 45% of OVO ChIP peaks overlapped TSSs, we plotted the read density of the above chromatin marks over OVO ChIP peak maximums for OVO bound over the TSS, gene body, or intergenic regions (Figure S2A-D). We found that OVO bound regions that were not overlapping the TSS still showed the same propensity for enrichment of open chromatin and active histone marks. Intergenic regions were especially enriched for open chromatin measured through ATAC-seq. Altogether suggesting that OVO binding genome-wide is tightly associated with open chromatin regardless of germ cell stage, and active transcription in GSCs. In other words, chromatin state data suggests OVO is acting positively on its target genes and raises the possibility that OVO-binding and open chromatin are related.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For clarity, it would help the reader if the authors mentioned the male-specific TATA-associated factors as a rationale for testing the role of OVO binding in core promoter function. This is currently mentioned in the Discussion on lines 575-577, but would help in understanding the motivation behind the detailed analysis of the promoter binding of OVO in the Results and make the negative result more clearly impactful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have introduced the male specific tata factors as suggested and have condensed the two intro paragraphs in this section into one, as shown below.</p><p>Lines 347-363</p><p>“Our data thus far clearly indicates that OVO binding occurs at or very near the core promoter, a region recognized by an enormous collection of factors that associate with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription (Aoyagi and Wassarman 2000; Vo Ngoc, Kassavetis, and Kadonaga 2019). The highly organized polymerase complex has sequence-specific DNA recognition sites with incredibly precise spacing between them, with an overall DNA footprint of a little less than 100bp (Rice, Chamberlin, and Kane 1993; FitzGerald et al. 2006; Ohler et al. 2002). There are upstream binding sites such as TATA, sites at transcription start, such as the initiator (INR), and downstream promoter elements (DPE) (Vo Ngoc, Kassavetis, and Kadonaga 2019). The combinations of these DNA motifs is not random in mammals and Drosophila (FitzGerald et al. 2006), and distinct combinations of different motifs at the TSS of genes expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are conserved over tens of millions of years of evolution (Chen et al. 2014). The male germline expresses a number of TATA-associated factors that have been implicated in male-specific promoter usage for gene expression (M. Hiller et al. 2004; M. A. Hiller et al. 2001; Lu et al. 2020; V. C. Li et al. 2009). It is possible that OVO is a female germline specific TATA-associated factor, and if so, OVO binding sites at core promoters should share precise spacing with other core promoter elements, suggesting it is likely part of the complex. If not, then OVO is more likely to facilitate binding of the basal transcriptional machinery. Because of the extended footprint of engaged RNA polymerase, OVO and the basal machinery would not be likely to occupy the same region at the same time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the system used for the RNA-seq would benefit from additional clarity. It is not clear as written why it is &quot;Lucky&quot; that there is an mRNA isoform with extended exon 2 required for egg chamber development beyond stage 5. How does this requirement compare to the global requirement for OVO, which seems to be required for germ cell development even before stage 5? Understanding this system is essential for interpreting the RNA-seq results. Indeed, the authors have a separate manuscript (currently on bioRxiv) that explains the details of this system. As such, the current description requires that the reader refer to this additional pre-print. Could the authors include a diagram to better illustrate this system? Furthermore, since this RNA-seq is being performed on tissue that includes nurse cells, follicle cells, and germ cells from multiple stages of development, it is important for the authors to clearly state in which cell types OVO is expressed and likely functional. (While this is well beyond this manuscript, this analysis is the type that might benefit from the use of single-cell sequencing as a means to deconvolute the phenotypic effects of OVO loss.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the text to better describe the system for RNA-seq.

These genes are significant because they constitute a set of genes that are expressed in the germline and the encoded proteins are eventually incorporated into the vitelline membrane providing the structural integrity and impermeability of the egg (Mineo, Furriols, and Casanova 2017; Ventura et al. 2010). Loss-of-function of these three genes results in flaccid eggs that are permeable to dye and fail to develop. The loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>fs(1)N</italic>, <italic>fs(1)M3</italic>, and <italic>closca</italic> closely resembles the dominant antimorph <italic>ovoD3</italic> phenotype. The <italic>ovoD3</italic> allele is the weakest of the original dominant-negative <italic>ovo</italic> alleles and produces defective eggs allowing us to explore the role of OVO in late stages (Busson et al. 1983; Komitopoulou et al. 1983). <italic>ovoD3</italic>/ovo+ transheterozygous females express a repressive form of OVO that results in dominant sterility, and importantly, these females lay flaccid eggs with compromised vitelline membranes that are permeable to the dye neutral red (Oliver, Pauli, and Mahowald 1990). Since OVO+ is bound at the TSS of <italic>fs(1)N</italic>, <italic>fs(1)M3</italic>, and <italic>closca</italic>, and these three genes respond transcriptionally to OVO+, then it is plausible that the repressive OVOD3 is negatively regulating these three genes that are required for vitelline membrane formation. This is evidence that OVO is not only involved in regulating the expression of numerous essential maternal pathways for embryonic development, but it is also essential for regulating genes that are required for egg integrity and maturation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion of OVO as a pioneer factor is highly speculative and based only on correlative data. In fact, the expression data in the embryonic germline is not included in this manuscript, but rather in a separate bioRxiv preprint. This makes it challenging to understand, why this is extensively discussed here. However, there are experiments that could begin to test this proposal. OVO could be expressed in an exogenous tissue and test whether it promotes accessibility. Also, mutations could be made (using gene editing) to identify previously known OVO binding sites in the otu and/or other promoters and these could be assayed for accessibility. By selecting promoters of genes that are not essential for germline development, the authors could directly test the role of OVO in promoting chromatin accessibility. Alternatively, are there reasons that the system used for RNA-seq couldn't be similarly used for ATACseq? It is imperfect but could provide insights into chromatin accessibility in the absence of OVO.</p></disp-quote><p>We have largely removed the speculation on pioneering activity, reference to embryonic germline OVO dynamics included in the previous work, and Figure 7.
