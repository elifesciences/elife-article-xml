coordination of complex processes. Here, we aimed to leverage natural genetic correlation structure of gene expression both within and across tissues to understand how muscle interacts with metabolic tissues. Specifically, we performed a survey of genetic correlations focused on myokine gene regulation, muscle cell composition, cross-tissue signaling, and interactions with genetic sex in humans. While expression levels of a majority of myokines and cell proportions within skeletal muscle showed little relative differences between males and females, nearly all significant cross-tissue enrichments operated in a sex-specific or hormone-dependent fashion; in particular, with estradiol. These sex- and hormone-specific effects were consistent across key metabolic tissues: liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, intestine, heart, visceral, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. To characterize the role of estradiol receptor signaling on myokine expression, we generated male and female mice which lack estrogen receptor α specifically in skeletal muscle (MERKO) and integrated with human data. These analyses highlighted potential mechanisms of sex-dependent myokine signaling conserved between species, such as myostatin enriched for divergent substrate utilization pathways between sexes. Several other putative sex-dependent mechanisms of myokine signaling were uncovered, such as muscle-derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (<italic>TNFA</italic>) enriched for stronger inflammatory signaling in females compared to males and <italic>GPX3</italic> as a male-specific link between glycolytic fiber abundance and hepatic inflammation. Collectively, we provide a population genetics framework for inferring muscle signaling to metabolic tissues in humans. We further highlight sex and estradiol receptor signaling as critical variables when assaying myokine functions and how changes in cell composition are predicted to impact other metabolic organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The muscles that are responsible for voluntary movements such as exercise are called skeletal muscles.

allow muscle to impact systemic physiology and disease. Myokines play critical roles in a variety of processes, including metabolic homeostasis, exercise improvements, inflammation, cancer, and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Severinsen and Pedersen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eckel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Febbraio and Pedersen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Seldin and Wong, 2012</xref>). Several notable examples include key peptide hormones such as myostatin and interleukin-6 which exert potent actions in regulating autocrine/paracrine muscle physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kollias and McDermott, 2008</xref>) and beneficial exercise-induced endocrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Severinsen and Pedersen, 2020</xref>), respectively. Despite the clear relevance of these factors in mediating a multitude of physiological outcomes, the genetic architecture, regulation, and functions of myokines remain inadequately understood. Given that genetic sex contributes critically to nearly every physiological outcome, it is essential to consider when relating specific mechanisms to complex genetic and metabolic interactions. Specifically, many metabolic traits impacted by myokines show striking sex differences arising from hormonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clegg and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>), genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zore et al., 2018</xref>), or gene-by-sex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Norheim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chella Krishnan et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we leveraged natural genetic correlation structure of gene expression both within and across tissues to understand how muscle interacts with metabolic tissues. Collectively, we provide a population genetics framework for inferring muscle signaling to metabolic tissues in humans. We further highlight sex and estradiol receptor signaling as critical variables when assaying myokine functions and how changes in cell composition are predicted to impact other metabolic organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sex hormone receptors are enriched with myokine expression independent of biological sex</title><p>Our goal was to exploit correlation structure of natural genetic variation to investigate how skeletal muscle communicates with and impacts metabolic organs. We first assayed regulation of myokines and changes in cellular composition, then related these observations to inferred cross-tissue signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Initially, we performed differential expression of genes encoding all known secreted proteins (3666 total) in skeletal muscle from 210 male and 100 female individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). While several notable myokines appeared different between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a striking majority of all secreted proteins (74%) showed no difference in expression between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To understand potential sex effects on the regulation of myokines, gene ontology (GO) enrichments were performed on genes which showed the strongest correlation with myokines corresponding to each category (male-specific, female-specific, or non-sex-specific). Here, the top 10 pathways which persisted in females were also always observed to overlap with the non-sex-specific category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, pathways enriched for male-specific myokines were distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, the female and shared pathways suggested roles in epigenetics and RNA processing, while male-specific myokine coregulated processes were more enriched in metabolic pathways (e.g. NADH metabolism) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further, a majority of myokines showed strong correlation with receptors mediating functions of androgens (androgen receptor [AR]), estradiol (estrogen receptor α – ESR1), or both, regardless of sex-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We note that expression of hormone receptors themselves were also not significantly different between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To infer causality from hormone receptor regulation, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on mice lacking <italic>Esr1</italic> in skeletal muscle specifically (MERKO) and integrated these analyses with human myokine estimates. While myokines not regulated by <italic>Esr1</italic> showed little sex-specific differences in expression, those which were estrogen-dependent showed much stronger representation of sex specificity, in particular in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Among these was the master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation and proliferation, myostatin (MSTN), where hormone receptor correlations and gene expression were markedly higher in males compared to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Further, ablation of <italic>Esr1</italic> in mice uniquely drove expression changes in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest interactions between biological sex and ESR1 to tightly regulate <italic>MSTN</italic> in males, where other factors could contribute more in females. Given that, like many bioactive secreted proteins, the regulation and sex specificity of myostatin are additionally controlled via post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>), we next explored gene expression changes at the protein level. Immunoblots were performed on skeletal muscle from male and female WT or MERKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Quantification of the processed form of myostatin showed that, consistent with the RNA-Seq in mice and humans, the protein trended toward higher levels in male compared to female mice, where ablation of <italic>Esr1</italic> showed a reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Dissimilar to the mouse sequencing data but consistent with human correlations, female MERKO mice showed a reduction in processed form of myostatin relative to their WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Related to the sex-specific regulation of myostatin observed at both RNA and protein levels, gene expression also showed differences in functional annotations. Here, the most highly enriched pathways in males showed GO terms related to glycolytic metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) compared to oxidative phosphorylation in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These observations are consistent with previous studies which note myostatin-dependent increases in muscle mass in males, but not females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Reisz-Porszasz et al., 2003</xref>), where estradiol signaling is suggested as a mechanism mediating these differences. These data demonstrate that, expression of most myokines are not different between genetic sexes; however, interactions between sex and hormone receptors likely play important roles in determining myokine regulation and local signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sex and hormone effects on myokine regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall study design for integration of gene expression from muscle from 310 humans, single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), muscle-specific deletion of <italic>Esr1</italic> to infer interorgan coregulatory process across major metabolic tissues.

We applied a statistical method developed to infer cross-tissue signaling which occur as a result of genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seldin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seldin and Lusis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Seldin et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we assayed the distribution of midweight bicorrelation coefficients between myokine expression levels and global gene expression in key metabolic tissues including hypothalamus, heart, intestine, pancreas, liver, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue. Remarkably, nearly all highly significant correlations between myokines and target organ genes (putative direct interactions) showed sex-specific modes of operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>). This sex specificity also appeared more pronounced for positive correlations between myokines and target tissue genes, as compared to negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Further, among these significant cross-tissue circuits, hormone receptor enrichments for these myokines were strongly dependent on the category (e.g. significant only in females) rather than target tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>). This observation further suggests that hormone receptor levels (ESR1 or AR) in muscle are a stronger determinant of myokine expression compared to genetic sex; however, sex is suggested to dominate coregulated signaling processes across organs via myokines. To gauge the relative impact of muscle steroid hormone receptors across organs, the number of significant correlations between <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>AR,</italic> or both were quantified from muscle to each tissue. Here, <italic>ESR1</italic> showed an order of magnitude stronger enrichment across metabolic tissues compared to <italic>AR</italic> or correlation with both hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>). Additionally, the number of significantly correlated cross-tissue male <italic>ESR1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) was threefold higher than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Because both sex and ESR1 signaling appeared to contribute to the regulation and functions of myokines, significant cross-tissue enrichments were binned into categories taking into consideration whether myokines were driven by ESR1 in muscle, and/or showing a sex-specific mode of cross-organ significance. This analysis suggested that a majority of myokines were either driven by ESR1 and signaled robustly across sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, yellow) or signaled differently between sexes, but regulated independent of ESR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, red). These categories appeared to a much greater extent compared to a combination of both <italic>ESR1</italic>-driven myokine and sex-specific cross-tissue signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, beige) or neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, seagreen). One notable example of predicted sex-specific signaling was observed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA). When compared between sexes, muscle <italic>TNFA</italic> showed markedly different putative target tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, left), as well as underlying functional pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, right). For example, overall inflammatory processes engaged by TNFA were stronger in adipose tissue in females; however, the same pathways were higher in liver and hypothalamus in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, left). Collectively, these data show that genetic sex and related sex steroid hormones, particularly estradiol, exert dominant roles in regulating predicted tissue and pathway engagement by myokines.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sex and hormone effects on myokine regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) Key illustrating analysis for distribution of midweight bicorrelation coefficients between all myokines in skeletal muscle and global transcriptome measures in each target tissue.

Single-cell sequencing of human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rubenstein et al., 2020</xref>) was integrated using cellular deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Danziger et al., 2019</xref>) to roughly estimate cellular composition in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Here, a proportion in admixture approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>) outperformed other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to capture a majority of established cell populations across individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Similar to myokine expression, no notable differences were observed between sexes in terms of cell composition, with the exception of modest higher glycolytic fiber in males, compared to elevated oxidative fiber levels in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, no differences were observed in the correlations within muscle between compositions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>); however, nearly every cross-tissue enrichment corresponding to an individual muscle cell type differed between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Generally, differences in skeletal muscle cell abundance was associated with changes in liver and visceral adipose tissue pathways in males, compared to pancreas in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast to general myokine enrichments, cell proportions showed stronger correlations with <italic>AR</italic> when compared to <italic>ESR1</italic> across both sexes where the most abundant cell types were significantly enriched for both steroid hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To uncover potential direct mechanisms linking changes in cell composition to peripheral tissues, we correlated all myokines with cell composition profiles. Again, despite few differences between sexes in terms of myokine expression and cell composition, specific myokines highly correlating with individual cell types were markedly different between males and females with the exception of one, <italic>APOD</italic> in slow-twitch fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To determine if variation in cell compositions corresponding to sex-specific tissue signaling via myokines was predicted to be likely, we implemented adjusted regression mediation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yokota et al., 2020</xref>) for glycolytic fiber composition. Because male glycolytic fiber-type abundance was selectively enriched for liver pathways such as immune cell activation and regulated exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), the top genes driving these enrichments were used for mediation. The top-correlated muscle secreted protein with male glycolytic fiber-type levels was secreted glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3). Here, adjusting regressions between glycolytic fiber and liver pathways on <italic>GPX3</italic> reduced the overall significance across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting GPX3 as a potential mediator of this communication. These data point to a potential mechanism whereby muscle fiber abundance could buffer free radical generation in the liver, thereby feeding back on inflammation. This analysis appeared additionally sensitive to inferring non-dependent relationships between muscle cell types, top-ranked myokines, and cross-tissue processes. For example, female glycolytic fibers were strongly enriched for pancreatic protein synthesis pathways; however, when adjusted for the top-ranked myokine <italic>CES4A</italic>, no changes in regression significance were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). These analyses suggest that male GPX3 is a potential mechanism whereby fast-twitch muscle signals to liver; however, the same cell type in females are predicted to drive pancreas protein synthesis independent of CES4A. In summary, we show that cell composition is strongly conserved between sexes, but putative cross-tissue signaling of altered composition differs entirely. We further suggest putative myokines and mechanisms, as well as highlight the key regulatory roles of estrodiol in both sexes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Genetic variation of muscle cell proportions and coregulated cross-tissue processes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for skeletal muscle single-cell sequencing used to deconvolute proportions.

We find that in general, expression of myokines do not significantly differ between sexes; however, inferred signaling mechanisms across tissues using regressions show strong sex specificity. Steroid hormone receptors, in particular <italic>ESR1</italic>, is highlighted as a key regulator of myokines and potentially interacting with biological sex for proteins such as myostatin. Further integration with loss-of-function mouse models of <italic>Esr1</italic> highlighted the key roles of estradiol signaling in muscle in terms of myokine regulation and signaling across both sexes. Generation of pseudo-single-cell maps of muscle composition showed that, like myokines, muscle proportions are conserved between sexes, but inferred interorgan consequences differ substantially. When interpreting these findings, several considerations should be taken. While inter-tissue regression analyses have been informative to dissect mechanisms of endocrinology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seldin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seldin and Lusis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Seldin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li and Auwerx, 2020</xref>), observations can be subjected to spurious or latent relationships in the data. While causality for inter-organ signaling can be inferred statistically using approaches such as mediation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, the only methods to provide definitive validation for new mechanisms are in experimental settings. Further, our current analyses rely on gene expression to guide functions of proteins which are typically strongly regulated by post-transcriptional processes. As shown for myostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), gene expression analyses can miss key functional aspects of proteins, where follow-up studies and resources focused on protein and subsequent modification levels could heavily improve predictions. In addition, we anticipate that estimates for ESR1 effects on myokines in this study likely represent an underestimated number of all human ESR1-driven myokines. One limitation here includes that annotation of known orthologous mouse-human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">The Alliance of Genome Resources Consortium, 2020</xref>) remains somewhat limited. Furthermore, cell composition estimates from single-cell sequencing data are inferred from gene expression, where histological or flow cytometry-based methods can provide much more accurate direct quantifications. Clearly, morphological and structural differences between sexes have been observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Haizlip et al., 2015</xref>) which, if not apparent in deconvoluted gene expression, would be missed in this analysis. Future studies addressing these points will help to clarify context- and mechanism-relevant muscle-derived endocrine communication axes. In summary, this study highlights the key contributions of sex and sex steroid hormones in mediating myokine functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All datasets used, R scripts implemented for analyses, and detailed walkthrough guide is available via: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling">https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:f85e39fc6a9e5925b66376dc77f748cfc76489b2;origin=https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling;visit=swh:1:snp:2a361a2495b23946ffe3e2d9eb10c9db3e371db2;anchor=swh:1:rev:530dc39df1c586ad67eab36688fa2c1936b06354">swh:1:rev:530dc39df1c586ad67eab36688fa2c1936b06354</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Velez and Seldin, 2022</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-MSTN<break/>(Goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R&amp;D</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF788</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit anti-βactin<break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GTX109639</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice used in this study were approved by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with Public Health Service guidelines with reference #92-169.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data sources and availability</title><p>All data used in this study can be immediately accessed via GitHub to facilitate analysis.

Membranes were immersed in a stripping solution for 10 min (Restore PLUS Western Blot, Thermo Fisher), and then the process repeated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin (GeneTex GTX109639) at 1/1000 dilution as loading control to assess uniformity of loading.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal research was approved by the UCLA IACUC, where dare and procedures described in detail here: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aax8096.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76887-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>DE statistics for myokines based on sex.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76887-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Cell type marker genes used.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76887-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All datasets and detailed analysis available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling">https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:f85e39fc6a9e5925b66376dc77f748cfc76489b2;origin=https://github.com/Leandromvelez/myokine-signaling;visit=swh:1:snp:2a361a2495b23946ffe3e2d9eb10c9db3e371db2;anchor=swh:1:rev:530dc39df1c586ad67eab36688fa2c1936b06354">swh:1:rev:530dc39df1c586ad67eab36688fa2c1936b06354</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Frode Norheim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) Requests from reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors can address some issues:</p><p>1. On line 76, &quot;Sex hormones are enriched with myokine expression independent of biological sex&quot; In general, this section can be written more directly, and materials can be described in greater detail. For example, it would be better to provide the number of secreted protein gene expression studied.</p><p>2. The authors could modify the heading on Figure 1C to &quot;Proportions&quot; or &quot;Sex-specific assignment of Myokine Expression.&quot;</p><p>3, Increase the font size of Fig 1D. In general, the font sizes of some of the plots in figures need to be increased.</p><p>4. Label the x-axis of Fig 1E</p><p>5. On line 103, &quot;...hormone receptor correlations, gene expression was markedly higher in males compared to females...&quot;</p><p>6.

We have revised the manuscript in several ways to highlight this point:</p><p>1. Immunoblotting for myostatin was performed on male and female WT and MERKO mice (revised Figure 1H and supplement 2). While the sex-specificity of myostatin and differential expression following <italic>ESR1</italic> ablation in males was consistent with RNA-Seq, females also showed a reduction of <italic>MSTN</italic> related to <italic>ESR1</italic>. These data are included in the revised manuscript, where we utilize as a point to discuss the limitation with reliance on gene expression to infer function. It is interesting to note that the <italic>ESR1</italic> ~ <italic>MSTN</italic> correlations in GTEx were consistent with the immunoblot; however, gene expression in mice failed to predict this observation.</p><p>2. Generally, the language has been toned down in referencing correlated gene expression as “causal” in inferring signaling. This is apparent throughout the revised text, figures and title</p><p>3. The conclusion/limitations section has been revised to highlight this limitation. Specifically, we added: “Further, our current analyses rely on gene expression to guide functions of proteins which are typically strongly regulated by post-transcriptional processes. As shown for myostatin (Figure 1), gene expression analyses can miss key functional aspects of proteins, where follow-up studies and resources focused on protein and subsequent modification levels will heavily improve predictions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
