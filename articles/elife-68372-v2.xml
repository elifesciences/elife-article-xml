dampen enthusiasm for life, and dealing with negative affective states is essential for individual survival. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) are critical for modulating affective states in mice. However, the functional roles of PBN-PVT projections in modulating affective states remain elusive. Here, we show that PBN neurons send dense projection fibers to the PVT and form direct excitatory synapses with PVT neurons. Activation of the PBN-PVT pathway induces robust behaviors associated with negative affective states without affecting nociceptive behaviors. Inhibition of the PBN-PVT pathway reduces aversion-like and fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, the PVT neurons innervated by the PBN are activated by aversive stimulation, and activation of PBN-PVT projections enhances the neuronal activity of PVT neurons in response to the aversive stimulus. Consistently, activation of PVT neurons that received PBN-PVT projections induces anxiety-like behaviors. Thus, our study indicates that PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parabrachial nucleus</kwd><kwd>thalamic paraventricular nucleus</kwd><kwd>affective states</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>aversion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010097</institution-id><institution>China Association for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019QNRC001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010098</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Association for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19YF1438700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21ZR1468600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The parabrachial nucleus-thalamic paraventricular nucleus pathway is critical for modulating affective states in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Threat and injury often induce defensive behaviors, such as flight, freezing, hiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohman and Mineka, 2001</xref>), and negative affective states, such as fear and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>). Such behavioral adaptations and psychological responses are essential for animal survival, and understanding their mechanisms is of great interest. It is worth noting that the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the brainstem plays a critical role in encoding danger signals and promoting affective behavior states to limit harm in response to potential threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The PBN receives the majority of the ascending inputs from the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Todd, 2010</xref>), and PBN neurons respond robustly to nociception, food neophobia, hypercapnia, and threat to maintain homeostasis in stressful circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>). The PBN relays this information (visceral malaise, taste, temperature, pain, itch) to brain areas, such as the hypothalamus, central amygdala (CeA), thalamus, insular cortex (IC), and periaqueductal gray (PAG), to participate in diverse physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palmiter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saper, 2016</xref>). A recent study found that subpopulations of the PBN have distinct projection patterns and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). Neurons in the dorsal division of the PBN projecting to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and PAG mediate escape behaviors. In contrast, neurons in the external lateral division of the PBN projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the CeA mediate aversion and avoidance memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). Optogenetic manipulation of specific outputs from PBN accomplishes distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>). In the thalamus, the intralaminar thalamus nucleus (ILN) is the downstream target of PBN neurons that receive spinal cord inputs, and this ILN pathway participates in nociception processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the ILN, the thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is another primary target of projections from the PBN nucleus in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The PVT has been implicated in a range of affective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). The functional roles of the PVT include modulation of a diverse array of processes, such as arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Do-Monte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engelke et al., 2021</xref>), stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2020</xref>), and associative learning and memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keyes et al., 2020</xref>). The PVT receives a significant amount of input from the brainstem, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas and projects to the infralimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens (NAc), BNST, and CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirouac, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vertes et al., 2015</xref>). The convergent signals include arousal from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), emotional saliency from the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamamuro et al., 2020</xref>), and stress responsivity from the locus coeruleus (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beas et al., 2018</xref>), which might help promote appropriate behavioral responses to environmental challenges. However, despite substantial improvements in our understanding of the neurocircuitry of the PVT, the functional role of PBN-PVT projections remains mostly unknown.</p><p>In this study, we used viral tracing and electrophysiology to dissect the anatomical and functional connections between the PBN and the PVT. By using optogenetic and pharmacogenetic approaches, we then demonstrated that PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional connectivity pattern of PBN-PVT projections</title><p>Although it has been shown that the PVT receives input from the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Kirouac, 2012</xref>), the detailed morphology of PBN-PVT projections and whether these two nuclei form direct functional synapses remain unknown. To examine the synaptic connectivity between the PBN and the PVT, we injected AAV2/8-hSyn-ChR2-mCherry virus into the PBN and employed whole-cell patch-clamp recording. There were dense projection fibers in the PVT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and precisely time-locked action potentials induced by brief laser pulses in PBN ChR2<sup>+</sup> neurons (5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We found that optogenetic activation of PBN projection fibers evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in 34 of 52 PVT neurons. The medial PVT (bregma: –0.94 to –1.82 mm; 18 of 25 cells, 72.0%) and posterior PVT (pPVT; bregma: –1.82 to –2.3 mm; 14 of 21 neurons, 66.7%) showed higher connectivity than the anterior PVT (bregma: –0.22 to –0.94 mm; 2 of 6 cells, 33.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). The average amplitude of the light-evoked EPSCs was 103.4 ± 11.93 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, the latency of EPSCs was short with small jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), indicating monosynaptic connections between the PBN and PVT. Consistently, the EPSCs were sensitive to the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) and were rescued by the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 μM). The EPSCs were further blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (10 μM), confirming the monosynaptic glutamatergic innervation of PVT neurons by PBN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). In addition, we also observed light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in only 4 of 52 PVT neurons (less than 30 pA). Thus, these results indicate that most monosynaptic connections between PBN and PVT are glutamatergic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional connectivity pattern of parabrachial nucleus-paraventricular nucleus (PBN-PVT) projections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The schematic for virus injection of AAV2/8-hSyn-ChR2-mCherry into the PBN nucleus and the slice recording with 473 nm laser stimulation.

Optogenetic activation (473 nm, 20 Hz, 5 mW, 5 ms) of the efferents from the PBN to the PVT elicited instant running behavior along the chamber wall with a significantly increased velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The activation of PBN-PVT projections also reduced the center time compared with that of the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). It is worth noting that the velocity returned to normal once the laser was off, but the time spent in the center was still lower than that of the control group during the 5 min after stimulation. These results indicate that anxiety could last for at least several minutes after acute activation of PBN-PVT projections. Although the speed increased during the laser on period, the immobility time of the ChR2 mice during the laser on period was also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, the distance during the laser on period and the total distance in 15 min were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To provide a more detailed profile of behavior in the OFT, we further divided the laser on period (5–10 min) into five 1-min periods and analyzed the velocity, immobility time, center time, distance, and jumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–G</xref>). We found that the velocity and immobility time were increased, and the center time was decreased in the ChR2 mice during most periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the distance and jumping behaviors were increased mainly in the first 1-min period in ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). This detailed analysis indicates that optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections could induce brief and robust running, jumping behaviors, and persistent anxiety-like behaviors, such as less time spent in the center.</p><p>In addition to anxiety, another critical component of negative affective states is aversion. Therefore, we used the real-time place aversion (RTPA) test to explore the function of optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections in modulating aversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). We found that the activation of PBN-PVT projections reduced the time spent in the laser-paired chamber, and the aversion disappeared when the laser was off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). We also used a prolonged conditioning protocol that mimics drug-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We found that prolonged activation of PBN-PVT projections did not display aversion in the postconditioning test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm this instant aversion phenomenon, we subjected mice to the cue-dependent optogenetic conditioning test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). A 30 s auditory conditioning stimulus (CS) co-terminated with 30 s of synchronous optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections (laser stimulus [LS]) in this test. Activation of the PBN-PVT projections induced significant freezing behavior during six CS-LS pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). However, the freezing behavior to the same context or to the auditory cue in a novel context disappeared on the second day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P and Q</xref>). These results indicate that optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections induces instant aversion and freezing but does not drive associative fear memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pharmacogenetic activation of PBN-PVT neurons induces anxiety-like behaviors and freezing behaviors</title><p>To further confirm the effects of activating the PBN-PVT pathway, we also used retrograde viral tracing and pharmacogenetic manipulation.

Optogenetic inhibition of the PBN-PVT pathway could partially reduce 2-MT-induced aversive behaviors as well as footshock-induced freezing behaviors. The activity of PVT neurons was increased with the presentation of several aversive stimuli and could be further increased by activation of PBN-PVT projections. Consistently, activation of PVT<sub>PBN</sub> neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors. Taken together, our results reveal the functional role of PBN-PVT projections in modulating negative affective states in mice.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PBN efferents and PBN-PVT monosynaptic excitatory projections</title><p>The PBN is a critical hub receiving sensory information from the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Todd, 2010</xref>). The widespread distribution of PBN efferents contributes to different aspects of behavioral and physiological responses. Previous studies have shown that CGRP-expressing neurons in the PBN project to the CeA and contribute to the affective dimension of pain. In contrast, non-CGRP neurons may transmit sensory pain information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2015</xref>). The projections from the PBN to the VMH or PAG are involved in producing escape behaviors to avoid injury, while the projections from the PBN to the BNST or CeA participate in facilitating aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). PBN neurons, which receive projections from the spinal cord, form strong functional synaptic connections with ILN neurons but not CeA neurons to process nociceptive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). The PVT, which is located in the midline of the brain, is an important area that participates in the processing of affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirouac, 2015</xref>). Although recent research has reported that projecting fibers from the PBN were found in the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>), remarkably little is known about the connectivity information and function of these PBN-PVT projections.</p><p>Since we injected the constitutively expressed ChR2 virus into the PBN, some neurons in the LC (which is medial to the PBN) might be infected. LC neurons express type 1 vesicular glutamate transporter (VgluT1) and also project to the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beas et al., 2018</xref>). Although PBN-PVT projections comprise the major portion of the projections, there is still potential contamination from LC-PVT projections. We also observed a small portion of inhibitory connections between the PBN and the PVT by performing slice recording experiments. These results are consistent with a previous study showing that GABAergic neurons in the PBN also send sparse projections to the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate that this PBN-PVT GABAergic pathway might play an opposite role in modulating negative affective states. Further in situ hybridization results confirmed that the PBN-PVT neurons were mainly glutamatergic neurons expressing <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA. These results suggest that the majority of the PBN-PVT projections appeared to be excitatory. Further optoelectrode experiment results also confirmed that firing rates of some PVT neurons could be directly increased by monosynaptic inputs from PBN.</p><p>We also found that the connectivity and density of glutamatergic PBN projection fibers were higher in the middle and pPVT. These results are consistent with various studies supporting the idea that the pPVT is a particularly sensitive region of the PVT to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barson et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states</title><p>We found that activation of PBN-PVT projections or PBN-PVT neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors and fear-like behaviors in the OFT and EZM. We observed that mice displayed robust running and jumping behaviors mainly in the first minute of optogenetic manipulation, and these phenomena were not observed in the pharmacogenetic experiment. These might have been caused by the instantly increased activity of PBN-PVT projections induced by optogenetic manipulation. Mice might display ‘fight or flight’ during sudden affective state transitions. The pharmacogenetic approach takes several minutes and gradually enhances neural activity, and the resulting affective states change in a relatively mild way. We also observed that anxiety-like behaviors in the OFT still existed several minutes after optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections. However, in the RTPA test, aversion appeared when the laser was on and disappeared when the laser was off, indicating that aversion was transient and could not be translated to associative learning. This was further confirmed by the prolonged CPA test and cue-dependent optogenetic conditioning test. These results suggest that activation of PBN-PVT projections induces instant negative affective states but does not drive associative fear memory formation.</p><p>The selective optogenetic inhibition of PBN-PVT projections or PBN-PVT neurons could reduce aversion-like and fear-like behaviors. To better examine the behavioral changes, we performed a 10 min test in 2-MT and footshock experiments. We used a relatively long-term protocol in optogenetic inhibition experiments (10 min of constant laser stimulation). Such long-term inhibition protocols have been used in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). We also performed the classic fear conditioning test and found that inhibition of PBN-PVT projections did not affect associative fear memory formation or retrieval, suggesting that PBN-PVT projections mainly promote aversion but do not facilitate negative associations.</p><p>Our calcium imaging and Fos staining results indicate that PVT neurons are activated after exposure to aversive stimuli, consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The dual Fos staining experiment and optoelectrode experiments confirmed a broad overlap between laser-activated and footshock-activated neurons. The median response latency of laser-activated PVT neurons was 10 ms, indicating that monosynaptic inputs from PBN could directly activate a part of PVT neurons. We also observed that some neurons had relatively long latency (from 20 to 150 ms). That might be caused by cumulative effects of monosynaptic inputs or antidromic activation of PBN and multisynaptic activation of other PVT inputs that are innervated by the PBN. Further analysis showed that activation of PBN-PVT projections enhanced the overall firing rates of PVT neurons in response to footshock. These results suggest that the activation of PBN-PVT projections could enhance neuronal activity in response to aversive stimulation.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that activation of the PBN-CeA pathway was sufficient to drive behaviors associated with negative affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2015</xref>), enable associative learning, and generate aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>).

These results suggested that the PBN-PVT pathway and the PBN-CeA pathway are two parallel pathways originating from distinct efferent neurons within the PBN that perform distinct functions.</p><p>Recently, Chiang et al. found two major efferent pathways from the lateral PBN: one originating from the dorsal division of lateral PBN collateralizes the VMH and PAG and a second arising from the external lateral division of lateral PBN that collateralize to the BNST and CeA. They suggested that activation of the first pathway generates the aversive memory, and activation of the second one drives escape behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, the results indicate that the PBN-PVT pathway arises from both dorsal and external lateral divisions of lateral PBN and collateralizes the BNST, LH, PVN, and PAG but not the CeA or VMH. According to the location of originated PBN neurons and collateral projection pattern, we speculated that the PBN-PVT efferent pathway is different from both PBN-VMH/PAG pathway and PBN-BNST/CeA pathway. Since there were broad collateral projection fibers in BNST, PAG, and other brain regions, the possibility of antidromic effects following photoactivation of PBN terminals in PVT should be considered.</p><p>The tracing results showed that PVT<sub>PBN</sub> neurons projected to multiple brain areas, particularly the NAc, BNST, and CeA. The BNST and CeA have been previously implicated in negative affective behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tye et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the activation of PVT-CeA projections induced place aversion, and the effect persisted the next day in the absence of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Do-Monte et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, long-term depression (LTD)-like stimulation of PVT-CeA projections or inhibition of the same circuit induced a persistent attenuation of fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Bi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>). These results revealed a critical role of PVT-CeA projections in aversive memory formation. In our study, we found that PBN-PVT projections were not crucial for aversive memory formation. The possible reason might be that manipulation of PVT-CeA projections induced direct excitatory inputs to the CeA, and the inputs were strong enough for aversive memory formation. However, activation of PBN-PVT projections might not induce enough excitatory inputs to the CeA via the disynaptic connection.</p><p>A previous study also found that the PVT mediates descending pain facilitation underlying persistent pain conditions via the PVT-CeA-PAG circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Different downstream pathways of PVT<sub>PBN</sub> neurons might have different functions, and deciphering the circuit mechanisms needs further examination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The potential role of PBN-PVT projections in depression and pain</title><p>It is worth noting that although the pharmacogenetic activation of PBN-PVT neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors and fear-like behaviors in hM3Dq group mice, no depression-like symptoms were observed in the TST and FST. On the other hand, chronic pain models, such as the partial sciatic nerve ligation model, spared nerve injury model, and complete Freund’s adjuvant model, generally induce anxiety and depression at least 3–4 weeks after surgery in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Our study collected behavioral data 30 min after a single dose of CNO injection. Different behavioral tests were performed at least 3 days apart to eliminate the residual CNO effects. We hypothesized that depression-like behaviors might be observed if we repeatedly activated PBN-PVT projections for weeks. However, whether PBN-PVT projections are involved in depression is still unknown.</p><p>A recent study revealed that PBN neurons convey nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the ILN, which is relatively close to the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). In our results, we carefully checked the virus expression and optic fiber locations. We found that pharmacogenetic activation of PBN-PVT neurons did not affect basal nociceptive thresholds or formalin-induced licking behaviors. Moreover, no obvious nociception-related behaviors were found through specific manipulations of the PBN innervated PVT neurons, which suggests that PBN-PVT projections might not be involved in nociceptive information processing.</p><p>In summary, we identified the functional role of PBN-PVT projections in modulating negative affective states. Our study paves the way for further deciphering the distinct roles of the PBN neural circuit in affective behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from the target neurons under IR-DIC visualization and a CCD camera (Retiga ELECTRO, QIMAGING) using a fluorescent Olympus BX51WI microscope. Recording pipettes (2–5 MΩ; Borosilicate Glass BF 150-86-10; Sutter Instrument) were prepared with a micropipette puller (P97; Sutter Instrument) and backfilled with potassium-based internal solution containing (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP (pH 7.3, 290 mOsm), or cesium-based internal solution containing (in mM) 130 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 2 QX-314, 11 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP (pH 7.3, 295 mOsm). Biocytin (0.2%) was included in the internal solution.</p><p>In PBN-PVT ChR2 experiments, whole-cell recordings of PBN neurons with current-clamp (I = 0 pA) were obtained with pipettes filled with the potassium-based internal solution. The 473 nm laser (5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz pulses, 0.5 ms duration, 2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was used to activate PBN ChR2-positive neurons. Light-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs of PVT neurons recorded with voltage-clamp (holding voltage of –70 mV or 0 mV) were obtained with pipettes filled with the cesium-based internal solution. The 473 nm laser (20 Hz paired pulses, 1 ms duration, 4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was used to activate ChR2-positive fibers. The light-evoked EPSCs were completely blocked by 1 μM TTX, rescued by 100 μM 4-AP, and blocked by 10 μM (6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX)). NBQX and TTX were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.</p><p>Voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings were carried out using a computer-controlled amplifier (MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices, USA). During recordings, traces were low-pass filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz (DigiData 1550B1; Molecular Devices). Data were acquired by Clampex 10.6 and filtered using a low-pass Gaussian algorithm (–3 dB cutoff frequency = 1000 Hz) in Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetic manipulation</title><p>For activating the PBN-PVT projection, a 473 nm laser (20 Hz, 5 mW, 5 ms pulse duration) was delivered.

The mouse was placed in the center of the box and recorded with a camera attached to a computer. The movement was automatically tracked and analyzed using AniLab software (Ningbo AnLai, China). The total distance traveled, the total velocity, the total immobility time (the mice were considered to be immobile if immobility time lasts more than 1 s), and time spent in the center area (20 × 20 cm) were measured.

The time spent in the 2-MT paired quadrant was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Elevated zero maze</title><p>The EZM was an opaque plastic circle (60 cm diameter), which consisted of four sections with two opened and two closed quadrants. Each quadrant had a path width of 6 cm. The maze was elevated 50 cm above the floor. The animals were placed into an open section facing a closed quadrant and freely explored the maze for 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Real-time place aversion test</title><p>Mice were habituated to a custom-made 20 × 30 × 40 cm two-chamber apparatus (distinct wall colors and stripe patterns) before the test. Each mouse was placed in the center and allowed to explore both chambers without laser stimulation for 10 min on day 1. The movement was recorded for 10 min as a baseline. The mice performed a slight preference for the black chamber according to the fact that the mice have innate aversion to brightly illuminated areas. On day 2, 473 nm laser stimulation (20 Hz, 5 mW, 5 ms) was automatically delivered when the mouse entered or stayed in the black chamber and turned off when the mouse exited the black chamber for 10 min. Finally, the mouse was allowed to freely explore both chambers without laser stimulation for another 10 min. The RTPA location plots and total time on the stimulated side were recorded and counted with the AniLab software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Conditioned place aversion</title><p>After habituation, mice were placed in the center of the two-chamber apparatus and allowed to explore either chamber for 15 min on day 1.

For the cue test, the freezing percentages were calculated for 30 s during tone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Auditory fear conditioning test</title><p>On day 1, mice were habituated to the fear conditioning chambers. On day 2, mice were conditioned by seven trials of sound tone (75 dB, 4 kHz, 30 s) co-terminated with footshock (0.6 mA, 2 s) averagely separated by 90 s. Laser (589 nm, 10 mW) was delivered 1 s before the footshock and lasted for 4 s at each trial. On day 3, mice were placed back into the original training chamber for 3 min to perform the contextual test, and the laser was delivered during the second minute.

After 2 weeks of virus expression, the mice were gently handled to be familiar with the calcium signal recording experiments (Thinker-Biotech). A signal (for synchronization) was manually tagged with the shock and air puff to evaluate the activity of PVT neurons. The calcium transient was recorded at 50 Hz. The fluorescence values change (ΔF/F) was calculated from the formula of (F−F0)/F0, where the F0 represents the median of the fluorescence values in the baseline period (−1 to −0.5 s relative to the stimulation onset).

The 16 microwire arrays were arranged in a 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 pattern and soldered to an 18-pin connector (Mil-Max). Three weeks after virus injection, the optoelectrode was implanted to the PVT nucleus (AP −1.46 mm, ML 0 mm, DV −2.90 mm). After 1 week of recovery, two trials were performed continuously. Trial 1 contained 10 sweeps of 2 s laser pulse trains (473 nm, 5 ms, 20 Hz, 8 mW). The interval of sweeps was 60 s. Trial 2 contained 20 sweeps of 2 s footshock (0.5 mA). The interval of sweeps was 60 s. In the even time sweeps (2, 4, 6, 8,10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), 2 s laser pulse trains were delivered spontaneously with the 2 s footshock. Neuronal signals were recorded using a Zeus system (Zeus, Bio-Signal Technologies, McKinney, TX), and spike signals were filtered online at 300 Hz. At the end of the experiment, all animals were perfused to confirm the optical fiber sites. Only the data of animals with correct optical fiber sites and virus expression regions were analyzed.</p><p>The spikes were sorted by the valley-seeking method with Offline Sorter software (Plexon, USA) and analyzed with NeuroExplorer (Nex Technologies, Boston, MA). Firing rates of the neurons and timestamps were exported for further analysis using customized scripts in MATLAB. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test was used to compare the spike firing rate of PVT during 2 s baseline (before stimulus) and 2 s after each stimulus. p&lt;0.001 indicates statistical significance.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mario Penzo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Fabricio do Monte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While individual assessments and recommendations from each of the reviewer is included below, here we provide you with a brief list of items that we collectively consider to be essential revisions that must be addressed in order for the manuscript to be considered further for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Revise the writing and overall framing of the study. The authors should avoid anthropomorphizing rodents by using terms typically associated with human's subjective experience of emotions like sadness and misery.</p><p>2) The authors should provide a more detailed discussion and present the temporal profiles of the behaviors elicited by photo stimulating PBN-PVT projections (see comments from Reviewer # 2).</p><p>3) While the authors showed that VGLUT2 expressing neurons of the PBN project to the PVT, we ask that the authors perform a more complete characterization of the molecular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons. The authors are not expected to identify new markers, but rather use known PBN markers as reference. The objective should be to determine what fraction of PBN projections to the PVT arise from VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons vs other PBN markers.</p><p>4) The authors should demonstrate that PBN input shapes PVT neuronal responses to aversive stimuli by expanding on their findings presented in Figure 5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) I recommend that the authors reconsider their overall framing of the term emotion and its evaluation in animal models. While in general the writing of the manuscript could be improved, I found the use of subjective terms of emotion like sadness and misery particularly problematic. Framing of the study within the constraints of aversion may be more appropriate here.</p><p>2) In Figure 1 it appears that the density of PBN projections is higher in the middle and posterior PVT (pPVT). The authors should better highlight this observation in the text, especially considering that the notion of the pPVT being a particularly aversive region of the PVT is now supported by various studies. The overall framing of the PBN-PVT pathway as involved in aversion fits well with the anatomical distribution of these projections.</p><p>3) Justification for the use of different genetic strategies to target the PBN-PVT pathway is required. When using the constitutively expensed ChR2 in the PBN to demonstrate glutamatergic projections to the PVT, please show whether there is contamination from adjacent brain stem structures like the LC and DRN, which project to the PVT and are known to contain glutamatergic neurons (vglut1 and vglut3, respectively). In figure 4 why were Vglut2-cre mice not used and PBN terminals in the PVT inhibited as in Figure 2?</p><p>4) In the retrograde labeling experiment (Figure 1) please show what fraction of retrogradely label cells are VGLUT2<sup>+</sup>.

This manuscript has numerous grammatical issues and typos. It would benefit enormously if the text is carefully proofread. It also misuses terminologies and concepts in several cases, including the use of the word &quot;affection&quot; presumably to refer to &quot;affective states&quot;, or the use of the word &quot;rescue&quot; to describe the reduction of &quot;fear-like behaviors&quot;. These issues should be corrected.</p><p>2. The authors frequently refer to Chiang et al. 2020 (PMID: 32289251) paper to support their observation that PBN-PVT projections are exclusively glutamatergic. However, the same paper showed that the PBN also sends a smaller number of GABAergic fibers to PVT. While the authors showed only EPSCs in PVT neurons when optogenetically activating PBN inputs, it is not clear whether the recordings were also performed after clamping the voltage at 0mV to allow the detection of possible IPSCs after stimulation of PBN fibers. Alternatively, the authors could use immunohistochemistry to identify the cell-type specificity of PVT-projecting neurons in PBN and reconcile their findings with the current literature.</p><p>3. Similarly, Chiang et al. 2020 described the role of PBN-CeA/BNST projections in regulating aversion. Although the authors showed that PVT-projecting neurons in PBN do not project to CeA, it would be very informative for the field if the authors could also provide the data for other brain regions to which PVT-projecting neurons also send collateral, especially those regions that are important for anxiety- and fear- like behaviors. This would help the authors to exclude (or include) the possible contribution of collateral projections to the reported behaviors.</p><p>4. For the PBN-PVT photoactivation experiments in Figure 2, a deeper discussion about the lack of effects on aversive memory formation (RTPA and fear conditioning) is missing. The authors should compare their results with prior studies in the literature. For example, activation of PVT-CeA projections induces place aversion and the effect persists in the next day in the absence of illumination (Do Monte et al. 2017, PMID: 28426970). Similarly, LTD-like stimulation of PVT-CeA projections or optogenetic/chemogenetic inhibition of the same circuit induces a persistent attenuation of fear responses (Chen and Bi, 2019, PMID: 30406427; Do Monte et al. 2015, PMID: 25600268; Penzo et al. 2015, PMID: 25600269)</p><p>5. In Figure 4, the authors should justify why they have inhibited the soma of PVT-projecting PBN neurons instead of axonal terminals in the PVT. They should also make it very clear in their schematic drawing by adding an optical fiber on the top of the PVT, similar to what they have done in other figures.</p><p>6. During optogenetic manipulations, the authors used a very long period of laser illumination (5 uninterrupted minutes of pulses for photoactivation and 10 minutes of constant laser for photoinhibition). These laser durations are much longer than the traditional intervals used for optogenetic manipulations in rodents. An explanation of the rationale for using such long intervals is needed. Also, regarding the photoactivation experiment (illustrated in Supplementary Video 1), it is very clear that the animals exhibited a wide range of different behaviors along the 5-min period of stimulation. These behaviors varied from no effect to increased speed of locomotion, to jumping episodes, to freezing responses by the end of the stimulation, thereby making it hard to define the correct function of this pathway in behavioral regulation. A breakdown of the behaviors by time and a deeper discussion of the different responses would probably help the readers to better understand the results.</p><p>7. The authors should provide a Cre-negative control for Figure 5G-N, given that tdTomato Ai14 mice can have baseline levels of tdTomato expression even in the absence of Cre. This is highly important because the transneuronal transduction of AAV1-Cre is generally limited and has never been tested in PVT.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It has been shown that PBN-VMH/PAG drive escape behaviors, whereas PBN-BNST/CEA generate aversive memory. The authors need to examine the relationship between PVT-projection and VMH/BNST-projections.</p><p>2. The authors need to examine the cellular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons, whether it originate from known PBN neuronal subtypes such as CGRP, Tac1, Pdyn, Nts et al.</p><p>3. As authors mentioned in discussion part, a recent study revealed that the PBN neurons project to ILN, which is relatively closed to the PVT. The authors need to carefully examine their manipulation experiments especially optogenetic stimulation. They need to make sure that the effect they observed was not due to the activation of PBN-ILN pathway. Since activation of PBN-ILN pathway induced pain-related behavior which could be very similar to negative emotions.</p><p>4. For the cue-dependent optogenetics conditioning test: activation of the PBN-PVT projection induces instant aversion and freezing but not drives associative fear learning. Could it be simply because the conditioning (6 times 30 seconds light stimulation) was too weak? The authors should try a prolong conditioning protocol that resemble drug CPP such as 30 min light stimulation at paired side.</p><p>5. Optogenetics and Pharmacogenetics are nouns while optogenetic and pharmacogenetic are adjectives. There are many places in the manuscript where the noun was misused.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PBN-PVT projections modulate negative affective states in mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors should avoid anthropomorphizing rodents by using terms typically associated with human's subjective experience of emotions like sadness and misery.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to avoid using subjective terms of emotions. We used terms including anxiety-like, depression-like, fear-like behaviors, freezing, aversion-like behaviors. We replaced the terms “emotions” “affections” with “affective states”. We also replaced the terms “rescue” “relieve” with “reduce”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide a more detailed discussion and present the temporal profiles of the behaviors elicited by photo stimulating PBN-PVT projections (see comments from Reviewer # 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a detailed analysis (one-minute time window) of optogenetic activation of PBN-PVT projections in OFT experiments. We further divided the laser ON period (5−10 minutes) into five one-minute periods and analyzed the velocity, non-moving time, center time, moving distance, and jumping behaviors. We found that the velocity and non-moving time were increased, and the center time was decreased in the ChR2 mice during most periods. Furthermore, we observed that the distance and jumping behaviors were increased mainly in the first one-minute period in ChR2 mice. This detailed analysis indicated that optogenetic activation induced brief and robust running, jumping behaviors, and persistent anxiety-like behaviors, such as less time spent in the center. These new results have been included in <italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2</italic> and were described in the text. Please see Page 7 Line 179 to Line 189. We also discussed this on Page 14 Line 396 to Line 403.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors showed that VGLUT2 expressing neurons of the PBN project to the PVT, we ask that the authors perform a more complete characterization of the molecular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons. The authors are not expected to identify new markers, but rather use known PBN markers as reference. The objective should be to determine what fraction of PBN projections to the PVT arise from VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons vs other PBN markers.</p></disp-quote><p>To examine the molecular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons, we have now performed the RNAscope experiments detecting <italic>VgluT2, Tac1, Tacr1, Pdyn</italic> mRNA, and fluorescent immunostaining detecting CGRP protein in the PBN.

We first recorded the spiking signals in response to 10 sweeps of 2-second laser pulse trains. Then we recorded the spiking signals in response to 20 sweeps of 2-second footshock without laser in the odd number sweeps or with laser in the even number sweeps. We found that there was also a broad overlap between laser-activated and footshock-activated neurons. Next, we analyzed the firing rates of PVT neurons during footshock with laser sweeps and footshock without laser sweeps. We found that the footshock stimulus with laser activated 30 of 40 neurons and increased the overall firing rates of 40 neurons compared with the footshock without laser result. These results indicated that activation of PBN-PVT projections could enhance PVT neuronal responses to aversive stimulation.

While in general the writing of the manuscript could be improved, I found the use of subjective terms of emotion like sadness and misery particularly problematic. Framing of the study within the constraints of aversion may be more appropriate here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Now we have reframed this manuscript. We have revised the text to avoid using subjective terms of emotions. We used terms including anxiety-like, depression-like, fear-like behaviors, freezing, aversion-like behaviors.

We also replaced the terms “rescue” “relieve” with “reduce”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1 it appears that the density of PBN projections is higher in the middle and posterior PVT (pPVT). The authors should better highlight this observation in the text, especially considering that the notion of the pPVT being a particularly aversive region of the PVT is now supported by various studies. The overall framing of the PBN-PVT pathway as involved in aversion fits well with the anatomical distribution of these projections.</p></disp-quote><p>We injected AAV2/8-EF1α-DIO-EGFP into PBN of <italic>VgluT2-ires-Cre</italic> mice.

When using the constitutively expensed ChR2 in the PBN to demonstrate glutamatergic projections to the PVT, please show whether there is contamination from adjacent brain stem structures like the LC and DRN, which project to the PVT and are known to contain glutamatergic neurons (vglut1 and vglut3, respectively).

We further divided the laser ON period (5−10 minutes) into five one-minute periods and analyzed the velocity, non-moving time, center time, travel distance, and jumping behaviors (<italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2C−G</italic>). We found that the velocity and non-moving time were increased, and the center time was decreased in the ChR2 mice during most periods (<italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2C−E</italic>). Furthermore, we observed that the distance and jumping behaviors were increased mainly in the first one-minute period in ChR2 mice (<italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2F−G</italic>). This detailed analysis indicated that optogenetic activation induced brief and robust running, jumping behaviors, and persistent anxiety-like behaviors, such as less time spent in the center. These new results have been included in <italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2</italic> and described in the text. Please see Page 7 Line 179 to Line 189. We also discussed this on Page 14 Line 396 to Line 403.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors should provide a Cre-negative control for Figure 5G-N, given that tdTomato Ai14 mice can have baseline levels of tdTomato expression even in the absence of Cre. This is highly important because the transneuronal transduction of AAV1-Cre is generally limited and has never been tested in PVT.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We used the Ai9 allele (Stock No. 007909). “Both Ai14 and Ai9 may exhibit low levels of tdTomato expression prior to exposure to Cre recombinase – but the tdTomato expression levels after Cre recombination are greater than those baseline levels. As such, it is recommended that researchers include Cre-negative controls to establish the baseline tdTomato levels in their experiments” (from Jax website)<italic>.</italic></p><p>We perfused one Ai9 mouse and carefully checked the baseline tdTomato expression. We found that there were no obvious tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons in the PVT. Please see Figure 1B. We speculated that the baseline level of tdTomato expression was relatively poor, and we could not detect the tdTomato fluorescence signal in the absence of Cre.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It has been shown that PBN-VMH/PAG drive escape behaviors, whereas PBN-BNST/CEA generate aversive memory. The authors need to examine the relationship between PVT-projection and VMH/BNST-projections.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the distribution pattern of collateral projections from PVT-projecting PBN neurons. The collateral projections were found in BNST, LH, PVN, PAG but not CeA or VMH. These new results have been included in <italic>Figure 1−figure supplement 3</italic> and described in the text. Please see Page 6 Line 148 to Line 151.</p><p>Recently, Chiang <italic>et al.</italic> found two major efferent pathways from the lateral PBN: one originating from the dorsal division of lateral PBN collateralizes the VMH and PAG and a second arising from the external lateral division of lateral PBN that collateralize to the BNST and CeA. They suggested that activation of the first pathway generates the aversive memory, and activation of the second one drives escape behaviors <italic>(Chiang et al., 2020)</italic>.</p><p>In our study, the results indicate that the PBN-PVT pathway arises from both dorsal and external lateral divisions of lateral PBN and collateralizes the BNST, LH, PVN, and PAG but not the CeA or VMH. According to the location of originated PBN neurons and collateral projection pattern, we speculated that the PBN-PVT efferent pathway is different from both PBN-VMH/PAG pathway and PBN-BNST/CeA pathway. We discussed this on Page 15 Line 444 to Page 16 Line 457.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors need to examine the cellular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons, whether it originates from known PBN neuronal subtypes such as CGRP, Tac1, Pdyn, Nts et al.</p></disp-quote><p>To examine the molecular identity of PVT-projecting PBN neurons, we have now performed the RNAscope experiments detecting <italic>VgluT2, Tac1, Tacr1, Pdyn</italic> mRNA, and fluorescent immunostaining detecting CGRP protein in the PBN. We found that about 94.4% of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons expressed <italic>VgluT2</italic> mRNA. We also found that tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons were only partially co-labeled with <italic>Tacr1</italic> mRNA (38.0%), <italic>Tac1</italic> mRNA (6.4%)<italic>,</italic> or <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA (23.0%), but not with CGRP.</p><p>These results indicate that the majority of PVT-projecting PBN neurons are glutamatergic neurons and these neurons do not specifically originate from subpopulations labeled by Tacr1, Tac1, Pdyn, or CGRP.

As authors mentioned in discussion part, a recent study revealed that the PBN neurons project to ILN, which is relatively closed to the PVT. The authors need to carefully examine their manipulation experiments especially optogenetic stimulation. They need to make sure that the effect they observed was not due to the activation of PBN-ILN pathway. Since activation of PBN-ILN pathway induced pain-related behavior which could be very similar to negative emotions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the virus expression and optic fiber tips locations. Please see <italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 1</italic> (ChR2 experiments) and Figure 4<italic>−figure supplement 1</italic> (NpHR3.0 experiments). The virus was expressed in the PBN, and the optic fibers were above the PVT. These results confirmed that we manipulated the PBN-PVT pathway without affecting the PBN-ILN pathway.</p><p>We also performed pharmacogenetic activation of PVT-projecting PBN neurons and found that basal nociceptive thresholds or the formalin-induced pain behaviors were not affected (<italic>Figure 3−figure supplement 2</italic>). We speculated that PBN-PVT pathway might not be involved in nociceptive information processing. We also discussed this on Page 17 Line 494 to Line 502.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the cue-dependent optogenetics conditioning test: activation of the PBN-PVT projection induces instant aversion and freezing but not drives associative fear learning. -- Could it be simply because the conditioning (6 times 30 seconds light stimulation) was too weak? The authors should try a prolong conditioning protocol that resemble drug CPP such as 30 min light stimulation at paired side.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now performed a prolonged conditioned place aversion that mimics drug-induced condition place aversion (<italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2H−I</italic>), and we found that optogenetic activation of the PBN-PVT projection did not induce aversion in the postconditioning test on Day 4.</p><p>These new results have been included in <italic>Figure 2−figure supplement 2H−I</italic>, and were described in the text.
