Optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, normally inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices and thalamus inhibited neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Systemic treatment of alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, and the effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. This demonstrates that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus is both sufficient and necessary for the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, when the light was delivered in the basolateral amygdala, local activation of systemic JF-NP-26 reduced pain thresholds, whereas inactivation of alloswitch-1 enhanced analgesia. Electrophysiological analysis showed that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of presumed BLA input, and decreased BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons. Both effects were reversed by optical silencing and reinstated by optical reactivation of alloswitch-1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the action of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis is not homogenous, and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the BLA may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. This could explain the suboptimal effect of mGlu5 NAMs on pain in human studies and validate photopharmacology as an important tool to determine ideal target sites for systemic drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photopharmacology</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>neuronal activity</kwd><kwd>metabotropic glutamate receptor</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GR-2016-02362046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Notartomaso</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.13039/501100011033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llebaria</surname><given-names>Amadeu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERDF A way of making Europe</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projects I+D+i CTQ2017-89222-R and PID2020-120499RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llebaria</surname><given-names>Amadeu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CSIC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201980E011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llebaria</surname><given-names>Amadeu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Departament de Recerca i Universitats Generalitat de Catalunya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017SGR1604 and 2021SGR00508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llebaria</surname><given-names>Amadeu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS038261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neugebauer</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Photopharmacological manipulations of mGlu5 receptors with light-sensitive negative allosteric modulators show brain region-specific roles in pain modulation and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the amygdala may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light-based tools have transformed modern biology. Beyond the established biomolecular detection and visualization technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu and Shroff, 2022</xref>), recent developments use light as a control element to direct the activity of cells and biomolecules in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szobota and Isacoff, 2010</xref>). The strategic introduction of chromophores as light-responsive molecular elements in cells has resulted in a precise regulation of biological function with high spatial, temporal, and biochemical precision. After light absorption, the chromophore undergoes chemical changes that modify the structure and function of the receptor and can be reversibly activated and deactivated.</p><p>Photopharmacology (or optopharmacology) is an innovative technique that combines the use of light and photoresponsive molecules to obtain precise spatiotemporal control of drug activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paoletti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hüll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Cano et al., 2023</xref>). As such, in vivo photopharmacology has emerged as a unique approach to identifying mechanisms of drug actions and as the doorway to precision medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hüll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Velema et al., 2014</xref>). Using light-sensitive drugs, it is possible to optimize the efficacy of new therapeutic agents and minimize their adverse effects resulting from widespread actions after systemic administration. The use of photopharmacology-based approaches to interrogate receptors in the brain is attractive due to the possibilities of manipulating the activity of specific localizations during defined times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matera and Bregestovski, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Photopharmacological approaches have recently been explored for pain modulation by members of our team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Font et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Notartomaso et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pereira et al., 2023</xref>) and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Landra-Willm et al., 2023</xref>). The drug treatment of neuropathic pain, i.e., chronic pain originating from damage or disease of the somatosensory system, remains a major therapeutic challenge and unmet medical need because of severe side effects and a high percentage of patients resistant to medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fornasari, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>). Neuropathic pain reflects the development of neuroplasticity that drives nociceptive sensitization, i.e., the amplification of pain signal transmission in most stations of the pain neuraxis, including regions of the pain matrix that encode the perceptive and emotional-affective components of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Latremoliere and Woolf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carozzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colloca et al., 2017</xref>). Targeting glutamate receptors represents a potential strategy aimed at restraining the maladaptive form of synaptic plasticity associated with chronic pain, and photomolecular tools directed at glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2017</xref>) receptors have been developed combining chemical and genetic techniques.</p><p>A large body of evidence suggests that type-5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptors are candidate drug targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain. mGlu5 receptors, which belong to group-I mGlu receptors, are coupled to G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins, and their activation leads to polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, with the ensuing formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicoletti et al., 2011</xref>). mGlu5 receptors are widely expressed in most regions of the pain neuraxis and can contribute to the development of nociceptive sensitization. Pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors has mostly shown antinociceptive activity in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazzitelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicoletti et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, oral administration of a mGlu5 receptor-negative allosteric modulator (NAM, fenobam), had minimal temporary analgesic effects and no clinically or statistically significant persistent analgesic effect on heat/capsaicin-induced cutaneous hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavallone et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be determined if, and to what extent, region-specific actions are involved in the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor NAMs, considering that opposing actions have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiritoshi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To address this question, we applied photopharmacology to identify brain region-specific functions of mGlu5 in neuropathic pain, using the well-established chronic constriction injury (CCI) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Xie, 1988</xref>). We designed a new experimental strategy that combined the systemic application of photocaged, or photoswitchable compounds with their optical activation, silencing or reactivation in specific brain regions. We tested two functionally distinct light-sensitive mGlu5 receptor ligands: (i) a caged derivative of the mGlu5 receptor NAM raseglurant (compound JF-NP-26), which is inactive on its own and activated by light in the visible spectrum (405 nm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Font et al., 2017</xref>; and, (ii) the photoswitchable mGlu5 receptor NAM alloswitch-1, which is active on its own, is inactivated by light at 405 nm, and can be re-activated by light at 520 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pittolo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The use of light allows a highly restricted spatio-temporal control of drug activity without genetic manipulation of targeted receptor proteins (as opposed to optogenetics). In addition, light in the visible spectrum does not damage CNS tissue and can be delivered multiple times if needed. The use of photoactive drugs also allows an extremely rapid control of pain, circumventing the anatomical barrier that limits the access of analgesic agents to their target sites. For example, light-induced activation of JF-NP-26 in the thalamus caused rapid and robust analgesia in a mouse model of breakthrough cancer pain, a sudden severe, and transient type of pain that may develop in cancer patients under treatment with opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Notartomaso et al., 2022</xref>). Light-activation of JF-NP-26 can help identify the site within the pain neuraxis where mGlu5 receptor blockade is <italic>sufficient</italic> to cause analgesia. In contrast, light-inactivation of alloswitch-1 allows to establish the region where mGlu5 receptor blockade is <italic>necessary</italic> for the induction of analgesia. In combination with electrophysiological analyses, the photopharmacological approach can shed light on the functional circuit controlling pain and other nervous system functions in response to the activation of mGlu5 receptors.</p><p>For brain region-specific optical activation and inactivation of mGlu5 NAMs to determine the site of action of mGlu5 receptors, we selected prefrontal cortical (infralimbic, prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices) and subcortical (thalamus and amygdala) regions that have been implicated in sensory, affective and cognitive aspects of pain and pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colloca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neugebauer et al., 2023</xref>). This study shows that prefrontal cortical regions and thalamus are necessary and sufficient for the antinociceptive effects of mGlu5 receptor blockade by systemic NAMs in neuropathic pain conditions. Unexpectedly, however, local mGlu5 receptor inhibition in the basolateral amygdala produced pronociceptive rather than antinociceptive effects by blocking feedforward inhibition of the central nucleus of amygdala without affecting amygdala output to prelimbic cortex (see Figure 4). Thus, the use of light-sensitive drugs allowed the demonstration of a heterogenous function of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis, which may have important implications for the application of precision medicine in the treatment of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the region-specific behavioral and electrophysiological effects of mGlu5 receptor blockade with caged and photoswitchable NAMs in neuropathic pain using photopharmacology.

Our previous work showed increased feedforward inhibition of prefrontal cortex due to increased activity in BLA in pain, and therefore, restoring prefrontal cortical output was able to inhibit pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neugebauer et al., 2023</xref>). We conducted in vivo electrophysiological recordings of individual pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex in anesthetized mice 16 days after CCI induction. Systemically applied alloswitch-1 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased neuronal activity, but inactivation of alloswitch-1 with blue-violet light illumination in the BLA had no significant effect, arguing against a contribution of mGlu5 in the BLA. Furthermore, reactivation of alloswitch-1 with green light illumination in the BLA did not mimic the effect of systemic alloswitch-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we explored another BLA output and tested the hypothesis that inhibition of mGlu5 in the BLA would decrease feedforward inhibition of neurons in the central nucleus (CeA) and hence increase their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), which has been shown to correlate positively with pain behaviors through projections to several brain areas involved in behavioral modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neugebauer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To do so we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of neurons in the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) in brain slices obtained from neuropathic mice 16 days after CCI induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j and k</xref>). CeA neurons receive direct excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory inputs from the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neugebauer, 2020</xref>). Glutamatergic-driven IPSCs and monosynaptic EPSCs were evoked in CeLC neurons by focal electrical stimulation in the BLA as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). Synaptic responses were evaluated before (ACSF) and during alloswitch-1 bath application, and under blue-violet or green light illumination to block and reinstate, respectively, the pharmacological activity of alloswitch-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l and m</xref>). Both EPSCs and IPSCs were blocked by a glutamate receptor antagonist (CNQX, 20 µM), confirming glutamatergic EPSCs and glutamate-driven IPSCs (IPSCs were additionally blocked by bicuculline, not shown). Alloswitch-1 (100 nM) had significant inhibitory effects on IPSCs at the BLA-CeLC synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l and n</xref>), which was reversed by inactivation with blue-violet light (5 min, 0.5 Hz, 500 ms) so that IPSCs were not significantly different from baseline. Reactivation with green light (5 min, 0.5 Hz, 500 ms) decreased IPSCs. Alloswitch-1 by itself and its inactivation and reactivation had no significant effects on EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3m and o</xref>). Accordingly, alloswitch-1 decreased the inhibition/excitation (I/E) ratio significantly; this effect was reversed with blue-violet light for optical inactivation and was reinstated with green light for reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3p</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ photopharmacological tools to compare and contrast distinct roles of mGlu5 receptors in different regions of the pain matrix.</p><p>The net effect of systemic administration of alloswitch-1 was the enhancement of pain thresholds, which is in line with findings obtained with other mGlu5 receptor NAMs in models of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lax et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that the overall effect of the drug across its target regions within the pain neuraxis is the induction of analgesia. However, the combined use of mGlu5 NAMs JF-NP-26 (which is activated by blue-violet light) and alloswitch-1 (which is inactivated by blue-violet light and re-activated by green light) showed for the first time that responses to mGlu5 receptor blockade are not homogenous in different regions of the pain matrix. Increases in pain thresholds after local activation of JF-NP-26 in a specific brain region indicate that mGlu5 receptor blockade in that region is sufficient for the induction of analgesia. In contrast, loss of analgesia after local inactivation of allowitch-1 suggests that mGlu5 receptor blockade in that region is necessary for the overall behavioral effect of a systemic mGlu5 receptor NAM. This innovative approach allowed us to uncover the heterogeneity and complexity of mGlu5 receptor blockade in pain processing, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain. By using precise spatial control of mGlu5 receptor function, we were able to dissect the contributions of specific brain regions to the overall analgesic response.</p><p>We found that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the contralateral ventrobasal thalamus and infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was sufficient for the induction of analgesia and was also required for the analgesic activity of a systemically administered mGlu5 receptor NAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Blockade of mGlu5 receptors in these regions resulted in increased pain thresholds, indicating their crucial involvement in the analgesic response. Conversely, selective optical inactivation of systemic alloswitch-1 in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices and thalamus blocked the analgesic effect. This observation is particularly remarkable, considering that alloswitch-1 remained active and blocked mGlu5 receptors in all other regions of the pain system. These data suggest that regulation of pain thresholds by mGlu5 receptors in the ventrobasal thalamus and the two more ventral mPFC subregions is not redundant, but rather complementary, and that a connection between these three regions is a main target for systemic mGlu5 NAMs in the induction of analgesia in models of neuropathic pain. Nociceptive sensitization has been consistently associated with hypoactivity of pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex, and activation of pyramidal neurons causes analgesia in models of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2018</xref>). A simplistic hypothesis is that alloswitch-1 or light-activated JF-NP-26 caused analgesia by antagonizing mGlu5 receptors expressed by inhibitory interneurons, or by excitatory neurons that preferentially activate inhibitory interneurons, within the local circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, light-induced inactivation of allowitch-1 in the contralateral anterior cingulate cortex did not abrogate the analgesic activity of the drug. While mGlu5 receptor blockade in the anterior cingulate cortex was not necessary for the overall analgesic effect of systemically administered mGlu5 NAM, antinociceptive effects of mGlu5 receptor blockade with JF-NP-26 in that region suggest that it plays a significant role in modulating pain behaviors.</p><p>There are contrasting reports on the role of mPFC mGlu5 receptors in pain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiritoshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji and Neugebauer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David-Pereira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the application of mGlu5 receptor antagonists in the ipsilateral prelimbic and infralimbic cortices enhanced neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2012</xref>), whereas ipsilateral infralimbic application reduced arthritis-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David-Pereira et al., 2016</xref>) and bilateral application in prelimbic cortex caused antinociception in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). Our photopharmacological tools allowed us to establish that pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the contralateral mPFC caused antinociception in the CCI model of neuropathic pain, and that prelimbic and infralimbic regions, but not anterior cingulate cortex, play a critical role in mediating systemic mGlu5 NAM antinociception. Our electrophysiological in vivo recordings provide evidence for the control of pro-nociceptive ON-cells in the RVM by prelimbic output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that is decreased by mGlu5 receptor inhibition (reinstating the local effects of alloswitch-1 in the prelimbic cortex) in neuropathic pain. Accordingly, our ex vivo brain slice physiology experiments found increased excitatory drive onto prelimbic pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, blockade of mGlu5 in the thalamus also inhibited pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), possibly through projections to cortical regions such as somatosensory and insular cortices, with the latter projecting strongly to the prelimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixsaut and Gräff, 2022</xref>). Previous studies showed increased mGlu5 receptor expression in the mPFC ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). We used an in vivo method to measure the primary signal transduction mechanism of mGlu5 receptors, i.e., polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. The method was based on a pre-treatment with lithium ions (to block the conversion of inositol phosphate, InsP, into free inositol) followed by systemic activation of mGlu5 receptors with a selective PAM (VU0360172) and measurements of InsP accumulation. We found that mGlu5 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was significantly amplified in all subregions of the contralateral mPFC and in the contralateral amygdala after induction of neuropathic pain whereas mGlu5 receptor protein levels were significantly increased only in the contralateral infralimbic cortex of neuropathic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that, at least in the anterior cingulate cortex, prelimbic cortex, and basolateral amygdala, mGlu5 receptors become hyperactive after the induction of pain. It remains to be determined if this is mediated by the enhanced coupling of mGlu5 receptors to G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins, increased expression of phospholipase-Cβ, or other mechanisms. Interestingly, mGlu5 receptor signaling was down-regulated in the thalamus of neuropathic mice, but mGlu5 blockade in the thalamus still had antinociceptive effects (see below). Down-regulation of mGlu5 receptor signaling in the thalamus might represent a compensatory mechanism aimed at mitigating pain in neuropathic mice.</p><p>By elucidating the regional specificity of mGlu5 receptor modulation, this study expands our understanding of the neural circuitry involved in pain processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our findings have implications for the development of targeted therapies for pain management. Selective modulation of mGlu5 receptor activity in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortex presents an intriguing opportunity to harness their specific analgesic effects while minimizing potential side effects associated with global mGlu5 receptor blockade. The differential roles of mPFC regions in pain modulation highlight their unique contributions to the complex pain circuitry. Targeting the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices allows for a more precise and localized approach, potentially reducing the risk of off-target effects and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of mGlu5 receptor-based interventions. This selective modulation strategy holds promise for the development of targeted and personalized treatments for neuropathic pain, offering a potential avenue for improved pain management with reduced adverse effects. Future research aimed at elucidating the specific mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of mGlu5 receptor modulation in these cortices will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic interventions and optimization of pain management strategies.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Putative circuitry of brain region-specific functions of mGlu5 receptors in pain modulation.</title><p>Hypothesized neural circuitry based on in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology and behavioral data. mGlu5 receptor blockade decreases feedforward inhibition from BLA to CeA to increase amygdala output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i–p</xref>) and facilitate pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and m</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), but has no effect on mPFC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d-f</xref>). mGlu5 receptor blockade in the mPFC increases pyramidal cell output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–h</xref>) to decrease the activity of pronociceptive RVM ON-cells via feedforward inhibition, resulting in decreased pain behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and k</xref>). mGlu5 receptor blockade in the VPL resulted in antinociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and n</xref>). mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex; VPL = ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus; BLA = basolateral amygdala; CeA = central nucleus of amygdala; RVM = rostral ventromedial medulla; ↑ facilitation; ↓ inhibition; Ø no effect.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94931-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A somewhat surprising finding of our study was the unique role of the amygdala (BLA) in mGlu5 function in neuropathic pain. Photopharmacology revealed for the first time that the BLA is a voice out of the chorus in the modulation of pain by mGlu5 receptors in neuropathic mice. Light-induced activation of JF-NP-26 in the right BLA reduced pain thresholds in neuropathic mice, indicating pro-nociceptive effects, whereas light-induced inactivation of alloswitch-1 in the BLA further enhanced analgesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also found that JF-NP-26 activation in the BLA decreased risk-taking behavior in neuropathic mice, consistent with increased anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that mGlu5 receptors in BLA neurons serve antinociceptive functions in neuropathic pain, and this may limit the overall effect of mGlu5 NAMs in the treatment of pain. One possible explanation we considered is that mGlu5 receptors in the BLA modulate connections with the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. These connections involve direct excitation as well as feedforward inhibition, and previous studies showed that electrical stimulation of BLA neurons enhanced inhibition of prelimbic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2003</xref>) and decreased excitation/inhibition balance in pain resulted in impaired mPFC output and behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiritoshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheriyan and Sheets, 2020</xref>). Therefore, mGlu5 NAM could be pronociceptive by decreasing the excitation/inhibition balance of BLA inputs to prelimbic regions. Results from our in vivo electrophysiological experiments, however, do not support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, our ex vivo brain slice physiology studies found that mGlu5 NAM decreased feedforward inhibition of neurons in the CeA, an important output region for behavioral modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neugebauer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Impaired feedforward inhibition of CeA output neurons drives pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). The role of mGlu5 function in the amygdala appears to be complex. Our data suggest pronociceptive effects of mGlu5 NAM in BLA through connections with CeA, whereas previous studies reported antinociceptive effects of mGlu5 receptor blockade with MPEP in the CeA in inflammatory pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han and Neugebauer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolber et al., 2010</xref>). Administration of alloswitch-1 into CeA also decreased hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ricart-Ortega et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, a mGlu5 antagonist (MTEP) inhibited both excitatory and inhibitory transmission in CeA neurons under normal conditions and in an arthritis pain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren and Neugebauer, 2010</xref>). Thus, differential mGlu5 function in BLA and CeA may serve to shed light onto the intricate amygdala circuitry involved in pain processing and pain modulation.</p><p>In summary, the application of photopharmacology to the analysis of mGlu5 function in pain discovered novel region-specific differential actions that need to be considered when targeting these receptors as novel and improved therapeutic targets, and this may have implications for other transmitter and modulator systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drugs</title><p>JF-NP-26 (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 6% DMSO, 6% Tween 80 in saline) and alloswitch-1 (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 20% DMSO, 20% Tween 80 in saline) were kindly provided by Professor Llebaria (IQAC-CSIC, Barcelona, Spain).

Mice were placed in a dark box (20 × 20 × 40 cm) with a wire grid bottom through which the von Frey filaments (North Coast Medical, Inc, San Jose, CA, USA; bending force ranging from 0.008 to 3.5 g) were applied by using a modified version of the up-down paradigm previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). Each filament was applied five times (3 min intervals) perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw until it bent. The filament that evoked at least three paw withdrawals was assigned as the pain threshold in grams.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stereotaxic implantation of optic fibers in different brain regions</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance) and implanted with monolateral LED optic fibers (MFC_400/430–0.57_mm_SMR_C45 Doric Lenses Inc, Quebec, Canada) using dental cement and surgical screws (Agnthos, Lidingö, Sweden) in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). The following brain regions in the right hemisphere were targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paxinos and Franklin, 2008</xref>): prelimbic cortex (1.50 mm anterior to the bregma, 0.3 mm lateral to midline, 2.7 mm ventral from surface of the skull), infralimbic cortex (1.70 mm anterior, 0.3 mm, 3 mm), anterior cingulate cortex (0.5 mm anterior, 0.2 mm, 2 mm), basolateral amygdala (1.34 mm posterior, 2.9 mm, 4.7), ventral posterolateral thalamus (1.8 mm posterior, 1.5 mm, 3.5 mm). The length (mm) of the optic fibers was selected according to the targeted brain area. Previous studies from our group showed that stereotaxic insertion of optical fibers into the infralimbic cortex leaves cortical connectivity intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji and Neugebauer, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optical manipulation of drugs in different brain regions</title><p>Mice were treated with JF-NP-26, (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 6% DMSO, 6% Tween 80 in saline) or alloswitch-1 (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 20% DMSO, 20% Tween 80 in saline). Individual brain areas (infralimbic cortex, prelimbic cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, ventrobasal thalamus, and basolateral amygdala contralateral to the side of injury) were illuminated through the implanted optic fiber with conical tip (Doric Lenses Inc) with blue-violet light (405±6.5 nm) to activate JF-NP-26 or inactivate alloswitch-1 and with green light (520±19 nm) to reactivate alloswitch-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pittolo et al., 2014</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The light box was open at the top, painted white, and illuminated by a 60 W light bulb located 30 cm above the apparatus, providing illumination in the range of 380–470 lux measured on the floor of the white compartment. The dark box was painted matte black and had a removable black lid at the top. Each animal was placed at the center of the dark compartment and was allowed to explore freely both compartments for 10 min. Total number of crossings between the two compartments (defined as all four paws being within a given compartment), latency to enter the illuminated compartment, and time spent in the illuminated compartment were measured. Movement of each animal was recorded using a video camera and analyzed by a blinded operator. Neuropathic mice were treated with JF-NP-26 (10 mg/kg, i.p. in 6% DMSO, 6% Tween 80 in saline) with or without violet light delivered into the BLA. In the TST, each mouse was suspended by its tail using adhesive tape and attached to a hook.

Equal amounts of proteins (20  μg) from supernatants were separated by 8% SDS polyacrilamide gel at 100  V for 1  hr for the detection of mGlu5 receptors, using a mini-gel apparatus (Bio-Rad Mini Protean II cell, Milano, Italy). Proteins were then electroblotted on Immuno PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) for 7  min using a Trans Blot Turbo System (Bio-Rad). Filters were washed three times and blocked for 1  hr in Tris-Tween buffered saline (TTBS) containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal anti-mGlu5 receptor antibody (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat #AB76316, lot. GR45647-18). Filters were washed three times with TTBS buffer and then incubated for 1  hr with secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (1:7000, Millipore, Cat #401393–2  ML). Immunostaining was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence luminosity (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Height, IL). The blots were re-probed with monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:50000, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat # A5441, lot. 116M4801V). Statements of validation and references are on the manufacturers' websites; antibodies were validated in our previous studies, including with knock-out mice (PMID: 30190524). ImageLab 6.1 software was used for the acquisition and analysis of the Western blot image data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISA</title><p>For the assessment of mGlu5 receptor signaling, mice were injected systemically with lithium chloride (10 mM, 100 μl, i.p.) followed, after 1 hr, by i.p. injection of a positive allosteric modulator for mGlu5 (VU0360172, 30 mg/kg i.p.) to activate mGlu5 receptors. Control mice were treated with lithium chloride followed by the vehicle. Mice were sacrificed 60 min after the last injection and the brain regions were microdissected with a Vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buccinasco, MI, Italy). The selected brain regions were weighed and homogenized by sonication in 10 μl/mg of tissue of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM; pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS. Homogenates were diluted 1:50 and InsP levels were assessed with the IP-One ELISA kit (Cisbio, Codolet, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Microplate manager 6 software (MPM6 Biorad) was used for plate reading.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology in brain slices</title><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in brain slices containing the right medial prefrontal cortex or amygdala obtained from CCI mice (16 days after surgery) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yakhnitsa et al., 2022</xref>). Brains were quickly removed and immersed in an oxygenated ice-cold sucrose-based physiological solution containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 25 glucose, 5 KCl, 21 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2,</sub> and 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Coronal brain slices of 300 μm thickness were obtained using a Vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Biosystems VT Series, Nussloch, Germany) and incubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 117 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 11 glucose) at room temperature (21 °C) for at least 1 hr before patch recordings. A single brain slice was transferred to the recording chamber and submerged in ACSF (31 ± 1°C) superfusing the slice at ~2 ml/min. Only one or two brain slices per animal were used and only one neuron was recorded in each brain slice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from visually identified prelimbic or central amygdala (laterocapsular division) neurons using DIC-IR videomicroscopy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). Recording electrodes (tip resistance 5–8 MΩ) were made from borosilicate glass and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 122 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, and 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP; pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.3 with KOH and osmolarity to 280 mOsm/kg with sucrose. In some experiments, 0.2% biocytin was included in the intracellular solution on the day of the experiment. Data acquisition and analysis were done using a dual 4-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instr., Hamden, CT), low-noise Digidata 1322 or 1550B interface (Axon Instr., Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Axoclamp-2B or MulitClamp700B amplifier (Axon Instr., Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and pClamp9 or 11 software (Axon Instr.). If series resistance (monitored with pClamp9 or 11 software) changed by more than 20%, the neuron was discarded. To characterize the properties of recorded neurons, depolarizing current pulses (500 ms, 25 pA step) were applied in current clamp mode. Neurons were voltage-clamp at –70 mV or 0 mV to study excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) evoked by the electrical stimulation of presumed afferents from basolateral amygdala (BLA) using a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (David Kopf Instruments). Monosynaptic EPSCs and glutamate-driven IPSCs were completely blocked by the application of a non-NMDA receptor antagonist (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, CNQX, 20 μM). IPSCs were blocked by bicuculline (10 μM). Alloswitch-1 was applied to the brain slice by gravity-driven superfusion in ACSF (final concentration 100 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pittolo et al., 2014</xref>, 2 ml/min), and electrophysiological measurements were made 10–15 min during drug application. Illumination of the target region in the slice was done through the objective of the microscope (BX51, Olympus, Waltham, MA) with an integrated LED stimulation system (X-Cite Xylis). Photoisomerization of alloswitch-1 was achieved by illumination with blue-violet light (375±14 nm) generated by a broad-spectrum LED illumination system by passing through an AT375/28 x filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT) for 5 min (0.5 Hz, 500 ms), and was reversed by illumination with green light (545±15 nm) an AT545/30 x filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT) for 5 min (0.5 Hz, 500 ms). The electrophysiological outcome measures were assessed after 5 min and during (blue-violet or green) light application.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>Single-unit electrophysiological recordings were performed in the prelimbic cortex or RVM in CCI mice 16 days after injury. An LED optic fiber was implanted into the BLA when recording from the prelimbic area, or into the prelimbic cortex when recording from RVM. Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and anesthesia was maintained with a constant continuous infusion of propofol (5–10 mg/kg/h, i.v.) throughout the experiment. A small craniotomy allowed the stereotaxic insertion of a glass-insulated tungsten filament recording electrode (3–5 MΩ) (Frederick Haer &amp; Co., Bowdoin, ME, USA) that was lowered into the prelimbic cortex (1.50 mm anterior to the bregma, 0.3 mm lateral to midline, 1.5–2.7 mm ventral from surface of the skull) or RVM (6.48 mm posterior to bregma, 0.3–0.5 mm lateral, and 4.5–6 mm ventral) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boccella et al., 2019</xref>). Spike waveforms were displayed on an oscilloscope to ensure that the unit under study was unambiguously discriminated throughout the recording period. Signals were processed using an interface (CED 1401; Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) connected to a Pentium III PC. Spike2 software (CED, v.4) was used to create peristimulus rate histograms on-line and to store and analyze digital records of single-unit activity off-line. In the RVM, we classified ON- and OFF-cells based on their firing patterns relative to nocifensive withdrawal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fields and Heinricher, 1985</xref>). As ON-cells with a high basal firing rate can be easily misclassified as NEUTRAL-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbaro et al., 1986</xref>), potential NEUTRAL-cells with continuous spontaneous activity were verified by giving a brief bolus of anesthetic to the point that the withdrawal reflex was abolished. Indeed, the firing of spontaneously active ON-cells slows or stops with this manipulation, which unmasks reflex-related responses. Recordings were performed only from ON-cells, which have response characteristics consistent with a role in pain facilitation and accelerate firing immediately before the nocifensive reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Heinricher, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, cells were identified by a burst of activity in response to a brief (3 s) noxious mechanical stimulus (von Frey filament with bending force of 97.8 mN) applied to the hind paw contralateral to the RVM. RVM ON-cell burst activity (Hz) evoked by peripheral noxious stimulation was calculated as number of spikes in the 10 s interval starting from the beginning of the increase in firing frequency (which was at least double its spontaneous activity). In the prelimbic cortex, regular-spiking pyramidal cells were studied. Background activity (Hz) refers to neuronal activity in the absence of intentional stimulation. Neuronal activity (frequency of excitation of RVM neurons or background activity of prelimbic neurons) was measured every 5 min before and after systemic administration of alloswitch-1 and before and after optical manipulation, and was calculated as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis and data presentation</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sacha Nelson as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and all agree the work has implications beyond the pain field and has the potential to be broadly important. However, they felt the main claims are only partially supported by the data and therefore incomplete. The three main points that should be addressed are see below. We are also attaching the full reviews below for details that should help you prepare your revision.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>(1) Conduct behavioral tests that measure the &quot;affective&quot; components of pain. The behaviors examined need to be expanded beyond reflexive assays, for example, examine place preference/aversion.</p><p>(2) Provide better validation of the light-activated agents, ideally in vivo.</p><p>(3) Add missing controls, increase sample sizes, and perform the correct statistical tests. Furthermore, you should better explain/discuss the effect sizes and justify why only male mice are studied (or, if possible, add female mice).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Notartomaso et al. used optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, baseline inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, thalamus, and BLA to investigate the roles of these receptors in various brain regions in pain processing. They found that alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, but this analgesic effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. In contrast, these pharmacological effects were reversed in the BLA. They further found that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of BLA input, and decreased feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons by BLA. They thus concluded that mGlu5 receptors had differential effects in distinct brain regions. mGlu5 receptors are important receptors in pain processing, and their regional specificity has not been studied in detail.

This is an extension of their previous work using photocaged mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators and incorporates a systemically active NAM that can be locally photoswitched off and on with violet and green light, respectively. The authors found that NAM signaling in the thalamus and prefrontal cortical regions consistently reduced mechanical hypersensitivity. However, they observed divergent effects on these measures in the basolateral amygdala. The authors attempted to solve the discrepancy in behavioral measurements between mGlu5 signaling in the basolateral amygdala by determining how NAMs modulate synaptic transmission or in vivo firing and found that these effects were projection-dependent. Overall this paper presents some interesting observations, but the lack of suitable control groups, limited behavior tests, and the broad profiling approach lacks some cohesion and makes it challenging to determine where and how mGlu5 receptors are exerting these effects.</p><p>The behavior and slice physiology experiments are both lacking control groups. Given the differences in basal and mGlu5 PAM stimulated InsP levels in figure 1, including sham groups for the behavioral testing could provide further insight into how mGlu5 NAMs influence nociception. At a minimum, at least one vehicle-treated and photostimulated group should be included to rule out potential off-target effects on the contralateral brain region to the nerve injury. This could also help address whether mGlu5 NAMs are directly analgesic or anti-nociceptive.</p><p>Does photostimulation or systemic NAM injection impact other behaviors outside of mechanical withdrawal thresholds? This is important for the interpretation of these effects as pro/anti-nociceptive and not due to impacting vigilance, fear, anxiety, etc. which can affect these sensory measurements.</p><p>I appreciate the effort to link the differences in behavioral responses with NAM activation in the amygdala using slice physiology. In the proposed models, mGlu5 is proposed to exist on some upstream projections.

In the mPFC model in Figure 3, the authors are measuring a monosynaptic EPSC (presumably) from the BLA. If this model is correct, wouldn't this excitatory input also be enhanced onto the proposed mGlu5+ inhibitory neurons leading to an increase in polysynaptic IPSC amplitudes?

For example, transition of alloswtich‐1 from trans into cis (inactivation of alloswitch‐1) is optimal at wavelengths ranging from 385‐390 to 400 (Pittolo et al. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014, Ricart‐Ortega et al., ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020) (our selected wavelength was 405 ± 6.5). For the cis‐trans isomerization we used wavelengths of 520 + 19 nm, because the optimal wavelength giving a higher proportion of trans isomer in the photostationary state is between 500 and 550 nm (Ricart‐Ortega et al., ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020). Please, see also response to reviewer 3. Information has been added on page 11.</p><p>With regard to the potential spread of light (“range”), the light spread with a conical tip cannula is less than 200 micrometers (see details at the manufacturer’s website https://doriclenses.com/downloads/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNote_Illumination_FiberTip_V1.0.0.pdf). This is now stated on page 11.</p><p>We used well established coordinates for stereotaxic injections and ensured consistency by using mice of similar age and weight. As mentioned in Methods, cannulas were custom‐designed with specific lengths appropriate for each targeted region to ensure accurate placement. We checked the correct position of the fiber in pilot experiments to ensure the precision of the area of illumination. We have decades of experience with stereotaxic implantations and injections into different brain regions, but admittedly we did not perform a histological analysis in mice used for photopharmacological experiments, partially because tissues were collected for molecular analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The role of ACC in pain processing is typically affective and thus is tested by conditioned place aversion/preference assays, and so the authors may consider the application of these assays to further validate their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see our response to Reviewer #1.

In the proposed models, mGlu5 is proposed to exist on some upstream projections. However, no direct effects were observed from these proposed inhibitory (Figure 3a-h) or excitatory (Figure i-p) populations, arguing against this.

We agree that our previous diagram needed clarification and have updated Figure 3a (and summary Figure 4) accordingly. In the mPFC, mGlu5 would act on interneurons that modulate excitatory input (presumably from BLA) presynaptically for decreased excitatory drive of pyramidal cells. Thus, blockade of mGlu5 with alloswitch would remove the inhibitory influence and shift towards excitatory drive of pyramidal cells, which is what the data show (increased EPSCs). Regarding the BLA‐CeA synapse, our data suggest that mGlu5 preferentially acts through the feedforward inhibition pathway rather than on the monosynaptic excitatory drive of CeA output neurons. It is possible that different synaptic signaling mechanisms are involved at interneuron versus output neuron synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the point above, does Alloswitch-1 modulate membrane properties of the recorded output neurons and might there also be a direct effect on these microcircuits?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting point. The focus of the brain slice physiology was on the synaptic circuitry and feedforward inhibition in particular. Given the time‐sensitivity protocol, which involved four different manipulations (predrug, drug, and two different light administrations), we did not include a thorough analysis of membrane properties and excitability. However, we did not overserve any changes in holding current or conductance in the voltage‐clamp experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What light intensities were used, and does violet illumination affect cellular health?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to reviewer 2. The light intensities used in our experiments were carefully chosen based on previous studies to ensure effective isomerization of the photoswitchable ligands while minimizing potential phototoxicity or cellular damage (Pittolo et al.,Nat. Chem. Biol., 2014; Gómez‐Santacana et al. ACS Cent. Sci., Ricart‐Ortega et al., ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020). Regarding the potential effects of illumination on cellular health, we took this concern into consideration for our experimental design. We selected 405 nm, which is fully located in the visible spectrum (violet range) and is less energetic and less toxic than UV‐light. The extent of alloswitch‐1 photoisomerization from trans‐to‐cis configuration is comparable for illumination with 380 or 405 nm. Still, violet light, particularly at high intensities and prolonged exposure durations, may induce phototoxicity and affect cellular viability. To mitigate this risk and minimize any adverse effects on cellular health, we employed pulsed light delivery protocols, as pulsed light illumination allows for precise control over the duration and intensity of light exposure, reducing the risk of phototoxicity while ensuring effective isomerization of the photoswitchable ligands. By using pulsed light, we aimed to strike a balance between achieving optimal experimental outcomes and safeguarding cellular viability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
