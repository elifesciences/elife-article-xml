While providing a good quantitative description of RT data in terms of abstract perceptual representations, EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place. To address this limitation, we introduce the visual accumulator model (VAM), in which convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted to trial-level RTs and raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli from individual subjects in a unified Bayesian framework. Models fitted to large-scale cognitive training data from a stylized flanker task captured individual differences in congruency effects, RTs, and accuracy. We find evidence that the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations, demonstrating how our framework can be used to relate visual representations to behavioral outputs. Together, our work provides a probabilistic framework for both constraining neural network models of vision with behavioral data and studying how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual processing</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>neural network modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining biologically-plausible neural network models of vision with traditional decision-making models enables a detailed characterization of how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions from raw sensory inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decision-making under time pressure is deeply embedded within the activities of daily life. To study the cognitive and neural processes underlying decision-making, psychologists fit computational models to response time (RT) data gathered from relatively simple cognitive tasks. Evidence accumulation models (EAMs), such as the diffusion-decision model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>) and linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Heathcote, 2008</xref>), are the most successful and widely-used computational models of joint RT and choice data from decision-making tasks. In the EAM framework, sensory evidence is accumulated (possibly with noise) until reaching a threshold, at which point an overt response is generated. As such, decision-making is described in terms of a small number of interpretable parameters that capture basic cognitive processes. Empirically, EAMs have been shown to capture RT distributions from a variety of cognitive tasks at the individual subject level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Heathcote, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Despite this empirical success and theoretical merit, the simple characterization of decision-making encapsulated by EAMs results in somewhat restrictive applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Wagenmakers, 2020</xref>). In the context of visual tasks, EAMs do not typically provide a detailed specification of how raw visual stimuli are transformed into evidence and consequently do not explain the visual processing steps underlying decision-making. A number of recent modeling efforts have addressed this limitation by adapting convolutional neural network (CNN) models used in image classification tasks to the novel purpose of generating RTs or RT proxies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spoerer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumbhar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rafiei et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goetschalckx et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trueblood et al., 2021</xref>), a strategy we also pursue here. CNNs are useful in this regard since they are image-computable—they accept arbitrary images as input—and capture important characteristics of biological vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindsay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kriegeskorte, 2015</xref>). Early CNN layers exhibit spatially-organized units with local receptive fields, analogous to the retinotopic organization of the early mammalian visual pathway. The concatenation of multiple layers forms a hierarchy in which progressively more abstract features are extracted in deeper layers, in a way that is globally similar to the primate visual cortical hierarchy.</p><p>Here, we integrate CNN models for visual feature extraction with traditional EAMs of speeded decision-making tasks in a framework we call the visual accumulator model (VAM). As in the prior models referenced above, the VAM accepts raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli as inputs and generates RTs and choices as outputs. The key feature of the VAM that distinguishes it from prior models is that the CNN and EAM parameters are <italic>jointly fitted</italic> to the RT, choice, and visual stimulus data from individual participants in a unified Bayesian framework. Thus, both the visual representations learned by the CNN and the EAM parameters are directly constrained by behavioral data. In contrast, prior models first optimize the CNN to perform the behavioral task, then separately fit a minimal set of high-level CNN parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rafiei et al., 2024</xref>) and/or the EAM parameters to behavioral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trueblood et al., 2021</xref>). As we will show, fitting the CNN with human data—rather than optimizing the model to perform a task—has significant consequences for the representations learned by the model.</p><p>We leverage the VAM to explore how abstract, task-relevant information is extracted from raw sensory inputs, and we investigate how the behavioral phenomenon of congruency effects arises as a consequence of the representation geometry learned by the CNN. In doing so, our framework also addresses one of the main criticisms of deep neural network models of vision that are optimized to perform particular tasks (e.g. object identification): these models do not account for many results from psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindsay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malhotra et al., 2022</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Modeling framework</title><p>We first describe the task—Lost in Migration (LIM), available as part of the Lumosity cognitive training platform—which will serve to ground the discussion of the model. LIM is a stylized version of the well-known arrows flanker task used in the study of cognitive control and visual attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoffels and van der Molen, 1988</xref>). In LIM, participants are shown stimuli composed of several arrow-shaped birds. The task is to indicate the direction of the central bird (the target) using the arrow keys on the keyboard, ignoring the direction of the surrounding birds (the flankers). Participants engage with the task at home and are rewarded via a composite score that takes into account both speed and accuracy.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task and model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, Lost in Migration task.

See Methods for additional details.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98351-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The stimuli used in LIM vary along several dimensions that are not present in the standard flanker task, implying potentially complicated stimulus-behavior dependencies that are well-suited to the VAM. First, both targets and flankers can be independently oriented left, right, up, or down, such that there are four possible response directions (the standard arrow flanker task allows for only left and right responses). Second, the layout of the targets and the flankers can appear in one of seven configurations: left/right/up/down ‘V,’ horizontal/vertical line, and cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Last, the target can be centered anywhere within the 640×480 pixel game window, subject to edge constraints.</p><p>As with other flanker tasks, a given trial is said to be congruent if targets and flankers are oriented in the same direction, and incongruent otherwise. A consistent observation from studies employing the flanker task and related conflict tasks are <italic>congruency effects</italic>: participants are slower and less accurate on incongruent trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simon, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stroop, 1935</xref>). Congruency effects are considered to index a specific aspect of cognitive control: they indicate the extent to which an individual can selectively attend to task-relevant information and ignore irrelevant information.</p><p>The visual accumulator is an image-computable EAM, composed of a CNN and EAM chained together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Minimally processed (pixel-space) visual stimuli are provided as inputs to the CNN. The outputs of the CNN correspond to the mean rates at which evidence is accumulated (the drift rates), one for each possible response (four in the case of LIM). The EAM then generates choices and RTs through a noisy evidence accumulation process. For each participant in the dataset, we fit one such model (CNN + EAM) jointly using that participant’s visual stimuli, RTs, and choices. Building on prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kucukelbir et al., 2017</xref>), we developed an automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) algorithm that simultaneously optimizes the parameters of the CNN and learns the posterior distribution over the LBA parameters (Methods).</p><p>The particular EAM we adopt is the linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Heathcote, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) since it can be applied to tasks with more than two possible responses, though the general VAM framework is compatible with other EAMs that have a closed-form or easily approximated likelihood. The LBA parameters fitted in the VAM are the decision threshold <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, the non-decision time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and a parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that controls the dispersion of the initial accumulator values (the drift rate means are fitted implicitly via the CNN). We used a seven layer CNN architecture (six convolutional layers, one fully-connected layer) in the VAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To speed up the training process, the first two convolutional layers were initialized with the parameters from a 16-layer VGG CNN trained to classify the ImageNet dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>All of the code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pauljaffe/vam">https://github.com/pauljaffe/vam</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaffe, 2025</xref>) and data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775513">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775513</ext-link>) used to train the VAMs and reproduce our results are publicly available.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Models capture human behavioral data</title><p>We fitted a separate VAM to LIM data (visual stimuli, RTs, choices) from each of 75 Lumosity users (participants). We selected participants who had practiced Lost in Migration extensively (≥25,000 trials) and used data from a later stage of practice to minimize learning effects (≥ each participant’s 50<sup>th</sup> gameplay). These participants varied in age (23–87 y) and in their behavior (mean RT, accuracy, congruency effects), allowing us to examine how well our framework captured individual differences.</p><p>To assess the model fits, we compared the mean RT, accuracy, RT congruency effect (incongruent trial mean RT minus congruent trial mean RT), and accuracy congruency effect (congruent trial accuracy minus incongruent trial accuracy) of each model/participant pair on a set of holdout stimuli, separate from those used to train the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We found that the RT congruency effect could be attributed to a reduction in the mean target drift rate parameter on incongruent vs. congruent trials, while the accuracy congruency effect could be attributed to a higher mean flanker drift rate on incongruent trials relative to the non-target (other) mean drift rates on congruent trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Specifically, we quantified how well the target direction could be decoded from the activation matrix of a given layer with a linear support vector machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>) (SVM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Note that only incongruent trials were used in these analyses, since the classifier could use the flanker direction to classify the target on congruent trials, artificially inflating performance. Decoding performance on holdout data for target direction was near chance (27%) in the first network layer and increased to nearly perfect decoding (≥ 97%) at layer 4, with a sharp increase between the second and third convolutional layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The increase in target decoding accuracy from shallower to deeper network layers is generally consistent with neural recording studies in mammals and other neural networks studies that document more accurate decoding of abstract variables (e.g. object or category identity) in higher visual/cortical regions and deeper neural network layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brincat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muratore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tafazoli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated target selectivity at the single-unit level by quantifying the mutual information between each unit’s activity and target direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muratore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tafazoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast to the population-level decoding results, information for target direction exhibited a non-monotonic ‘hunchback’ profile across the convolutional layers, then increased sharply in the final fully-connected layer. The observation that single-unit information for target direction decreased between the fourth and final convolutional layers indicates that the units become progressively less selective for particular target directions. Since population-level decoding remained high in these layers, this suggests a transition from representing target direction with specialized ‘target neurons’ to a more distributed, ensemble-level code. Notably, a similar transition in coding properties takes place along the cortical hierarchy, with higher-order cortical regions exhibiting a reduction in units with ‘pure’ selectivity and a corresponding increase in units with mixed selectivity for multiple task or stimulus features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>). The high proportion of units with mixed selectivity results in a high-dimensional representation in which all task-relevant information can easily be extracted with simple linear decoders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cover, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pagan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these ideas, we found that the dimensionality of target representations as measured by the participation ratio (Methods) increased sharply in the last two convolutional layers (Conv5–Conv6), paralleling the reduction in single-unit information for target direction in these layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The high-dimensional representation observed in these layers may enable the VAM to capture the rich stimulus-behavior dependencies present in the participant data. The reduction in dimensionality in the final fully-connected layer, and concomitant increase in single-unit information for target direction, may reflect a strong constraint to select the correct target direction imposed by the task. Notably, the hunchback-shaped profile we observed in the dimensionality of representations has also been observed along visual cortical regions of the rat ventral stream and in other neural network studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansuini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muratore et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To more explicitly characterize the degree of directional selectivity in each layer, we quantified the proportion of units that responded preferentially to one of the four target directions. We separated units according to the sign of modulation and degree of directional selectivity: ‘selective (+)’ and ‘selective (-)’ units were more (or less) active for one target direction relative to the other three; ‘complex’ units exhibited significant modulation by target direction without a clear directional preference (Methods).</p><p>The proportion of units that were selective for a particular direction increased steadily from the second to the fourth convolutional layer, with most units exhibiting positive modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Between the fourth and final convolutional layers, the proportion of units with positive target direction modulation decreased, while the proportion of units with negative and complex modulation increased.</p><p>In summary, a strong representation for target direction emerged in the middle convolutional layers, and was initially supported by a simple low-dimensional code, with information for each target direction concentrated in separate populations of directionally-tuned units. In later convolutional layers, target direction was supported by a more distributed, complex, and high-dimensional code, with weaker directional selectivity at the single-unit level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Extraction and suppression of distracting stimulus information</title><p>How do the models’ visual representations enable target selectivity for stimuli that vary along several irrelevant dimensions? The mammalian visual system solves the analogous problem of visual object recognition through representations that become increasingly invariant to different object positions, sizes, and lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>). To determine whether the models learned representations that share these characteristics, we initially assessed whether the model representations for target direction are indeed invariant (or more generally, tolerant), to variation in flanker direction, stimulus layout, and horizontal/vertical position. Alternatively, the models could have learned a coding scheme in which different representations are responsible for selecting the target in each distracter context, e.g., with units that respond to the conjunction of particular target direction and layout combinations.</p><p>To assess the degree of representation tolerance, we quantified how well a linear SVM trained to classify target direction in one distracter context generalized to a different distracter context, where the distracter context is defined by a particular type of task-irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>). For example, to assess the degree of tolerance to flanker direction, we split trials into a training set where the flanker direction was fixed to a particular value (e.g. down), and a generalization set with all other flanker directions (e.g. flanker direction = left/right/up). The performance of the classifier on the generalization set measures the extent to which the target representations are tolerant (or invariant) to variability in a given type of distracting information.</p><p>For each type of distracting information, we found that generalization performance was initially near chance (25%) and increased steadily through the network layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The lower generalization performance for flanker direction observed in the deepest network layers (∼60%) can be attributed to the robust congruency effects exhibited by the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>): for the vast majority of incongruent error trials, the model chose the flanker direction, implying that flanker direction has a strong impact on model representations.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Suppression of task-irrelevant information and tolerance in task-relevant representations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Decoding accuracy of stimulus target direction in a new distracter context (generalization performance).

To examine this explicitly, we quantified how well each irrelevant stimulus feature (flanker direction, stimulus layout, horizontal/vertical position) could be decoded from the activity in each layer using the same SVM classifier methodology as we did for target direction decoding. We found that decoding accuracy for flanker direction and stimulus layout exhibited a hunchback profile in which decoding performance started low in early layers, increased in intermediate layers, and decreased in later layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The decoding accuracy for horizontal and vertical position followed a similar but shifted pattern: there was a steady increase in accuracy until the second-to-last layer, followed by a slight drop in the last layer. Partial (rather than complete) suppression of irrelevant stimulus features is expected given that these features all impact behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In agreement with the population-level decoding analyses, information for the irrelevant stimulus features exhibited a pronounced hunchback profile in the progression from shallower to deeper network layers. It is noteworthy that the suppression of irrelevant information is more pronounced at the single-unit level in that decoding accuracy remains relatively high in later layers, particularly for flanker direction. This parallels the findings discussed above for target direction, and again suggests a transition from a simple code with populations of units that are selective for particular stimulus features to a more distributed, ensemble-level code.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Orthogonality of task-relevant and irrelevant information predicts behavior</title><p>A noteworthy feature of visual attention is that the selectivity and tolerance identified above is not absolute: irrelevant information cannot be filtered out completely, as illustrated by the congruency effects observed in the flanker task and related conflict tasks. A common framework for understanding these behavioral phenomena posits that task-relevant and irrelevant information compete for control over response execution, and that congruency effects arise from incomplete suppression of irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Motivated by these theories, we investigated whether the degree of suppression of irrelevant information in the trained models was correlated with congruency effects across the models we analyzed.</p><p>To this end, we operationalized suppression with two metrics of the model representations that we investigated above: the accuracy of decoders trained to classify flanker direction from the model representations and the mutual information for flanker direction conveyed by single units. We expected to observe a positive correlation between both of these metrics and both RT and accuracy congruency effects: higher decoder accuracy or mutual information for flanker direction corresponds to less suppression and, therefore, higher congruency effects. However, we did not observe a significant positive correlation between either decoding accuracy or mutual information and RT or accuracy congruency effects in any of the model layers, with the exception of a single significant positive correlation between flanker mutual information and accuracy congruency effects in layer Conv3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given this somewhat surprising negative result, we were motivated to consider an alternative account of congruency effects, one that takes into account the relative geometry of the task-irrelevant (flanker) <italic>and</italic> task-relevant (target) information. In particular, we considered the possibility that task-relevant and irrelevant information could be orthogonalized in the high-dimensional space of neural activity, such that task-relevant information is shielded from distracter interference.

We interpret the high alignment as evidence that the model has learned a common representation for direction that is shared for both targets and flankers. In later layers, we found that target and flanker representations become increasingly orthogonal, consistent with the view that the processing in later layers acts to reduce interference between task-relevant and irrelevant information.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Orthogonality of target/flanker subspaces predicts accuracy congruency effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Target/flanker subspace alignment averaged across models.

This raises the possibility that these two training paradigms induce different representations in the models. To investigate this, we trained CNNs to perform LIM (i.e. output the direction of the target) by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss function used in image classification tasks, where the training labels are given by the true direction of the target bird in each stimulus. The task-optimized CNNs were identical to those used in the VAMs, except that the outputs of the last layer were converted to softmax-scored probabilities for each direction rather than drift rates.

This challenges a core (but often implicit) assumption of the task-optimized training paradigm, namely that training a model to do a task well will result in model representations that are similar to those employed by humans.

However, as a coarse proxy for RT, we can examine the confidence of the CNN’s decisions, defined as the softmax-scored logit (probability) of the most probable direction in the final CNN layer. This choice of RT proxy is motivated by some prior studies that have combined CNNs with EAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trueblood et al., 2021</xref>). These studies explicitly or implicitly derive a measure of decision confidence from the activity of the last CNN layer. The confidence measure is then mapped to the EAM drift rates, such that greater decision confidence generally corresponds to higher drift rates (and therefore shorter RTs).</p><p>We calculated the average confidence of each task-optimized CNN separately for congruent vs. incongruent trials.

Therefore, these analyses provide some evidence that task-optimized CNNs have the capacity to exhibit congruency effects, though an explicit comparison of the magnitude of these effects with human data requires additional modeling assumptions (e.g. fitting a separate EAM).</p><p>Above, we showed that VAMs with greater orthogonalization of target and flanker information exhibit smaller accuracy congruency effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), providing evidence that the relative geometry of task-relevant and irrelevant representations is a critical determinant of the degree of flanker interference at the behavioral level. Given that the task-optimized models do not exhibit an accuracy congruency effect, we expect that these models would exhibit a higher degree of orthogonalization of target and flanker information. Consistent with this idea, we found that the task-optimized models had lower target/flanker subspace alignment (i.e. higher orthogonalization) for all network layers beginning with the third convolutional layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>A direct consequence of the training paradigms used to train the VAMs is that these models are encouraged to capture dependencies between the stimulus features and behavior (RTs and accuracy), while the task-optimized models are not. As a result, the VAMs may learn more complex representations of the stimuli, since a variety of stimulus features—layout, stimulus position, flanker direction—influence behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we compared the dimensionality of target representations between the VAMs and task-optimized models using the participation ratio metric discussed above.</p><p>We found that the dimensionality of the VAM and task-optimized model representations was nearly identical for the first four convolutional layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, for the final two convolutional layers, the VAMs exhibited a substantially more pronounced expansion of dimensionality than the task-optimized models. In the final fully-connected layer, dimensionality decreased sharply for both types of models, and was somewhat higher for the VAMs.</p><p>The increased dimensionality of VAMs’ target represenations in later network layers is consistent with the view that these models must learn more complex representations of the stimuli in order to successfully capture stimulus-behavior dependencies. It is also noteworthy that the most striking difference between the dimensionality of the VAMs and task-optimized models occurs during the latter part (layers Conv5–Conv6) of the expansion phase of the hunchback-shaped dimensionality profile discussed above and observed in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansuini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mante et al., 2013</xref>). In these layers, single-unit information for target and flanker direction—the primary task features—decreases, while population-level decoding of these features remains high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B–C </xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B–C</xref>). As discussed above, this dissociation implies a transition from a simple representation of target/flanker direction with separate populations of directionally-tuned units to a more complex and distributed code.</p><p>To determine whether the task-optimized models exhibited this change in coding properties, we quantified the single-unit information and population-level decoding accuracy for target/flanker direction in these models. Relative to the VAMs, the task-optimized models had substantially higher single-unit information for both target and flanker direction in layers Conv5–Conv6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The task-optimized models also showed marginally more or roughly equivalent single-unit information for stimulus position in these layers relative to the VAMs, but had less single-unit information for stimulus layout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, population-level decoding accuracy for target/flanker direction and stimulus position was similar between the task-optimized models and VAMs in layers Conv5–Conv6, though decoding accuracy for stimulus layout was notably lower for the task-optimized models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the task-optimized models maintained a simpler code for target/flanker direction in the later convolutional layers relative to the VAMs, primarily relying on separate populations of directionally-tuned units. Consistent with this idea, the task-optimized models had a higher proportion of simple selective (+) directionally-tuned units and a lower proportion of complex units in layers Conv5–6 relative to the VAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The dominant models of decision-making, while providing a good quantitative description of psychophysical data, do not incorporate biologically plausible models of the perceptual processes that are essential for many behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Wagenmakers, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, neural network models of vision, while capturing core properties of the primate visual system, do not account for many results from behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linsley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malhotra et al., 2022</xref>). The VAM addresses both of these limitations by integrating neural network models for visual processing with traditional decision-making models in a unified probabilistic framework that can be fitted to visual stimuli and RT data. Leveraging large-scale data from a task with rich visual stimuli, we demonstrate that our framework captures complex dependencies between stimulus features and behavior at the level of individual participants. We also illustrate how congruency effects—a core behavioral phenomenon observed in conflict tasks—can be explained in terms of the visual representations of the model. Finally, we document several key differences between the representations learned by models fitted to human behavioral data (the VAMs) and those learned by models trained only to do the task.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Processing phases underlying the transformation of sensory information</title><p>To perform the task and capture the behavioral data, the VAMs learned representations that—like the mammalian cortex—extract task-relevant information from raw visual inputs. Our analyses of these representations revealed several discrete processing phases that are fruitfully discussed in relation to the changes in target representation dimensionality we observed. Across the layers of the VAM’s CNN, target dimensionality exhibited a prominent hunchback shape profile, corresponding to an initial protracted phase of dimensionality expansion followed by abrupt dimensionality compression in the final network layers. An analogous expansion and subsequent compression of object representation dimensionality has been documented in CNNs trained to classify images and along the rat visual-cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansuini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muratore et al., 2022</xref>), with some notable differences from our work that we highlight below.</p><p>We speculate that the initial phase of dimensionality expansion can be explained in part by the pruning of low-level stimulus features (e.g. contrast and luminosity) that are correlated across stimuli in the dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansuini et al., 2019</xref>). These correlations are particularly strong in our dataset since we used the same background image for each stimulus, resulting in low-dimensional activity in the initial network layers. Conceivably, the initial increase in target representation dimensionality (i.e.layers Conv1–Conv4) results from the removal of these correlations, analogous to a whitening transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansuini et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the early and middle convolutional layers (Conv1–Conv4), we found that the population-level decoding and single-unit information for both task-relevant (target direction) and distracting information (flanker direction, stimulus layout, and position) increased, occurring in parallel with the subtle expansion of dimensionality we observed in these layers. These trends are broadly consistent with observations that the mammalian visual cortex encodes increasingly abstract stimulus properties (e.g. object identity) in downstream brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Güçlü and van Gerven, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>). The fact that information for distracting stimulus features increased in these layers is especially noteworthy, given that this information—the flanker direction, most prominently—impairs performance on the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoffels and van der Molen, 1988</xref>). While it is tempting to speculate that the VAMs learned to extract distracter information because they were fitted to behavioral data, where the impairments in task performance manifest, the task-optimized models also exhibited increased distracter information in these layers. This suggests an alternative explanation in which the model first extracts more granular, superordinate stimulus representations that group together stimulus features with similar statistics. For example, the initial increase in encoding of target and flanker direction may reflect the representation of a unitary ‘directional signal’ that facilitates the eventual separation of target and flanker direction representations that occurs in later layers. This idea is consistent with our observation that target/flanker subspaces are highly aligned in the middle convolutional layers and become progressively more orthogonal in later network layers.</p><p>In the last convolutional layers (Conv5–Conv6), we observed a large expansion in target representation dimensionality, which was notably less pronounced in the task-optimized models compared to the VAMs. We speculate that the increase in dimensionality may be partly due to an increase in mixed selectivity for multiple stimulus features at the single-unit level, similar to the single-unit coding properties observed in primate PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>). In general agreement with this idea, we observed a reduction in the proportion of units with selectivity for particular target directions in these layers, and a concomitant increase in units that were modulated by multiple target directions. Relative to the VAMs, the task-optimized models showed a higher proportion of directionally-tuned units in these layers. A notable advantage of high-dimensional neural codes composed of units with mixed selectivity is that many different input-output relationships can be implemented with simple decoders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cover, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the higher dimensionality and more complex target direction coding observed in the VAMs relative to the task-optimized models may reflect the fact that the VAMs are trained to capture a potentially large number of dependencies between stimulus attributes and behavior, while the task-optimized models need only extract the target direction. Given the impressive capacity of primates to learn complex tasks and arbitrary stimulus behavior relationships, and the abundance of high-dimensional representations across the cortex, models trained to capture the richness of stimulus-behavior dependencies—such as the VAM—may result in better models of cortical processing than optimizing models to perform tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Congruency effects emerge from the relative geometry of task-relevant vs. distracting sensory representations</title><p>One of the key strengths of our modeling framework is that neural representations of stimulus features can be directly related to behavioral outputs. We focused in particular on congruency effects since they are ubiquitously observed in conflict tasks and highlight an inherent limitation of selective attention, namely that humans cannot completely filter out distracting information. Congruency effects are often interpreted in the context of a ‘dual-process’ model in which automatic or impulsive processing arising from distracting stimulus information and more controlled or deliberate processing of task-relevant information compete for control over behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ridderinkhof, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>). According to this model, congruency effects result from the incomplete suppression of incorrect response activation in the automatic pathway. Building on this framework, a variety of models have been proposed that successfully capture congruency effects and other behavioral phenomena observed in conflict tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulrich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">White et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our work differs from these prior modeling efforts in two key ways. First, we did not attempt to ‘build in’ a predetermined implementation of congruency effects. Rather, we fitted a relatively unstructured neural network model to human flanker task data and examined how congruency effects emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaffe et al., 2023</xref>). Second, we explicitly modeled how task-relevant (and task-irrelevant) representations are extracted from raw visual stimuli with a biologically-plausible model of the mammalian visual system (a CNN). These features of the VAM allowed us to explore a space of possible explanations for congruency effects that are not readily investigated with other models of conflict tasks. Each CNN layer is composed of many simple neuron-like processing units, enabling a population-level description of task-relevant and irrelevant representations. Prior connectionist models of conflict tasks are also implemented as networks of interacting processing units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>), but are much reduced in scale relative to the VAM, precluding a characterization of stimulus feature representations in terms of their high-dimensional geometry as we pursue here. Another relevant attribute of CNNs is that the successive convolution and pooling operations in each layer extract increasingly abstract, task-related representations from raw visual inputs, a hallmark of the mammalian ventral visual system. This enabled a rich characterization of the intermediate visual representations that sequentially transform raw visual stimuli to behavioral outputs.</p><p>Leveraging these features of the VAM framework, we investigated potential explanations for congruency effects in terms of the population-level activity and representation geometry in each network layer. Motivated by the dual-process model of conflict tasks mentioned above, we initially sought evidence for the suppression of task-irrelevant information, as operationalized by population-level decoding accuracy and single-unit information for flanker direction. While we did find evidence of greater suppression in later vs. middle convolutional layers for both of these metrics, variability in the magnitude of this suppression across models was not related to variability in congruency effects.</p><p>Instead, we found that the relative geometry of target and flanker representations was a critical determinant of congruency effects. In particular, models with smaller accuracy congruency effects had more orthogonal (or less aligned) representations of targets and flankers in later network layers, proximal to behavioral outputs. This finding is consistent with the idea that orthogonalization of task-relevant/irrelevant representations shields the task-relevant information from distracters, and parallels findings from neural recording studies in both humans and animals that representations for different sources of information can be orthogonalized in order to prevent interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flesch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Libby and Buschman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panichello and Buschman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ritz and Shenhav, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xie et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To elaborate on this idea, in models with more aligned (less orthogonal) target/flanker representations in intermediate layers, the task-relevant (target) subspace is effectively ‘contaminated’ by task-irrelevant (flanker) information. In the absence of any corrective process, the task-relevant subspace propagates a mixture of both correct (target) and incorrect (flanker) direction signals forward through the network. At the final readout layer of the network, assuming that the target subspace is well-aligned with the readout weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Papyan et al., 2020</xref>), flanker signals within the target subspace then contribute to the drift rate for the (incorrect) flanker direction. This increases the probability of an error, such that models with more aligned target/flanker representations exhibit larger accuracy congruency effects. A corollary of this proposition is that the absolute amount of flanker information in the network—equivalently, the degree to which flanker information has been suppressed—is not necessarily predictive of congruency effects. This may account for our observations that the measures of suppression we considered are not correlated with accuracy congruency effects across models, and that representations for flanker direction do not appear to be strongly suppressed even in later network layers, as evidenced by high decoding accuracy for flanker direction in both the VAMs and task-optimized models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of dynamics in conflict tasks</title><p>One apparent limitation of the VAM as presented here is that it does not have visual processing dynamics, which seem to be required to explain some observations from the flanker task and related conflict tasks. For example, the RTs on incongruent error trials are typically faster than error RTs for congruent trials and RTs for correct trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>, an effect that we confirm is also present in the flanker task variant studied here. This observation can be explained by a ‘shrinking attention spotlight’ in which response activation from flankers starts high and diminishes over time, resulting in a higher proportion of errors for faster RTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">White et al., 2011</xref>. We speculate that our models were unable to capture these particular error patterns because the visual processing module (CNN) we used does not have any dynamics (e.g. recurrence) that could instantiate such time-varying attention and resultant time-varying drift rates. However, it is not difficult to imagine how the orthogonalization mechanism described above, which explains variability in accuracy congruency effects <italic>across</italic> individuals, could act in concert with other dynamic processes that explain variability in congruency effects <italic>within</italic> individuals (e.g. as a function of RT). In general, any process that dynamically gates the influence of irrelevant sensory information on behavioral outputs could accomplish this, for example, ramping inhibition of incorrect response activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Wildenberg et al., 2010</xref>), a shrinking attention spotlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">White et al., 2011</xref>), or dynamics in neural population-level geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>).

Raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli are processed by a biologically-plausible neural network model of vision that outputs the parameters of a traditional decision-making model. Each VAM is fitted to data from a single participant, a feature that allowed us to study how individual differences in behavior emerge from differences in the ‘brains’ of the models. To this end, we found that models with smaller congruency effects had more orthogonal representations for task-relevant and irrelevant information. While we chose to use a CNN to model visual processing, we note that the VAM is not limited to this choice: other sensory encoding models, such as those based on transformer architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dosovitskiy et al., 2021</xref>), can be readily swapped in to replace the CNN with minimal changes to the underlying VAM implementation. Similarly, the LBA decision-making model we employed is easily replaced with other decision-making models that have a closed-form or easily approximated likelihood, such as the diffusion-decision model and leaky competing accumulator model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lo and Ip, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Navarro and Fuss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). In this way, the VAM provides a general probabilistic framework for jointly fitting interpretable decision-making models and expressive neural network architectures of sensory processing with psychophysical data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Datasets</title><p>We used deidentified Lost in Migration gameplay data from 75 Lumosity users (participants) to train the models included in this paper. The mean (SD) age of this sample at the time of signup was 56.4 (18.6) y; 46.7% identified as female, 48.0% identified as male, and 5.3% did not report their gender. All analysis and modeling was done retrospectively on preexisting Lumosity data that were collected during the normal use of the Lumosity program (at home). All participants consented to the use and disclosure of their deidentified Lumosity data for any purpose as laid out in the Lumosity Privacy Policy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lumosity.com/en/legal/privacy_policy/">https://www.lumosity.com/en/legal/privacy_policy/</ext-link>).

The selection from this larger pool was done at random, with the following exception: we included all participants under the age of 40 (n=19) to ensure adequate representation of younger participants. The criteria used to define the larger participant pool were as follows: we required that participants had signed up as Lumosity users between June 28, 2015 and June 30, 2020 (inclusive); that they were between the ages of 18 and 89 at the time of signup (inclusive); that their country of origin was Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or the United States; that their preferred language was English; and that they were not employees of Lumos Labs, Inc Accounts created for research purposes were also excluded. We also required that all of a given participant’s Lost in Migration gameplays were done on the web (as opposed to mobile) platform. Finally, we required that participants had at least 200 Lost in Migration gameplays and at least 25,000 trials starting with their 50<sup>th</sup> gameplay. One additional participant with near chance accuracy (33%) on Lost in Migration was excluded from the larger participant pool.</p><p>Trials with very short and very long RTs were excluded and did not count toward the 25,000 trial minimum. Specifically, we excluded trials less than or equal to 250 ms and trials classified as outliers from a criterion based on the median absolute deviation from the median (the MAD): trials with an absolute deviation from the median RT of more than 10 times a given participant’s MAD were excluded.</p><p>The final datasets from each participant used for model training consist of the first 25,000 non-outlier trials starting with their 50<sup>th</sup> gameplay. Data from the first 49 gameplays were excluded to reduce learning-related variability.

The number of channels/units used in the seven layers were as follows: 64, 64, 128, 128, 128, 256, 1024. The output layer (after the fully-connected layer) has four channels, one for each drift rate. Each convolutional layer used a 3×3 pixel kernel (stride 1, same padding). Each convolutional layer was followed by a ReLU nonlinearity, instance normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ulyanov et al., 2017</xref>), and a max-pooling layer (2×2 pixel window, stride 2), in that order. The fully-connected hidden layer was followed by a ReLU nonlinearity and a dropout layer (dropout rate set to 0.5).</p><p>To speed up model training, the first two convolutional layers were initialized with the parameters from a larger CNN trained on an image classification task. Specifically, the pretrained model used a 16-layer VGG architecture and was trained on the ImageNet dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015</xref>).

Finally, the stimuli were resized from 640×480 pixels (width×height) to 128×128 pixels.</p><p>We used data augmentation techniques commonly used in other image classification training paradigms to improve the generalization ability of the models. Specifically, for each batch of training data, each image was independently and randomly translated by a small amount. The size of the translation (in pixels) was drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1] (vertical) and [0,2] (horizontal), rounded to the nearest pixel (horizontal and vertical translations were sampled independently). We also applied a variation of a random elastic image deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simard et al., 2003</xref>) as implemented in the Augmax Python package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heidler, 2022</xref>).

Significant modulation was determined by running an ANOVA on the RTs in each stimulus feature bin (e.g. for each layout or each horizontal position bin), using a threshold <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05. For horizontal stimulus position, we used bins of width = 50 pixels in the original 640×480 pixel window space, except for the leftmost and rightmost bins which had width = 60 pixels. For vertical stimulus position, we used bins of width = 25 pixels.</p><p>The number of participants exhibiting significant modulation of RT was 60 for stimulus layout, 72 for horizontal position, and 69 for vertical position (out of 75 total). To determine whether a given participant exhibited significant modulation of accuracy by a given stimulus feature, we used a chi-squared test for equality of proportions across stimulus feature bins (threshold p-value=0.05). No participants exhibited significant modulation of accuracy for any of the stimulus features.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>LBA parameters</title><p>For analyses of the fitted LBA parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf126"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf127"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <italic>A</italic>, we used the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of these parameters, corresponding to the mean parameter vector of the learned Gaussian posterior density <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf128"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

For the selectivity and tolerance analyses in which we decoded target or flanker direction from the activity in each layer, described in more detail below, note that the target and flanker directions are by definition the same on congruent trials. As such, a classifier trained to decode target direction from congruent trials could achieve perfect accuracy using information in the unit activity attributable to the flankers, rather than targets. Using only incongruent trials ensured that such cross-contamination could not occur. We used only incongruent trials for all of the other analyses of the activations simply for convenience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Stimulus feature decoding</title><p>To assess how well particular stimulus features could be decoded from the activity in each layer, we trained a linear SVM to classify the values of that stimulus feature using the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf132"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> activation matrix in each layer.

Horizontal and vertical stimulus positions were discretized to enable classification using the same bins as were used in the behavioral analyses.</p><p>The classification task was done in a standard ‘one-vs-rest’ setting: for each value of a given stimulus feature, one sub-classifier was trained on a binary classification task with the chosen value as one class and all other values as the other class, yielding one classifier for each value of the stimulus feature (e.g. four for target direction, seven for stimulus layout). To determine the decision of the combined classifier for a given image, we generated predictions from each sub-classifier and assigned the decision to the sub-classifier with the largest (most confident) prediction. We assessed the overall decoding accuracy of each SVM on a separate test image set. Note that both the training set and test set for the SVMs were subsets of the holdout image set (i.e. the images that were not used to train the VAMs). The SVMs were trained using the LinearSVC model in the scikit-learn Python package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pedregosa, 2011</xref> with the squared hinge loss function and L2 regularization with the penalty parameter C set to 1.0 (the default settings).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Tolerance</title><p>To assess the tolerance of model representations to variation in a given stimulus feature (flanker direction, stimulus layout, horizontal position, and vertical position), we trained a linear SVM to classify target direction from the CNN activations using stimuli with the chosen stimulus feature fixed to one value (the training context), and assessed the generalization performance of the SVM on stimuli that contained all other values of that stimulus feature (the generalization context). For example, to assess tolerance to stimulus layout, we trained one SVM to classify target direction using stimuli with the vertical line layout, and assessed the generalization performance of that classifier on stimuli with the six other layouts. We trained one such SVM for each of the seven stimulus layouts, and averaged the generalization performance across these seven SVMs to derive the overall generalization performance measure for a given model and network layer.

Units with an ANOVA <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.001 were defined as significantly modulated by target direction. These units were further split into three subtypes based on their degree of selectivity and sign of modulation: selective (+), selective (-), and complex units.</p><p>We first selected units that had significantly higher or lower activation for one direction relative to the other three directions, as assessed by Tukey’s HSD test (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Within this population, some units had both significantly higher activation for one direction relative to the other three <italic>and</italic> significantly lower activation for one direction relative to the other three. Units that did vs. did not have this property were handled separately. In the former (simpler) case, the units that only had significantly higher activation for one direction relative to the other three were defined as selective (+) units; the units that only had significantly lower activation for one direction relative to the other three were defined as selective (-) units.</p><p>In the latter (more complicated) case, we compared the magnitude of the activation for the positive and negative modulation directions with a rank-sum test. Units for which the magnitude of activity for the positive modulation direction was significantly greater (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) than the magnitude of activity for the negative modulation direction were defined as selective (+) units. Analogous criteria were used to define selective (-) units (with the signs reversed). Units within this pool with rank-sum p-value&gt;0.05 were defined as complex units. Finally, units that were significantly modulated by target direction but that did not meet any of the criteria described above were also defined as complex units.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98351-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All of the code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pauljaffe/vam">https://github.com/pauljaffe/vam</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaffe, 2025</xref>) and data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775513">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10775513</ext-link>) used to train the VAMs and reproduce our results are publicly-available without restrictions.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>PI</given-names></name><name><surname>Gustavo</surname><given-names>XSR</given-names></name><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bissett</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Poldrack</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Data and models for 'An image-computable model of speeded decision-making'</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.10775513</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Steyvers, M Robinson, D Yamins and members of the NeuroAILab, the Lumos Labs research team, and members of the Poldrack Lab for helpful conversations and comments on this work.

The authors motivate their paper by saying &quot;EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place&quot; (second sentence of the Abstract). VAM is definitely a step in this direction but there's still a gap between the current VAM implementation and sensory systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98351.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In An image-computable model of speeded decision-making, the authors introduce and fit a combined CCN-EAM (a 'VAM') to flanker-task-like data. They show that the VAM can fit mean RTs and accuracies as well as the congruency effect that is present in the data, and subsequently analyze the VAM in terms of where in the network congruency effects arise.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about this manuscript, as I appreciate the innovative efforts to combine CNNs with EAMs in a new class of cognitive models, while also having some reservations from an EAM perspective. The idea of combining these approaches has great potential, and I'm excited to see where this research will lead. However, I do have some concerns about the quality of fit between the behavioral data and the model. Specifically, the RT distributions, delta plots, and conditional accuracy function don't appear to be well-matched by the VAM. The conflict effects on behavioral data are well-established and typically considered crucial to understanding the underlying cognitive process. Unfortunately, it seems that these parts of the data don't fit well with the proposed model.</p><p>This disparity is not entirely surprising. The EAM literature suggests that LBA models might not be suitable for conflict tasks, and the presented results seem to confirm this concern. Conflict EAMs, including the DMC (e.g., Ulrich et al., 2015; Evans &amp; Servant, 2022; Lee &amp; Sewell 2024), propose dynamic drift rates with a fast automatic process that is gradually withdrawn from evidence accumulation over time. This approach results in congruency effects arising from temporal dynamics, not spatial representations.</p><p>In contrast, the VAM imposes static drift rates in the LBA model, leading to an effect between drift rates that translates to changes in representations. However, this account does not adequately explain the behavioral data, and the proposed representational geometry explanation is therefore limited.</p><p>My concerns are addressed in the revised manuscript, but I struggle to understand why the authors distinguish between explaining mean effects across individuals and congruency effects within individuals. These concepts seem related, and issues at the individual level could propagate to the group mean. Furthermore, I find it challenging to accept that dynamics merely act 'in concert' with the orthogonalization mechanism, as it seems possible that an account that uses a time-varying EAM may not require any orthogonalization mechanism in the first place. The orthogonalization mechanism might have arisen because the model does not have the possibility to account for the conflict effect from temporal effects, instead of spatial effects. I could envision a CNN-DMC in which conflict effects arise only at the level of the choice model (e.g., as a time-varying filter that changes which information is read out from the visual system, rather than due to changes in the representations in the visual system itself). This possibility should be acknowledged in the paper, and it would be interesting to discuss how such an account would be tested.</p><p>While I appreciate the technological advancement presented in this paper, my concerns are not about implementation details but rather about the choice of models and their consequences. I believe that a more in-depth exploration of which conclusions can be drawn, and which model comparisons would be required to reach a final conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98351.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>Paul I</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Santiago-Reyes</surname><given-names>Gustavo X</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford, CA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lumos Labs</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco, CA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bissett</surname><given-names>Patrick G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poldrack</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper introduces a new approach to modeling human behavioral responses using image-computable models.

However, this was done in a 2022 preprint</p><p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.505015v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.23.505015v1</ext-link>) that introduced a network called RTNet. This preprint is cited here, but never really discussed. Further, the two unique features of the current approach discussed in lines 55-60 are both present to some extent in RTNet. Given the strong conceptual similarity in approach, it seems that a detailed discussion of similarities and differences (of which there are many) should feature in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out—we agree that the novel contributions of our model (the VAM) with respect to prior related models (including RTNet) should be clarified, and have revised the Introduction accordingly. We include the following clarifications in the Introduction:</p><p>“The key feature of the VAM that distinguishes it from prior models is that the CNN and EAM parameters are jointly fitted to the RT, choice, and visual stimulus data from individual participants in a unified Bayesian framework. Thus, both the visual representations learned by the CNN and the EAM parameters are directly constrained by behavioral data. In contrast, prior models first optimize the CNN to perform the behavioral task, then separately fit a minimal set of high-level CNN parameters [RTNet, Rafiei et al., 2024] and/or the EAM parameters to behavioral data [Annis et al., 2021; Holmes et al., 2020; Trueblood et al., 2021]. As we will show, fitting the CNN with human data—rather than optimizing the model to perform a task—has significant consequences for the representations learned by the model.”</p><p>E.g. in the case of RTNet, the variability of the Bayesian CNN weight distribution, the decision threshold, and the magnitude of the noise added to the images are adjusted to match the average human accuracy (separately for each task condition). RTNet is an interesting and useful model that we believe has complementary strengths to our own work.</p><p>Since there are several other existing models in addition to the VAM and RTNet that use CNNs to generate RTs or RT proxies (by our count, at least six that we cite earlier in the Introduction), we felt it was inappropriate to preferentially include a detailed comparison of the VAM and RTNet beyond the passage quoted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the approach here, a given stimulus is always processed in the same way through the core CNN to produce activations v_k. These v_k's are then corrupted by Gaussian noise to produce drift rates d_k, which can differ from trial to trial even for the same stimulus. In other words, the assumption built into VAM appears to be that the drift rate variability stems entirely from post-sensory (decisional) noise. In contrast, the typical interpretation of EAMs is that the variability in drift rates is sensory. This is also the assumption built into RTNet where the core CNN produces noisy evidence. Can the authors comment on the plausibility of VAM's assumption that the noise is post-sensory?</p></disp-quote><p>In our view, the VAM is compatible with a model in which the drift rate variability for a given stimulus is due to sensory noise, since we do not specify the origin of the Gaussian noise added to the drift rates. As the reviewer notes, the CNN component of the VAM processes a given stimulus deterministically, yielding the mean drift rates. This does not preclude us from imagining an additional (unmodeled) sensory process that adds variability to the drift rates. The VAM simply represents this and other hypothetical sources of variability as additive Gaussian noise. We agree however that it is worthwhile to think about the origin of the drift rate variability, though it is not a focus of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2 plots how well VAM explains different behavioral features. It would be very useful if the authors could also fit simple EAMs to the data to clarify which of these features are explainable by EAMs only and which are not.</p></disp-quote><p>In our view, fitting simple EAMs to the data would not be especially informative and poses a number of challenges for the particular task we study (LIM) that are neatly avoided by using the VAM. In particular, as we show in Figure 2, the stimuli vary along several dimensions that all appear to influence behavior: horizontal position, vertical position, layout, target direction, and flanker direction. Since the VAM is stimulus-computable, fitting the VAM automatically discovers how all of these stimulus features influence behavior (via their effect on the drift rates outputted by the CNN). In contrast, fitting a simple EAM (e.g. the LBA model) necessitates choosing a particular parameterization that specifies the relationship between all of the stimulus features and the EAM model parameters. This raises a number of practical questions. For example, should we attempt to fit a separate EAM for each stimulus feature, or model all stimulus features simultaneously?</p><p>Moreover, while we could in principle navigate these issues and fit simple EAMs to the data, we do not intend to claim that simple EAMs fail to explain the relationship between stimulus features and behavior as well as the VAM. Rather, the key strength of the VAM relative to simple EAMs is that it includes a detailed and biologically plausible model of human vision. The majority of the paper capitalizes on this strength by showing how behavioral effects of interest (namely congruency effects) can be explained in terms of the VAM’s visual representations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) VAM is tested in two different ways behaviorally. First, it is tested to what extent it captures individual differences (Figure 2B-E). Second, it is tested to what extent it captures average subject data (Figure 2F-J). It wasn't clear to me why for some metrics only individual differences are examined and for other metrics only average human data is examined. I think that it will be much more informative if separate figures examine average human data and individual difference data. I think that it's especially important to clarify whether VAM can capture individual differences for the quantities plotted in Figures 2F-J.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that Fig. 2J in fact already shows how well the VAM captures individual differences for the average subject data shown in Fig. 2H (stimulus layout) and Fig. 2I (stimulus position). For a given participant and stimulus feature, we calculated the Pearson's r between model/participant mean RTs across each stimulus feature value. Fig. 2J shows the distribution of these Pearson’s r values across all participants for stimulus layout and horizontal/vertical position.</p><p>Fig. 2G also already shows how well the VAM captures individual differences in behavior. Specifically, this panel shows individual differences in mean RT attributable to differences in age. For Fig. 2F, which shows how the model drift rates differ on congruent vs. incongruent trials, there is no sensible way to compare the models to the participants at any level of analysis (since the participants do not have drift rates).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors look inside VAM and perform many exploratory analyses. I found many of these difficult to follow since there was little guidance about why each analysis was conducted. This also made it difficult to assess the likelihood that any given result is robust and replicable. More importantly, it was unclear which results are hypothesized to depend on the VAM architecture and training, and which results would be expected in performance-optimized CNNs. The authors train and examine performance-optimized CNNs later, but it would be useful to compare those results to the VAM results immediately when each VAM result is first introduced.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out—we apologize for any confusion caused by our presentation of the CNN analyses. We have added in additional motivating statements, methodological clarifications, and relevant references to our Results, particularly for Figure 3 in which we first introduce the analyses of the CNN representations/activity. In general, each analysis is prefaced by a guiding question or specific rationale, e.g. “How do the models' visual representations enable target selectivity for stimuli that vary along several irrelevant dimensions?” We also provide numerous references in which these analysis techniques have been used to address similar questions in CNNs or the primate visual cortex.</p><p>We chose to maintain the current organization of our results in which the comparison between the VAM and the task-optimized models are presented in a separate figure. We felt that including analyses of both the VAM and task-optimized models in the initial analyses of the CNN representations would be overwhelming for many readers. As the reviewer acknowledges, some readers may already find these results challenging to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors don't examine how the task-optimized models would produce RTs. They say in lines 371-2 that they &quot;could not examine the RT congruency effect since the task-optimized models do not generate RTs.&quot; CNNs alone don't generate RTs, but RTs can easily be generated from them using the same EAM add-on that is part of VAM. Given that the CNNs are already trained, I can't see a reason why the authors can't train EAMs on top of the already trained CNNs and generate RTs, so these can provide a better comparison to VAM.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, but we judge the suggestion to “train EAMs on top of the already trained CNNs and generate RTs” to be a significant expansion of the scope of the paper with multiple possible roads forward. In particular, one must specify how the outputs of the task-optimized CNN (logits for each possible response) relate to drift rates, and there is no widely-accepted or standard way to do this. Previously proposed methods include transforming representation distances in the last layer to drift rates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1037/xlm0000968">https://doi.org/10.1037/xlm0000968</ext-link>), fitting additional subject-specific parameters that map the logits to drift rates</p><p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s42113-019-00042-1">https://doi.org/10.1007/s42113-019-00042-1</ext-link>), or using the softmax-scored model outputs as drift rates directly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01914-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01914-8</ext-link>), though in the latter case the RTs are not on the same scale as human data. In our view, evaluating these different methods is beyond the scope of this paper. An advantage of the VAM is that one does not have to fit two separate models (a CNN and a EAM) to generate RTs.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree that it would be informative to examine something like RTs in the task-optimized models. Our revised Results section now includes an analysis of the confidence of the task-optimized models’ decisions, which we use a proxy for RTs:</p><p>“Since the task-optimized models do not generate RTs, it is not possible to directly measure RT congruency effects in these models without making additional assumptions about how the CNN's classification decisions relate to RTs. However, as a coarse proxy for RT, we can examine the confidence of the CNN's decisions, defined as the softmax-scored logit (probability) of the most probable direction in the final CNN layer. This choice of RT proxy is motivated by some prior studies that have combined CNNs with EAMs [Annis et al., 2021; Holmes et al., 2020; Trueblood et al., 2021]. These studies explicitly or implicitly derive a measure of decision confidence from the activity of the last CNN layer. The confidence measure is then mapped to the EAM drift rates, such that greater decision confidence generally corresponds to higher drift rates (and therefore shorter RTs).</p><p>We calculated the average confidence of each task-optimized CNN separately for congruent vs. incongruent trials. On average, the task-optimized models showed higher confidence on congruent vs. incongruent trials (W = 21.0, p &lt; 1e-3, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Cohen's d = 0.99; n = 75 models). These analyses therefore provide some evidence that task-optimized CNNs have the capacity to exhibit congruency effects, though an explicit comparison of the magnitude of these effects with human data requires additional modeling assumptions (e.g., fitting a separate EAM).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The Discussion felt very long and mostly a summary of the Results. I also couldn't shake the feeling that it had many just-so stories related to the variety of findings reported.

I don't understand how it can be claimed that this approach can serve as a model of an individual's sensory processing. Which of the 5 sets of weights (5 VAMs) captures a given subject's visual processing? Are the authors saying that the visual system of a given subject changes based on the expected RT for a stimulus? I feel like I'm missing something about how the authors think about these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these particular analyses may cause confusion and have removed them from our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In an image-computable model of speeded decision-making, the authors introduce and fit a combined CCN-EAM (a 'VAM') to flanker-task-like data. They show that the VAM can fit mean RTs and accuracies as well as the congruency effect that is present in the data, and subsequently analyze the VAM in terms of where in the network congruency effects arise.</p><p>Overall, combining DNNs and EAMs appears to be a promising avenue to seriously model the visual system in decision-making tasks compared to the current practice in EAMs. Some variants have been proposed or used before (e.g., doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.078 , doi.org/10.1007/s42113-019-00042-1), but always in the context of using task-trained models, rather than models trained on behavioral data. However, I was surprised to read that the authors developed their model in the context of a conflict task, rather than a simpler perceptual decision-making task. Conflict effects in human behavior are particularly complex, and thereby, the authors set a high goal for themselves in terms of the to-be-explained human behavior. Unfortunately, the proposed VAM does not appear to provide a great account of conflict effects that are considered fundamental features of human behavior, like the shape of response time distributions, and specifically, delta plots (doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.20.4.731). The authors argue that it is beyond the scope of the presented paper to analyze delta plots, but as these are central to studies of human conflict behavior, models that aim to explain conflict behavior will need to be able to fit and explain delta plots.</p><p>Theories on conflict often suggest that negative/positive-trending delta plots arise through the relative timing of response activation related to relevant and irrelevant information.</p><p>Accumulation for relevant and irrelevant information would, as a result, either start at different points in time or the rates vary over time. The current VAM, as a feedforward neural network model, does not appear to be able to capture such effects, and perhaps fundamentally not so: accumulation for each choice option is forced to start at the same time, and rates are a static output of the CNN.</p><p>The proposed solution of fitting five separate VAMs (one for each of five RT quantiles) is not satisfactory: it does not explain how delta plots result from the model, for the same reason that fitting five evidence accumulation models (one per RT quantile) does not explain how response time distributions arise. If, for example, one would want to make a prediction about someone's response time and choice based on a given stimulus, one would first have to decide which of the five VAMs to use, which is circular. But more importantly, this way of fitting multiple models does not explain the latent mechanism that underlies the shape of the delta plots.</p><p>As such, the extensive analyses on the VAM layers and the resulting conclusions that conflict effects arise due to changing representations across layers (e.g., &quot;the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations&quot;) - while inspiring, they remain hard to weigh, as they are contingent on the assumption that the VAM can capture human behavior in the conflict task, which it struggles with. That said, the promise of combining CNNs and EAMs is clearly there. A way forward could be to either adjust the proposed model so that it can explain delta plots, which would potentially require temporal dynamics and time-varying evidence accumulation rates, or perhaps to start simpler and combine CCNs-EAMs that are able to fit more standard perceptual decision-making tasks without conflict effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments on our work. However, we note that the</p><p>VAM does in fact capture the positive-trending RT delta plot observed in the participant data (Fig. S4A), though the intercepts for models/participants differ somewhat. On the other hand, the conditional accuracy functions (Fig. S4B) reveal a more pronounced difference between model and participant behavior. As the reviewer points out, capturing these effects is likely to require a model that can produce time-varying drift rates, whereas our model produces a fixed drift rate for a given stimulus. We also agree that fitting a separate VAM to each RT quantile is not a satisfactory means of addressing this limitation and have removed these analyses from our revised manuscript.</p><p>However, while we agree that accurately capturing these dynamic effects is a laudable goal, it is in our view also worthwhile to consider explanations for the mean behavioral effect (i.e. the accuracy congruency effect), which can occur independently of any consideration of dynamics. One of our main findings is that across-model variability in accuracy congruency effects is better attributed to variation in representation geometry (target/flanker subspace alignment) vs.</p><p>variation in the degree of flanker suppression. This finding does not require any consideration of dynamics to be valid at the level of explanation we pursue (across-user variability in congruency effects), but also does not preclude additional dynamic processes that could give rise to more specific error patterns. Our revised discussion now includes a section where we summarize and elaborate on these ideas:</p><p>“It is not difficult to imagine how the orthogonalization mechanism described above, which explains variability in accuracy congruency effects across individuals, could act in concert with other dynamic processes that explain variability in congruency effects within individuals (e.g., as a function of RT). In general, any process that dynamically gates the influence of irrelevant sensory information on behavioral outputs could accomplish this, for example ramping inhibition of incorrect response activation [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00222">https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00222</ext-link>], a shrinking attention spotlight [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2011.08.001">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2011.08.001</ext-link>], or dynamics in neural population-level geometry [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3643">https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3643</ext-link>].

While this is not the first effort to combine these modeling frameworks, it uses this combination of approaches uniquely.</p><p>Specifically, the authors attempt to better understand the structure of human information representations by fitting this model to behavioral (choice-RT) data from a classic flanker task. This objective is made possible by using a very large (by psychological modeling standards) industry data set to jointly fit both components of this VAM model to individual-level data. Using this approach, they illustrate (among other results) (1) how the interaction between target and flanker representations influence the presence and strength of congruency effects, (2) how the structure of representations changes (distributed versus more localized) with depth in the CNN model component, and (3) how different model training paradigms change the nature of information representations. This work contributes to the ML literature by demonstrating the value of training models with richer behavioral data. It also contributes to cognitive science by demonstrating how ML approaches can be integrated into cognitive modeling. Finally, it contributes to the literature on conflict modeling by illustrating how information representations may lead to some of the classic effects observed in this area of research.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The data set used for this analysis is unique and is made publicly available as part of this article. Specifically, they have access to data for 75 participants with &gt;25,000 trials per participant. This scale of data/individual is unusual and is the foundation on which this research rests.</p><p>(2) This is the first time, to my knowledge, that a model combining a CNN with a choice-RT model has been jointly fit to choice-RT data at the level of individual people. This type of model combination has been used before but in a more restricted context. This joint fitting, and in particular, learning a CNN through the choice-RT modeling framework, allows the authors to probe the structure of human information representations learned directly from behavioral data.</p><p>(3) The analysis approaches used in this article are state-of-the-art. The training of these models is straightforward given the data available. The interesting part of this article (opinion of course) is the way in which they probe what CNN has learned once trained. I find their analysis of how distractor and target information interfere with each other particularly compelling as well as their demonstration that training on behavioral data changes the structure of information representations when compared to training models on standard task-optimized data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Just as the data in this article is a major strength, it is also a weakness. This type of modeling would be difficult, if not impossible to do with standard laboratory data. I don't know what the data floor would be, but collecting tens of thousands of decisions for a single person is impractical in most contexts. Thus this type of work may live in the realm of industry. I do want to re-iterate that the data for this study was made publicly available though!</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect (but have not systematically tested) that the VAMs can be fitted with substantially less data. We use data augmentation techniques (various randomized image transformations) during training to improve the generalization capabilities of the VAMs, and these methods are likely to be particularly important when training on smaller datasets. One could consider increasing the amount of image data augmentation when working with smaller datasets, or pursuing other forms of data augmentation like resampling from estimated RT distributions (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01510-8">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01510-8</ext-link> for an example of this). In general, we don’t think that prospective users of our approach should be discouraged if they have only a few hundred trials per subject (or less) - it’s worth trying!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While this article uses choice-RT data it doesn't fully leverage the richness of the RT data itself. As the authors point out, this modeling framework, the LBA component in particular, does not account for some of the more nuanced but well-established RT effects in this data. This is not a big concern given the already nice contributions of this article and it leads to an opportunity for ongoing investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that fully capturing the more nuanced behavioral effects you mention (e.g. RT delta plots and conditional accuracy functions) is a worthwhile goal for future research—see our response to Reviewer #2 for a more detailed discussion. ----------</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The phrase in the Abstract &quot;convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted&quot; made me initially believe that the two models were fitted independently.

In the aforementioned references, the CNN is trained on the image set, and individual level Bayesian estimation was only applied to the EAM. Thus, it may be useful to highlight the joint estimation aspect of this investigation as well as how the uniqueness of the data available makes it possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed—see above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3c and associated text. I understand the MI analysis you are performing here, however it is difficult to interpret as it stands. In the figure, what does a MI of 0.1 mean?? Can you give some context to that scale? I do find the interpretation of the hunchback shape in lines 210-222 to be somewhat of a stretch. The discussion that precedes (lines 199-209) this is clear and convincing. Can this discussion be strengthened more? And more interpretability of Figure 3c would be helpful; entropic scales can be hard to interpret without some context or scale associated.</p></disp-quote><p>The MI analyses in Fig. 3C (and also Figs. 4C and 6E) show normalized MI, in which the raw MI has been divided by the entropy of the stimulus feature distribution. This normalization facilitates comparing the MI for different stimulus features, which is relevant for Figs. 4C and 6E. The normalized MI has a possible range of [0, 1], where 1 indicates perfect correlation between the two variables and 0 indicates complete independence. We now note in the legend of these figures that the possible normalized MI range is [0, 1], which should help with interpreting these values.

This is just a musing, but what would happen if you just used a 4 layer CNN, or even a 3 layer? This is not just a methods question. Your analysis suggests a transition from localized to distributed information representation. Right now, the EAM only sees the output of the distributed representation. What if it saw the results the more local representations from early layers? Of course, a shallower network may just form the distributed representations earlier, but it would interesting if there were a way to tease out not just the presence of distributed vs local representations, but the utility of those to the EAM.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this interesting suggestion. We did do some preliminary experiments in models with fewer layers, though we only examined the outputs of these models and did not assess their representations. We found that models with 3–5 layers generally failed to achieve human-level accuracy on the task. In principle, one could relate this observation to the representations of these models as a means of assessing the relative utility of distributed/local representations. However, there are confounding factors that one would ideally control for in order to compare models with different numbers of layers in this fashion (namely, the number of parameters).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Section Line 359 (Task optimized models) - It would be helpful to clarify here what these task-optimized models are being trained to do. As I understand it, they are being trained to directly predict the target direction. But are you asking them to learn to predict the true target direction? Or are you training them to predict what each individual responds? I think it is the second (since you have 75 of these), but it's not clear. I looked at the methods and still couldn't get a clear description of this. Also, are you just stripping the LBA off of the end of the CNN and then essentially putting a softmax in its place? If so, it would be helpful to say so.</p></disp-quote><p>The task-optimized models were actually trained to output the true target direction in each stimulus, rather than trained to match the decisions of the human participants. We trained 75 such models since we wanted to use exactly the same stimuli as were used to train each VAM. The task-optimized CNNs were identical to those used in the VAMs, except that the outputs of the last layer were converted to softmax-scored probabilities for each direction rather than drift rates. The Results and Methods section now included additional commentary that clarifies these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 373-376: This statement is pretty well established at this point in the similarity judgement literature.

This is a bit of a philosophical point, but I'll go ahead and mention it. The standard VAM does not necessarily learn &quot;richer&quot; feature representations. Rather, you are asking the VAM and task-optimized models to do different things. As a result, they learn different representations. &quot;Better&quot; or &quot;richer&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. In one view, you could view the VAM performance as sub-par since it exhibits strange artifacts (congruency effects) and the expansion of dimensionality in the VAM representations is merely a side-effect of poor performance.

This is a great paper but this is just a limitation inherent in the model.
