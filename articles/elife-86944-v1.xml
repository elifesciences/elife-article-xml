metabolism according to physiological and nutritional circumstances. However, the regulatory mechanisms and significance of metabolic flexibility are not completely understood. Here, we report that the deletion of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic>, a mitochondria-based phosphatase, critically alters mitochondrial fuel selection – the utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose (the major simple carbohydrate), is inhibited, whereas the fatty acid utilization is enhanced. <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout does not impact the development of the skeletal muscle or heart. However, the metabolic inflexibility ultimately leads to muscular atrophy, heart failure, and sudden death. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the prolonged substrate shift from carbohydrates to lipids causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial destruction, which in turn results in marked accumulation of lipids and profound damage in the knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> deletion from the liver or adipose tissue does not generate any local or systemic defects. These findings suggest that Ptpmt1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility and that their balanced utilization of carbohydrates and lipids is essential for both the skeletal muscle and the heart despite the two tissues having different preferred energy sources.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are powered by mitochondria, a group of organelles that produce chemical energy in the form of molecules called ATP.

Mitochondrial abundance and their preferences for metabolic substrates differ in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). While mitochondria are abundant in red skeletal muscles such as Soleus, and the heart, the mitochondrial content in white muscles, such as Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL), is much lower. Mitochondria in the skeletal muscle and heart have distinct preferences for energy sources – skeletal muscle mitochondria prefer glucose (the major simple carbohydrate) as the substrate, whereas cardiac mitochondria mainly use fatty acids as the fuel. Moreover, different types of skeletal muscle cells (fibers) utilize glucose to produce energy in different mechanisms – in slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers glucose (via pyruvate, a critical metabolite derived from glucose) is predominantly oxidized within the mitochondria to generate energy, whereas in fast-twitch muscle fibers pyruvate is primarily reduced to lactate in the cytosol promoting glycolytic flux to rapidly produce energy and support quick contractions. Nevertheless, both muscle and heart mitochondria are flexible in selecting substrates in response to stress (exercise, fasting, etc.) and under disease conditions (heart failure, diabetes, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertero and Maack, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nabben et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schulze et al., 2016</xref>). It remains to be determined how mitochondrial utilization of various competing metabolic substrates is coordinated and whether disruption of mitochondrial flexibility in fuel selection affects the function of the heart and skeletal muscle.</p><p>Ptpmt1, encoded by nuclear DNA, is localized to the mitochondrion and anchored at the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pagliarini et al., 2005</xref>). It dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). PIPs are a class of membrane phospholipids that bind to a distinctive set of effector proteins, thereby regulating a characteristic suite of cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and ion channel/transporter functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gamper and Shapiro, 2007</xref>). Ptpmt1 is also involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin by converting phosphotidylglecerol phosphate to phosphotidylglecerol, the precursor of cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Global knockout of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> results in developmental arrest and post-implantation lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). Our previous studies suggest that Ptpmt1 facilitates mitochondrial metabolism largely by dephosphorylation of downstream PIP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2009</xref>) that appear to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation but enhance cytosolic glycolysis by activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), a transporter of four-carbon (C4) dicarboxylate intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that has been shown to regulate cellular energetics by limiting mitochondrial oxidation of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vozza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouillaud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diano and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pecqueur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Samudio et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> is highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we exploit <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> tissue-specific knockout models to address the role and mechanisms of Ptpmt1-facilitated mitochondrial metabolism in these tissues. We find that Ptpmt1 plays an important role in facilitating mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates and that balanced fuel selection is essential for maintaining both muscle and heart functions despite the two tissues having distinct preferences for energy sources.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockout of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> from skeletal muscles results in defective contractile function and progressive muscle atrophy</title><p>To determine the role of Ptpmt1-mediated metabolism in the skeletal muscle and heart, we generated tissue-specific <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Ptpmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>) by crossing <italic>Ptpmt1 floxed</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) and muscle creatine kinase promoter-driven <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<italic>Ckm-Cre</italic>), which express the Cre recombinase in the skeletal muscle and heart starting at embryonic day 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brüning et al., 1998</xref>). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed ~95% and ~80% deletion of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> in the skeletal muscle and heart in <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These animals were indistinguishable from their wild-type (WT, <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>) littermates up to 3 months of age, suggesting that <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> deletion did not affect muscle or heart development. The knockout mice exhibited reduced weight gain starting at 4–5 months and their body sizes were significantly smaller than those of control mice at 8 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Muscle wasting was observed in <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice at 8 months or older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Histopathological examination of skeletal muscles of these knockout mice revealed characteristic changes of muscle atrophy – marked variations in muscle fiber diameters and the presence of ghost fibers or more interstitial space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, Masson’s Trichrome staining revealed increased collagen-rich fibrotic regions in <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then examined <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout mice at 6–8 months (prior to the onset of muscle wasting). <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice became fatigued faster and fell more quickly than <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> control animals in wire hang tests, indicating muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In treadmill exercise tests, both male and female knockout mice displayed reduced maximum speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), endurance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and distance of the run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether the reduced muscle strengths of the knockout mice resulted from muscle cell-intrinsic defects, isometric contractile properties of isolated muscles were examined. Ex vivo force–frequency measurements were performed on Soleus, a more oxidative muscle with a higher percentage of slow-twitch Type I fibers, and EDL, a more glycolytic muscle with a higher percentage of fast-twitch Type II fibers. Both knockout Soleus and EDL showed decreased optimal length, the length of the muscle at which maximal force was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Specific force production of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout Soleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and EDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) was decreased. However, normalized force production was decreased only in knockout Soleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but not in knockout EDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that Ptpmt1 plays a more important role in oxidative than glycolytic muscle fibers although both knockout Soleus and EDL developed muscle atrophy subsequently.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> from skeletal muscles results in defective contractility and progressive muscle atrophy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative 8-month-old of <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptpmt1<sup>+/+</sup>/Ckm-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice, and hind limbs and hearts dissected from these mice were photographed.

In addition, we isolated mitochondria from young skeletal muscles and assessed mitochondrial metabolism in the presence of a single metabolic substrate by real-time measurement of ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption. When pyruvate, a critical metabolite derived from glucose, was provided as the sole substrate, ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption in Ptpmt1-deficient mitochondria was markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate was diminished in the absence of Ptpmt1. Interestingly, we observed enhanced oxygen consumption in these mitochondria when fatty acids were supplied as the fuel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A slightly increased respiratory response in Ptpmt1-depleted mitochondria was also detected when glutamate, another mitochondrial substrate, was provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, feeding with succinate, the substrate for Complex II of the electron transport chain, resulted in similar oxygen consumption in Ptpmt1 null and control mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), validating the intact function of the electron transport chain in the knockout mitochondria and excluding flavin adenine dinucleotide and quinone-linked deficiencies.

In contrast to muscle/heart- and heart-specific knockout mice, liver-specific <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout mice were healthy without overt abnormalities. They had a normal lifespan.

In this study, we have identified an important role of the mitochondrial phosphatase Ptpmt1 in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility. The loss of Ptpmt1 decreased mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose, whereas fatty acid oxidation was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, this prolonged mitochondrial substrate shift causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, ultimately leading to the accumulation of lipids/lipid intermediates in <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout skeletal muscle and cardiac myocytes. Excess lipids/lipid intermediates are known to be toxic to cardiomyocytes (lipotoxicity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huss and Kelly, 2005</xref>). The profound damages in <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout hearts and muscles that occurred subsequently were likely attributed to these accumulated lipids, although other factors, such as decreased anabolic activities (as demonstrated by diminished mTor signaling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), could also contribute to these phenotypes. The mitochondrial and tissue damages that subsequently happened, combined with the resulting energetic stress, finally led to muscle atrophy and heart failure in the knockout mice.</p><p>One of the important findings in this report is that persistent mitochondrial fuel switch from pyruvate to fatty acids is detrimental for both cardiac and skeletal muscles despite the two tissues having different preferred energy sources. Glucose is the major energy source for skeletal muscles. It is used for energy production mainly in mitochondria in oxidative red muscles or through cytosolic glycolysis in glycolytic white muscles. Glucose is also the main energy source for the developing heart, but the adult heart primarily utilizes fatty acids to produce ATP, although the adult heart can also utilize glucose and lactate, the end product of glycolysis, as energy sources. Indeed, when mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate was inhibited by Ptpmt1 depletion, heart dysfunction developed much later than skeletal muscle dysfunction. Interestingly, the data from these animal models suggest that efficient carbohydrate oxidation in mitochondria and balanced mitochondrial fuel selection are critically important for both oxidative and glycolytic muscles as well as the adult heart, but not for the development of the skeletal muscle and heart although Ptpmt1 depletion took place during the embryonic stage. Undoubtedly, the late-onset phenotypes observed in the knockout mice over time was attributed to the metabolic defects arising from the loss of Ptpmt1 in the embryos. Although <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes initially maintained energy homeostasis through enhanced fatty acid and glutamate oxidation, along with metabolic adaptations or activation of alternative energy-producing pathways in the first few months, they eventually encountered substantial energy deficits. This was attributed to the subsequent occurrence of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage.</p><p><italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout hepatocytes or adipocytes did not display such secondary effects (mitochondria and cell damages). This is possibly because the requirement of carbohydrate oxidation for energy production in hepatocytes and adipocytes is lower than that in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and/or <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout hepatocytes and adipocytes did not need to uptake excessive fatty acids in the effort to maintain energy homeostasis. Another possibility is that the capabilities of hepatocytes and adipocytes to process fatty acids and to clear lipid metabolites (through cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol exportation out of the cell) are much stronger than muscle cells and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding in this report is that Ptpmt1 plays a major role in governing the metabolic fate of pyruvate and maintaining mitochondrial flexible substrate utilization. Pyruvate is at the central branch point of mitochondrial oxidation and cytosolic glycolysis in glucose metabolism − it can enter the mitochondrion for oxidation or be reduced to lactate in the cytosol. Our data suggest that inhibited mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate is most likely responsible for the remodeled metabolism in <italic>Ptpmt1</italic> knockout cells since ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption of Ptpmt1-ablated mitochondria was greatly reduced with pyruvate as the sole substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, acute production of α-KG from extramitochondrial pyruvate was indeed decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>The precise mechanism by which Ptpmt1 facilitates mitochondrial utilization/uptake of pyruvate remains to be further determined. Ptpmt1 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane where pyruvate transporters reside. This phosphatase dephosphorylates PIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pagliarini et al., 2004</xref>). We have shown previously that PIPs directly promote fatty acid-induced activation of Ucp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Ucp2, unlike Ucp1, is a C4 metabolite transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vozza et al., 2014</xref>). Elevated Ucp2 activity inhibits mitochondrial oxidation of glucose but enhances cytosolic glycolysis although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouillaud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diano and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pecqueur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Samudio et al., 2009</xref>). Ptpmt1 depletion conceivably leads to the buildup of downstream PIP substrates in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which in turn remodel mitochondrial energy source selection by enhancing Ucp2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) [Ucp2 levels in Ptpmt1-ablated mitochondria were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>)]. It may also be possible that the accumulated PIPs directly inhibit the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter Mpc. It is important to note that Ptpmt1 was reported to be involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) which is one of the major components of the mitochondrial inner membrane and that plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane stability and dynamics. Thus, it may also be possible that Ptpmt1 depletion decreases mitochondrial pyruvate utilization through reduced cardiolipin synthesis. Comprehensive metabolomic analyses for <italic>Ptpmt1</italic>-deleted cells would provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic alterations caused by Ptpmt1 loss.</p><p>In summary, in this report we provide evidence that the mitochondria-based multifunctional phosphatase Ptpmt1 plays an important role in facilitating mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate and maintaining mitochondrial flexibility for balanced substrate selection. Prolonged mitochondrial energy sources switch from carbohydrates to lipids such as that caused by Ptpmt1 depletion is detrimental to the skeletal muscle and heart but not the liver and adipose, ultimately leading to muscle atrophy and heart failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Data were analyzed with ADInstruments PowerLab software customized for these experiments. Muscles were first equilibrated for 20 min to mimic conditions of normal activity (low duty cycle, ∼1%). Muscles were then subjected to the length–force relationship test to determine the optimal length at which maximal force is achieved. Muscles were stimulated with frequencies ranging from 1 to 130 Hz to generate force versus frequency relationships. From these relationships, the frequency producing maximal tetanic force (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) was then used for the rest of the experiments. Muscles were stimulated every minute with <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> for 5–10 min to assure that the preparation was stable at which point the tissue bathing buffer was replaced with one containing 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 0.1 mM Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA).

Plates were incubated at 37°C in an incubator for 8–10 min. Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were measured under basal conditions in the presence of ADP (4 mM), the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin (1.5 μM), the mitochondrial uncoupling compound carbonylcyanide-4-trifluorometh-oxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 4 μM), and the electron transport chain inhibitor rotenone (1 μM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of respiration in fresh muscle tissues</title><p>OCRs of muscle tissues were measured using a Seahorse XF24 analyzer and Seahorse XF24 Islet Capture Microplates (Agilent, 101122-100) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shintaku et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, tibialis anterior muscles were dissected into 3 × 1 mm cross-sections with a biopsy punch (3 mm diameter). The tissue sections were incubated for 1 hr in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Tissue OCRs were measured at the basal level and following the addition of oligomycin (8 μM), FCCP (4 μM), and antimycin A/rotenone (1 μM). Following OCR measurements, tissues were dried at 60°C for 48 hr. All tissue OCR measurements were then normalized against dry tissue weights.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mitochondrial Pdh activity assay, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and α-KG measurements</title><p>Mitochondria were freshly isolated from skeletal muscle/heart tissues and washed twice with MAS.

Authors show that the utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose, is inhibited, whereas fatty acid utilization is enhanced. Importantly, while the deletion of PTPMT1 does not impact development of skeletal muscle or heart, the metabolic inflexibility leads to muscular atrophy, heart failure, and sudden death. Mechanistically, authors claim that the prolonged substrate shift from carbohydrates to lipids causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to accumulation of lipids and muscle cell and CM damage in the KO. Interestingly, PTPMT1 deletion from the liver or adipose tissue does not generate any local or systemic defects. Authors conclude that PTPMT1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility and that the balanced utilization of carbohydrates and lipids is essential for skeletal muscle and heart.</p><p>The following issues remain:</p><p>1. Authors have not alleviated the concern regarding the fact that CKMM- and the MYHC-Cre express early, during development ; even if the effects are not grossly apparent during development, many developmental issues progress over time and manifest later in adulthood, particularly those concerning cardiac function and development (ie adult congenital disease). As such, the authors explanation that they don't observe differences does not suffice; detailed developmental assessment by histology at the various developmental stages (by timed mating) are needed to validate the study and conclusions of the authors. Alternatively, as mentioned previously, authors could utilize inducible cre drivers, expressing the gene only in adulthood to prove that the effects are or not developmental in nature. Similarly, the authors new assertion that late-onset phenotypes observed in the knockout mice over time is attributed to the metabolic defects arising from the loss of PTPMT1 in the embryos needs to be validated- therefore the developmental effects are in fact critical to the phenotype and should be demonstrated in the paper.</p><p>2. Quantification of ALL western blot data is an absolute necessity and speaks to the rigor and reproducibility of the study. I do not agree that this is unnecessary or that it would take up too much space.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86944.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study presents novel findings on the metabolic fuel preference shift regulated by PTPMT1, a target of interest, in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.</p><p>Zheng et al. have investigated the effects of PTPMT1 Knock-out on cellular metabolic flexibility.

In addition, the functional data such as echocardiography shows partial and limited data.</p><p>Therefore, it is only a matter of speculation that the absence of PTPMT1 inhibits glucose (pyruvate)

matched.</p></disp-quote><p>Regrettably, we did not monitor the body weights throughout the study. We have now revised the description clarifying the confusions. Importantly we evaluated the weights of the muscle (EDL and soleus) and heart tissues in 8-month-old mice (Fig. 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Quantitative data for figures.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the manuscript, the presented images are representatives of at least three mice per genotype. However, assessing specific measurements such as cell sizes, diameters, or mitochondria sizes in histological tissue sections and electron microscopical fields is not feasible due to practical limitations. Unfortunately, we do not have access to specialized software for such analyses. While semi-quantification of Western blot bands is possible, implementing this for all Western blots in the manuscript would result in a substantial increase in the number of bar graphics. Below are Western blots from additional two pairs of mice used in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: Confusions about “total mitochondrial content”.</p></disp-quote><p>The mitochondria content in cells was assessed by quantitatively comparing the DNA level of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome B to that of the nuclear gene 18S using quantitative PCR. This method is commonly used to determine the relative number of mitochondria in cells. However, we have revised and provided a clearer description in the figure legend to avoid any potential confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: Suggestions on further analyses of PGC1-alpha and TFAM. LC3-I and -II.</p></disp-quote><p>We evaluated LC3-I/II levels in PTPMT1 knockout muscles, and our findings did not indicate any signs of increased autophagic activity (Supplementary Figure S3). We will examine PGC1-alph and TFAM levels in our future studies. It is worth noting that in our previous RNA-seq analyses of PTPMT1 knockout hematopoietic cells, we did not observe any significant alterations in the expression levels of these two genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Description on fibrotic lesions.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantifying fibrotic areas poses a significant challenge. Therefore, we were only able to describe this finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: Fig 6 is not well organized and aligned.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to your suggestion, we have reorganized this figure accordingly. Panels C, D, and E display mitochondrial OCR data derived from three biological replicates/genotype. We feel that these changes are sufficient to demonstrate the differences in substrate utilization between PTPMT1 knockout and control mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: Descriptions on glucose oxidation and glycolysis in different types of muscle fibers are confusing</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the suggestions and revised the descriptions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8: A discussion about lactate utilization in cardiomyocytes would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have now added a brief discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9: “Cropped” images were used in Fig 10.</p></disp-quote><p>The images shown in Fig. 10 were not cropped images. In order to efficiently use the tissue and mitochondrial lysates, the Western blot membranes were intentionally cut into smaller fragments based on the molecular weights of the proteins to be detected. These smaller membrane sections were then employed for individual Western blotting purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment 1: The order of Fig 1 panels should be reorganized.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have now reorganized this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment 2: Suggestion for an Echocardiograph result table.</p></disp-quote><p>These analyses were carried out by trained personnel at the Emory Animal Physiology Core. The data presented in our manuscript was provided by them. It is important to note that no additional parameters were measured beyond the data provided by the Core.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment 3: Is ROS production increased in PTPMT1 knockout muscle cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, PTPMT1 knockout tissues showed elevated overall cellular ROS levels even at 3 months (Figure 6I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment 4: Typo in S10 legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The typo has been corrected.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1: The effects of PTPMT1 on the skeletal muscle and heart might be an embryonic defect. They might be mediated by significantly reduced mTOR signaling</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the valid point made by this reviewer. While both CKMM-Cre and Myh6Cre express Cre during the embryonic stage, we did not observe any developmental defects in skeletal muscle-specific (PTPMT1fl/fl/CKMM-Cre) or heart-specific (PTPMT1fl/fl/Myh6-Cre) knockout mice. These knockout mice appeared indistinguishable from their WT littermates until the age of 3-4 months.</p><p>Morphologically, the skeletal muscle and heart dissected from these mice showed no abnormalities.Additionally, mitochondria isolated from these tissues did not exhibit any morphological/structural defects. Undoubtedly, the late-onset phenotypes observed in the knockout mice over time was attributed to the metabolic defects arising from the loss of PTPMT1 in the embryos. Although PTPMT1 knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes initially maintained energy homeostasis through enhanced fatty acid and glutamate oxidation, along with metabolic adaptations or activation of alternative energy-producing pathways in the first few months, they eventually encountered substantial energy deficits. This was attributed to the subsequent occurrence of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. In response to this valuable feedback, we have included a brief discussion in the manuscript's discussion section to address this point.</p><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, the late-onset phenotypes observed in our study were likely a result of subsequent damages induced by prolonged metabolic substrate shift and lipid accumulation within the cells. We agree with the reviewer that decreased mTOR activities may also contribute to these late effects, and have included a brief discussion in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Why are the effects of the loss of PTPMT1 similar in the skeletal muscle and heart.</p></disp-quote><p>The depletion of PTPMT1 yields similar effects in both tissue types; however, the manifestations occur earlier in the skeletal muscle. Although mitochondria in the skeletal muscle and heart have distinct preferences for energy sources, prolonged forced utilization of fatty acids caused by PTPMT1 depletion eventually leads to lipid accumulation and cellular damage (lipotoxicity) in both tissue types. This phenomenon underscores the importance of maintaining a balance in substrate utilization to prevent adverse effects on cellular health in the skeletal muscle and heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: AMPK is activated in PTPMT1 knockout cardiomyocytes; this should have cardioprotective effects.</p></disp-quote><p>AMPK can be activated through various mechanisms. In our study, AMPK activation occurs in response to energetic stress in late-stage PTPMT1 knockout tissues that displayed significantly reduced ATP levels, aligning with its role as a bioenergetic stress sensor. It is possible that AMPK activation alone was insufficient to overcome the secondary damages induced by the prolonged metabolic switch from carbohydrate metabolism to fatty acid metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: Knockout skeletal muscles and hearts had lipid accumulation; why were knockout mice smaller than controls? Are there any changes in white fat, core temperature or browning of fat? Rescue experiments should be considered to prove that lipid accumulation is the cause of death in the knockout mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the lipid accumulation observed in muscle cells and cardiomyocytes of the knockout mice does not necessarily imply that these tissue-specific knockout mice would be heavier or have increased body fat. We appreciate the suggestions regarding energy expenditure tests and rescue experiments. We will certainly consider incorporating these experiments into our future study.</p><p>As stated in the manuscript, we did not observe any morphological changes in white or brown fat tissues in the adipocyte-specific PTPMT1 knockout mice. Furthermore, we assessed body temperature and its response to a cold environment (4°C), and no differences were detected between the knockout mice and the control mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Are there sex differences in muscle and heart phenotypes in the tissue specific knockout mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe significant differences in phenotypes between male and female knockout mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: What happens to UCP2 activity in PTPMT1 deleted cells and what is its function in mediating AMPK and/mTOR regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, there is a lack of direct methods available to measure UCP2 activity. The relationship between UCP2 and the regulation of AMPK and mTOR has not been extensively investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: What is the effect of PTPMT1 deletion on cardiolipin synthesis?</p></disp-quote><p>PTPMT1 has been implicated in both facilitating mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate and participating in the synthesis of cardiolipin. To investigate the impact of PTPMT1 knockout on cardiolipin levels, we plan to establish a mass spectrometry assay for the quantitative analysis of cardiolipin in knockout mitochondria. Completing these experiments might require a considerable amount of time. Nonetheless, we extensively addressed this point in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>Comment 8: The title needs more specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have revised the title to &quot;Loss of PTPMT1 restricts mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates and induces muscle atrophy and heart failure in tissue-specific knockout mice&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9: Heart and skeletal muscle weights in Fig 1A should be normalized against tibia length.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not perform normalization in this study. However, we appreciate the suggestion and will incorporate it into our future studies. It is important to note that the lengths of tibias in the knockout mice were only marginally shorter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 10: Low magnification and longitudinal section of the muscle should be shown in Fig 1B and 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>The histological images provide supporting evidence for the conclusion, despite not being optimal in quality. We acknowledge the suggested improvements and assure you that we will integrate them into our future studies. It is crucial to emphasize that each conclusion in this study was derived from multiple experimental designs, rather than solely relying on morphological changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 11: Fig 1F is mislabeled as 1G.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted a thorough review and can confidently confirm that the labeling is correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 12: Fig 2F and 6B should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the manuscript, the images presented are representatives of at least three mice per genotype.
