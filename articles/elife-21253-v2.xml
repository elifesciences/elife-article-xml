the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Kandela et al., 2015) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper &quot;BET bromodomain inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc&quot; (Delmore et al., 2011). Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells with the small-molecular inhibitor of BET bromodomains, (+)-JQ1, selectively downregulated <italic>MYC</italic> transcription, which is similar to what was reported in the original study (Figure 3B; Delmore et al., 2011). Efficacy of (+)-JQ1 was evaluated in an orthotopically xenografted model of MM. Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011). Tumor burden, as determined by bioluminescence, was decreased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7C-D; Delmore et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on <italic>MYC</italic> transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21253.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21253.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>bromodomain inhibitor</kwd><kwd>myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), for a paper by Delmore et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2011, Delmore et al. demonstrated that inhibition of BET bromodomains with a selective small-molecule, (+)-JQ1, down-regulated the c-Myc transcriptional signaling network and reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival <italic>in vivo</italic> indicating that targeting of BET bromodomains is an effective strategy to modulate c-Myc function in multiple myeloma (MM). Time-dependent downregulation of <italic>MYC</italic> was observed in a human MM cell line (MM.1S) treated with (+)-JQ1, in agreement with other examined MM cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). Using a bioluminescent MM xenograft model (MM.1S-luc) daily treatment with (+)-JQ1 resulted in a statistically significant decrease in tumor burden and, importantly, increased overall survival compared to vehicle control treated animals.</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Delmore et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 3B and 7C–E), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). Since that publication there have been additional studies examining the therapeutic strategy of targeting BET bromodomains in other types of cancer. This includes reports of antitumor effects using BET bromodomain inhibitors in MM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaidos et al., 2014</xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siu et al., 2016</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montenegro et al., 2014</xref>), childhood sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bid et al., 2016</xref>), and triple negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">da Motta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shu et al., 2016</xref>). Acquired resistance to BET inhibitors have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rathert et al., 2015</xref>), with recent studies suggesting combinatorial drug treatment to overcome resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asangani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurimchak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to efficacy, the nonclinical safety of BET inhibition has also been examined. In mesenchymal stem cells, (+)-JQ1 was reported to induce cell cycle arrest and downregulation of genes involved in self-renewal, mitosis, and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alghamdi et al., 2016</xref>), while mice treated with (+)-JQ1 at an efficacious dose resulted in lymphoid and hematopoietic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Currently, several BET bromodomain inhibitors, with slight variation in mechanism, are in clinical trials for patients with various hematologic and solid malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaidos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wadhwa and Nicolaides, 2016</xref>). Early results from a phase one study to establish the recommended dose of the OTX015/MK-8628 BET inhibitor in hematologic malignancies reported the drug was tolerated; however, thrombocytopenia was a common toxic effect observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amorim et al., 2016</xref>). In four patients with advanced stage NUT midline carcinoma, with confirmed BRD4-NUT fusions, early clinical benefit was reported for two, with a third achieving disease stabilization after treatment with OTX015/MK-8628 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stathis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evaluation of <italic>MYC</italic> expression in JQ1-treated MM.1S-luc Cells</title><p>We sought to independently replicate an experiment analyzing the expression of endogenous <italic>MYC</italic> during pharmacological inhibition of BET bromodomains with (+)-JQ1.

While the original study included a time course treatment with assessments at 0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr, the replication was restricted to the early- (0 hr and 1 hr) and late-treatment (8 hr) time points. Additionally, the replication experiment was extended to include additional control conditions to monitor <italic>MYC</italic> expression with the inactive (−)-JQ1 enantiomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>) and vehicle control at the same time points. We found that during the time course of cells treated with (+)-JQ1, <italic>MYC</italic> expression was inhibited by 0.146 times [n = 5, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.031] at 1 hr and 0.126 times [n = 5, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.036] at 8 hr following treatment compared to the amount of <italic>MYC</italic> expressed in cells at 0 hr [n = 5, M = 1.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.070] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) result was statistically significant for all effects. A further analysis of the simple main effects for each treatment type revealed a statistically significant effect with (+)-JQ1 treatment (<italic>F</italic>(2,8) = 777.5, <italic>p</italic>=6.86x10<sup>−10</sup>), indicating that the mean <italic>MYC</italic> expression was different among the three time points evaluated. As outlined <italic>a priori</italic> in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), two planned paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted as follow-up tests using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, making the significance threshold 0.025. The comparison of MM.1S-luc cells harvested 8 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment compared to cells 0 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(4) = 38.92, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=2.60x10<sup>−6</sup>, corrected <italic>p</italic>=5.21x10<sup>−6</sup>), as well as the comparison of MM.1S-luc cells harvested 1 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment compared to cells 0 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment (<italic>t</italic>(4) = 25.10, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=1.50x10<sup>−5</sup>, corrected <italic>p</italic>=2.99x10<sup>−5</sup>). As expected from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, examination of the simple main effect for vehicle control treatment was not statistically significant (<italic>F</italic>(2,8) = 1.05, <italic>p</italic>=0.394). Interestingly, though, treatment with (−)-JQ1 yielded a statistically significant effect (<italic>F</italic>(2,8) = 19.40, <italic>p</italic>=0.00085). While this indicates that the null hypothesis that there is no difference among the different time points can be rejected, the magnitude of the effect size in (−)-JQ1 treated cells, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>G</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.698, 90% CI [0.444, 0.882], is considerably smaller than (+)-JQ1 treated cells, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>G</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.989, 90% CI [0.980, 0.996]. Furthermore, <italic>MYC</italic> expression at 0 hr [n = 5, M = 1.028, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.040], 1 hr [n = 5, M = 0.928, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.034], and 8 hr [n = 5, M = 1.005, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.016] after treatment with (−)-JQ1 is in stark contrast to what was observed when MM.1S-luc cells were treated with (+)-JQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to our confirmatory analyses described above, the data were also explored as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). Although this was a planned analysis, it is exploratory because it differs from the methods used in the original study by analyzing the data as unpaired instead of paired. All of the effects of the two-way between-subjects ANOVA were statistically significant (interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(4,36) = 175.9, <italic>p</italic>=4.28x10<sup>−23</sup>; treatment main effect, <italic>F</italic>(2,36) = 665.9, p=3.68x10<sup>−29</sup>; time main effect, <italic>F</italic>(2,36) = 240.6, <italic>p</italic>=1.47x10<sup>−21</sup>). The planned contrast of MM.1S-luc cells harvested 8 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment and cells 0 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(36) = 29.27, <italic>p</italic>=1.06x10<sup>−26</sup>, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 15.82, 95% CI [8.14, 23.51]). Similarly, the planned contrast of MM.1S-luc cells harvested 1 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment compared to cells 0 hr after (+)-JQ1 treatment also yielded statistically significant results (<italic>t</italic>(36) = 29.96, <italic>p</italic>=4.80x10<sup>−26</sup>, Cohen's <italic>d</italic> = 15.71, 95% CI [8.08, 23.35]). These results are in agreement with the mixed-design ANOVA and planned paired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Testing the efficacy of JQ1 treatment in mice harboring bioluminescent MM lesions</title><p>In order to test the effectiveness of (+)-JQ1 as a therapeutic strategy to target c-Myc, we sought to replicate experiments similar to what was reported in Figure 7C–E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). This included evaluation of tumor burden in mice orthotopically xenografted, as well as analysis of the overall rate of survival. Similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, the inactive (−)-JQ1 enantiomer, which was not included in the original study, was added as an additional control to evaluate the specificity of the approach. Female SCID-beige mice were inoculated intravenously with a previously characterized bioluminescent MM model (MM.1S-luc) that recapitulates the clinical disease and allows for <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of tumor burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitsiades et al., 2004</xref>). A pilot study was conducted to determine the appropriate timescale of tumor progression during this replication attempt after an initial attempt to engraft mice resulted in a longer delay from inoculation to detection than expected and reported in the original study. During the pilot study, mice were inoculated and monitored for tumor burden 8 days and 13 days after inoculation as described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). The mice continued to be monitored three times a week until 57 days after inoculation when disease symptoms (e.g. significant weight loss and hind limb paralysis) associated with this xenograft model were detected in multiple mice. The baseline that was observed in the original study eight days after inoculation (~2×10<sup>6</sup> bioluminescence) was not observed until day 27 post-inoculation in the pilot study. Interestingly, other studies that utilized almost the same model (strain, sex, and age of mice as well as mode of injection) have also reported variable times to detectable engraftment. Tai and colleagues did not report baseline signals until two weeks after inoculation, granted 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected opposed to the 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells injected in the original study and this replication attempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tai et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, Zhang and colleagues did not observe this level of baseline bioluminescence until 2–3 weeks when injecting 3×10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, two other studies reported variable times to detectable engraftment, however these studies utilized different mouse strains and sex. When male SCID/NOD mice were injected with 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells, a baseline signal was not reported until two weeks after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitsiades et al., 2004</xref>), while Azab and colleagues, which inoculated 2×10<sup>6</sup> MM.1S-luc cells, reported that it took 3–4 weeks for sufficient tumor progression to occur and be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azab et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Following the modified time frame, mice were inoculated with 2×10<sup>6</sup> MM.1S-luc cells and closely monitored until the desired baseline bioluminescence was achieved, which occurred on day 30 post-inoculation. After a further measurement five days later, all mice with established disease, defined as lesions diffusely engrafted in the skeleton with an increase in bioluminescence between days 30 and 35, were randomized into three cohorts. Following daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle control, 50 mg/kg (+)-JQ1, or 50 mg/kg (−)-JQ1 for 36 days we assessed the overall survival rate of the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mice treated with vehicle control achieved a median survival of 24.5 days during the treatment period [n = 12], which was lengthened during (+)-JQ1 treatment. The median survival of the (+)-JQ1 treated group could not be determined since more than half of the animals survived to the pre-specified study endpoint of 36 days. The median survival of mice treated with (−)-JQ1 [n = 12] was 29 days. This compares to the original study which achieved a median survival of 22 days with vehicle control [n = 10] that was prolonged to 35 days with (+)-JQ1 treatment [n = 9]. Furthermore, the median survival rates for vehicle treated mice are in agreement with control conditions in other studies reporting survival during treatment with this xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitsiades et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tai et al., 2014</xref>). To compare the survival distributions a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed. As outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), we planned to conduct two comparisons using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons making the significance threshold 0.025. The planned comparison between (+)-JQ1 treatment and vehicle control was statistically significant (uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.024, corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.047); however, the planned comparison between (+)-JQ1 and (−)-JQ1 treatment was not statistically significant (uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.093, corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.187). Interestingly, this result suggests the (−)-JQ1 enantiomer might possess pharmacological activity even though relative <italic>MYC</italic> expression remained largely unchanged following treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This could be due to how (−)-JQ1 interacts with and is metabolized with other molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to (+)-JQ1, thus leading to unexpected effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chhabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21253.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overall survival in JQ1-treated MM.1S-luc orthotopic xenograft model.</title><p>Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival during the pre-specified study period of 36 days.

Mice treated with vehicle control or (+)-JQ1 on day 22 reached an average bioluminescence of 2.73×10<sup>8</sup> [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.01×10<sup>8</sup>] and 9.90×10<sup>7</sup> [n = 11, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.81×10<sup>8</sup>], respectively. This compares to an average bioluminescence of 1.85×10<sup>10</sup> [n = 10, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01×10<sup>10</sup>] in vehicle control treated mice and 5.52×10<sup>9</sup> [n = 9, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.25×10<sup>9</sup>] in (+)-JQ1 treated mice reported in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, tumor burden at day 22 in mice treated with (−)-JQ1 reached an average bioluminescence of 7.13×10<sup>7</sup> [n = 9, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.87×10<sup>7</sup>]. To test if (+)-JQ1 treatment decreased the burden of disease, we performed a one-way ANOVA on the day 22 bioluminescence signal (natural log-transformed), which was not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(2,24) = 1.126, <italic>p</italic>=0.341. Additionally, as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), we planned to conduct two comparisons using Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test. The planned comparison of tumor burden from mice treated with (+)-JQ1 compared to vehicle control was not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(24) = 1.303, <italic>p</italic>=0.205), nor was the planned comparison between (+)-JQ1 treatment and (−)-JQ1 (<italic>t</italic>(24) = 1.221, <italic>p</italic>=0.234). These results should take into consideration that some mice were euthanized due to disease progression before the prespecified tumor burden analysis endpoint of 22 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which did not occur in the original study. This led to a sample size imbalance due to the preferential death of mice in the vehicle control group (5 of 12) and (-)-JQ1 group (3 of 12) compared to the (+)-JQ1 group (1 of 12). The higher rate of early death in the vehicle control and (-)-JQ1 groups is reflective of the increased overall survival observed in (+)-JQ1 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Besides leading to information loss, if the mice that were euthanized ended up having high tumor burdens, then the group averages reported in this replication attempt would be distorted, limiting the opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laajala et al., 2012</xref>). This could be due to biological variability of the kinetics of engraftment and growth of systemically injected tumor cells, as well as differences in the details between the original experimental design and this replication attempt that were not known or accounted for.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21253.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tumor burden in JQ1-treated MM.1S-luc orthotopic xenograft model.</title><p>Female SCID-beige mice were orthotopically xenografted after intravenous injection with MM.1S-luc cells.

The depth and location of the tumor as well as the thickness or color of the animal’s skin can alter the bioluminescent signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baba et al., 2007</xref>), as well as the choice of anesthesia used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keyaerts et al., 2012</xref>). The route of administration and the timing of imaging after D-luciferin injections can also impact the signal. While this study injected D-luciferin by intraperitoneal injection, same as the original study, this route of injection can lead to variations in the signal due to variations in the rate of absorption across the peritoneum to reach the luciferase expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Close et al., 2011</xref>). This makes intravenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keyaerts et al., 2008</xref>) or subcutaneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khalil et al., 2013</xref>) administration of D-luciferin attractive alternatives. Further, the signal, and thus the perception of tumor burden, can also vary during longitudinal monitoring since the time course of the bioluminescence signal after D-luciferin injection changes with days after the luciferase expressing cells were inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Meta-analyses of original and replicated effects</title><p>We performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to combine each of the effects described above as pre-specified in the confirmatory analysis plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The replication study of &quot; BET Bromodomain Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy to Target c-Myc &quot; is proposed to replicate the key findings in the original paper published in Cell by Delmore et al. in 2011. The experiments set up in this replication study are consistent with their published registered report in <italic>eLife</italic> last year. The description of the experiments is very detailed and the mathematical statistical methods used in this replication study are objective, proper and accurate.

Similarly, Zhang and colleagues did not observe this level of baseline bioluminescence until 2-3 weeks when injecting 3x106 cells (Zhang et al., 2014).

In the Replication Study we described the unpaired t-test as an additional exploratory analysis since it was not originally reported (revised text: “Although this was a planned analysis, it is exploratory because it differs from the methods used in the original study by analyzing the data as unpaired instead of paired.”). We have also revised the statistical section for this experiment as suggested in first comment to better clarify this aspect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
