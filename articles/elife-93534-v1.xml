We confirmed a 13–11 hybrid chromosome with long-read sequencing, consistent with a translocation product arising from recombination between large interchromosomal ribosome-containing segmental duplications. Within most 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasites, the duplicated chromosome 11 segments were identical. Across parasites, multiple distinct haplotype groupings were consistent with emergence due to clonal expansion of progeny from intrastrain meiotic recombination.

The resulting lack of these proteins allows the parasite to fully escape diagnosis by PfHRP2-based RDTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Organization WH, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomson et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Pfhrp2/3</italic>-deleted parasites appear to be spreading rapidly in some regions and have compromised existing test-and-treat programs, especially in the Horn of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feleke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">WHO, 2020</xref>). The prevalence of parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion varies markedly across continents and regions in a manner not explained by RDT use alone. Parasites with these deletions are well-established in areas where PfHRP2-based RDTs have never been used routinely, such as parts of South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomson et al., 2020</xref>). Studies in Ethiopia, where false-negative RDTs owing to <italic>pfhrp2 and pfhrp3</italic> deletions are common, suggest that the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion arose first, given it is more prevalent and shows a shorter shared haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feleke et al., 2021</xref>). The reason why <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion occurred prior to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> remains unclear. A 1994 study of the HB3 laboratory strain reported frequent meiotic translocation of a <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion from chromosomes 13 to 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinterberg et al., 1994</xref>). An explanation of this mechanism, whether it might occur in natural populations, and how it relates to the initial loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> has not been fully explored.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Precise pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion mechanisms remain unknown</title><p>Studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> structural rearrangements are challenging, and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions are particularly difficult due to their position in complex subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric regions represent roughly 5% of the genome, are unstable, and contain rapidly diversifying gene families (e.g. <italic>var</italic>, <italic>rifin</italic>, <italic>stevor</italic>) that undergo frequent conversion between chromosomes mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and double-stranded breakage (DSB) and telomere healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calhoun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattei and Scherf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vernick and McCutchan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Subtelomeric exchange importantly allows for unbalanced progeny without the usual deleterious ramifications of altering a larger proportion of a chromosome. Notably, newly formed duplications predispose to further duplications or other rearrangements through NAHR between highly identical paralogous regions. Together, this potentiates the rapid expansion of gene families and their spread across subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conrad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Didelot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mills et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parks et al., 2015</xref>). The duplicative transposition of a subtelomeric region of one chromosome onto another chromosome frequently occurs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Specifically, prior studies have found duplicative transposition events involving several genes, including <italic>var2csa</italic> and <italic>cytochrome b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bopp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claessens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> are adjacent to but not considered part of the subtelomeric regions, and recombination of <italic>var</italic> genes does not result in the deletion of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feleke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otto et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>Telomere healing, de novo telomere addition via telomerase activity, is associated with subtelomeric deletion events in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that involve chromosomal breakage and loss of all downstream genes. Healing serves to stabilize the end of the chromosome. Deletion of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> knob-associated histidine-rich protein (<italic>KAHRP</italic> or <italic>pfhrp1</italic>) and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> genes via this mechanism was first reported to occur in laboratory isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pologe and Ravetch, 1988</xref>). Since then, studies have defined the critical role of telomerase in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and additional occurrences affecting several genes, including <italic>pfhrp1, Pf332,</italic> and <italic>Pf87</italic> in laboratory isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bottius et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattei and Scherf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scherf and Mattei, 1992</xref>). For <italic>pfhrp1</italic> and <italic>pfhrp2,</italic> this deletion mechanism only occurred in laboratory isolates but not in clinical samples, suggesting the genes have important roles in normal infections, and their loss is selected against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scherf and Mattei, 1992</xref>).</p><p>An improved understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions can provide important insights into how frequently they occur and the evolutionary pressures driving their emergence and help inform control strategies. We examined the pattern and nature of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions using available whole-genome sequences and additional long-read sequencing. The objectives of this study were to determine the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion patterns along with their geographical associations and sequence and assemble the chromosomes containing the deletions using long-read sequencing. Our findings shed light on geographical differences in <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion patterns, their mechanisms, and how they likely emerged, providing key information for improved surveillance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in the global <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomic dataset</title><p>We examined all publicly available Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from global <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates as of January 2023, comprising 19,313 field samples and lab isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We analyzed the genomic regions containing <italic>pfhrp2</italic> on chromosome 8 and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> on chromosome 13 to detect nucleotide and copy number variation (e.g. deletions and duplications) using local haplotype assembly and sequencing depth. Regions on chromosomes 5 and 11 associated with these duplicates were also analyzed based on associations with patterns seen within chromosomes 8 and 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, Methods). Samples were eliminated for downstream analysis if they had less than 5 x median genomic coverage and selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) samples with significant variability on visible inspection. This resulted in 3321 samples being eliminated, leaving 15,992 samples for further analysis. We removed six samples that showed signs of deletions but also had a complexity of infection (COI) greater than 1 to eliminate any artifact introduced by mixed infections from downstream analysis. We identified 26 parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion and 168 with <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion. Twenty field samples contained both deletions; 11 were found in Ethiopia, six in Peru, and three in Brazil, and all had the 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion pattern. Across all regions, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions were more common than <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions; specifically, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions were present in Africa in 42 and 11, Asia in 51 and 3, and South America in 75 and 11 parasites. It should be noted that these numbers are not accurate measures of prevalence, given that the publicly available WGS specimens utilized in this analysis come from locations and time periods that commonly used RDT positivity for collection. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions are difficult to sequence and assemble, meaning these numbers may be significantly underestimated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pfhrp2 deletion associated with variable breakpoints and telomeric healing</title><p>We further examined the breakpoints of 26 parasites (24 patient parasites and two lab isolates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Within each parasite, the microhaplotypes in the telomeric region are identical, consistent with a continuation of the adjacent chromosome 11 duplication. However, for nearly all parasites, as the region traverses towards the centromere within the ribosomal duplication, there is an abrupt transition where the haplotypes begin to differ. These transition points vary but are shared within specific groupings correlating with the chromosome 11 microhaplotype clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). These transition points likely represent NAHR exchange breakpoints, and their varied locations further support that multiple intrastrain translocation events have given rise to 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasites in the population.

The limited number of <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted strains showed chromosome 8 breakpoints predominantly in the gene with evidence of telomere healing, a common repair mechanism in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calhoun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions occurred through three different mechanisms. The least common mechanism involved simple breakage loss of chromosome 13 from <italic>pfhrp3</italic> to the telomere, followed by telomere healing (13<sup>-</sup>TARE1 pattern). The second most common pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> was likely the result of NAHR, within 20–28 bp di-nucleotide AT repeats translocating a 26,535 bp region of chromosome 5 containing <italic>pfmdr1</italic> onto chromosome 13, thereby duplicating <italic>pfmdr1</italic> and deleting <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. There appeared to be one origin of 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>, which was only observed in the Asia population, and its continued presence was potentially driven by the added benefit of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication in the presence of mefloquine. The most common pattern, 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>, predominated in the Americas and Africa and was the result of NAHR between chromosome 11 and 13 within the large 15.2 kb highly-identical ribosomal duplication, translocating and thereby duplicating 70,175 bp of core chromosome 11 plus 15–87 kb of paralogous sub-telomeric region replacing the chromosomal region on chromosome 13 that contained <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. Importantly, NAHR-mediated translocations resulting in deletion have repeatedly occurred based on evidence of multiple breakpoints and chromosome 11 haplotypes with identical copies in parasites. These findings, combined with identical copies of the shared chromosome 11 segment, suggest that these parasites represent multiple instances of intrastrain (self) NAHR-mediated translocation followed by clonal propagation of 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> progeny. Within haplotype groups with identical chromosome 11 duplicated regions, there appear to be several clonal groups, which suggests that different events lead to the same duplication of chromosome 11, and each continued to have clonal propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). While Hinterberg et al. proposed that a general mechanism of non-homologous recombination of the subtelomeric regions may be responsible for translocating the already existing deletion of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinterberg et al., 1994</xref>), our analysis would suggest ribosomal duplication-mediated NAHR is the likely cause of the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion itself. The high frequency of the meiotic translocation in the laboratory cross further supports the hypothesis that these NAHR-mediated translocations are occurring at a high frequency in meiosis in natural populations. Consequently, this suggests that progeny must be strongly selected against in natural populations apart from where specific conditions exist, allowing for <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion to emerge and expand (e.g. South America and the Horn of Africa).</p><p>Positive selection due to drug resistance may underlie pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> translocation that duplicates <italic>pfmdr1</italic> onto chromosome 13. In South East Asia (SEA), the only place containing pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>, tandem duplications of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> exist that provide mefloquine resistance, and mefloquine has been used extensively as an artemisinin partner drug, unlike Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veiga et al., 2016</xref>). Discordant reads, local assembly, and TARE1 identification support NAHR-mediated translocation of <italic>pfmdr1,</italic> followed by telomeric healing to create a functional chromosome. All strains showed the same exact NAHR breakpoint and TARE1 localization consistent with a single origin event, giving rise to all 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> parasites. Interestingly, <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplications have been shown to be unstable, with both increases and decreases in copy numbers frequently occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samarakoon et al., 2011</xref>). During de-amplification, a free fragment of DNA containing a <italic>pfmdr1</italic> copy may have been the substrate that integrated into chromosome 13 by NAHR, followed by telomerase healing to stabilize the 13–5 hybrid chromosome, analogous to <italic>var</italic> gene recombination events where double-stranded DNA is displaced, becoming highly recombinogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The spread of 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup> containing parasites could be due to the benefit of the extra <italic>pfmdr1</italic> copy on chromosome 13, the loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic>, or both. Its expansion in SEA would be consistent with selection due to copy-number-associated mefloquine resistance, given mefloquine’s extensive use as an individual and artemisinin partner drug in the region. Furthermore, given all isolates with evidence of this duplication either had only wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic> or were mixed, the 13–5 chromosome copy most likely had wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic>. In 20 out of 25 <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication cases with a mixed genotype of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), the core genome <italic>pfmdr1</italic> had the Y184F mutation with no other mutations detected within the <italic>pfmdr1</italic> gene. Isolates containing only Y184F in <italic>pfmdr1</italic> were shown to be outgrown by wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duvalsaint et al., 2021</xref>), which would mean having the wild-type <italic>pfmdr1</italic> duplication on chromosome 13 might confer a stable (non-tandem) ‘heterozygous’ survival advantage beyond just increased copy number-mediated resistance to mefloquine.</p><p>To confirm the NAHR event between 11 and 13 leading to loss of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> observed in our analysis of short-read data, we long-read sequenced <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deleted lab isolates, HB3 and SD01, to generate reads spanning the 15 kb duplicated region, showing support for a normal chromosome 11 and a hybrid 13–11 in both isolates. These findings supported an NAHR event between the two 15 kb duplicated regions, causing this interchromosomal exchange and leading to progeny with a hybrid 13–11 chromosome lacking <italic>pfhrp3</italic> and its surrounding genes from the 15 kb duplicated region and onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This was consistent with the genomic coverage pattern we observed in publicly available data from 117 <italic>pfhrp3-</italic>deleted field samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such translocation patterns have been described and confirmed by long-read sequencing but have generally involved multigene families such as <italic>var</italic> genes within the subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calhoun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The event described here represented a much larger section of loss/duplication of 70 kb of the core genome in addition to the subtelomere.</p><p>We propose a mechanistic model in which homology misalignment and recombination between chromosomes 11 and 13 initially occurs in an oocyst from identical parasites predominately in low transmission settings, resulting in four potential progeny including one with normal chromosomes 11 and 13 and three with translocations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This could account for the identical haplotypes observed in the two copies of the chromosome 11 segment. Based on the identical haplotypes observed in most parasites, the most direct and likely mechanism involves progeny with two copies of chromosome 11 recombining with an unrelated strain to yield unrelated chromosome 11 haplotypes. This duplication-mediated NAHR event occurs frequently during meiosis and can explain the frequent rearrangements seen between chromosomes 11 and 13 in the previous experimental cross of HB3 × DD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinterberg et al., 1994</xref>). Meiotic misalignment and subsequent NAHR is a common cause of high-frequency chromosomal rearrangements, including in human disease (e.g. in humans, 22q11 deletion syndrome due to misalignment of duplicated blocks on chromosome 22 occurs in 1 in 4000 births)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vergés et al., 2014</xref>).

This decreased fitness of parasites with <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions also argues against a mitotic origin, as deletions arising after meiosis would have to compete against more numerous and more fit intact parasites. Additionally, <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions arising in culture have not been observed. The fact that abundant <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions have only been observed in low-transmission areas where within-infection competition is rare is consistent with this hypothesis of within-infection competition suppressing emergence. In the setting of RDT use in a low-transmission environment, a pfhrp2 deletion occurring in the context of an existing <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion may be more strongly selected for compared to a <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion occurring alone still detectable by RDTs. This is supported by evidence that <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion appears to predate <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions in the Horn of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feleke et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The biological effects of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> loss and potential selective forces are complicated due to other genes lost and gained and the extent of the rearrangements.

Conversely, the lack of this protein is likely detrimental to survival and may be why the reciprocal hybrid 11–13 (pattern 13<sup>++</sup>11<sup>-</sup>) was not observed in field isolates. Only lab isolate FCR3 had any indication from coverage data that it had a duplicated chromosome 13 and a deleted chromosome 11. Furthermore, when looking at the field samples with chromosome 11 deletions with telomere healing, breakages were almost exclusively right after <italic>pf332</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>)<italic>,</italic> which suggests this protein is vital. Given that the majority of the publicly available field samples were collected from studies using RDT-positive samples and that RDT would have likely detected the increased PfHRP3 encoded by duplicated <italic>pfhrp3</italic>, sampling should not be biased against detecting parasites with this reciprocal hybrid 11–13. Thus, the lack of 11–13 rearrangement in field isolates suggests that the selective disadvantage of the lost and gained genes was strong enough to prevent its emergence in the natural parasite population.</p><p>While further studies are needed to determine the reasons for these geographical patterns of <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions, our results provide an improved understanding of the mechanism of structural variation underlying <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion. They also suggest general constraints against emergence in high-transmission regions due to within-host competition and that there are likely further specific requirements for emergence in low-transmission settings. If selective constraints of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions are similar, the high frequency of the NAHR-mediated loss and the additional drug pressure from duplication of <italic>pfmdr1</italic> may explain why <italic>pfhrp3</italic> loss precedes <italic>pfhrp2</italic> loss despite RDT pressure presumably exerting stronger survival advantage with loss of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> versus <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. However, given we still have a limited understanding of their biological roles, there may be situations where selective forces may favor loss of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> relative to <italic>pfhrp3</italic>. Limitations of this study include the use of publicly available sequencing data that were collected often based on positive rapid diagnostic tests, which limits our interpretation of the occurrence and relative frequency of these deletions. This could introduce regional biases due to different diagnostic methods as well as limit the full range of deletion mechanisms, particularly <italic>pfhrp2</italic>. Our findings are clinically important because the continued loss of these genes without timely intervention may result in a rapid decrease in the sensitivity of HRP2-based RDTs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have performed long-read sequencing to definitively span and assemble the entire segmental duplication involved in the deletions.

Raw fastqs were downloaded using their short read archive (SRA) accession numbers. Using default settings, raw reads were trimmed with AdapterRemoval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schubert et al., 2016</xref>). Processed reads were mapped to a genome file that was created by combining the human genome (GRCh38), <italic>mycoplasma</italic> genomes [Genbank accession AP014657.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hata, 2015</xref>) and LR214940.1], and 3D7 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (version 2015-06-18) genome with bwa-mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li, 2013</xref>) using settings of ‘-M -k 25’ to optimize for contamination removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>).

Read depth was then normalized by dividing by the median coverage of the whole genome. Read depth for the regions shared between chromosomes 11 and 13 was determined by taking reads mapped to the corresponding regions on 11 or 13 and then dividing by 2 to get the coverage for those regions. Samples were eliminated for downstream analysis if they had less than 5 x median genomic coverage and sWGA samples with significant variability on visible inspection. For most visualizations, the coverage is rounded to the nearest 1, and the max coverage is capped at 2 x coverage for better visualization. To ensure analysis of only highly confident deleted strains, normalized read depth between 0.1–1 was rounded to 1, and less than 0.1 was rounded to 0. Samples were considered for potential genomic deletion if they had zero coverage after rounding from chromosome 8 1,375,557–1,387,982 for <italic>pfhrp2</italic>, chromosome 13 from 2,841,776–2,844,785 for <italic>pfhrp3</italic>, and from chromosome 11 1,991,347–2,003,328. These numbers were chosen after visual inspection of samples with any zero coverage within the genomic region of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic>.

Variants were then filtered to only biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The complexity of infection (COI) was determined using the REAL McCOIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) on the 1000 highest expected heterozygosity SNPs. Identity by descent was calculated using hmmIBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaffner et al., 2018</xref>) to get inter-strain relatedness between samples.</p><p>Local haplotype reconstruction was also performed on each region described above on all the WGS samples using PathWeaver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nickjhathaway/PathWeaver">https://github.com/nickjhathaway/PathWeaver</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hathaway, 2024</xref> manuscript in preparation). PathWeaver takes the reads mapped to a region of interest and then performs a de Bruijn graph construction while keeping read information to inform graph traversal to prevent chimera assemblies in polyclonal samples. The haplotypes from PathWeaver were analyzed by constructing a graph for each genomic region to determine the conserved subregions that all haplotypes traversed using custom C++ scripts. Smaller variable regions were then determined to be those between these conserved regions. These variable subregions were used for genotyping by running PathWeaver again on these new regions. The regions analyzed were chromosome 05 (including <italic>pfmdr1</italic>): 929,384–988,747,, chromosome 08: 1,290,239–1,387,982, chromosome 11: 1,897,151–2,003,328, chromosome 13: 2,769,916–2,844,785 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>).

To search for the presence of TARE1 within the short read Illumina WGS datasets, reads from the entire regions of interest were pulled down across chromosomes 5, 8, 11, and 13, and the above TARE1 pattern was searched for in each read. Regions with TARE1 detected in their reads were assembled to ensure the TARE1 sequence was contiguous with the genomic region from which the reads were pulled. The regions with TARE1 contiguous with genomic regions were then compared to the coverage pattern within the area. A parasite was marked as having evidence of telomere healing if TARE1 was detected in the regions where coverage then dropped to 0 or down to the genomic coverage of the rest of the genome in the case of the chromosome 5 duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Chromosome 5 pfmdr1 duplication breakpoint determination</title><p>The recombination breakpoints on chromosome 5 were determined by looking for discordant read pairs (mates mapping to different chromosomal positions around areas of interest), assembling the discordant pairs, and mapping back to the assembled contig.

The genomic regions where coverage had a sudden fold increase to 2 x or 3 x coverage were scanned in 500 bp windows, and discordant mates, as determined by their alignment by bwa, were gathered in each window. If a window had several discordant mates that mapped to within 500 bp of each other, these regions would be linked. Raw reads were then pulled from the original and discordant regions and assembled using PathWeaver. The assembled contigs were then aligned using LASTZ to determine where a contig switched from one chromosomal region (upstream for the tandem duplication or to a different chromosome like the chromosome 13 translocation) to determine the exact genomic locations of the breakpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>pfhrp3 pattern determination</title><p>A sample was considered pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> if it had zero coverage on chromosome 13 from the chromosome 11/13 duplicated region with no detectable TARE1 sequence at the location where coverage dropped to zero and if it had detectable coverage on chromosome 11 from the duplicated region onwards.

To assemble the low coverage and highly similar chromosome 11 and 13 segments of SD01, two assemblies were performed with Flye using chromosome 13-specific and 11-specific reads to get contigs representing the chromosome 11 and 13 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and final contigs were polished using the Illumina SD01 reads using the program pilon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walker et al., 2014</xref>). HB3 was assembled using the Canu assembler with default settings. Note that SD01 had a more disjointed assembly, likely due to coming from the last remaining cryopreserved vial, which had low parasitemia, was nonviable, and had a subsequent lower amount of input DNA.

To ensure analysis of only highly confident deleted strains, normalized coverage of 0.1 or more was round to 1 instead of 0. Samples were considered for potential genomic deletion if they had zero coverage after rounding from chromosome 8 1,375,557 to 1,387,982 for <italic>pfhrp2</italic>, chromosome 13 from 2,841,776 to 2,844,785 for <italic>pfhrp3</italic>, and from chromosome 11 1,991,347 to 2,003,328.

There is no mention of how missing data were handled. Without this, it is difficult to know when conclusions were based on analyses that were more quantitative (for instance, using pre-determined read thresholds) or more subjective (with patterns being extracted visually).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated several parts of the methods section to explicitly state what thresholds and analysis pipelines to use, making our documentation clearer. For mapping to the hybrid vs standard chromosomes for the long reads, spanning reads across the duplicated region were required to extend 50bp upstream and downstream of the region. These regions are significantly different between chromosomes 11 and 13, so requiring spanning reads to map to these regions prevented multi-mapping reads. Reads that started within the duplicated region were allowed to map to both the hybrid and standard chromosomes for visualization in Figure 4. Importantly, for both HB3 and SD01, no reads spanned from the duplicated region into chromosome 13, showing a complete lack of reads that contained the portion of chromosome 13 that came after the duplicated region. None of the other isolates had any spanning reads across the hybrid chromosomes. Details on deletion calls were based on initial visualization of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> and then on read thresholds (see above response for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: Third, while a new method is employed for local haplotype reconstruction (PathWeaver), the manuscript does not include details on this approach or benchmarking data with which to evaluate its performance and understand any potential artifacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an analysis based on biallelic SNPs to compare to the PathWeaver results, which produced similar results to help validate the PathWeaver results.

The identification of only one type of deletion pattern for Pfhrp2 may be related to these biases.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a section in the Discussion on the limitations of our study, which states the following, “Limitations of this study include the use of publicly available sequencing data that were collected often based on positive rapid diagnostic tests, which limits our interpretation of the occurrence and relative frequency of these deletions. This could introduce regional biases due to different diagnostic methods as well as limit the full range of deletion mechanisms, particularly pfhrp2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: The specific objectives of the study are not stated clearly, and it is sometimes difficult to know which findings are new to this study. Is it the first study analyzing all the worldwide available sequences? Is it the first one to do long-read sequencing to span the entire duplicated region?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Introduction, we added, “The objectives of this study were to determine the pfhrp3 deletion patterns along with their geographical associations and sequence and assemble the chromosomes containing the deletions using long-read sequencing.”</p><p>We also added in the Discussion, “To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have performed long-read sequencing to definitively span and assemble the entire segmental duplication involved in the deletions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: Another aspect that should be explained in the introduction is that there was previous information about the association of the deletions to patterns found in chromosomes 5 and 11. In the short-read sequences results, it is not clear if these chromosomes were analysed because of the associations found in this study (and no associations were found to putative duplications or deletions in other chromosomes), or if they were specifically included in the analysis because of the previous information (and the other chromosomes were not analysed).</p></disp-quote><p>The former is correct. Chromosomes 5 and 11 were analyzed due to the associations found in this study, not from prior information. We have added the following sentence in the Results: “As a result of our short-read analysis demonstrating these three patterns and discordant reads between the chromosomes involved, chromosomes 5, 11, and 13 were further examined. No other chromosomes had associated discordant reads or changes in read coverage. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: An interesting statement in the discussion is that existing pfhrp3 deletions in a low-transmission environment may provide a genetic background on which less frequent pfhrp2 deletion events can occur. Does it mean that the occurrence of pfhrp3 deletions would favor the pfhrp2 deletion events? How, and is there any evidence for that?</p></disp-quote><p>We should have stated more explicitly that selection would better be able to act on the now doubly deleted parasite versus a parasite with HRP3 still intact and weakly detectable by RDTs.Since fully RDT-negative parasites require a two-hit mechanism, where both <italic>pfhrp2</italic> and <italic>pfhrp3</italic> need to be deleted, and since there appear to be more mechanisms and drivers for <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletions, this would create a population of parasites with one hit already and would only require the additional hit of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion to occur to become RDT negative. So the point in the discussion being made is not that the <italic>pfhrp3</italic> deletion would favor <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion but rather that there is a population circulating with one hit already, which would make it more likely that the less frequent pfhrp2 deletion would result in a dual deleted parasite and therefore an RDT-negative parasite. The discussion has been modified to the following to try to make this point more clear. “In the setting of RDT use in a low-transmission environment, a pfhrp2 deletion occurring in the context of an existing pfhrp3 deletion may be more strongly selected for compared to pfhrp2 deletion occurring alone still detectable by RDTs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Reviewer comment: In the text, clonal propagation is the proposed hypothesis for the presence of near-identical copies of the chromosome 11 duplicated region. Even among the parasites showing variation between chromosomes, Figure 5 shows 3 haplotype groups with multiple sample members, which is also suggestive that these are highly related parasites. In addition to confirming COI status, it would be straightforward to calculate the genome-wide relatedness between/among parasites belonging to the same haplotype group. The assumption is that they are clones or highly related. A different finding would require more thought into potential genomic artifacts driving the pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We confirmed the COI of each sample using THE REAL McCOIL. Six samples were not monoclonal, and we removed these samples from the downstream analysis to remove any contribution of polyclonal samples to the downstream haplotype analysis. Then, by using hmmIBD on whole-genome biallelic SNPs, we determined the whole-genome relatedness between the parasites. The haplotype groups do appear clonal though there appear to be several clonal groups within the larger groups of clusters 01 (n=28) and 03 (n=12) which combined with the variation seen within the 15.2kb region on chromosome 11/13, there appears to be different events that then lead to the same duplicated chromosome 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: By way of validating the PathWeaver results, it could be useful to use another comparator method on the samples that are COI=1 or 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an analysis based on biallelic SNPs to compare to the PathWeaver results, which produced similar results to help validate the PathWeaver results. We continued to use PathWeaver (Hathaway, in preparation), which is better able to detect variation relative to standard GATK4 analyses due to the refined local alignments from assembled haplotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Questions regarding Methods:</p><p>Reviewer comment: Were any metrics of genome quality factored into sample selection?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, samples were removed if there was less than &lt;5x median whole genome coverage. Additionally, several subsets of sWGA samples were removed based on visual inspection. These details have been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: How were polyclonal samples treated to ensure they did not produce analysis artifacts?</p></disp-quote><p>The read-depth analysis required zero coverage across the regions of <italic>pfhrp2/pfhrp3,</italic> which made it so that most of the samples analyzed were monoclonal (or polyclonal infections of only deleted strains). We have now used THE REAL McCOIL on whole genome SNPs to determine COIs. Six samples were identified as polyclonal, and we removed them for the analysis and updated the manuscript. Their removal did not significantly impact the results or conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: How was local realignment of short-read data performed? Was this step informed by the conserved, non-paralogous genomic regions, or were these only used for downstream variant analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>No local realignment of short-read data was performed. The analysis was either read depth or de novo assembly from reads from specific regions. Regarding the de novo assembly, variant calls were replaced by complete local haplotypes, and a region was typed based on the haplotype called for the region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: For read-depth estimation, what cutoffs were used to classify windows as deletion, WT, or duplication? How much variability was present in the data? The plot legends imply a continuous scale, but in reality, only 3 discrete colors are used (0, 1, 2), so these must represent the data after rounding.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been added to the manuscript. See response to Reviewer #1 questions #2 and #3 above</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: Similarly, what thresholds were used for mapping the long-reads? In Fig S21, it appears there is a high proportion of discordant reads.</p></disp-quote><p>Long reads were mapped using minimap2 with default settings. For Figure 21, since it is from the mappings to 3D7 chromosome 11 and hybrid 3D7 13-11 chromosome, the genome from the duplicated region from the blue bar underneath is identical, so reads are expected to map to both since the genome regions are identical. The significance of this figure and Figure 4 is the number of long reads that span the whole chr11/13 duplicated region connection the 3D7 chromosome 11 and the hybrid proving that there are reads that start with chromosome 13 sequence and end with chromosome 11 sequence and the lack of reads that span from chromosome 13 into the 3D7 chromosome 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: The section on the mdr1 breakpoints is too vague.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the methods section to be more explicit about how these breakpoints were determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comment: I assume that the &quot;Homologous Genomic Structure&quot; section of the Methods is the number analysis that was alluded to in the Results?
