Supplying equimolar amounts of assembly-competent ribosomal proteins is complicated by their aggregation propensity and the spatial separation of their location of synthesis and pre-ribosome incorporation. Recent evidence has highlighted that dedicated chaperones protect individual, unassembled ribosomal proteins on their path to the pre-ribosomal assembly site. Here, we show that the co-translational recognition of Rpl3 and Rpl4 by their respective dedicated chaperone, Rrb1 or Acl4, reduces the degradation of the encoding <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In both cases, negative regulation of mRNA levels occurs when the availability of the dedicated chaperone is limited and the nascent ribosomal protein is instead accessible to a regulatory machinery consisting of the nascent-polypeptide-associated complex and the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex. Notably, deregulated expression of Rpl3 and Rpl4 leads to their massive aggregation and a perturbation of overall proteostasis in cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1. Taken together, we have uncovered an unprecedented regulatory mechanism that adjusts the de novo synthesis of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their actual consumption during ribosome assembly and, thereby, protects cells from the potentially detrimental effects of their surplus production.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells are packed full of molecules known as proteins, which perform many vital tasks the cells need to survive and grow. Machines called ribosomes inside the cells use template molecules called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs for short) to produce proteins. The newly-made proteins then have to travel to a specific location in the cell to perform their tasks. Some newly-made proteins are prone to forming clumps, so cells have other proteins known as chaperones that ensure these clumps do not form.</p><p>The ribosomes themselves are made up of several proteins, some of which are also prone to clumping as they are being produced. To prevent this from happening, cells control how many ribosomal proteins they make, so there are just enough to form the ribosomes the cell needs at any given time. Previous studies found that, in yeast, two ribosomal proteins called Rpl3 and Rpl4 each have their own dedicated chaperone to prevent them from clumping. However, it remained unclear whether these chaperones are also involved in regulating the levels of Rpl3 and Rpl4.</p><p>To address this question, Pillet et al. studied both of these dedicated chaperones in yeast cells. The experiments showed that the chaperones bound to their target proteins (either units of Rpl3 or Rpl4) as they were being produced on the ribosomes. This protected the template mRNAs the ribosomes were using to produce these proteins from being destroyed, thus allowing further units of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to be produced. When enough Rpl3 and Rpl4 units were made, there were not enough of the chaperones to bind them all, leaving the mRNA templates unprotected. This led to the destruction of the mRNA templates, which decreased the numbers of Rpl3 and Rpl4 units being produced.</p><p>The work of Pillet et al. reveals a feedback mechanism that allows yeast to tightly control the levels of Rpl3 and Rpl4. In the future, these findings may help us understand diseases caused by defects in ribosomal proteins, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and possibly also neurodegenerative diseases caused by clumps of proteins forming in cells. The next step will be to find out whether the mechanism uncovered by Pillet et al. also exists in human and other mammalian cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>protein homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Ccr4-Not complex</kwd><kwd>mRNA degradation</kwd><kwd>yeast genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_156764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kressler</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_175547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kressler</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_204801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kressler</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14C154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kressler</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel co-translational mechanism continuously adjusts the expression levels of ribosomal proteins Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their consumption during ribosome synthesis by regulating the abundance of their mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosomes are the molecular machines that synthesize all cellular proteins from mRNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>). Eukaryotic 80S ribosomes are made up of two unequal ribosomal subunits (r-subunits): the small 40S and the large 60S r-subunit. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the 40S r-subunit is composed of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 33 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), while the 60S r-subunit contains 3 rRNA species (25S, 5.8S, and 5S) and 46 r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, the making of ribosomes corresponds to a gigantic molecular jigsaw puzzle, which, when accurately pieced together, results in the formation of translation-competent ribosomes. Our current understanding of ribosome biogenesis is mostly derived from studying this multistep assembly process in the model organism <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. An exponentially growing yeast cell contains ~200,000 ribosomes and, with a generation time of 90 min, needs to produce more than 2000 ribosomes per minute, thus, requiring the synthesis of at least ~160,000 r-proteins per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Warner, 1999</xref>). Given the enormous complexity of the process, it is not surprising that a plethora (&gt;200) of mostly essential biogenesis factors is involved to ensure its fast and faultless completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kressler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bassler and Hurt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>). While atomic structures of eukaryotic ribosomes have already been obtained 10 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klinge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>), recent advances in cryo-EM have now enabled to solve high-resolution structures of several distinct pre-ribosomal particles, thereby starting to provide a detailed molecular view of ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Greber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kressler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bassler and Hurt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The early steps of ribosome synthesis take place in the nucleolus where the rDNA genes are transcribed into precursor rRNAs (pre-rRNAs). Three of the four rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, and 25S) are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) into a 35S pre-rRNA, which undergoes covalent modifications and endo- and exonucleolytic cleavage reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Watkins and Bohnsack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fernández-Pevida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Turowski and Tollervey, 2015</xref>), whereas the fourth rRNA (5S) is transcribed as a pre-5S rRNA by RNA Pol III. The stepwise association of several biogenesis modules, additional biogenesis factors, and selected small-subunit r-proteins with the nascent 35S pre-rRNA leads to the formation of the 90S pre-ribosome. Then, endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-rRNA separates the two assembly paths and gives rise to the first pre-40S and pre-60S particles, which are, upon further maturation, exported to the cytoplasm where they are converted into translation-competent 40S and 60S r-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kressler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bassler and Hurt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To sustain optimal rates of ribosome assembly, each of the 79 r-proteins must be produced in an assembly-competent amount that, at least, matches the abundance of the newly synthesized 35S pre-rRNA. This enormous logistic task is complicated by the fact that 59 r-proteins are synthesized from duplicated r-protein genes (RPGs) and that most primary RPG mRNA transcripts (102 of 138) contain introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Planta and Mager, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>). As a first mechanism to ensure the roughly equimolar supply of each r-protein, RPG transcription is regulated such that the output for each of the 79 RPG mRNAs, regardless of whether derived from a single-copy or duplicated RPG, is within a similar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zeevi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Knight et al., 2014</xref>). This co-regulation of the three different RPG promoter types is mediated by the complementary action of the two TORC1-controlled transcription factors Ifh1 and Sfp1, which are either mainly required for activation of category I and II (Ifh1) or category III (Sfp1) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Zencir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shore et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, RPG transcription is also coordinated with RNA Pol I activity via Utp22-dependent sequestration of Ifh1 in the CURI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>). However, transcriptional harmonization is likely not sufficient because the quantitative and qualitative production of r-proteins is influenced by additional parameters, such as the stability and translatability of the different RPG mRNAs as well as the intrinsic stability and aggregation propensity of each individual r-protein. Despite their difficult structural characteristics and highly basic nature, which make them susceptible for aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jäkel et al., 2002</xref>), r-proteins are nevertheless, as shown in mammalian cells, continuously produced beyond their actual consumption in ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lam et al., 2007</xref>). Apparently, cells can readily cope with a moderate excess of unassembled r-proteins in the nucleus as these are selectively recognized and ubiquitinated by the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1 (ERISQ pathway) and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>). However, when orphan r-proteins are more excessively present, owing to a severe perturbation of ribosome assembly, and start to aggregate, a stress response pathway, termed RASTR or RPAS, is activated, which alleviates the proteostatic burden by upregulating Hsf1-dependent target genes and downregulating RPG transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tye et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In order to not unnecessarily strain cellular proteostasis under normal growth conditions, cells have evolved general as well as highly specific mechanisms to protect newly synthesized r-proteins from aggregation and safely guide them to their pre-ribosomal assembly site. For instance, the two ribosome-associated chaperone systems, the RAC-Ssb chaperone triad and the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deuerling et al., 2019</xref>), functionally cooperate to promote the soluble expression of many r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Koplin et al., 2010</xref>). However, most r-proteins associate with pre-ribosomal particles in the nucle(ol)us; thus, their risky journey does not end in the cytoplasm. Despite their small size, nuclear import of r-proteins largely depends on active transport mediated by importins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rout et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de la Cruz et al., 2015</xref>), which exhibit, likely by recognizing and shielding the exposed rRNA-binding regions of r-proteins, a dual function as transport receptors and chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jäkel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Melnikov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huber and Hoelz, 2017</xref>). Besides being assisted by these general mechanisms, some r-proteins also rely on tailor-made solutions. For instance, 9 of the 79 r-proteins are transiently associated with a selective binding partner belonging to the heterogeneous class of dedicated chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Espinar-Marchena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pillet et al., 2017</xref>). These exert their beneficial effects by, for example, already capturing the nascent r-protein client in a co-translational manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rössler et al., 2019</xref>), coupling the co-import of two r-proteins with their ribosomal assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Calviño et al., 2015</xref>), or facilitating the nuclear transfer from an importin to the assembly site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schütz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Ting et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, some r-proteins regulate their own expression levels through autoregulatory feedback loops, for example, by repressing translation, inhibiting splicing, or promoting degradation of their own (pre-)mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fewell and Woolford, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gudipati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson and Vilardell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gabunilas and Chanfreau, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Petibon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Roy et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that a common regulatory machinery subjects the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs to co-translational downregulation when the dedicated chaperone Rrb1 or Acl4 is not available for binding to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4, respectively. Central to the here-described regulatory mechanism is the Caf130-mediated connection between the NAC and, via the N-terminal domain of Not1, the Ccr4-Not complex, which is assembled around the essential Not1 scaffold and implicated in many aspects of mRNA metabolism, notably including cytoplasmic mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Collart, 2016</xref>). The tight regulation of Rpl3 and Rpl4 levels appears to be of physiological relevance as their deregulated expression in cells lacking Tom1 leads to their massive aggregation and cell inviability. Taken together, our data indicate that this novel, co-translational regulatory mechanism specifically operates to continuously adjust the expression levels of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their actual consumption during ribosome assembly, thereby avoiding that their surplus production might negatively affect cellular proteostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The growth defect of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells is suppressed by the absence of Caf130, Cal4, and the nascent polypeptide-associated complex</title><p>We and others have previously shown that the dedicated chaperone Acl4 associates with the r-protein Rpl4 in a co-translational manner and protects Rpl4 from aggregation and degradation on its path to its assembly site on nucleolar pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huber and Hoelz, 2017</xref>). While growing <italic>∆acl4</italic> null mutant cells on YPD plates, we observed that spontaneous suppressors of the severe slow-growth (sg) phenotype arose at a relatively high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since mild overexpression of Rpl4a from a centromeric plasmid almost completely restored the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that the <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppressor mutations might either increase the expression level or stability of Rpl4 or facilitate the incorporation of Rpl4 into pre-60S particles. To unravel the reason for this observation, we isolated a large number of <italic>∆acl4</italic> and <italic>∆acl4</italic>/<italic>∆rpl4a</italic> suppressors and identified causative candidate mutations by whole-genome sequencing (see Materials and methods). Bioinformatics analysis of the sequenced genomes revealed that the 48 independent suppressors harbored 47 different candidate mutations, which mapped to only four different genes: <italic>CAF130</italic> (35 different mutations), <italic>YJR011C</italic>/<italic>CAL4</italic> (7), <italic>NOT1</italic> (4), and <italic>RPL4A</italic> (1) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Notably, Caf130 is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nasertorabi et al., 2011</xref>) and, as shown below, interacts directly with the previously uncharacterized Yjr011c, which we have accordingly named Cal4 (<italic>C</italic>af130-<italic>a</italic>ssociated regulator of Rp<italic>l4</italic>). Given that the suppressor screen yielded early frameshift mutations in both <italic>CAF130</italic> and <italic>CAL4</italic>, we first tested whether their complete deletion would restore the severe growth defect of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, this was indeed the case; however, while both the absence of Caf130 and Cal4 restored growth of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells virtually to the wild-type extent at 16, 23, and 30°C, only the <italic>∆cal4/∆acl4</italic> double mutant combination grew well at 37°C as the single <italic>∆caf130</italic> mutant already exhibited a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Absence of Caf130, Cal4, or the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) suppresses the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect by increasing <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect.

While absence of Btt1 (<italic>∆btt1</italic>) resulted in a modest growth amelioration of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells at 23 and 30°C, full suppression could be observed at 37°C; however, no restoration of the growth defect could be discerned at 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Given that there was no suppression at any of the tested temperatures when <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells were lacking the major NAC β-subunit Egd1 (<italic>∆egd1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we tested whether the complete absence of NAC-β (<italic>∆egd1</italic>, <italic>∆btt1</italic>) would enhance the extent of suppression. Indeed, a very robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect could be witnessed from 16 to 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); but, in line with the ts phenotype of <italic>∆egd1</italic>/<italic>∆btt1</italic> double mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), there was no mutual suppression of the respective growth defects at 37°C in <italic>∆egd1</italic>/<italic>∆btt1</italic>/<italic>∆acl4</italic> triple mutant cells. Similarly, absence of NAC-α (<italic>∆egd2</italic>), which conferred a ts phenotype, also rescued the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect to the wild-type extent at temperatures up to 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In support of a specific role of NAC, deletion of Zuo1 (<italic>∆zuo1</italic>), a component of the ribosome-associated RAC-Ssb chaperone triad, did not enable suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that the absence of either the accessory Ccr4-Not component Caf130, the previously uncharacterized Cal4, or the NAC compensates for the lack of Acl4, suggesting that these factors may be part of a regulatory network controlling the expression levels of Rpl4. Moreover, with respect to NAC’s two paralogous β-subunits, the suppression analyses indicate that the Btt1-containing NAC heterodimer provides the main contribution, especially at elevated temperature, although Egd1-containing NAC appears to operate in a partially redundant manner, as evidenced by the finding that full <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression at temperatures below 37°C can only be observed when both NAC β-subunits are simultaneously absent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels are increased in the absence of Caf130, Cal4, and the nascent polypeptide-associated complex</title><p>To obtain insight into how the above-described components might regulate Rpl4 expression, we first compared the total <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels between wild-type and mutant cells, grown in YPD medium at 30°C, by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). In good correlation with the suppression efficiency, we observed an about twofold relative increase of the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels in <italic>∆caf130</italic>, <italic>∆cal4</italic>, <italic>∆egd2</italic>, and <italic>∆btt1</italic>/<italic>∆egd1</italic> mutant cells but no increase in <italic>∆egd1</italic> and <italic>∆btt1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Given that mild overexpression of Rpl4a efficiently restores the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>), the moderate rise in <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels likely accounts for the observed suppression. To evaluate the specificity of this upregulation, we next determined the levels of the <italic>RPL3</italic>, <italic>RPL5</italic>, and <italic>RPS3</italic> mRNA. While there were only minor changes in the abundance of the <italic>RPL5</italic> and <italic>RPS3</italic> mRNAs, the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA exhibited a similar increase as the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA in <italic>∆caf130</italic>, <italic>∆egd2</italic>, and <italic>∆btt1</italic>/<italic>∆egd1</italic> mutant cells; conspicuously, however, the absence of Cal4 did not augment <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels, indicating that Cal4 may be specifically required for the regulation of the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA. Notably, the inverse effect was observed in <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells, which exclusively displayed decreased levels of the <italic>RPL4</italic> and, to a lesser extent, the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA, suggesting that co-translational capturing of nascent Rpl4 by Acl4 may have a positive impact on the abundance of the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA (see below).</p><p>To discern whether altered transcription initiation or mRNA stability could be the reason for the observed changes in <italic>RPL3</italic> and/or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA abundance, we assessed RNA Pol II occupancy around the transcription start site (TSS) of several RPGs by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR in wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (see Materials and methods). In support of mRNA stability being the responsible feature, absence of Caf130 did not lead to an increased association of initiating RNA Pol II on the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, while inactivation of TORC1 by rapamycin treatment similarly reduced transcription of all tested RPGs both in wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels nevertheless remained around twofold higher in cells lacking Caf130, suggesting that the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs, even when present at lower abundance, are still subjected to negative regulation under these conditions in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Since the above results indicated that the regulation mediated by Caf130, Cal4, and NAC may only operate on a limited number of common mRNAs, we wished to obtain a global overview of the regulated transcripts. To this end, we assessed, using the same total RNA extracts as for the above qRT-PCRs, the relative abundance of individual mRNAs within the entire transcriptome by RNA-seq (see Materials and methods). Strikingly, when compared to the levels in wild-type cells, the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA and both <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs, transcribed from the paralogous <italic>RPL4A</italic> and <italic>RPL4B</italic> genes, were amongst the most prominently upregulated transcripts in <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In line with the above qRT-PCR data, only the <italic>RPL4A</italic> and <italic>RPL4B</italic> transcripts, but not the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA, belonged to the markedly upregulated transcripts in <italic>∆cal4</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Individual deletion of NAC-α (<italic>∆egd2</italic>) or NAC-β (<italic>∆egd1</italic>, <italic>∆btt1</italic>) also resulted in an observable, albeit less outstanding, upregulation of the <italic>RPL3</italic>, <italic>RPL4A</italic>, and <italic>RPL4B</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), presumably due to more pronounced global changes in their transcriptomes. A common feature of all four mutant transcriptomes, although to a lesser extent in the one of <italic>∆cal4</italic> cells, appears to be the upregulation of transcripts encoding components of stress response pathways, including, for example, proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the transcription factor Yap1, which is known to mediate oxidative stress tolerance, or proteins involved in iron uptake and homeostasis. On the other hand, the downregulated transcripts are more diverse, but often belong to different anabolic processes that mediate cell growth, such as translation (e.g., genes coding for r-proteins and biogenesis factors), the provisioning of building blocks (e.g., genes coding for permeases and enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis), and mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, no other RPG transcripts were found to be upregulated in the same manner as the <italic>RPL3</italic>, <italic>RPL4A</italic>, and <italic>RPL4B</italic> mRNAs, suggesting that these three are specific common targets of Caf130 and the NAC, while Cal4 only contributes to the negative regulation of the two <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The full-length translational isoform of Not1 enables negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels</title><p>Encouraged by the above results, we next examined the involvement of Not1, the largest subunit and scaffold protein of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Collart, 2016</xref>), in the regulatory process. Intriguingly, the four identified <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppressor mutations, even though <italic>NOT1</italic> is an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Collart and Struhl, 1993</xref>), either change the start codon (M1L), introduce a premature stop codon (L112*), or result in early frameshifts (K21<sup>fs</sup> and I128<sup>fs</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); they are therefore predicted to interfere with the synthesis of a functional Not1 protein. Moreover, Western analysis of C-terminally TAP-tagged Not1, expressed from the genomic locus, consistently resulted in the detection of two Not1-TAP bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); hence, the shorter, major Not1 isoform must correspond, as also previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu et al., 1998</xref>), to an N-terminally truncated Not1 protein, which could either be generated from different mRNA isoforms or by an alternative translation initiation event. In support of the second possibility, only a single <italic>NOT1</italic> mRNA species was detected in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Collart and Struhl, 1993</xref>). Notably, the <italic>NOT1</italic> sequence does not contain any out-of-frame ATG trinucleotides between the start codon and the second in-frame ATG coding for M163, strongly suggesting that a leaky scanning mechanism enables the synthesis of the N-terminally truncated Not1 variant. To experimentally corroborate this plausible conjecture, we mutated the <italic>NOT1</italic> coding sequence by either changing codon 163 such that it codes for another amino acid (construct M163L and M163A) or introducing an out-of-frame ATG trinucleotide at two different positions by silent mutagenesis of codons 40 and 156 (construct N40(oofATG) and N156(oofATG)). These plasmid-borne constructs, expressing the four C-terminally TAP-tagged Not1 variants from the <italic>NOT1</italic> promoter, were transformed into a <italic>NOT1</italic> shuffle strain. Then, upon plasmid shuffling on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-containing plates, complementation was assessed by growth assays on YPD plates. Importantly, all four Not1 variants sustained growth in the absence of endogenous Not1 equally well as wild-type Not1-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Western analysis of total protein extracts prepared by an alkaline lysis protocol, using antibodies recognizing the protein A moiety of the TAP tag, revealed that Not1-TAP was expressed at higher levels from plasmid than from the genomic locus. Despite the slightly changed start context owing to the introduction of an NdeI site (tac-ATG versus cat-ATG), expression of Not1-TAP from plasmid still resulted in the detection of a full-length and an N-terminally truncated isoform at similar ratios as when expressed from the native context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In line with ATG codon 163 being the second translation initiation site, only the upper band corresponding to full-length Not1-TAP persisted in the M163L and M163A mutant variants. Concerning the two variants containing out-of-frame ATG trinucleotides upstream of the M163 codon, the N40(oofATG) and, to a lesser extent, the N156(oofATG) construct suppressed the synthesis of the major, N-terminally truncated Not1 isoform, presumably reflecting the relative strength of the two ATG contexts as translation initiation signals. We conclude that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Not1 is naturally synthesized as two distinct protein isoforms, which differ, due to a leaky scanning mechanism enabling the utilization of a downstream translation initiation site, by the presence (less abundant, full-length isoform) or absence (major isoform, starting with M163) of the N-terminal 162 amino acids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Absence of Not1’s N-terminal domain suppresses the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect and increases <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Not1 highlighting its domain organization and known binding sites of Ccr4-Not core components as revealed by diverse (co-)crystal structures (PDB: 4B8B and 4B8A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basquin et al., 2012</xref>], 4CV5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>], 5AJD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>], and 4BY6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhaskar et al., 2013</xref>]). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, the N-terminal Not1 segment encompassing amino acids 21–153 corresponds to the minimal Caf130-interacting domain (CaInD). Note that Ccr4 does not directly bind to Not1, it is recruited via its interaction with Caf1. The position and nature of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppressor mutations are indicated: M1L (ATG start codon changed to cTG), K21<sup>fs</sup> (AAA codon with deletion of one A, resulting in a frameshift), L112* (TTG codon changed to TaG stop codon), and I128<sup>fs</sup> (ATT codon with A deleted, resulting in a frameshift).

Progressive mapping revealed that deletion of the first 28 residues (29C construct) still entailed poor growth at 37°C, whereas the deletion variant only lacking the N-terminal 20 residues (21C construct) permitted wild-type growth at all temperatures.</p><p>To demonstrate that absence of the N-terminal 162 amino acids enables, as predicted by the above-described findings, suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect, we generated and transformed a <italic>NOT1</italic>/<italic>ACL4</italic> double shuffle strain with plasmids expressing wild-type Not1 or the three N-terminal deletion variants. Then, upon plasmid shuffling on 5-FOA-containing plates, the suppression capacity of the different constructs was determined by assessing growth on YPD plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, no suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect could be observed in <italic>∆acl4</italic>/<italic>∆not1</italic> cells expressing either full-length Not1 or the fully functional Not1.21C variant. Conversely, expression of the Not1.29C or Not1.163C deletion variants restored wild-type growth of <italic>∆acl4</italic>/<italic>∆not1</italic> cells at 16, 23, and 30°C but, in line with the above complementation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), not at 37°C. In accord with the efficient suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect, the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA was, compared to its relative levels in the wild-type control, upregulated around twofold in <italic>∆not1</italic> cells expressing the Not1.163C variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Likewise, as already observed before in cells lacking Caf130, Egd2, or both Btt1 and Egd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), the levels of the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA were also increased to a similar extent. However, none of the other tested RPG mRNAs (<italic>RPL5</italic>, <italic>RPL10</italic>, <italic>RPL11</italic>, <italic>RPS2</italic>, <italic>RPS3</italic>, and <italic>RPS6</italic>) exhibited similar changes in abundance as the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs. Taken together, these data show that the N-terminal 162 residues, which are specifically included in the minor, full-length Not1 isoform, are required both for growth at elevated temperature and for mediating the regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels.</p><p>Given that the Not1 scaffold of the Ccr4-Not complex is implicated in enabling negative regulation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs, an involvement of other Ccr4-Not components, especially those with established functions in mRNA degradation (the Caf1-Ccr4 deadenylase module) and coupling of translational repression with mRNA turnover (Not4 E3 ligase and Not2-Not5 module) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alhusaini and Coller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Collart, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>), is highly likely. To test this by assessing suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect, we first individually deleted the genes encoding these Ccr4-Not components in the W303 background. While the <italic>∆caf40</italic> and <italic>∆not3</italic> null mutants did not display any observable growth defects, the <italic>∆caf1</italic>, <italic>∆ccr4</italic>, and <italic>∆not4</italic> null mutants exhibited pronounced sg phenotypes that were exacerbated at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). However, and in agreement with Not2 being required for the integrity of the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Russell et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>∆not2</italic> and <italic>∆not5</italic> mutant cells grew extremely slowly and were therefore excluded from the <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The obtained null mutants were crossed with <italic>ACL4</italic> shuffle strains, tetrads were dissected, and then, after counter-selection against the <italic>ACL4</italic>-bearing <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid, the growth of cells derived from tetratype tetrads was assessed on YPD plates. However, absence of none of these Ccr4-Not components suppressed the growth defect of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells at any of the tested temperatures, but, conversely, their absence synergistically enhanced, albeit to different extents, the sg phenotype of cells lacking Acl4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). Based on this genetic analysis, we conclude that at least Caf40 and Not3 appear not to be required for the negative regulation of <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. At this stage, the plausible involvement of Not4 and especially the Caf1-Ccr4 deadenylase module cannot be discarded as any specific regulatory effect might be masked by more general effects of their absence on cytoplasmic mRNA decay and/or maintenance of proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Panasenko and Collart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Halter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Collart, 2016</xref>). Recently, the N-terminal domain of Not5 (Not5-NTD) has been shown to mediate, via its binding to the ribosomal E-site, association of the Ccr4-Not complex with translating 80S ribosomes lacking an accommodated tRNA in the A-site, thereby sensing and subjecting mRNAs with low codon optimality to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>). Expression of a Not5 variant lacking the NTD (114C construct) in <italic>∆not5</italic> cells did not result in any observable growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>), but was nonetheless neither suppressing the sg phenotype entailed by the absence of Acl4 nor leading to an increase in <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism is not part of the regulatory network controlling the abundance of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs. In support of this, absence of Rps25 (eS25; <italic>∆rps25a</italic>/<italic>∆rps25b</italic>), which is a key determinant for Not5-NTD binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>), neither suppressed the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Finally, no <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression could be observed in the individual absence of the decapping activators Dhh1 and Pat1, which were shown to associate with Ccr4-Not via Not1 and Not3/5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Maillet and Collart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alhusaini and Coller, 2016</xref>), the major 5′ -&gt; 3′ exonuclease Xrn1, or the exosome-assisting RNA helicase Ski2, which is required for cytoplasmic 3′ -&gt; 5′ mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Caf130 connects Cal4 and Btt1 to Ccr4-Not by exclusively interacting with the full-length translational isoform of Not1</title><p>The common involvement in <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA regulation, as well as their mutual interactions in large-scale yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) and/or affinity purification approaches and the finding that Btt1 is associated with the Ccr4-Not complex in a Caf130-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Yu et al., 2008</xref>), indicated that Caf130, Cal4, and Btt1 may directly physically interact and be recruited through Caf130, likely via the N-terminal 162 amino acids of Not1, to the Ccr4-Not complex. To obtain evidence for this scenario, we first assessed the in vivo interactions of these components by GFP-Trap co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To this end, we constructed strains expressing distinct combinations of C-terminally GFP-tagged bait proteins and C-terminally TAP-tagged prey proteins. Upon rapid one-step affinity purification of the bait proteins from cell lysates using magnetic GFP-Trap beads, the prey proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against the protein A moiety of the TAP tag, thus enabling the highly sensitive detection of co-precipitated prey proteins. In parallel, as specificity controls to evaluate the background binding of the prey proteins to the GFP-Trap beads, strains expressing nontagged bait proteins together with the individual TAP-tagged prey proteins were simultaneously analyzed. As expected, affinity purification of the full-length Not1-GFP bait resulted in the co-purification of Caf130 and Btt1; however, the major NAC β-subunit Egd1 and the NAC α-subunit Egd2 could not be detected above background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, Cal4 was also enriched in the Not1-GFP immunoprecipitation, hence clearly establishing Cal4 as a novel accessory component of the Ccr4-Not complex. In agreement with the functional involvement of the very N-terminal part of Not1 in the negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels, the Not1.154C-GFP bait lacking the first 153 amino acids no longer co-purified Caf130 and Cal4, while it was still able to associate with core components of the Ccr4-Not complex, such as Not2, Not4, and Not5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Reciprocal experiments revealed specific interactions between (i) the Caf130-GFP bait and Btt1, Not1, and Cal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), (ii) the Cal4-GFP bait and Btt1, Not1, and Caf130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and (iii) the Btt1-GFP bait and Not1, Caf130, and Cal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, neither Egd1 nor Egd2 were detected above background in the Caf130-GFP and Cal4-GFP affinity purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), while the Btt1-GFP bait, as expected, co-purified Egd2 but not Egd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Correspondingly, only the NAC β-subunit Egd1, but neither Caf130, Cal4, nor full-length Not1, was specifically co-precipitated with the Egd2-GFP bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, a selective enrichment of the upper Not1-TAP band could be clearly discerned in the Caf130-GFP, Cal4-GFP, and Btt1-GFP affinity purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), thus further strengthening the notion that Caf130, Cal4, and Btt1 are specifically associated with the full-length Not1 isoform.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Caf130 connects Cal4 and Btt1 to Ccr4-Not by exclusively interacting with the full-length translational isoform of Not1.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Assessment of in vivo interactions by GFP-Trap co-immunoprecipitation.

By testing the diverse distinct combinations of full-length proteins, we could reveal that Caf130 has the capacity to interact with Not1, Cal4, and Btt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>); however, no Y2H interactions could be observed between the Cal4 bait and the Not1 or Btt1 preys and between the Btt1 bait and the Not1 or Cal4 preys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), strongly suggesting that Caf130 fulfills the role of a hub protein connecting, via its association with Not1, both Cal4 and Btt1 to the Ccr4-Not complex. In support of this, the Not1 bait exhibited some Y2H reporter activation, albeit to a much lesser extent than in combination with the Caf130 prey, when combined with the Cal4 and Btt1 preys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which, in light of the above findings, can readily be explained by Caf130 serving as a bridging molecule for these interactions. Moreover, as already indicated by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we did not detect any interactions between Egd1 or, respectively, Egd2 and Not1, Caf130, or Cal4 at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Interestingly, however, a Y2H interaction between Caf130 and both Egd1 and Egd2 could be observed at 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that the common NAC domain has an intrinsic capacity to interact with Caf130 and thus offering a potential explanation for the partially redundant contribution of Egd1 and Btt1 to the regulatory process. Subsequent Y2H mapping of the respective minimal interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), as schematically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, first revealed that Caf130 associates via (i) a large N-terminal portion (amino acids 40–655) with Not1, (ii) the C-terminal part thereof (amino acids 292–655) with Btt1, and (iii) a consecutive segment (amino acids 686–938) with Cal4. In agreement with the genetic and the GFP-Trap co-immunoprecipitation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), the minimal Not1 surface mediating Caf130 binding could be mapped to an N-terminal segment encompassing amino acids 21–153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which we therefore termed the Caf130-interacting domain (CaInD). On Btt1, the minimal fragment for Caf130 binding comprised amino acids 38–129, corresponding to the NAC domain (amino acids 38–103) bearing a short C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In line with the reported NAC domain crystal structures of the human NACA-BTF3 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), both Btt1 and Egd1 interacted with Egd2’s NAC domain, and the region covering the six predicted β-strands (amino acids 54–101) of Btt1’s NAC domain was sufficient to mediate the association with Egd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). The finding that both Caf130 and Egd2 bind to the NAC domain of Btt1 corroborates, as already indicated by the lack of a detectable co-precipitation between these two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>), a model in which Btt1 associates in a mutually exclusive manner with either Caf130 or Egd2. Finally, the minimal Caf130-binding surface on Cal4 was formed by amino acids 26–222 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the co-immunoprecipitation and Y2H interaction analyses establish Cal4 as a novel accessory component of the Ccr4-Not complex and reveal that Caf130, in its role as a scaffold protein, has the capacity to simultaneously interact with Not1, Btt1, and Cal4.

To evaluate the impact of the <italic>rpl4a.W109C</italic> mutation on yeast growth, the <italic>rpl4a.W109C</italic> allele was combined with the <italic>∆rpl4b</italic> null allele. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the strain exclusively expressing the Rpl4a.W109C protein grew almost as well as the <italic>RPL4A</italic>/<italic>∆rpl4b</italic> control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we combined the <italic>rpl4a.W109C</italic> allele with the <italic>∆acl4</italic> null allele, revealing a robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect at all tested temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To assess whether mutation of further residues in proximity of W109 could also confer suppression, we tested the four previously described nonoverlapping, consecutive alanine substitution mutants (named BI, BII, BIII, and BIV; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which no longer interact with Acl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>). Again, these mutant alleles were integrated at the genomic <italic>RPL4A</italic> locus and their complementation and suppression capacity was determined by combining them with the <italic>∆rpl4b</italic> or <italic>∆acl4</italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The BI mutations (F90A/N92A/M93A/C94A/R95A) conferred a strong sg phenotype and, accordingly, did not enable suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> phenotype. Growth of cells expressing the variant harboring the BII mutations (R98A/M99A/F100A) was not substantially ameliorated, and almost no <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression could be observed from 16 to 30°C; however, some growth improvement and weak suppression were apparent at 37°C. Conversely, the BIII mutations (P102A/T103A/K104A/T105A) permitted significantly better growth, especially at 16°C, at all tested temperatures except 37°C, and suppression, up to the BIII-inherent growth defect, could also be observed and was again particularly pronounced at 16°C. Similar to the W109C substitution, the BIV mutations (W106A/R107A/K108A/W109A), comprising an exchange of tryptophan 109 to alanine, only elicited a very mild growth defect and conferred robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect at all tested temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, the genetic analyses establish the W109 residue within the long internal loop region as a critical determinant for enabling negative regulation of Rpl4 expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The Rpl4 protein harbors the regulation-conferring signal.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect by the <italic>rpl4a.W109C</italic> allele.

To this end, the wild-type and mutant-encoding <italic>RPL4A</italic> ORFs were fused at their 3′ end to the yEGFP coding sequence and were expressed from a monocopy plasmid under the transcriptional control of the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter in wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells. Then, the relative levels of the <italic>RPL4A</italic>-yEGFP fusion mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR using a primer pair specifically amplifying a portion of the yEGFP coding sequence and compared between the wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> situation where regulation is either in place or disabled and <italic>RPL4A</italic> mRNA levels are therefore expected to be either minimal or maximal, respectively. Importantly, downregulation of the fusion mRNA containing wild-type <italic>RPL4A</italic>, when transcribed from the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter, could be clearly observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the altered promoter context and the addition of the yEGFP coding sequence do not fundamentally change the regulation-conferring process. Notably, the levels of the <italic>RPL4A</italic>-yEGFP fusion mRNA coding for the BI mutant protein were even more substantially decreased, strongly suggesting that co-translational capturing of nascent Rpl4a by Acl4 stabilizes the <italic>RPL4A</italic> mRNA. The levels of the mRNAs encoding the BII and BIII mutant variants were still lower than the one of the mRNA harboring wild-type <italic>RPL4A</italic>, but, compared to the BI-expressing mRNA, a slight gradual increase in their abundance could be noticed. Most importantly, and in line with the robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect, presence of either the BIV mutations or the W109C substitution restored the levels of their mRNAs in wild-type cells almost to the ones detected in <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells.</p><p>Aiming to corroborate the importance of the above-identified residues for the regulatory process and to delineate, if possible, a minimal regulation-conferring region, we first constructed plasmids expressing progressively N- and C-terminally deleted Rpl4a variants, fused to an N- or C-terminal yEGFP moiety, respectively (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), under the transcriptional control of the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. To avoid any mRNA-stabilizing effect due to co-translational Acl4 binding, the BI mutations were introduced into all constructs comprising this region of the <italic>RPL4A</italic> coding sequence. Then, the plasmid constructs were transformed into wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells and the relative levels of the different fusion mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR using, as above, a primer pair specifically amplifying a portion of the common yEGFP coding sequence. The levels of the yEGFP-<italic>RPL4A</italic> fusion mRNAs coding for Rpl4a deletion variants lacking the first 42 (denoted as 43C construct) or 77 amino acids were, similarly to the <italic>RPL4A</italic>-yEGFP mRNA encoding full-length Rpl4a containing the BI mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), about 2.5-fold lower in wild-type compared to <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Further progressive mapping revealed a gradual increase in mRNA abundance when the encoded proteins were either devoid of the first 87, 95, or 100 amino acids; remarkably, the Rpl4a variant starting with amino acid 101 (101C construct) still conferred a significant, around 1.5-fold negative regulation to its mRNA. However, the fusion mRNA expressing the deletion variant lacking the first 110 amino acids was no longer subjected to regulation in wild-type cells; thus, clearly highlighting the importance of the short segment encompassing amino acids 101–110, which notably comprises the W109 residue. Accordingly, no regulation was imposed on its encoding fusion mRNA by the C-terminal deletion variant ending at amino acid 104 (N104 construct). Progressive extension of the C-terminal end of the encoded variants revealed that some mRNA regulation started to occur when Rpl4a ended at amino acid 114 and that, after a further subtle decrease in mRNA levels entailed by the Rpl4a.N132 protein, efficient regulation was reached again when the encoded Rpl4a was extended up to amino acid 139 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we addressed whether the inferred minimal regulation-conferring region (amino acids 78–139) was sufficient to enforce, when placed in a heterologous context, a decrease in mRNA levels in wild-type cells. To this end, we generated a plasmid-based construct expressing Rpl4a residues 78–139 from the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter as a fusion protein that is flanked by an N-terminal TAP-Flag tag (NTAPF) and, for the determination of the mRNA levels by qRT-PCR, a C-terminal yEGFP moiety. Moreover, the BI, BII, BIII, and BIV mutations, as well as a combination of the W109C substitution with the BI mutations, were introduced into the coding sequence in order to assess whether these alterations had the same effect within the minimal region as in the context of full-length <italic>RPL4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, the presence of either the BIV mutations or the W109C substitution resulted, when compared to the similarly regulated wild-type construct or the one containing only the BI mutations, in an increase in the abundance of the respective mRNAs up to their levels in <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, a slight increase in mRNA levels could be observed in the presence of the BII and, more evidently, of the BIII mutations, pointing once more to a minor contribution of the residues that are altered by the BIII mutations toward the negative regulation of its encoding mRNA.</p><p>Taken together, mapping of the regulation-conferring region on Rpl4a revealed that a segment encompassing amino acids 78–139 is sufficient to have a negative impact on the abundance of the encoding mRNA. Within this region, the tryptophan 109 residue, whose mutation to cysteine enables robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect, appears to be a critical determinant for mediating the negative regulation of <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. Notably, the W109 residue, which is located near the C-terminal end of the Acl4-binding site, is shielded by Acl4, and, moreover, mutations that abolish the interaction with Acl4 promote a further reduction of <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. It is therefore highly likely that co-translational capturing of Rpl4 by Acl4 stabilizes the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA (see below), possibly by precluding the recognition of the nascent Rpl4 segment around the W109 residue by the regulatory machinery. In line with ongoing translation being required for efficient negative regulation, addition of the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide abrogated the difference in abundance between the above reporter mRNAs containing the BI or BIV mutations within the minimal regulation-conferring coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The regulation-conferring Rpl3 segment is adjacent to the Rrb1-binding site</title><p>Given that the same machinery, with the exception of Cal4, is involved in the negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels and considering that Rpl3 is also co-translationally captured by a dedicated chaperone, the essential Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>), we next wished to explore whether the underlying principles of both regulation events might be similar. In particular, we suspected that the regulation-conferring region might overlap with or be in the immediate proximity of the Rrb1-binding site, which we had previously mapped to the N-terminal 15 residues of Rpl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>). To map the regulation-conferring region, we constructed monocopy plasmids expressing wild-type Rpl3 as well as N- and/or C-terminal truncation variants thereof, fused to a C-terminal yEGFP moiety, under the transcriptional control of the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. Then, upon transformation into wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells, with the latter providing a benchmark for the maximal abundance of each transcript, total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells and the relative levels of the <italic>RPL3</italic>-yEGFP fusion mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR. In this experimental setup, the levels of the fusion mRNA harboring full-length <italic>RPL3</italic> were only downregulated by around 1.25-fold in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); thus, negative regulation was less efficient than in the case of the endogenous <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Notably, however, the abundance of the mRNA encoding a deletion variant lacking the first seven residues (8C construct), which is no longer capable of interacting with Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), was reduced more than threefold, indicating that absence of Rrb1 binding to nascent Rpl3 has an mRNA-destabilizing effect. Analyses of further N-terminal deletion variants revealed a minor increase in mRNA abundance when the encoded protein lacked the first 11 amino acids (12C construct) and a more prominent increase, resulting in around 2.2-fold lower mRNA levels, when the first 14 residues (15C construct) were missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, removal of the first 17 amino acids (18C construct) from the encoded protein raised the abundance of the mRNA almost up to its levels in <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells, suggesting an important contribution of a very short segment, comprising residues 12 to 17, to the negative regulation. Mapping of the C-terminal border revealed that the fusion mRNA expressing the first 52 amino acids (N52 construct) was considerably more regulated than the full-length <italic>RPL3</italic>-yEGFP mRNA. However, further refinement by testing even shorter, C-terminally truncated variants was not possible since their expression, presumably owing to the titration of Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>), conferred a strong sg phenotype to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, we generated constructs expressing different C-terminally deleted Rpl3 variants that were simultaneously lacking the first seven amino acids. Compared to the fusion mRNA coding for the Rpl3.N52 variant, the abundance of the mRNA encoding the Rpl3 fragment spanning residues 8–52 (8–52 construct) was even further diminished, exhibiting a more than 2.5-fold reduction in wild-type cells compared to <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), thus, confirming the notion that co-translational recognition of the N-terminal Rpl3 residues by Rrb1 positively affects mRNA levels. The extent of negative regulation was only marginally decreased when the encoded Rpl3 variant ended at amino acid 48 (8–48 construct), but a strong increase in mRNA levels could be observed when the expressed Rpl3 variant lacked an additional four C-terminal residues (8–44 construct). In conclusion, the above data show that the minimal regulation-conferring region required for robust negative regulation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA is contained within the N-terminal part of Rpl3, from residue 8 to 52, and attribute a potentially crucial involvement to a short segment between residues 11 and 18.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The regulation-conferring Rpl3 segment is adjacent to the Rrb1-binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mapping of the minimal regulation-conferring region on <italic>RPL3</italic>.

Given that the first seven amino acids of Rpl3 are required for Rrb1 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>), we focused the mutational analysis on residues within this short segment (H3, R4, K5, and Y6) and additionally included the conserved R10 and H11 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Gratifyingly, the H3E, K5E, and Y6E mutations, both in the context of full-length Rpl3 or when comprised in the C-terminally truncated Rpl3.N52 variant, abolished the Y2H interaction with Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, these mutants were unable to complement the lethality of <italic>∆rpl3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On the other hand, the R10E/H11E and R10A/H11A substitutions did not affect the Y2H interaction with Rrb1, but nonetheless, presumably owing to an important role of these two residues in rRNA binding, pre-60S assembly, or functioning of the ribosome, they resulted in extremely weak growth of <italic>∆rpl3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2A</xref>). Importantly, presence of the H3E mutation, which represents the most N-terminal exchange abolishing Rrb1 binding, led to a similar decrease in <italic>RPL3</italic>-yEGFP mRNA levels as removal of the first seven residues did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Hence, we chose to introduce the H3E mutation into Rpl3.N52 for unveiling the contribution of selected residues, within the above-determined minimal region (amino acids 8–52), to the negative regulation of the encoding mRNA. To facilitate the task, we simultaneously changed 2–3 neighboring residues, especially focusing on bulky hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids, to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Before assessing the mRNA levels, we evaluated the generated Rpl3 variants, in the absence of the H3E mutation, with respect to their capability to associate with Rrb1 and sustain growth of <italic>∆rpl3</italic> cells. In the context of the N-terminal 52 amino acids, none of the introduced mutations affected the Y2H interaction with Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the context of full-length Rpl3, however, the H13A/L14A and F46A/L47A mutations reduced or respectively abolished the interaction with Rrb1, while all other tested mutants associated with Rrb1 to a similar extent as wild-type Rpl3. Given that concurrent alanine substitution of F46 and L47, which are situated at the beginning of the first β-strand in the center of Rpl3’s two-lobed globular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), also abolished growth of <italic>∆rpl3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the combination of these two mutations likely affects the productive folding of full-length Rpl3. Importantly, most of the other generated <italic>rpl3</italic> mutants did not display any apparent growth defect, only the H13A/L14A and the R28A/K30A mutations conferred an sg phenotype at all tested temperatures or moderately impaired growth at 37°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After having established their impact on Rrb1 binding and growth, we assessed the effect of the different alanine substitutions on the abundance of the fusion mRNAs encoding these C-terminally yEGFP-tagged Rpl3.N52 variants bearing the H3E exchange. Compared to the control containing only the H3E mutation, which reduced transcript levels by more than twofold in wild-type cells, the most prominent increase in mRNA abundance could be observed by the additional presence of the F16A/L17A substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, a clear diminution of negative regulation, resulting in a less than 1.5-fold downregulation of mRNA levels in wild-type cells, was brought about by the R19A/K20A/R21A and F46A/L47A mutations. Next, we wondered whether deregulated expression of Rpl3 was sufficient to restore growth of cells lacking the essential Rrb1. In contrast to the robust suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect by endogenously expressed W109C- or BIV-mutant Rpl4a variants, expression of Rpl3.F16A/L17A from monocopy plasmid only enabled weak growth in the absence of Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that the essential role of Rrb1 extends beyond being a passive Rpl3 binder and likely includes other aspects, such as promoting the safe transfer and efficient assembly of Rpl3 into early pre-60S particles.</p><p>Taken together, we have mapped the regulation-conferring region to amino acids 8–52 of Rpl3 and identified residues therein, especially phenylalanine 16 and/or leucine 17, that serve as necessary determinants for efficient negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels. These two residues are directly adjacent to the minimal Rrb1-binding site consisting of the N-terminal 15 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pausch et al., 2015</xref>), and, noteworthily, the F16A/L17A double substitution enables normal growth and does not appear to affect the interaction with Rrb1. Importantly, the above-described data now permit to conclude that similar principles apply to the negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. Besides basically involving the same regulatory machinery, maximal regulation requires in both cases an additional segment of around 30 amino acids after the identified, critically important Rpl3 (F16/L17) or Rpl4 (W109) residues, suggesting that an auxiliary, yet to be unveiled feature contributes to the regulation process (see Discussion). Moreover, the crucial role of individual residues provides compelling evidence that nascent Rpl3 and Rpl4 harbor the signal eliciting the negative regulation of their own mRNA levels. Finally, the immediate proximity or overlap of the Rrb1- or Acl4-binding site with residues that are needed for potent regulation advocates a model in which co-translational capturing of Rpl3 or Rpl4 by its respective dedicated chaperone would preclude their recognition by the regulatory machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Overexpression of Rrb1 and Acl4 increases <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels</title><p>Next, we wished to obtain more direct evidence for a positive effect of Rrb1 or Acl4 binding to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4, respectively, on the abundance of the encoding mRNAs. To this end, we expressed the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4 in wild-type cells or in cells either lacking the genomic copy of <italic>RRB1</italic> (<italic>∆rrb1</italic>) or <italic>ACL4</italic> (<italic>∆acl4</italic>) from a monocopy plasmid under the control of the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter and assessed the levels of the endogenous <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs by qRT-PCR. When grown at 30°C in liquid SGal-Leu medium, overexpression of Rrb1 resulted in a more than 2.5-fold increase in <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels both in wild-type and <italic>∆rrb1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), whereas a slight decrease in <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA abundance could be observed. Likewise, overexpression of Acl4 led to a similarly robust increase in <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels while, at the same time, the abundance of the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA was marginally negatively affected. Conversely, depletion of either Rrb1 or Acl4, which as expected entailed either a lethal or an sg phenotype, by growing cells for 24 hr in glucose-containing medium resulted in a more than twofold decrease in <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings are consistent with the above observations that mutational inactivation of Acl4 or Rrb1 binding by the BI mutations or the H3E substitution, respectively, augmented the negative regulation of their mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Moreover, and also in in agreement with the observed reduction in <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), Acl4-depleted cells exhibited an almost 1.5-fold decrease in <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA abundance was reduced to a comparable extent upon Rrb1 depletion. However, the levels of other assessed mRNAs, such as the ones encoding Rpl5 or Rps3, were found to be moderately upregulated upon Rrb1 or Acl4 depletion. We presume that this mutual reduction of the other mRNA being regulated by the same machinery might be due a decreased rate of early pre-60S assembly and the concomitant sequestration of Rrb1 or Acl4, which are only available in limiting amounts, by nonincorporated, excess Rpl3 or Rpl4 arising from Acl4 or Rrb1 depletion, respectively. Taken together, we conclude that the availability of the dedicated chaperone for binding to its nascent r-protein client is a crucial parameter for determining the stability of the corresponding mRNA.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of Rrb1 and Acl4 increases <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels.</title><p>Wild-type (WT), <italic>RRB1</italic> shuffle (<italic>∆rrb1</italic>), and <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells were transformed with an empty vector or plasmids expressing either Rrb1 or Acl4 under the control of the inducible <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter.

A previous study of the Deshaies laboratory revealed that aggregation of many r-proteins, including Rpl3 and Rpl4, is largely increased in cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>), and, moreover, different reports have shown that perturbations of ribosome assembly, essentially leading to an accumulation of newly synthesized, nonassembled r-proteins, negatively affect cellular proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tye et al., 2019</xref>). To assess genetically the impact of excess Rpl3 or Rpl4, we individually overexpressed these two r-proteins from a multicopy plasmid under the control of the inducible <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter both in wild-type and <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells. While only a minor effect on growth of wild-type cells could be discerned, overexpression of Rpl3 or Rpl4a in <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells resulted in a more severe growth defect than overexpression of Rpl26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which was previously shown to be degraded by the proteasome upon ubiquitination by Tom1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>). To evaluate the effect of the Rpl3 and Rpl4a mutant variants that efficiently reduce the negative regulation of their encoding mRNAs, these had therefore to be more moderately overexpressed, again under the transcriptional control of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter, from monocopy plasmids. Strikingly, overexpression of the BIV and W109C Rpl4a variants as well as the F16A/L17A and R19A/K20A/R21A Rpl3 variants exclusively and strongly compromised, albeit to different extents, the growth of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells, while overexpression of wild-type Rpl4a and Rpl3 only marginally affected growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To exclude that in the case of the overexpressed Rpl3 mutants the observed effects are due to titration of Rrb1, we additionally added the H3E mutation, which, as shown above, abolishes the interaction with Rrb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, presence of the H3E mutation substantially exacerbated the impact of the Rpl3 variants harboring the F16A/L17A and R19A/K20A/R21A substitutions on growth of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, and considering the contribution of Acl4 to Rpl4’s soluble expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>), it appears that association of the respective dedicated chaperone has a positive influence on an intrinsically difficult property of newly synthesized Rpl3 and Rpl4, which could consist in their aggregation propensity.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we next assessed whether the overexpressed Rpl3 (F16A/L17A and R19A/K20A/R21A, either alone or combined with H3E) and Rpl4a (BIV and W109C) variants, fused to a C-terminal 2xHA tag, would exhibit aggregation in <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells at 30°C. To this end, we shifted wild-type and <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells containing the different monocopy plasmids, pre-grown in liquid medium with raffinose as carbon source, for 4 hr to galactose-containing medium and revealed the inducibly expressed proteins in the total extract and the insoluble pellet fraction by Western analysis using anti-HA antibodies. In agreement with Rpl4 being ubiquitinated in vitro by Tom1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>), the abundance of wild-type Rpl4a-2xHA was clearly increased in <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells when compared to its levels in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In accord with their deregulated expression, the BIV and W109C Rpl4a variants were more abundant than wild-type Rpl4a both in wild-type and <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells. In good correlation with the observed expression levels, the two Rpl4a variants, which could already be detected to some extent in the insoluble fraction of wild-type cells, exhibited a higher occurrence than wild-type Rpl4a in aggregates of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells. The two Rpl3 variants (F16A/L17A and R19A/K20A/R21A), despite being similarly abundant as wild-type Rpl3 in the total extracts, were considerably enriched in the insoluble fraction of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Likewise, while the levels of wild-type Rpl3 were comparable in wild-type and <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells, more Rpl3 was present in the aggregate fraction of cells lacking Tom1. Compared to wild-type Rpl3, the abundance and, even more markedly, the insolubility of the two Rpl3 mutant proteins, especially of the F16A/L17A variant, were substantially increased in the absence of Tom1. Presence of the H3E mutation strongly reduced the amounts of wild-type and mutant Rpl3 in total extracts of wild-type cells; nevertheless, and in contrast to Rpl3.H3E, in particular the H3E/F16A/L17A variant exhibited a notable degree of aggregation. Remarkably, absence of Tom1 restored the levels of wild-type and mutant Rpl3 containing the H3E mutation and resulted in their prominent occurrence in the insoluble fraction. Altogether, the above findings provide evidence that Tom1-mediated clearance of excess Rpl3 and Rpl4 is required to efficiently prevent their aggregation. Moreover, given that wild-type Rpl3 and Rpl4a exert a dosage-dependent negative effect on the growth of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells and also considering that only Rpl3 and Rpl4a variants inducibly expressed in a deregulated fashion, thus exhibiting higher abundance than their wild-type counterparts in the insoluble fraction, severely affect the growth of cells lacking Tom1, it is reasonable to assume that the detrimental impact on cell growth only sets in once a certain threshold of aggregation has been exceeded.</p><p>To gain additional insight into the nature and location of the aggregation process, we examined the fate of the above Rpl4a variants (BIV and W109C) and of the two Rpl3 mutant proteins (F16A/L17A and H3E/F16A/L17A) exhibiting the highest aggregation propensity by fluorescence microscopy. To this end, we transformed monocopy plasmids expressing wild-type and mutant Rpl3 and Rpl4a, fused to a C-terminal yeast codon-optimized mNeonGreen (yOmNG), from the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter into wild-type and <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells, additionally bearing a plasmid providing the nucleolar marker protein Nop58-yEmCherry. Cells were first pre-grown at 30°C in liquid medium with raffinose as carbon source and then shifted for 4 hr to galactose-containing medium. Wild-type Rpl3 and Rpl4a showed, when expressed in wild-type cells, almost exclusively cytoplasmic localization and exhibited only in a fraction of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (less than 20%) nucleolar accumulation or enrichment in nucle(ol)ar dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Conversely, the mutant Rpl3 and Rpl4a variants displayed in most <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells a strong fluorescence signal in the nucle(ol)ar compartment. As in the case of the wild-type proteins, we again observed different types of localization patterns, ranging from a rather diffuse nucleolar enrichment, sometimes expanding to the adjacent nucleoplasm, to the appearance of one to several bright nuclear dots or blob-like structures. Given that the fluorescence signal intensity is highest in the latter two morphological states, we presume that these actually correspond to aggregates of excess Rpl3 and Rpl4a, which initially, when still less abundant, can diffusely distribute within the nucleolar phase. In line with the finding that the presence of the H3E mutation enhances the negative impact of Rpl3.F16A/L17A overexpression on growth of <italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the fraction of cells exhibiting extensive nuclear aggregation was higher upon Rpl3.H3E/F16A/L17A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the induced overexpression of Rpl3 or Rpl4 leads to their aggregation within the nucle(ol)ar compartment of cells lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Deregulated expression of Rpl3 and Rpl4 induces their aggregation and abolishes growth in the absence of Tom1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overexpressed Rpl4a variants, exhibiting deregulated expression, accumulate in the nucleolus and aggregate in the nucleus in the absence of Tom1.

Notably, the absence of Caf130, Not1’s N-terminal CaInD domain, or either of the two NAC subunits, which all cause the deregulated expression of both Rpl3 and Rpl4, conferred synthetic lethality to cells lacking Tom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B–G</xref>). Even more remarkably, cells simultaneously lacking Cal4, which only increases <italic>RPL4</italic> but not <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA levels, and Tom1 were also inviable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that deregulated expression of endogenous Rpl4 is already sufficient to confer lethality when excess r-proteins are not degraded by Tom1-dependent clearance. In agreement with excess Rpl4 being directly responsible for the synergistic growth defect, deregulated Rpl4a expression, this time enabled by the presence of the BIV mutations in the genomic <italic>RPL4A</italic> copy, did not support growth upon genetic depletion of Tom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3H</xref>). Accordingly, lowering the levels of synthesized Rpl4, by deleting the <italic>RPL4A</italic> gene, efficiently suppressed the synthetic lethality of <italic>∆cal4</italic>/<italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Providing Rpl4 exclusively from the <italic>RPL4B</italic> locus, however, was not sufficient to restore growth of <italic>∆caf130</italic>/<italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that not only excess supply of Rpl4 but also of Rpl3 is individually detrimental for cells lacking Tom1. In line with this notion, expression of the Rpl3.F16A/L17A variant, under the transcriptional control of its own promoter from a multicopy plasmid, abolished growth of Tom1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even more importantly, only simultaneously reducing the abundance of Rpl4 and Rpl3 by deleting <italic>RPL4A</italic> and expressing Rpl3 from the weaker <italic>RPL4B</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zeevi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Knight et al., 2014</xref>), but not solely lowering Rpl3 levels, permitted efficient growth of <italic>∆caf130</italic>/<italic>∆tom1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, the genetic data convincingly demonstrate that the moderate constant surplus supply, around twofold at the mRNA level, of either Rpl3 or Rpl4 is sufficient to perturb growth and possibly also proteostasis of cells lacking Tom1. To explore whether deregulated expression of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 indeed promotes their aggregation, we assessed their occurrence in the insoluble fraction of <italic>∆caf130</italic> and <italic>∆cal4</italic> cells upon genetic depletion of Tom1. Strikingly, Rpl3 appeared already after 8 hr in glucose-containing medium in the insoluble fraction of <italic>∆caf130</italic>/P<italic>GAL</italic>-2xHA-<italic>TOM1</italic> cells, and Western analysis also revealed some accumulation of Rpl4 at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). After 24 hr of Tom1 depletion, a massive aggregation of Rpl3 and, albeit to a lesser extent, of Rpl4 could be observed. Concomitantly, many additional proteins showed up in the insoluble fraction, including, as indicated by Western analysis, several r-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that aggregation of Rpl3 and Rpl4 leads to an extensive perturbation of cellular proteostasis. Notably, the abundance of the other directly tested r-proteins was substantially decreased in the total extracts after 24 hr of Tom1 depletion, presumably reflecting, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>), the decreased transcription of their encoding genes as a result of lower Ifh1 promoter occupancy in order to alleviate the proteotoxic burden. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the major distinct gel bands confirmed the high prevalence of almost all r-proteins in the insoluble fraction and additionally revealed the presence of a broad range of different proteins, including ribosome biogenesis factors, proteasome subunits, general chaperones, and translation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). As expected, depleting Tom1 for 24 hr in <italic>∆cal4</italic> cells resulted, to a similar extent as observed above in <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells, in extensive aggregation of Rpl4 and the concomitant presence of many additional proteins in the insoluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We note that the deregulated expression of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4, in the absence of Tom1-dependent clearance of their excess occurrence, promotes their aggregation and entails a loss of overall proteostasis, which very likely accounts for the observed synthetic lethality of <italic>∆caf130</italic>/<italic>∆tom1</italic> and also of <italic>∆cal4</italic>/<italic>∆tom1</italic> cells.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the two dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4 intimately cooperate with the regulatory machinery to provide optimal levels of assembly-competent Rpl3 and Rpl4. By perfectly balancing their de novo synthesis, pre-60S assembly can be sustained at the highest possible rate without requiring the Tom1-mediated degradation of excess Rpl3 and Rpl4, which would, as a last resort, be necessary to avoid their aggregation and, ultimately, a potentially deleterious collapse of cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the above-described data also strongly suggest that the main, physiologically relevant targets of the regulatory machinery are the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have unveiled a novel, fascinating mechanism enabling the tight co-translational regulation of r-protein expression that is of physiological importance for the maintenance of cellular proteostasis. On the basis of our data and the current state of knowledge, we propose the following model for how the de novo synthesis of Rpl3 and Rpl4 is fine-tuned to meet the demands of ribosome assembly and, at the same time, protect cells from the potentially detrimental effects of their surplus production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Under normal conditions, that is, when ribosome assembly proceeds at an optimal rate, the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4 are available in sufficient amounts to capture their nascent r-protein client Rpl3 or Rpl4, respectively, as the specific chaperone-binding segment emerges from the exit tunnel on the surface of the 60S r-subunit, thereby leading to a stabilization of the <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA that is in the process of being translated. Conversely, when ribosome biogenesis occurs at reduced pace and Rpl3 or Rpl4 cannot get efficiently integrated into the developing pre-60S particles, Rrb1 and Acl4 get sequestered by their unassembled r-protein partner in the nucleus and, therefore, can no longer bind to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 in a timely manner. In this case, the presumed, co-translational interaction of NAC with the regulation-conferring segment on these two r-proteins persists long enough to enable the recruitment of or the transfer to the regulatory machinery, which, likely via the Caf1-Ccr4 deadenylase module of the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not core complex, promotes the degradation of the physically connected <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA. The finding that overexpression of Rrb1 or Acl4 leads to a further, specific increase in <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels strongly suggests that the two dedicated chaperones are actually present in somewhat limiting amounts and that, even under normal growth conditions, there is a constant competition between Rrb1 or Acl4 and the regulatory machinery for binding to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), thus, conferring high sensitivity to the regulatory process. Accordingly, the functional utility of dedicated chaperones can be extended to the purpose of serving as molecular rheostats that, in the case of Rrb1 and Acl4, continuously sense the status of early pre-60S assembly by surveying the levels of free Rpl3 or Rpl4, respectively, and thereby coordinate the production of new Rpl3 and Rpl4 with their actual consumption during biogenesis of 60S r-subunits. The need for such a tight regulation becomes apparent when Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 expression is deregulated, such as in the absence of Caf130 or Cal4, and cells cannot clear these excessively produced r-proteins via their Tom1-mediated ubiquitination (ERISQ pathway) and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In this setting, Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 undergo massive aggregation, which likely accounts for the observed collapse of overall proteostasis and the inability to sustain cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). We conclude that, depending on the cell’s proteostatic state, the meticulous adjustment of the abundance of unassembled Rpl3 and/or Rpl4, achieved by a properly functioning interplay between the regulatory machinery and the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4, may become essential to maintain cellular proteostasis. Moreover, the here-described autoregulatory feedback loop constitutes together with the ERISQ pathway a robust buffering system to prevent cells from experiencing the harmful impact of excess Rpl3 and/or Rpl4.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Simplified model showing how availability of the dedicated chaperone Rrb1 or Acl4 and the here uncovered regulatory network cooperate to balance Rpl3 and Rpl4 expression by co-translationally regulating <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels.</title><p>The question marks indicate that it remains to be determined how nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 are recognized by the regulatory machinery and how this leads to the degradation, presumably involving a component of the Ccr4-Not complex, of the <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs. Also included in the model and highlighted by an exclamation mark is the finding that surplus production of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4, for example, elicited by inactivation of the regulatory machinery, may lead to their aggregation when cells lack the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1, which is required for mediating the degradation of excess r-proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) via the so-called ERISQ (excess ribosomal protein quality control) pathway.

Ifh1, owing to its Utp22-dependent sequestration in the CURI complex, is also employed, by sensing the 90S assembly status, to coordinate the transcriptional output of most RPGs with that of the 35S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, in response to a ribosome assembly stress, leading to the aggregation of unassembled r-proteins, Ifh1 gets rapidly displaced from RPG promoters and appears to accumulate in an insoluble nucle(ol)ar fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>); the concomitant decrease in Ifh1-dependent RPG transcription then helps to alleviate the proteostatic stress by reducing the production of new r-proteins. Notably, the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> genes contain category III promoters, and they are the RPGs whose efficient transcription, while being rather insensitive to Ifh1 depletion or the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR), shows the highest Sfp1 dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Zencir et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, the here-described co-translational regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels represents an elegant mechanism to specifically reduce the de novo synthesis of Rpl3 and Rpl4 when their unassembled levels exceed, due to a perturbation of ribosome assembly, the buffering capacity of the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4. While the above would suggest a special relevance for rapidly responding to certain stress conditions, our data indicate that the regulatory mechanism also continuously operates under normal growth conditions. In line with a constant adjustment of their transcript levels via a regulated degradation pathway, the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> transcripts are among the five RPG mRNAs exhibiting markedly shorter half-lives than all other RPG mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). What could be the reason for their different transcriptional regulation and the need to tightly control the levels of unassembled Rpl3 and Rpl4? Both Rpl3 and Rpl4, by associating shortly before or after the generation of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA, are among the earliest assembling large subunit r-proteins, and they fulfill a central role for the compaction and/or stabilization of the earliest pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rosado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pöll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gamalinda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pillet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joret et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to sustain optimal rates of 60S production and avoid the costs and impact of abortive pre-60S assembly, it is necessary to warrant a sufficient supply of assembly-competent Rpl3 and Rpl4. The temporary nuclear storage of Rpl3 and Rpl4 in complex with their dedicated chaperone not only provides the required buffering capacity to rapidly respond to short-term increases in assembly demand but also the means to relay and directly connect the status of early pre-60S assembly to the rate of the two r-proteins’ de novo synthesis. Compared to a purely transcription-based adaptation of protein levels, the uncovered regulatory mechanism, owing to the constant supply of new <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> mRNAs that are then either translated or subjected to regulated degradation, has the evident advantage of enabling a more rapid response. We conclude that the accurate functioning of this regulatory system is instrumental to avoid the impact of both the surplus and insufficient supply of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Potential mechanism of substrate recognition and mRNA degradation</title><p>While our study has identified several of the involved regulatory components (NAC, Caf130, Cal4, and Not1) as well as the regulation-conferring segment on the two nascent r-proteins and some key residues therein, the mechanism and selectivity of the substrate recognition process and the component(s) mediating mRNA degradation remain to be determined. Considering the mandatory requirement of a physical connection with Not1 for negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels to occur, an involvement of one of the associated core components of the Ccr4-Not complex can be supposed. Since it is well established that the Ccr4-Not complex plays an important role in the decay of cytoplasmic mRNAs, a process that is initiated by deadenylation of the poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker, 2012</xref>), we consider it highly likely that its Caf1-Ccr4 deadenylase module promotes degradation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA. Notably, the utilization of a defined segment of the encoded nascent polypeptide constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, an unprecedented mechanism of recruitment of the Ccr4-Not complex to a substrate mRNA, which is more conventionally achieved through interactions with either the poly(A)-binding protein or rather general as well as specific RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bresson and Tollervey, 2018</xref>), but, as recently shown, can also occur via the accommodation of the Not5-NTD in the ribosomal E-site of mRNAs displaying low codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>). Regardless of the recruitment mechanism, sensing of the mRNA’s translation status appears in many cases to be an important aspect for enabling selective mRNA degradation.</p><p>How are nascent Rpl3 and Rpl4, in the absence of Rrb1 or Acl4 binding, recognized as signals for the selective recruitment of the Ccr4-Not complex in order to initiate the degradation of the encoding mRNAs? The strict requirement of both NAC subunits for negative regulation indicates that heterodimeric NAC, owing to its established role as a ribosome-associated chaperone that binds nascent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deuerling et al., 2019</xref>), is involved in the substrate recognition process. Given that the N-terminal tail of NAC-β can insert, as seen in the cryo-EM structure of a reconstituted <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NAC-60S complex, up to the constriction point of the polypeptide exit tunnel to sense and bind to nascent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gamerdinger et al., 2019</xref>), we assume that the yeast NAC-β subunits may be responsible for establishing the initial contact with the N-terminal part of the regulation-conferring segment of nascent Rpl3 and Rpl4. Conspicuously, in both cases the residues identified as being crucial for conferring regulation, F16/L17 and W109, respectively, are followed by a segment of around 30 amino acids that is also required to confer maximal regulation. Considering that around 25–30 amino acids are generally buried within the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhushan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Döring et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that the residues following these key residues, especially those potentially extending from the constriction point of the tunnel to the peptidyl transferase center, may have a propensity for stalling the nascent chain in the exit tunnel. The immediate proximity or even partial overlap of the Rrb1- or Acl4-binding site and the key residues of the regulation-conferring segment suggests that timely association with the dedicated chaperone may preclude NAC from interacting with nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 and allow translation to proceed. Conversely, if these are not swiftly enough captured by their dedicated chaperone, NAC could sense and bind to the regulation-conferring segment, an event that presumably fortifies stalling and, thereby, further decreases the speed of translation. This would provide the necessary time window to judiciously decide about the fate of the stalled nascent ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) and its associated mRNA. If the dedicated chaperone associates sufficiently fast with its fully or partially exposed binding site on nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4, the concomitant displacement of NAC may generate a pulling force that might be necessary to overcome stalling, and the precocious degradation of the encoding mRNA can be avoided. On the other hand, when Rrb1 or Acl4 are not available in a high enough concentration in the cytoplasm, the probability of channeling the stalled RNCs to the regulated mRNA degradation pathway increases over time. Considering the high selectivity of the regulatory process and that NAC-β utilizes its NAC domain to interact either with NAC-α or Caf130, it is reasonable to postulate that Caf130-associated NAC-β then takes over the nascent Rpl3 and Rpl4 substrates. To efficiently channel the selected mRNAs to regulated degradation and confer directionality to the process, the interaction of NAC-β with Caf130 is expected to increase the affinity for the substrate, possibly through the formation of a dedicated substrate-binding surface together with Caf130 and/or Not1’s CaInD domain. At present, it is not clear why Cal4 only participates in the regulation of the <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA, but, given its robust association with Caf130, we assume that Cal4 either makes an essential contribution to substrate recognition or is required for conferring the necessary strength to RNC stalling such that the associated mRNA cannot evade its degradation.</p><p>The above-described scenario would fit well with the recently proposed role of NAC as a triage factor that promotes the faithful transfer of nascent chains to the proper targeting machinery or chaperone-assisted folding pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, our findings are reminiscent of the previous observation that mammalian mRNAs encoding proteins whose signal sequence is inefficiently recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) are, albeit by a yet to be determined mechanism, selectively degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Karamyshev et al., 2014</xref>). In analogy to the SRP-recognized sequences of secretory proteins, the binding sites on r-proteins, especially the N-terminally located segment on Rpl3, that enable the co-translational recruitment of dedicated chaperones could also be viewed as highly specific signal sequences. In the special case of nascent Rpl3 and Rpl4, the timely association with Rrb1 or Acl4 not only enables their fail-safe production as assembly-competent r-proteins but also prevents the degradation of the encoding mRNAs. Clearly, future experiments will be required to challenge the presented model, unveil the exact nature of the uncovered regulatory mechanism, and reveal whether it also exists in evolutionary more complex eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of perturbed r-protein homeostasis for developmental disorders</title><p>Notably, our study highlights the r-proteins Rpl3 and Rpl4 as potential drivers of cellular protein aggregation. Our findings therefore further reinforce the notion that the aggregation of unassembled r-proteins represents a threat to the maintenance of cellular proteostasis, which, as shown by previous studies, yeast cells try first to avoid by clearing excess r-proteins via Tom1-mediated degradation (ERISQ pathway) and then to resolve by activating a stress response pathway, referred to as RASTR or RPAS, that increases the protein folding, disaggregation, and degradation capacity and decreases Ifh1-dependent transcription of RPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tye et al., 2019</xref>).

In the case of RPL4, both its overexpression and depletion, the latter in an RPL5- and RPL11-dependent manner, lead to p53 stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a possible connection between RPL3 and RPL4 variants and DBA is suggested by the identification of missense mutations both in <italic>RPL3</italic> (one DBA patient; His11 to Arg substitution, unknown significance for disease manifestation) and <italic>RPL4</italic> (one individual with DBA-like phenotypes; Val-Leu insertion between Ala58 and Gly59) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gazda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jongmans et al., 2018</xref>). Besides in DBA, increased p53 activity also plays a pivotal role in eliciting tissue-specific defects in a variety of different developmental syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bowen and Attardi, 2019</xref>). In this respect, it is worth mentioning that genetic changes in <italic>HUWE1</italic>, encoding the ortholog of Tom1, are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, prominently including X-linked intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Giles and Grill, 2020</xref>), and that reduced HUWE1 levels, due to a disease-causing mutation, increase p53 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aprigliano et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, individuals with mutations in <italic>CNOT1</italic> exhibit a broad range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes, most consistently resulting in intellectual disability, development, speech, and motor delay, and hypotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vissers et al., 2020</xref>). Taking into account the findings of our study and the above considerations, perturbed proteostasis, elicited by unassembled r-proteins such as RPL3 and RPL4, could not only contribute to the development of DBA but possibly also influence the aging process and be of relevance to the etiology of diverse developmental disorders and even neurodegenerative diseases of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Szybińska and Leśniak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Maor-Nof et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, genetic methods, and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) are derivatives of W303 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Thomas and Rothstein, 1989</xref>).

The quality of the samples was assessed by their analysis on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc, Ankeny, USA). The libraries were prepared according to the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). Briefly, polyA-containing mRNAs were purified, fragmented, reverse transcribed, and amplified to generate the libraries, which were subjected to high-throughput sequencing on a HiSeq 3000 instrument (Illumina).</p><p>In a preliminary step, the reads from multiple lanes were combined into single files. Quality control was performed with FastQC v0.11.7 (fastqc: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>), revealing excellent quality reads for all samples; hence, no cleaning was applied. The yeast genome R64-1-1.90, downloaded from Ensembl (Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.dna.toplevel.fa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yates et al., 2020</xref>), was indexed for STAR v2.5.0b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Then the reads from step 1 were remapped to genes for each sample with STAR using the annotation information from Ensembl (Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.90.gtf). The final table of counts was obtained by merging the individual tables with Unix commands. Since several genes of interest have paralogs (e.g., <italic>RPL4A</italic> and <italic>RPL4B</italic>), we used the parameter “<monospace>--outFilterMultimapNmax</monospace> 2” to allow for two possible locations of each read.</p><p>The read counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; for metadata, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) were then analyzed using the R library DESeq2, version 1.30.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Since the mating types of the strains were not taken into consideration during the design of the experiment and can be imbalanced between the triplicate of each investigated genotype, a first analysis was conducted on all samples to determine the genes that were significantly changed (padj&lt;0.05) due to the mating type of the strains (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> versus <italic>MAT</italic>α). 26 genes were identified and removed for a second analysis where each mutant triplicate was compared to the wild-type triplicate.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eugene Valkov (Reviewer #2); David Shore (Reviewer #3); David Tollervey (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should consider how they might shorten the text throughout without sacrificing any information. There are many spots where deletions or rephrasing could actually improve clarity. Additionally, the authors could either delete the penultimate Results section (&quot;Possible conservation…&quot;) completely or reduce it to a short paragraph since it contains no new functional data. Finally, some of the analysis could be tightened up to shorten the manuscript as well.</p><p>2) The RNA-seq experiment in Figure 1 does not distinguish between effects on transcription and mRNA stability. It is important to measure transcription more directly in these strains, for example by RNA Pol2 ChIP-seq, NET-seq or TT-seq. Or RNA Pol2 ChIP-qPCR at RPL3/4 and perhaps at one or two RP genes that appear to be highly regulated at initiation (category I or II) for comparison. This should allow the authors to determine the extent to which regulation of all r-protein gene expression in the strains they test is either at the level of transcription initiation or mRNA stability (production versus degradation). This is particularly relevant given that recent studies have shown that RPL3/4 genes are subjected to minimal regulation at the transcriptional level following stress compared to most other r-protein genes. In sum, transcription should be more directly analyzed in the key mutant strains and in wild-type cells under a few stress conditions (e.g. heat shock, TORC1 inhibition, nutrient deprivation, ribosome assembly defects, etc.).</p><p>3) The authors need to address directly the relationship between the system they describe here and the observations in Buschauer et al. Science, 2020 (and references therein) regarding the involvement of Ccr4-Not in monitoring codon optimality at translating ribosomes. This could be done through a clearer discussion of these points but would be better addressed by testing the role of the Not5 N-terminal domain in RPL3/4 mRNA regulation and, perhaps using data in Buschauer et al., determine whether ribosome stalling occurs around the regulatory regions they identify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>One of my major concerns is that the manuscript is too long, with the writing often verbose and very difficult to follow. I will make some specific suggestions below but would urge the authors to consider how they might shorten the text throughout without sacrificing any information. There are many spots where deletions or rephrasing could actually improve clarity. I would also suggest that the authors either delete the penultimate Results section (&quot;Possible conservation…&quot;) completely or reduce it to a short paragraph since it contains no new functional data.</p><p>Regarding the experiments themselves, I have the following major criticisms/suggestions:</p><p>(1) The RNA-seq experiment in Figure 1 does not distinguish between effects on transcription and mRNA stability. It would thus be useful to measure transcription more directly in these strains, either by NET-seq or RNA Pol2 ChIP-seq. This should allow the authors to determine the extent to which regulation of all r-protein gene expression in the strains they test is either at the level of transcription initiation or mRNA stability (production versus degradation). This is particularly relevant given that recent studies have shown that RPL3/4 genes are subjected to minimal regulation at the transcriptional level following stress compared to most other r-protein genes (see below).</p><p>(2) The authors should consider auxin-induced degron (AID) experiments to address the role of Caf1, Ccr4, and Not4, using RNA-seq or RT-PCR to measure the RPL3/4 mRNA levels following auxin addition, with appropriate controls.</p><p>(3) To solidify the claim that Caf130 bridges the interaction between Btt1 and Not1, the pull-down experiments could be performed in a caf130Δ strain.</p><p>(4) On pg. 13 line 29, I would suggest that the authors delete &quot;nascent&quot; and rephrase the title of this section since it implies that regulation occurs exclusively at the ribosome, which is not actually demonstrated here. I would agree that this is very likely to be the case, but I would suggest that the authors make clear that they don't know for sure, unless, of course, they have a strong argument that this has to be true.</p><p>(5) The argument (pg. 15 line 18) that the regulatory signal is on the Rpl4 protein and not its mRNA is not very strong, in my opinion. It might be interesting to see if cycloheximide treatment blocks the regulation, perhaps following acute Acl4 depletion by AID.</p><p>(6) The authors need to address directly the relationship between the system they describe here and the observations in Buschauer et al. Science, 2020 (and references therein) regarding the involvement of Ccr4-Not in monitoring codon optimality at translating ribosomes. They should test the role of the Not5 N-terminal domain in RPL3/4 mRNA regulation and, perhaps using data in Buschauer et al., determine whether ribosome stalling occurs around the regulatory regions they identify.</p><p>(7) Related to the point above, the authors could significantly improve their study by either testing the role of NAC subunits in codon optimality monitoring by Ccr4-Not (related to Buschauer et al. Figure 5) or searching for the putative targets of the Rpl3/4 regulatory regions (which they speculate could be Btt1). Both would be even better. A key point that they need to address is whether or not the RPL3/4 regulatory system they describe here is in fact controlled by codon optimality, which might itself be exacerbated by stress, rather than through a specific protein-protein interaction involving the r-protein regulatory regions and/or interactions with the chaperones. It is less clear to me how the latter might be regulated by stress.</p><p>(8) The sentence pg. 26 line 3 doesn't make sense to me (&quot;even though&quot;) and I think, as mentioned above, that the authors miss an important point here. Zencir et al. show that RPL3/4 and the other category III genes are much less down-regulated following different forms of stress than are the majority of genes (category I and II), and suggest that this may be due to the fact that they are coupled to specialized chaperone proteins. The authors' findings suggest that RPL3/4 mRNAs are indeed strongly regulated upon stress (though they don't actually examine stress conditions in this study!), but at a post-transcriptional level, namely mRNA stability. This (potential) novel finding should be directly tested by examing RPL3/4 mRNA stability under various stress conditions (e.g. heat shock, TORC1 inhibition, nutrient deprivation, ribosome assembly defects, etc.).</p><p>(9) Related to the above, the authors never test experimentally the notion that Ccr4-Not regulation of RPL3/4 mRNAs is part of the ribosome assembly stress response described by Albert et al. (2019) and Tye et al. (2019). The authors focus primarily on the relationship between chaperone levels and RPL3/4 mRNA levels without really addressing the possible physiological role of Ccr4-Not mRNA regulation with respect to Rpl3/4. A key feature of this response is that it is abrogated by cycloheximide treatment, differentiating it from some other stress responses. Dampening of RPL3/4 mRNA regulation by cycloheximide would also provide support for the notion that the polypeptide and not the RNA of the regulatory region is responsible for regulation.</p><p>Additional comments and suggestions:</p><p>(1) In the Abstract, pg. 2 line 8 &quot;prevents&quot; should probably be changed to &quot;reduces&quot;, since they show that even in conditions of normal chaperone levels there is still degradation.</p><p>(2) Pg. 6, lines 13-16: simplify to something like &quot;To gain further insight into this observation we isolated a large number of acl4Δ and acl4Δ/rpl4Δ suppressors and identified the causative mutations by whole-genome sequencing&quot;.</p><p>(3) Not clear how causative mutations were identified without pooling and sequencing of sup+ and sup- isolates from a single backcross (pooled linkage analysis). Were there really no other polymorphisms in the suppressor strains.</p><p>(4) It would be useful to show a cartoon of the NAC and Ccr4-Not complexes in Figure 1 to help the reader to follow the subsequent analysis.</p><p>(5) In section &quot;RPL4 mRNA levels are increased…&quot; (pgs. 7-8) it would be interesting to know, as pointed out above, which of these effects are at the level of mRNA production versus degradation or stabilization. The effect of cal4Δ is hardly small, with both up and down-regulated genes. Why is that?</p><p>(6) The sentences on pg. 25, lines 11-14 and 27-31, are awkward and need to be rewritten for clarity (&quot;only present in insufficient abundance&quot;…?; too many subordinate clauses in the latter sentence).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1: In the tree plots – indicating the zero with a dashed line might be helpful. This type of data is often presented as a volcano plot – with significance (adjusted P values) rather than counts on the axis. I quite like this version, however, in the absence of P-values for named gene classes in the graph, the authors should consider stating these for the most important changes, especially when marginal (eg Rpl3 and Rpl4 in ∆btt1, ∆egd1).</p><p>2. P12, P13; Figure 3: &quot;Btt1 appears to exclusively interact with either Caf130 or Egd2, but not simultaneously with both, since neither Caf130 nor Egd2 could co-purify each other….&quot; Could this be an efficiency issue? I did not see any indication of the pairwise coprecipitation efficiency but according to the legend ~200 fold more precipitate was loaded relative to input, so the stoichiometry is unclear. If – for example – 10% of each protein is in complex with Btt1, only 1% would coprecipitate.</p><p>3. Figure 7S4: The general approach of using MS to assess the proteins present in the pellet fraction is good. However, the version used, involving the cutting of visible gel bands is surprising. By definition, most proteins detected during depletion are absent from the 0 h sample, since the corresponding regions were not analysed. A labelling based method, eg SILAC or iCAT, allowing quantitation of relative recovery for all proteins might have been better. The data presented are, however, sufficient to support the major conclusions, that protein aggregation is increased and multiple proteins are recruited.</p><p>4. Figure 8: What does the exclamation mark indicate?</p><p>5. In the PDF, commas separating thousands in numbers are inverted.</p><p>6. A great deal of data are presented, but even allowing for this the text is very long, with frequent repetitions in the text and again in the figure legends and Discussion. At over 8 pages, the Discussion seems particularly long. A result is that only afficionados may make it thought to the end.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74255.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should consider how they might shorten the text throughout without sacrificing any information.

Even though we discuss therein for the first time, also based on structural alignments of only recently available structure predictions, pertinent commonalities and differences between the yeast and human proteins associating with Not’1 N-terminal domain, we agree that this extensive analysis is not particularly relevant for the functional understanding of the uncovered regulatory mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The RNA-seq experiment in Figure 1 does not distinguish between effects on transcription and mRNA stability.

To specifically ChIP initiating RNA Pol II, we employed, as commonly done (Albert et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2019, PMID: 31124783; Zencir et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2020, PMID: 33084907), an antibody (Abcam ab5131) recognizing the S5-phosphorylated heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain of Rpo21/Rpb1. Then, we assessed occupancy of RNA Pol II around the transcription start site (TSS) of several RPGs, containing either category I (<italic>RPL30</italic> and <italic>RPL39</italic>), II (<italic>RPS20</italic>), or III (<italic>RPL3</italic>, <italic>RPL4A</italic>, and <italic>RPL4B</italic>) promoters, by qPCR, using occupancy around the TSS of <italic>SNR52</italic> as a reference for normalization. This analysis revealed that absence of Caf130 does not lead to an increased association of initiating RNA Pol II on the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> promoters (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A), strongly supporting the notion that the observed increase in <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels is due their increased stability when the uncovered regulatory mechanism has been inactivated. Moreover, we have also tested the effects of TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin treatment, which resulted in a similarly reduced transcription of all tested RPGs both in wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Nevertheless, the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels remained around two-fold higher in cells lacking Caf130, suggesting that the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs, even when present at lower abundance, are still subjected to negative regulation under these conditions in wild-type cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The new text describing these findings can be found on page 7 (starting on line 34) and page 8 (ending on line 8) of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The finding that transcription initiation is not increased at the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> promoters in the absence of Caf130 was not unexpected as we had already shown in the submitted manuscript that inactivation of the regulatory machinery also leads to increased mRNA levels when <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A</italic>, or the minimal regulation-conferring regions thereof, are transcribed from the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. Moreover, the finding that one single (leading to the W109C substitution in Rpl4a) or only a few (leading to the F16A/L17A substitutions in Rpl3) nucleotide change(s) within the coding sequence of the minimal regulation-conferring region increases the mRNA levels of these reporter constructs in wild-type cells provides additional strong evidence that regulation does not occur at the transcriptional stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to address directly the relationship between the system they describe here and the observations in Buschauer et al. Science, 2020 (and references therein) regarding the involvement of Ccr4-Not in monitoring codon optimality at translating ribosomes. This could be done through a clearer discussion of these points but would be better addressed by testing the role of the Not5 N-terminal domain in RPL3/4 mRNA regulation and, perhaps using data in Buschauer et al., determine whether ribosome stalling occurs around the regulatory regions they identify.</p></disp-quote><p>In the submitted manuscript, we had already described in the Results section that absence of Not5’s N-terminal domain (Figure 2—figure supplement 1I), which does not result in any observable growth defect (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H), as well as deletion of Rps25 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1J) do not suppress the growth defect of <italic>∆acl4</italic> cells (see page 11, lines 8-17). Moreover, we had mentioned in the Discussion that accommodation of the Not5-NTD in the ribosomal E-site of mRNAs displaying low A-site codon optimality represents one of the mechanisms of Ccr4-Not complex recruitment to a substrate mRNA (see page 27, lines 29-31).</p><p>To further corroborate that the mechanism reported by Buschauer et al. is not involved, we have, as suggested, assessed the effect of the absence of Not5’s N-terminal domain on <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. As expected from the genetic data, expression of the Not5 variant lacking the N-terminal domain in <italic>∆not5</italic> cells does not lead to an increase in <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1J in the revised manuscript). Moreover, we have also introduced this additional information in the text (see page 11, lines 16-21 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>As previously shown by the Coller laboratory (Presnyak et al. Cell 2015, PMID: 25768907), most RPG mRNAs display an optimal codon content of more than 80%. Moreover, a stretch of several consecutive rare codons appears to be required to cause a dramatic decrease in mRNA stability, as revealed by the insertion of ten non-optimal codons into otherwise stable mRNA reporter constructs (see Hu et al. Nature 2009, PMID: 19701183; Sweet et al. PLoS Biol. 2012, PMID: 22719226). As suggested, we have assessed, according to the data provided in Figure 5C of the Buschauer et al. publication, the occurrence and distribution of Not4-enriched A-site codons and non-optimal codons, respectively, within the minimal regulation-conferring regions of <italic>RPL3</italic> (codons encoding residues 1-52) and <italic>RPL4A</italic> (codons encoding residues 78-139) (see ).

Importantly, there are not any evident stretches of either Not4-enriched A-site codons or non-optimal codons. In this context it is worth mentioning that the absence of Not5’s N-terminal domain does not increase the half-life of a <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter mRNA displaying 50% codon optimality (see Figure 5E in the Buschauer et al. publication); thus, making its involvement in targeting these <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA regions, which display an even higher codon optimality, to degradation highly unlikely.As our data clearly rule out an involvement of Not5’s N-terminal domain, we do not believe that it is necessary to further discuss, as proposed, the mechanism described by Buschauer et al., whose physiological relevance (i.e. the effect on specific mRNAs) has not been investigated in that study, in the context of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One of my major concerns is that the manuscript is too long, with the writing often verbose and very difficult to follow.

However, the outcome and interpretation of these experiments may be hampered by the anticipated pleiotropic effects entailed by depletion of Caf1, Ccr4, and Not4 on general cytoplasmic mRNA decay and/or maintenance of proteostasis. In this sense, it may indeed be helpful to consider using, as proposed, a more rapid depletion system than the conventional one based on glucose-mediated repression of genes that are under the transcriptional control of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> promoter. As auxin has recently been shown to inhibit TORC1 (Nicastro et al. PLoS Genet. 2021, PMID: 33690632), whose activity is required for efficient transcription of all RPGs, experiments using the auxin-induced degron (AID) depletion system need to be properly controlled and may, in the worst case, turn out to be inept for detecting around two-fold changes in <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. As an alternative to assessing <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels upon depletion of these Ccr4-Not components, we have also planned to do this in <italic>∆not1</italic> cells co-expressing the major Not1 isoform (Not1.163C), lacking the N-terminal domain and sustaining the essential function of the Ccr4-Not complex, and the minor, full-length Not1 isoform (Not1.M163A) additionally containing deletions or point mutations that specifically abrogate Caf1-Ccr4 or Not4 binding.

We have therefore omitted this sentence (page 15, lines 15-18 of the submitted manuscript) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>According to our opinion, several lines of evidence provide convincing support for the argument that the regulatory signal is harbored by the Rpl3 and Rpl4 protein: (1) A single amino acid exchange (W109C, one nucleotide substitution) within full-length Rpl4a confers <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression and up-regulates levels of the <italic>rpl4a.W109C</italic>-yEGFP fusion mRNA (Figure 4D); (2) The W109C substitution within the minimal regulation-conferring segment (encompassing amino acids 78-139 of Rpl4a) is sufficient to reduce, even when Acl4 binding is disabled by the BI mutations, negative regulation of the encoding mRNA (Figure 4F); (3) Overexpression of Acl4, which we had previously shown to capture Rpl4 in a co-translational manner (Pillet et al. PLoS Genetics 2015) and whose binding site overlaps with the identified key residues mediating regulation (W109 and possibly also residues W106, R107, and K108 that are substituted alongside W109 with alanines in the BIV mutant) (see Acl4-Rpl4 co-structure in Huber and Hoelz Nat. Commun. 2017, PMID: 28148929), results in increased <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels (Figure 6); (4) Similar principles apply to the regulation of RPL3 mRNA levels. For example, two amino acid changes (F16A/L17A, six nucleotide substitutions), which are immediately following the minimal Rrb1 binding site (see Pausch et al. Nat. Commun. 2015 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), reduce negative regulation of the mRNA reporter encoding residues 1-52 of Rpl3 (see Figure 5C). Overexpression of Rrb1 or presence of the H3E mutation, which abolishes Rrb1 binding, increases or, respectively, decreases the levels of the <italic>RPL3</italic> mRNA (Figure 6 and Figure 5A).</p><p>While we are absolutely open for alternative models and have also explicitly stated in the Discussion that “Clearly, future experiments will be required to challenge the presented model and unveil the exact nature of the uncovered regulatory mechanism.” (see page 29, lines 11-12 of the submitted manuscript and page 28, lines 34-36 of the revised manuscript), the proposed co-translational regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels, involving a competition between the dedicated chaperone and the regulatory machinery for binding to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4, represents for the moment the most plausible model. Assuming that the regulatory signal would be on the mRNA, how would it elicit regulation? As our data show that Not5’s N-terminal domain is not involved, selective recruitment of the Ccr4-Not complex to the <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA owing to low A-site codon optimality is highly unlikely (see also our answer to Essential revision point 3). In any case, it is questionable whether one ‘tryptophan’ codon (W109), in the context of otherwise optimal codons, or the combination of an optimal ‘phenylalanine’ and ‘leucine’ codon (F16/L17) could selectively impose regulation to the encoding mRNAs. Moreover, given the close proximity or partial overlap of the dedicated chaperone binding site and the regulatory signal, a positive effect of Rrb1 or Acl4 binding on the stability of the <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA cannot be reconciled with a regulatory event involving decoding of the above-mentioned codons as the binding site of the dedicated chaperone would have not at all (Rpl3: residues 1-15) or only partially (Rpl4: residues 43-114) exited from the ribosome. Therefore, it is also difficult to imagine how a potential secondary structure, involving the bases of these codons, could act as a regulatory signal that blocks ribosome movement on these mRNAs. Similarly, how would mutation of these codons reduce recognition by the regulatory machinery, especially considering that the involved ribosome-associated NAC has a well-established role in binding to nascent chains?</p><p>Concerning the suggestion to address by cycloheximide treatment whether regulation depends on ongoing translation, see our answer to point 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors need to address directly the relationship between the system they describe here and the observations in Buschauer et al. Science, 2020 (and references therein) regarding the involvement of Ccr4-Not in monitoring codon optimality at translating ribosomes.

Figure 5) or searching for the putative targets of the Rpl3/4 regulatory regions (which they speculate could be Btt1). Both would be even better. A key point that they need to address is whether or not the RPL3/4 regulatory system they describe here is in fact controlled by codon optimality, which might itself be exacerbated by stress, rather than through a specific protein-protein interaction involving the r-protein regulatory regions and/or interactions with the chaperones. It is less clear to me how the latter might be regulated by stress.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in the Discussion, we firmly believe that co-translational recognition of nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 by their dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4, respectively, represents a plausible and elegant mechanism to rapidly relay and directly couple the status of pre-60S assembly to the rate of Rpl3 or Rpl4 de novo synthesis. By continuously sensing the levels of unassembled Rpl3 and Rpl4, which can be temporarily stored in the nucleus in complex with their dedicated chaperone, the availability of free Rrb1 and Acl4 to capture their nascent r-protein partner determines the fate of the encoding <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs and, thereby, the amount of newly synthesized Rpl3 or Rpl4. Accordingly, only changes in unassembled Rpl3 or Rpl4 that exceed the binding capacity of Rrb1 or Acl4, owing to a specific or more global perturbation of ribosome assembly (stress), will lead to a rapid and strong downregulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. In other words, any ribosome assembly defect or stress leading to reduced incorporation of Rpl3 or Rpl4 would lead to a titration of free Rrb1 or Acl4 and their nuclear sequestration in complex with their unassembled r-protein client. As Rrb1 or Acl4 overexpression and inactivation of their binding (H3E mutation in Rpl3 or BI mutations in Rpl4) either positively or negatively affect the abundance of the <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs (Figure 6 and Figures 5A and 4D), it can be inferred that the regulatory mechanism also continuously operates under normal growth conditions. Therefore, such a tight regulation of unassembled Rpl3 or Rpl4 levels is ideally suited to both warrant optimal rates of 60S production, thus avoiding the costs and impact of abortive pre-60S assembly, and prevent cells form the potentially detrimental effect of Rpl3 or Rpl4 aggregation. Evidently, the proposed co-translational regulation mechanism has the advantage of enabling a more rapid response than a transcription-based regulation of protein levels.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that it would be interesting to understand how the regulatory signal on Rpl3 or Rpl4 is deciphered by the regulatory machinery. As already replied above (see answer to Essential revision point 3), our data indicate that the here-described regulatory system does not involve monitoring of codon optimality. Rather, as stated in the Discussion, we envisage that NAC binding to nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4, presumably around the identified key residues (F16/L17 in Rpl3 and W109 in Rpl4), may fortify a stalling activity that is present in the distal region of the minimal regulation-conferring segments. Slowing down translation would then provide the necessary time window to enable the recruitment of the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex and initiate the degradation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs. Despite significant efforts since the discovery of NAC in 1994, only very little is still known about how NAC recognizes and affects the fate of nascent polypeptides (reviewed in Deuerling et al. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019, PMID: 30833456). It appears that capturing the weak and transient interactions between NAC and its nascent, physiological substrates on translating ribosomes it technically very challenging. Addressing this issue would probably require the biochemical and structural analysis of robustly stalled nascent polypeptides displaying different lengths of the regulatory signal at the solvent side of the exit tunnel. Considering the enormous challenge and complexity of such experiments, we believe that this task should be part of a thorough follow-up study aimed at deciphering the molecular details of the regulatory mechanism that we have unveiled in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The sentence pg. 26 line 3 doesn't make sense to me (&quot;even though&quot;) and I think, as mentioned above, that the authors miss an important point here. Zencir et al. show that RPL3/4 and the other category III genes are much less down-regulated following different forms of stress than are the majority of genes (category I and II), and suggest that this may be due to the fact that they are coupled to specialized chaperone proteins. The authors' findings suggest that RPL3/4 mRNAs are indeed strongly regulated upon stress (though they don't actually examine stress conditions in this study!), but at a post-transcriptional level, namely mRNA stability. This (potential) novel finding should be directly tested by examing RPL3/4 mRNA stability under various stress conditions (e.g. heat shock, TORC1 inhibition, nutrient deprivation, ribosome assembly defects, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the “even though” in this sentence is somehow confusing. We have therefore removed it and rephrased the sentence to: “… the complementary action of Ifh1 and Sfp1, which are predominantly required for activation ….”.</p><p>We have stated in the Discussion of the submitted manuscript that the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> genes are the RPGs whose transcription, while being rather insensitive to Ifh1 depletion or the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR), shows the highest Sfp1 dependence (Zencir et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; Albert et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2019) (see page 26, lines 12-15 of the revised manuscript). Zencir et al. have therefore proposed that dedicated chaperones could compensate for the lack of transcriptional downregulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> upon RASTR. Our study has now revealed how the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 and Acl4 are involved in a sophisticated co-translational regulation mechanism that, by regulating the stability of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs, adjusts the expression levels of Rpl3 and Rpl4 to their actual consumption during ribosome assembly. In this context, it is noteworthy that none of the other r-proteins encoded by mRNAs that are transcribed from category III promoters have so far been reported to associate with a dedicated chaperone. Hence, adaptation of their protein levels during stress conditions that do not affect Sfp1 activity is expected to occur <italic>via</italic> alternative mechanisms. Notably, amongst these Rps22, Rps28, and Rpl1 have been implicated in the regulation of <italic>RPS22B</italic>, <italic>RPS28B</italic>, and <italic>RPL1B</italic> mRNA levels (Roy et al. Commun. Biol. 2020, PMID: 33311538; He et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014, PMID: 24492965).</p><p>As already mentioned above (see answer to point 7), the proposed regulatory system appears to continuously operate even under normal growth conditions, but would also be ideally suited to rapidly respond to any stress leading to the accumulation of unassembled Rpl3 or Rpl4 and, thereby, to the titration of Rrb1 or Acl4. We have now shown that the regulatory machinery, as assessed in <italic>∆caf130</italic> mutant cells, does not play a role in transcription initiation at the promoters of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> genes (see answer to Essential revision point 2). Our new data also show that rapamycin treatment reduces transcription initiation at all tested RPG promoters to a similar extent in wild-type and <italic>∆caf130</italic> mutant cells (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Accordingly, the levels of these RPG mRNAs are lower in rapamycin-treated cells, but an around two-fold higher abundance of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs can still be observed in <italic>∆caf130</italic> mutant cells (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), suggesting that regulation still occurs under this ‘stress’ condition. However, we believe that addressing whether regulation remains active under the proposed variety of stress conditions is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Related to the above, the authors never test experimentally the notion that Ccr4-Not regulation of RPL3/4 mRNAs is part of the ribosome assembly stress response described by Albert et al. (2019) and Tye et al. (2019). The authors focus primarily on the relationship between chaperone levels and RPL3/4 mRNA levels without really addressing the possible physiological role of Ccr4-Not mRNA regulation with respect to Rpl3/4. A key feature of this response is that it is abrogated by cycloheximide treatment, differentiating it from some other stress responses. Dampening of RPL3/4 mRNA regulation by cycloheximide would also provide support for the notion that the polypeptide and not the RNA of the regulatory region is responsible for regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experiments, we observe that regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels occurs under normal growth conditions (growth at 30ºC in rich YPD medium), as revealed by their increased abundance in the absence of individual components of the regulatory machinery. Importantly, all these mutants (<italic>∆caf130</italic>, <italic>∆cal4</italic>, <italic>∆btt1/∆egd1</italic>, <italic>∆egd2</italic>, and <italic>not1.163C</italic>) do not display any growth defects at 30ºC; hence, regulation appears to occur in the absence of perturbed ribosome assembly or other cellular stresses. Moreover, all these mutants exhibit synthetic lethality with the <italic>∆tom1</italic> allele and, except <italic>∆cal4</italic>, also a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, strongly suggesting that tight regulation of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 levels becomes essential for cell survival under proteostatic stress conditions. Accordingly, it appears that the different processes (the here-described co-translational regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels, RASTR/RPAS, and ERISQ) continuously cooperate to prevent proteotoxic stress arising from the aggregation of excessively abundant, unassembled r-proteins. An important readout of RASTR is the downregulation of Ifh1-dependent RPG transcription. However, as we now show in the revised manuscript, cells experiencing deregulated expression of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 (<italic>∆caf130</italic> mutant grown at 30ºC) do not exhibit reduced transcription at Ifh1-dependent category I (<italic>RPL30</italic> and <italic>RPL39</italic>) and II (<italic>RPS20</italic>) RPG promoters (see also answer to Essential revision point 2); thus, strengthening the notion that co-translational regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels occurs independently of RASTR. However, it is reasonable to assume that these two processes are intimately interconnected. As already mentioned above (see answers to point 7 and 8), any perturbation of ribosome assembly that would be sufficiently severe to lead to the accumulation of unassembled Rpl3 or Rpl4 and, hence, to the limited availability of free Rrb1 or Acl4 is expected to increase negative regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels. Reciprocally, deregulated expression of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 in cells simultaneously experiencing proteostatic stress (ERISQ inactivation or growth at 37ºC) is expected, owing to the massive aggregation of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 and the entailed insolubility of many other r-proteins (Figure 7D), to result in the activation of RASTR and the transcriptional downregulation of Ifh1-dependent RPG transcription. It will be interesting to learn whether aggregation of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4 is sufficient to recruit Ifh1 into aggregates and to reduce RPG transcription from category I and II promoters. We have planned to carefully address these predictions in future studies.</p><p>Based on the results of our study, especially the finding that lethality of <italic>∆caf130/∆tom1</italic> cells is efficiently suppressed by simultaneously lowering Rpl3 (transcription of <italic>RPL3</italic> from weaker <italic>RPL4B</italic> promoter) and Rpl4 (deletion of major <italic>RPL4A</italic> copy) levels (see Figure 7C), we infer that the physiological role of the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex consists in the negative regulation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs. As outlined in the Discussion (see also answer to point 7), coupling the availability of the dedicated chaperones Rrb1 or Acl4 to co-translational regulation of <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA levels represents an elegant and simple mechanism to survey the levels of unassembled Rpl3 and Rpl4 and, thus, the status of early pre-60S assembly. Notably, this mechanism has the advantage to enable a rapid cellular response both to insufficient or exceeding amounts of free Rpl3 or Rpl4. In our opinion, it is more difficult to envisage how the Caf130-associated Ccr4-Not complex and/or the presumed NAC-dependent recognition of nascent Rpl3 or Rpl4 could be specifically and swiftly (in)activated to rapidly respond to changes in the abundance of unassembled Rpl3 or Rpl4. At present, we presume that NAC and the Ccr4-Not complex represent constitutive elements of the regulatory system that, in case of insufficient Rrb1 or Acl4 availability, promote in a default manner degradation of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs; however, it is possible that future insights may challenge this view.</p><p>Considering that cycloheximide (CHX) treatment is known to activate TORC1 (see for example Binda et al. Mol. Cell 2009, PMID: 19748353; Santos et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2019, PMID: 30916348), the evaluation of its specific effects on <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA regulation may not be straightforward. Additionally, it also known that mRNAs undergo widespread Xrn1-depenendent co-translational degradation, a phenomenon that is exploited to study ribosome dynamics by a method called 5PSeq (Pelechano et al. Cell 2015, PMID: 26046441; Pelechano et al. Nat. Protoc. 2016, PMID: 26820793; Tesina et al. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019, PMID: 30911188). According to our pilot experiments with wild-type cells, the non-normalized levels of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNA, but also of the <italic>RPL5</italic> mRNA, similarly increase up to around two-fold within 30 min after CHX addition, suggesting a possible influence of the above-mentioned effects on TORC1 activity or general co-translational degradation. To at least exclude potentially interfering effects of increased <italic>RPL3</italic> or <italic>RPL4</italic> transcription, it may therefore be necessary to drive their transcription from a promoter that is not affected by changes in TORC1 activity. Moreover, to avoid as much as possible the potential influence of differences in the steady-state abundance of the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4</italic> mRNAs between wild-type and, for example, <italic>∆caf130</italic> cells before CHX addition, it might be advantageous to initiate the synthesis of their mRNAs from an inducible promoter.</p><p>Bearing these potential limitations in mind, we have decided to perform the experiment by assessing the effects of CHX on the abundance of a reporter mRNA encoding the minimal regulation-conferring Rpl4a segment (residues 78-139), flanked by an N-terminal TAP tag and a C-terminal GFP moiety, and either containing the BI (enabling maximal negative regulation) or the BIV (disabling negative regulation) mutations (see Figure 4F). To enable rapid induction of mRNA production that, at the same time, does not depend on de novo protein synthesis, we placed the reporter constructs under the transcriptional control of the inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, which is efficiently induced under “reinduction memory” conditions (reviewed in Stockwell et al. Mol. Biosyst. 2015, PMID: 25328105). Specifically, cells were pre-grown in synthetic medium containing galactose, transferred for 1.5 h to glucose-containing medium (time point 0), and then, after one wash in sugar-free medium, placed into medium containing galactose. CHX was added to one half of the culture at a final concentration of 200 µg/ml. Then, aliquots were taken after 10, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min of culturing in galactose-containing medium +/- CHX and extracted RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR. In line with active translation being required for efficient negative regulation, this experiment revealed that addition of CHX eliminated the difference in abundance between the reporter mRNAs containing the BI or BIV mutations within the minimal regulation-conferring coding sequence and, moreover, also increased their overall abundance (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We have incorporated the new text describing these findings on page 16, lines 25-28, of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments and suggestions:</p><p>(1) In the Abstract, pg. 2 line 8 &quot;prevents&quot; should probably be changed to &quot;reduces&quot;, since they show that even in conditions of normal chaperone levels there is still degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this suggestion.

Moreover, the genomes of several suppressors, which were in each case derived from the same parental strains, contained the same additional mutation(s), indicating that these mutations were already present before suppressor isolation. However, some suppressor genomes also contained further additional mutations (polymorphisms) that were exclusively present in one given suppressor strain. Importantly, we have shown that absence of Caf130 (<italic>∆caf130</italic>), Cal4 (<italic>∆cal4</italic>), or Not1’s N-terminal domain (<italic>not1.163C</italic>) conferred <italic>∆acl4</italic> suppression (see Figures 1A, 1B, and 2D), which provides strong evidence that the presumed candidate mutations within <italic>CAF130</italic>, <italic>CAL4</italic>, and <italic>NOT1</italic> are indeed the causative mutations.

Importantly, however, the <italic>RPL3</italic> and/or <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> mRNAs do clearly not cluster with all other RPG mRNAs when full suppression of the <italic>∆acl4</italic> growth defect is observed; therefore, the data are good enough to confidently conclude that none of the remaining RPG mRNAs are subjected to a similar regulatory mechanism as the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> mRNAs. Nevertheless, it is possible that our analysis may have missed additional, non-RPG targets of the uncovered regulatory machinery; these would, however, be less important as our genetic data strongly indicate that the <italic>RPL3</italic> and <italic>RPL4A/B</italic> mRNAs are the physiologically relevant targets (see Figure 7B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The sentences on pg. 25, lines 11-14 and 27-31, are awkward and need to be rewritten for clarity (&quot;only present in insufficient abundance&quot;…?; too many subordinate clauses in the latter sentence).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these specific recommendations how to improve the clarity of the text.
