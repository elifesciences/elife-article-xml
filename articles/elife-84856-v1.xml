For instance, different mechanoreceptor neurons detect different types of touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>) and different types of cones detect distinct wavelengths of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rushton, 1972</xref>). Different sensory neurons may also detect stimuli in distinct locations, such as touch receptors in different parts of the body or photoreceptors in different parts of the retina. A fundamental question thus arises in each sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Estebanez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">King et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haverkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jin et al., 2021</xref>): when are distinct channels of sensory input merged and when are they kept separate in order to guide behavior? If they are merged, how and where does this integration occur?</p><p>Like other sensory systems, the gustatory system contains diverse types of sensory cells. Most studies classify taste cells based on the taste modality that they detect, such as sweet or bitter, which are often studied as homogeneous populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liman et al., 2014</xref>). However, each taste modality contains a repertoire of functionally diverse sensory cells. This diversity has been well characterized in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Flies contain sweet- and bitter-sensing cells in multiple organs, including external organs such as the legs and labellum (the distal segment of the proboscis, the fly’s feeding organ) and internal organs such as the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sweet- and bitter-sensing neurons within a single organ also exhibit functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>). For example, the labellum contains four classes of bitter-sensing neurons (S-a, S-b, I-a, and I-b), defined by the gustatory receptors(Grs) that they express, and these classes show different response profiles to bitter tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). Flies also contain taste cells to detect other modalities, such as salt, sour (acid), and fat, but their functional diversity is not as well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tauber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Models for bitter taste processing and <italic>Gal4</italic> lines to target bitter neuron subsets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting three major taste organs in the fly.

How are these diverse channels of taste input translated into behavioral output? One possibility is that these input channels converge onto common downstream pathways to regulate the same set of behaviors, representing an ‘integrative model’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). Alternatively, different input channels may be processed separately to regulate distinct behaviors, a ‘segregated processing model’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). This would allow the fly to execute specific behavioral responses depending on the compound that is detected or the organ that detects it.</p><p>Previous work, focusing mainly on appetitive tastes, suggests that taste neurons in different organs have different behavioral roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Appetitive tastes such as sugar elicit a sequence of behaviors, with specific organs regulating each step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mahishi and Huetteroth, 2019</xref>). Flies first detect the presence of sugar with their legs. Depending on the sugar concentration and the fly’s hunger state, taste detection by the leg may cause the fly to stop walking and extend its proboscis to contact the food. Labellar taste stimulation may then trigger the initiation of food consumption. Food consumption leads to stimulation of pharyngeal taste neurons, which regulate the duration of food ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>) and elicit local search behavior to find more food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murata et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, sugar-sensing inputs from different organs appear to be processed separately to regulate different aspects of behavior.</p><p>However, it is not clear whether the same principle applies to aversive tastes such as bitter. Some studies suggest that different types of bitter neurons have different behavioral roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), but this has not been widely examined. The anatomical organization of sensory projections also suggests the possibility of segregated processing: bitter-sensing neurons in different organs project axons to different regions of the subesophageal zone (SEZ), the primary taste area of the brain, suggesting potential connections to distinct downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the observation that bitter-sensing neurons in different organs show different response dynamics suggests that these neurons may have distinct functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we leverage a wide array of genetic tools and behavioral assays to systematically address this longstanding question: are different channels of bitter input integrated or processed separately to regulate behavior? First, we optogenetically activated subsets of bitter neurons in different organs. Bitter neuron subsets elicited a broad and highly overlapping set of behaviors, suggesting that these inputs converge onto common downstream pathways, but we also observed differences that argue for biased convergence. Next, we used transsynaptic tracing to determine whether different types of bitter neurons connect to common or distinct pathways. Consistent with our behavioral results, bitter neurons in different organs connect to overlapping second-order pathways with biased connectivity. Finally, we studied a novel type of putative second-order neuron that projects to the higher brain. We show that it integrates bitter input from multiple organs, and we characterized its response properties, behavioral role, and downstream connectivity. Together, these results suggest that bitter inputs from different organs are selectively integrated at the first synapse and drive largely overlapping behaviors, contrasting with the prevailing view that different taste organs have different functions. Our studies also provide insight into the functional role of downstream bitter neurons and the organization of taste pathways in the higher brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subsets of bitter neurons in different organs act in parallel to regulate feeding</title><p>The goal of this study was to uncover the logic and circuit architecture underlying how different channels of bitter input are processed in the brain. Different bitter inputs, including input from different taste organs or neuronal classes, could be integrated in the brain to regulate the same behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left) or processed separately to regulate distinct behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). We first aimed to distinguish between these models by optogenetically activating subtypes of bitter neurons within specific organs and examining their effect on a wide range of behaviors. We chose to perform activation experiments rather than neuronal silencing because we wanted to determine which behaviors each set of neurons is capable of driving, which implies connectivity to downstream behavioral circuits. Neuronal silencing may not reveal the same effects due to redundant functions of bitter neurons, especially because we are only targeting a subset of bitter neurons within each organ (see below). Moreover, optogenetic activation allows precise control over the timing and duration of taste stimulation. As a control, for each experiment we activated the entire population of bitter-sensing neurons and ensured that the resulting behavioral effects are consistent with known effects of bitter taste.</p><p>We used previously characterized <italic>Gal4</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>) to target all bitter-sensing neurons across the body (<italic>Gr33a-Gal4</italic>) as well as four subsets of bitter neurons within specific organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>): (1) bitter neurons in the leg (<italic>Gr58c-Gal4</italic>); (2) bitter neurons in the labellum belonging to classes S-a and I-a (<italic>Gr59c-Gal4</italic>); (3) bitter neurons in the labellum belonging to class S-b (<italic>Gr22f-Gal4</italic>); and (4) a pharyngeal bitter neuron termed V6 (<italic>Gr9a-Gal4</italic>). The expression patterns of these four <italic>Gal4</italic> lines have been carefully validated by previous studies, showing that each line is expressed in only one of the three taste organs under study (leg, labellum, or pharynx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>). We also imaged these organs to confirm the organ-specific expression pattern of each line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Because these <italic>Gal4</italic> lines label different numbers of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and may also vary in their expression strength, we focused on analyzing whether the activation of each neuronal subset could drive any significant change in each behavior rather than comparing the strength of behavioral effects across lines. We used the light-activated channel Chrimson to drive neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Chrimson has been previously used to activate taste sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Musso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>), and bitter-sensing neurons expressing Chrimson are effectively activated by red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We began by examining the effect of bitter neuron activation on feeding responses. We first tested the proboscis extension response (PER), an appetitive response that represents the initiation of feeding and is suppressed by bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). As expected, activating the entire population of bitter-sensing neurons strongly suppressed PER to sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, activating any of the four bitter neuron subsets also suppressed PER to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, subsets of bitter neurons within any of the three organs – the leg, labellum, or pharynx – can suppress the initiation of feeding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bitter neuron subsets in different organs act in parallel to regulate feeding responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of activating bitter neuron subsets on proboscis extension response (PER) to 100 mM sucrose (n=5–8 sets of flies).

The optoPAD uses a capacitance sensor to detect feeding events, which consist of individual ‘sips’ clustered into feeding bursts and feeding bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). We used closed-loop light stimulation to optogenetically activate bitter neurons whenever the fly interacted with one food source (100 mM sucrose), while a second identical food source not linked to optogenetic stimulation served as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Activating all bitter-sensing neurons or any of the four subsets caused a near-complete suppression of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). This suppression was evident in many different feeding-related parameters. All four bitter neuron subsets suppressed the total feeding duration, number of feeding bouts, sip number, and sip duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The number of feeding bursts was suppressed by all subsets except for leg neurons, although they showed the same trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The duration of individual feeding bouts was suppressed by only one subset, the pharyngeal neurons, suggesting that this specific parameter may be primarily regulated by the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether silencing these bitter neuron subsets prevents flies from suppressing feeding in the presence of natural bitter taste. We used the light-gated chloride channel GTACR to optogenetically silence neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>). We presented flies with two bitter-containing food sources (50 mM sucrose + 1 mM quinine), and we used closed-loop stimulation to silence bitter neurons whenever the fly interacted with one of the two food sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected, silencing all bitter neurons across the body strongly increased feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). We did not expect that silencing bitter neuron subsets would have a strong effect because each subset alone robustly suppresses feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), suggesting that they act redundantly. Silencing two of the four subsets (neurons in the leg and pharynx) increased feeding in experimental flies, with pharyngeal neurons showing a stronger effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, the effects of light stimulation generally did not reach statistical significance when compared with genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, activating each bitter neuron subset had strong effects on feeding whereas silencing had weaker or null effects. These results suggest that different bitter neuron subsets act in a parallel and partially redundant manner to regulate feeding, implying that these input channels are integrated by downstream feeding circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bitter neuron subsets in different organs elicit similar effects on locomotion</title><p>Although different bitter neuron subsets elicited similar effects on feeding behavior, they may exert different effects on other taste-related behaviors.

The projections of mlSEZt neurons in the SEZ and SLP could be clearly identified based on their location and morphology. mlSEZt projections in both the SEZ and SLP responded to bitter stimulation of either the labellum or leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>), demonstrating that these neurons receive bitter input from multiple organs. Water or sugar applied to the labellum elicited a much weaker response than bitter in the SEZ (~50% of the bitter response; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and no response in the SLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Water or sugar responses were not observed in either the SEZ or SLP with tarsal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>).

Bitter stimulation of the labellum elicited transient responses at bitter onset (ON response) and offset (OFF response), whereas stimulation of the leg elicited a more sustained ON response with no OFF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). When comparing responses in the same flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), labellar stimulation elicited stronger ON responses than tarsal stimulation (~70% versus ~30% ∆F/F).</p><p>Tarsal and labellar bitter stimulation also produced different spatial patterns of activation in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Responses to tarsal stimulation were localized to a small region located at the dorsolateral edge of the larger region activated by labellar stimulation. This is consistent with our colabeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom) and the known projection patterns of tarsal and labellar bitter-sensing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>).

We observed individual puncta, likely representing axon terminals of single mlSEZt cells, that were activated by bitter stimulation of either organ. These results suggest that individual mlSEZt cells receive convergent input from the labellum and leg. mlSEZt cell bodies, which are located far from either the SEZ or SLP projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), did not respond to bitter taste (data not shown), preventing us from unequivocally imaging responses in single mlSEZt cells.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether bitter responses in mlSEZt neurons depend on the identity of the bitter compound and the recent history of bitter stimulation, as shown for labellar bitter sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, mlSEZt neurons showed compound-dependent dynamics that resembled those of sensory neurons. Relative to the strength of the ON response, denatonium and quinine elicited strong OFF responses, caffeine elicited a slightly weaker OFF response, and L-canavanine elicited no OFF response at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). mlSEZt responses also showed an experience-dependent effect resembling that of bitter-sensing neurons: with repeated bitter stimulation, the bitter ON response habituated much more strongly than the OFF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results strongly suggest that the mlSEZt neurons labeled by <italic>R29F12-Gal4</italic> are second-order bitter neurons: they have an identical morphology to second-order bitter neurons labeled by <italic>trans</italic>-Tango, their projections overlap with the axon terminals of bitter-sensing neurons, and they show clear bitter responses. We will therefore refer to mlSEZt neurons as second-order bitter neurons, although it is formally possible that they are downstream bitter neurons that are not directly connected to bitter-sensing cells. The taste selectivity and response dynamics of mlSEZt neurons closely resemble those of bitter sensory neurons. The major transformation we observe is that mlSEZt neurons receive convergent bitter input from at least two different organs, the leg and labellum. This convergence may represent a substrate by which bitter neurons in different organs elicit common behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>mlSEZt neurons regulate a subset of taste-related behaviors</title><p>Given the existence of several second-order bitter pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we wondered how individual types of second-order neurons like mlSEZt contribute to behavior.

Activating mlSEZt neurons using Chrimson suppressed PER to sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), similar to the effect of activating bitter-sensing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Silencing mlSEZt neurons using GTACR reduced the PER suppression elicited by quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, mlSEZt neurons partially mediate the aversive effect of bitter taste on proboscis extension. To determine whether this effect translates into a regulation of feeding over longer timescales, we used the optoPAD assay. mlSEZt activation suppressed feeding on sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), consistent with its effect on PER. Certain feeding parameters were suppressed (e.g., total feeding duration, sip duration, number of feeding bouts) while others were not (e.g., number of sips). In contrast to the effect of activation, mlSEZt silencing did not significantly affect feeding on a sugar/bitter mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).

However, mAL neurons in males do not have a circular projection in the SLP, as mlSEZt cells do. Although our initial characterization of mlSEZt neurons was performed in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), mlSEZt neurons in males also show a circular SLP projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that they are distinct from <italic>fru</italic>+mAL neurons and do not appear to be sexually dimorphic.</p><p>We next asked whether mlSEZt cells are excitatory or inhibitory. The CREa1 lineage contains GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ito et al., 2013</xref>), and some neurons resembling mlSEZt in the FlyCircuit database express <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic>, a GABAergic marker (e.g., Gad1-F-600213 and Gad1-F-400450) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>). To confirm that mlSEZt cells are GABAergic, we colabeled them with the GABAergic marker <italic>VGAT-lexA</italic> and observed co-expression in most mlSEZt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While some mlSEZt cells did not show clear co-expression, it is possible that expression levels were too low to be detected. To rule out the possibility that some mlSEZt cells are excitatory, we also performed colabeling experiments with the cholinergic marker <italic>ChAT-lexA</italic>, as cholinergic neurons represent the major population of excitatory neurons in the fly brain.

What downstream circuits do mlSEZt cells connect to? We used <italic>trans</italic>-Tango to label neurons postsynaptic to mlSEZt, which represent third-order bitter neurons (3Ns). Interestingly, mlSEZt neurons themselves were prominently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that they form connections with each other. We also observed dense staining in the SLP and the neighboring superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP), with many cell bodies located laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). There were very few projections out of the SLP/SIP, suggesting that 3Ns primarily comprise local neurons. The few projections out of the SLP/SIP mainly arborize in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), the region innervated by second-order bitter neurons comprising the medial tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which suggests potential cross-talk between different second-order pathways. We also observed a medial projection that crossed the midline and innervated the contralateral SLP/SIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Finally, we observed a single projection that descended vertically from the SMP along the midline, potentially innervating the SEZ, and another projection descending directly from the SLP to the ventral brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>The dense staining in these <italic>trans</italic>-Tango experiments made it difficult to discern the morphology of single neurons. To identify individual 3Ns downstream of mlSEZt cells, we used the synaptic connectome of the fly brain (the hemibrain connectome; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Because this connectome does not include the SEZ, we were restricted to analyzing the morphology and connectivity of mlSEZt cells outside the SEZ. We identified 21 neurons whose morphology strongly resembled that of mlSEZt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These neurons were classified in the connectome as three different cell types: mAL3A (6 cells), mAL3B (5 cells), and mAL4 (10 cells). All three cell types show a ring-shaped projection in the SLP, with subtle differences in their arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). We will refer to these 21 cells as mlSEZt cells, but it is not clear whether bitter-responsive mlSEZt cells include all 21 cells and three cell types, or only a subset. mlSEZt cells show dense SLP arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) characteristic of mAL3B or mAL4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), but they may also include mAL3A cells with sparser arborizations.</p><p>We next used the connectome to identify 3Ns receiving input from these 21 mlSEZt cells. Using a connection threshold of 3 synapses, we identified 201 unique 3Ns. Interestingly, four of the ten 3Ns receiving the strongest mlSEZt input are in fact mlSEZt cells, revealing strong interconnectivity that is consistent with <italic>trans</italic>-Tango labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These mlSEZt interconnections show specific connectivity motifs. There are many strong connections from mAL3A to mAL3B, a few connections in the opposite direction (mAL3B to mAL3A), a few connections from mAL3A or mAL3B to mAL4, and almost no connections from mAL4 to the other types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). These results suggest a hierarchy where mAL3A strongly influences mAL3B, mAL3A and mAL3B weakly influence mAL4, and mAL4 does not influence the other types. Because these cells are GABAergic, these interactions may mediate inhibitory cross-talk that dampens or gates the responses of other mlSEZt cells.</p><p>After excluding interconnections between mlSEZt cells, most of the 3Ns receiving the strongest mlSEZt input are neurons projecting locally within the SLP and SIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), consistent with <italic>trans</italic>-Tango staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). Other areas targeted by top 3Ns include nearby regions such as the SMP, lateral horn, superior clamp, and anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum. Very few 3Ns have long-range projections. Different mlSEZt cell types show different connectivity patterns to the top 3Ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Interestingly, mAL3A cells provide the weakest input to the top 3Ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>) despite providing the strongest input to other mlSEZt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), suggesting a distinction between lateral and feedforward mlSEZt circuitry.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>List of 3Ns receiving at least 20 synapses from mlSEZt cells.</title><p>Percent input from mlSEZt refers to the percent of total input synapses the cell receives that come from mlSEZt cells.

some have been identified in other connectomic studies. Two top 3N types (SLP259 and SLP018) are third-order olfactory neurons in a pheromone-sensing circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taisz et al., 2022</xref>) and one top 3N, LHCENT1, connects the mushroom body to olfactory circuits in the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2020</xref>). Several other 3Ns are lateral horn neurons that may participate in olfactory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, mlSEZt neurons likely provide input to neurons integrating olfactory and gustatory information. The inputs to another top 3N type, aSP-g3, were recently reconstructed using a whole-brain connectome dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taisz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). mlSEZt cells (mAL3) as well as several other second-order taste neurons were identified as inputs to aSP-g3, suggesting that some 3Ns integrate input from multiple types of second-order neurons.</p><p>Next, we used the connectome to identify postsynaptic partners of 3Ns, which represent fourth-order bitter neurons (4Ns). Starting from the top 3Ns (those receiving ≥20 mlSEZt synapses; 32 cells), we identified over 1700 4Ns total and 322 4Ns that receive at least 20 synapses from the top 3N population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). The 4Ns include several mlSEZt cells, revealing feedback connections that likely modulate mlSEZt output. We focused on the 30 4Ns receiving the strongest 3N input, excluding feedback connections to mlSEZt cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Most of these top 4Ns send axonal projections to the SLP, SIP, or nearby areas, but collectively they target more diverse brain regions than the 3Ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I–J</xref>). 4N projections to the SMP are especially prominent, with 90% of top 4Ns sending output to this region. 60% of the top 4Ns project to the lateral horn and 43% project to the mushroom body, regions that mediate innate and learned olfactory processing, respectively. The top 4Ns include neurons that regulate egg-laying (oviIN and oviDNa; two oviDNb cells are also 4Ns but not in the top 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), mushroom body output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>), and the PPL201 (PPL2a) dopaminergic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boto et al., 2019</xref>).

body movements such as locomotion. Three of these descending neurons (types oviDNa and oviDNb) drive egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), while a fourth, DNp32, is activated during walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aimon et al., 2022</xref>). Given that mlSEZt activation elicits turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), we searched for downstream connections to DNa02, a descending neuron that controls turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Individual mlSEZt neurons connected to DNa02 via two or three intermediate neurons. We identified many possible connection paths, but a strong and commonly observed path was mlSEZt → SMP389 → AOTU012 → DNa02, with the latter two connections being exceptionally strong (40 and 140 synapses, respectively).</p><p>Together, these analyses suggest that bitter information conveyed by mlSEZt cells is processed in the SLP and SIP before being relayed to other areas, including the SMP, lateral horn, mushroom body, and descending neurons. Strong lateral connections between mlSEZt cells and feedback connections from 3Ns to mlSEZt neurons suggest the presence of extensive local processing. Several 3Ns and 4Ns likely integrate bitter information from mlSEZt with olfactory input, and at least one 3N integrates input from multiple second-order taste neurons. These studies provide the first glimpse into circuits for bitter processing in the higher brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated how different bitter taste inputs are processed in the brain to guide behavior. We took advantage of highly specific genetic tools and a wide range of behavioral assays, representing a systematic and rigorous approach to answering this question. Optogenetic experiments revealed that bitter neurons in different organs elicit broad and highly overlapping effects on behavior, suggesting that these inputs converge onto common downstream pathways. However, we also observed behavioral differences that suggest that these inputs are ‘selectively integrated’ – downstream pathways may selectively or preferentially receive input from certain bitter neuron subsets. Transsynaptic tracing of second-order pathways supported this interpretation, revealing that bitter neurons in different organs connect to overlapping second-order pathways, but with biased connectivity.</p><p>To begin to understand how second-order bitter neurons integrate sensory input and regulate behavior, we characterized a new type of second-order bitter neuron, mlSEZt. We found that mlSEZt neurons receive convergent input from multiple organs and regulate a subset of taste-related behaviors. mlSEZt cells transmit feedforward inhibition to the SLP, and this information is then relayed to several areas including the SMP, lateral horn, and mushroom body. mlSEZt is one of the only types of second-order bitter neurons that has been functionally studied in the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohra et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, our studies of downstream circuits from mlSEZt are the first to uncover third- and fourth-order taste pathways in the higher brain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Roles of bitter neuron subsets</title><p>Conventional models have proposed that taste neurons in different organs have distinct behavioral roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dethier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott, 2018</xref>). We were therefore surprised to find that activating bitter neurons within the leg, labellum, or pharynx had broad and largely overlapping effects on behavior. Activating bitter neurons in any of the three organs suppressed proboscis extension and feeding, enhanced locomotor speed and turning, and elicited innate aversion. Neurons in the leg and labellum also elicited learned aversion. These results imply that bitter inputs from different organs converge in the brain to drive a common set of aversive behaviors. However, the effects of different neuronal subsets were not identical. For example, activating pharyngeal bitter neurons elicited stronger innate aversion than leg or labellar (S-a + I-a) neurons, but the latter two subsets elicited stronger learned aversion than pharyngeal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Differences like these cannot be explained by technical issues such as the number of neurons activated or strength of <italic>Gal4</italic> expression. Together these results suggest a model in which downstream pathways selectively integrate different bitter inputs, enabling specific organs to preferentially regulate certain aspects of behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The strong similarities between the effects of bitter neurons in different organs contrast with studies of sugar taste. Sugar neurons in different organs have different effects on locomotion, feeding responses, and egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thoma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, there are specific differences between the roles of sugar and bitter neurons within an organ. For example, pharyngeal bitter neurons strongly regulate proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas pharyngeal sugar neurons do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). These findings suggest that inputs for appetitive and aversive tastes may be integrated in fundamentally different ways. Perhaps organ-specific roles for appetitive tastes are needed to generate the appropriate sequence of motor actions during feeding, whereas aversive behaviors are more general. It may be adaptive for any organ to be capable of driving nearly any type of aversive response.</p><p>We were also curious whether different subsets of bitter neurons within the same organ would show similar or distinct behavioral effects. Due to limitations in driver lines available when we initiated this study, we only compared two such subsets: labellar neurons belonging to the S-a + I-a classes versus the S-b class. S-a + I-a neurons drove aversive effects in all behavioral assays tested, whereas S-b neurons had a more limited effect. However, there are fewer S-b neurons (3) than S-a + I-a neurons (13) and the <italic>Gal4</italic> line used to label S-b neurons seemed to be expressed more weakly, limiting our interpretation of these results. Supporting the notion of class-specific behavioral effects, a previous study showed that two types of pharyngeal bitter neurons regulate different aspects of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In general, the existence of multiple bitter neuron classes in each organ, with different tuning profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>), would seem to imply that they have different functional roles. If different classes drive distinct aversive behaviors, this would enable the fly to respond differently depending on which bitter compound is detected. Alternatively, input from different classes may be combinatorially integrated to encode bitter identity. In this case, different compounds could elicit different behavioral responses without each class having a distinct behavioral role.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Second-order pathways for bitter taste processing</title><p>Through transsynaptic tracing, we identified three major second-order pathways that relay bitter input to higher brain areas, which have also been described in other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Snell et al., 2022</xref>). Each pathway receives input from multiple organs, although our experiments do not confirm that different inputs converge onto the same individual cells. Labellar bitter neurons connect to all three projection tracts, whereas tarsal bitter neurons primarily connect to the lateral and mediolateral tracts, and pharyngeal bitter neurons primarily innervate the medial tract. This biased connectivity pattern may provide a neuronal substrate for our behavioral results: different bitter neuron subsets may elicit overlapping but non-identical behavioral effects because they activate overlapping but non-identical second-order taste pathways. For example, bitter neurons in the leg and labellum elicited learning while pharyngeal neurons did not, and this difference may relate to the observation that only leg and labellar neurons connected strongly to the lateral and mediolateral tracts.</p><p>Bitter-sensing neurons in different organs show striking differences in their axonal projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). We were therefore surprised that <italic>trans</italic>-Tango labeling did not reveal any obvious pathways receiving input from just one organ. In the sugar-sensing circuit, several organ-specific pathways have been identified. IN1 interneurons in the SEZ receive sugar input specifically from the pharynx and regulate sugar ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>). A set of sugar-responsive serotonergic neurons in the SEZ receives input from the labellum, but not the leg, and regulates sugar intake and insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yao and Scott, 2022</xref>). Some tarsal sugar-sensing neurons arborize in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>) and activate leg-specific ascending neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), one of which regulates egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The new type of second-order bitter neuron that we characterized, mlSEZt, receives bitter input from both the leg and labellum. This is also the case for the only other second-order bitter projection neuron that has been previously studied, TPN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Bitter inputs from multiple organs are thus integrated at the first synapse, at least within certain second-order pathways. Aside from cross-organ integration, mlSEZt neurons do not show significant transformations of bitter encoding: their taste selectivity, response dynamics, and experience-dependent modulation closely resemble responses in sensory neurons. It will be interesting to compare bitter encoding across different second-order neurons. Different second-order pathways may convey different features of the taste stimulus, perhaps analogous to the parallel ‘what’ and ‘where’ pathways in the visual and auditory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee, 2013</xref>). For example, different second-order neurons may transmit the bitter ON versus OFF response, thus encoding the start and end of the stimulus. Certain neurons may encode bitter identity while others integrate multiple taste inputs to encode the overall taste valence.</p><p>How do individual types of second-order bitter neurons contribute to behavior? Activating mlSEZt neurons revealed that they regulate feeding responses and turning but not locomotor speed, innate preference, or learning. The behaviors not affected by mlSEZt neurons may be regulated by other pathways, and one possibility is that different pathways strictly control different behaviors. This has been suggested in the mammalian taste system, in which a cortico-amygdalar projection regulates licking behavior but is dispensable for reporting the identity of the stimulus in a discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, distinct pathways in the olfactory system mediate innate versus learned odor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bear et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin and Lin, 2019</xref>). Having separate pathways for different behavioral responses allows a circuit to readily modulate individual behaviors depending on context or state.</p><p>Alternatively, different second-order pathways may have overlapping behavioral roles. Perhaps different pathways encode different features of the stimulus, as discussed above, and this information is combined downstream in specific ways appropriate for regulating each behavior. In support of this combinatorial model, we found that different bitter-sensing neurons elicited overlapping behavioral effects even when they had largely non-overlapping projection targets. Tarsal bitter neurons mainly project to the lateral and mediolateral second-order pathways, whereas pharyngeal bitter neurons mainly project to the medial pathway, but both subsets strongly affected feeding responses, locomotor speed, and turning. In addition, activation of either mlSEZt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) or TPN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) suppresses proboscis extension, representing parallel second-order pathways with common behavioral roles. Thus, different second-order pathways may converge downstream to regulate common behaviors. In support of this model, many neurons downstream of mlSEZt (the mediolateral tract) project to the SMP (the target of the medial tract), suggesting potential convergence. Moreover, one of the 3Ns downstream of mlSEZt, aSP-g3, receives input from multiple second-order taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taisz et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Third- and fourth-order taste pathways</title><p>The population of second-order taste neurons has only recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Talay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Snell et al., 2022</xref>), and almost nothing is known about how taste information is processed further downstream. To gain insight into downstream bitter processing, we traced neural circuits downstream of mlSEZt cells. We first observed that mlSEZt cells connect to each other, and these are mainly unidirectional connections suggestive of hierarchical interactions. Because mlSEZt cells are GABAergic, specific mlSEZt cells likely inhibit other mlSEZt cells and gate their ability to transmit feedforward information. It will be interesting to determine how this motif shapes information flow, and whether mlSEZt cells representing the sources and targets of these connections have different response properties. Interestingly, the mlSEZt subtype providing the strongest connections to other mlSEZt cells provides the weakest connections to top 3Ns, suggesting a division of labor between lateral and feedforward output from mlSEZt cells.</p><p>Different mlSEZt cells also show different connectivity patterns to 3Ns, suggesting that parallel subcircuits may exist downstream of the mlSEZt population. 3Ns represent a broad set of neurons targeting the SLP, SIP, and nearby regions such as the lateral horn. Because mlSEZt neurons are inhibitory, 3Ns should be inhibited by bitter taste and may therefore represent neurons promoting appetitive behaviors. Several 3Ns are likely to process olfactory information, suggesting that they integrate smell and taste inputs. As mentioned above, at least one 3N receives input from multiple second-order taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taisz et al., 2022</xref>). It will be interesting to determine what kinds of taste input it integrates and whether second-order to 3N convergence is a common feature of the circuit.</p><p>While 3Ns mainly target a few brain regions, 4Ns project more broadly. 4Ns include mlSEZt cells, indicating the presence of feedback circuits that may facilitate or dampen mlSEZt transmission. 4Ns include neurons likely to participate in olfactory processing, again suggesting cross-talk between olfactory and taste pathways. Many of the top 4Ns project to the lateral horn and mushroom body, regions that mediate innate and learned olfactory processing, respectively. 90% of top 4Ns project to the SMP, a region that contains neurosecretory cells that regulate feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nässel and Zandawala, 2020</xref>). 4Ns also include several neurons that regulate egg-laying, suggesting that mlSEZt may convey bitter information to modulate egg-laying decisions. Flies have been shown to display either a preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joseph and Heberlein, 2012</xref>) or aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dweck et al., 2021</xref>) for laying eggs on bitter substrates, which may depend on the substrate composition or context. The activity of the egg-laying neuron oviDNb, one of three oviDNs in the 4N population, reflects the sugar concentration of the substrate and displays a rise-to-threshold signal that drives egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vijayan et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, oviDNs are poised to integrate multiple types of taste input to control egg-laying behavior.</p><p>Aside from oviDNs, the population of 4Ns that we analyzed (those receiving ≥20 synapses from the 3N population; 322 cells) included only one other descending neuron, DNp32. This suggests that additional layers of processing occur before mlSEZt input reaches neurons controlling locomotor behaviors. We identified the turning neuron DNa02 as a fifth-order neuron. While descending neurons control leg and body movements, motor neurons controlling proboscis movements and food consumption are located in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>), a region not included in the hemibrain connectome. Future analyses of whole-brain connectome datasets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) should enable us to identify connections between mlSEZt cells and motor neurons controlling feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Principles of sensory integration</title><p>Within a single taste modality, whether and how different channels of taste input are integrated has been largely unexplored, especially for aversive tastes. Our results show that bitter inputs from different organs are integrated early in the circuit and drive an overlapping, but not identical, set of behaviors. It will be interesting to determine whether similar principles govern the integration of taste input in other taste modalities and other organisms. Humans and other mammals have taste neurons in multiple locations, including three distinct areas of the tongue, the soft palate, pharynx, and internal organs such as the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Depoortere, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Travers and Nicklas, 1990</xref>). Moreover, mammalian bitter-sensing cells in the tongue show heterogeneous responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caicedo and Roper, 2001</xref>) and express different combinations of bitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>), similar to flies, suggesting the presence of different functional classes.</p><p>It will also be interesting to compare principles of taste processing and integration with other sensory systems. Like taste, the olfactory system contains well-defined sensory input channels. Because odors activate overlapping ensembles of sensory cells, inputs across the population must be integrated to determine odor identity and behavior, and this begins to occur at the second synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Groschner and Miesenböck, 2019</xref>). However, certain channels of olfactory information may represent ‘labeled-line’ circuits that are processed separately from other inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haverkamp et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanosensory system similarly contains well-defined input channels that detect specific stimulus features (e.g., indentation or vibration), suggesting that these channels could potentially mediate distinct aspects of touch perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that inputs from different mechanosensory types are integrated, beginning at the first synapse, to create mixed representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Emanuel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chirila et al., 2022</xref>). Uncovering when and how sensory circuits integrate different inputs, and how this relates to perception and behavior, lies at the core of understanding how we interpret signals from the world.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The arena contains a circular chamber with a glass cover, and flies are filmed from above using a USB camera (Point Grey). The infrared light for illumination and the red (627 nm) LED array for optogenetic stimulation are located just beneath the chamber. Each quadrant of the arena has an inlet for air flow, allowing for odor delivery, and air is removed through a vacuum port at the center of the arena. We did not use air flow for locomotor or innate preference assays. 20–30 flies were tested per trial. Flies were loaded into the chamber using mouth aspiration and were given at least 3 min to habituate before the experiment started. Flies were filmed at 30 frames/s.</p><p>For learning experiments using odor, 400 mL/min air was split into two streams that each flowed to one pair of opposing quadrants and could be odorized independently. Each stream was odorized by flowing air through bottles containing odor dilutions. Each stream was then split again to provide input to two opposing quadrants, representing a flow rate of 100 mL/min air into each quadrant. The odors used were 3-octanol (1:1000) and 4-methylcyclohexanol (1:750). Odors were diluted in mineral oil and 2 mL of each odor solution was pipetted onto a piece of thick filter paper (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #88615) placed inside of a glass odor bottle (Cole-Parmer, #EW-99535-16).</p><p>The effects of taste neuron activation on locomotion and innate preference were assayed sequentially in the same flies. To quantify locomotor effects, light stimulation was presented for 5 s. Flies were filmed for &gt;1 min before stimulation and 2 min after stimulation, although only the 5 s prior to stimulation was used to quantify baseline behavior. Each of the three light intensities was delivered to the same flies in increasing order of intensity, with several minutes between stimulations to ensure that the behavior had recovered. After an additional rest period, the same flies were then tested for innate preference by delivering low intensity light stimulation to two opposing quadrants for 30 s. The flies then had a 30 s rest period without light, followed by low intensity light stimulation in the other two quadrants for 30 s. Switching the light quadrants ensured that we could assess light preference independently of any spatial bias. This protocol was then repeated sequentially with medium and high intensity light.</p><p>To test learned odor preference, the CS+ odor was presented in all quadrants for 1 min along with light stimulation. Light stimulation started 5 s after odor valve opening and was delivered in 1 Hz pulses, following the protocol used in previous learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>). After a 1 min rest, the CS- odor was presented alone for 1 min. Following a 1 min rest, the CS+ and CS- odors were simultaneously delivered to different sets of opposing quadrants for 1 min, allowing the flies to choose between the odors. After another 1 min rest, the two odors were presented again for 1 min but the odor quadrants were switched to control for any spatial bias. Which odor was used as the CS+ or CS- was counterbalanced across trials. The light intensity used for learning experiments was 30 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Fly videos were analyzed using FlyTracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eyjolfsdottir et al., 2014</xref>), which quantified the position, forward velocity, and angular velocity of each fly at each time point. FlyTracker output was further analyzed in MATLAB to quantify preference for light or odor and to generate the traces shown in the figures. Preference index (PI) values were quantified in 1 s bins and calculated as (# flies in light quadrants – # flies in non-light quadrants)/total # flies. PI for the conditioned odor was calculated similarly as (# flies in CS + quadrants – # flies in CS- quadrants)/total # flies. Forward and angular velocities were averaged over 0.33 s bins (10 frames). To quantify locomotor changes at light onset, we averaged forward or angular velocity over the first 1 s of light presentation and compared these values to baseline values averaged over the 4 s preceding light onset. To quantify the change in speed after light stimulation, we averaged forward velocity over a 5 s period following light offset and compared it to the same baseline (pre-light) value described above. For statistical analyses of these data, each trial was considered to be a single data point (‘n’). Further analyses are described below in the ‘Statistical analyses’ section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunostaining and validation of expression patterns</title><p>Immunostaining experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>).

All images were processed using Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Calcium imaging was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devineni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>). Flies were taped on their backs to a piece of clear tape in an imaging chamber. For proboscis taste stimulation, fine strands of tape were used to restrain the legs, secure the head, and immobilize the proboscis in an extended position. For leg taste stimulation, the two forelegs were immobilized using tape and parafilm with the distal segment exposed. An imaging window was cut on the anterior surface of the head, the antennae were removed, and the esophagus was cut. The brain was immersed in modified artificial hemolymph in which 15 mM ribose is substituted for sucrose and trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Images were acquired using a two-photon laser scanning microscope (Ultima, Bruker) equipped with an ultra-fast Ti:S laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent) that is modulated by pockel cells (Conoptics). The excitation wavelength was 925 nm. Emitted photons were collected with a GaAsP photodiode detector (Hamamatsu) through a 60X water-immersion objective (Olympus). Images were acquired using the microscope software (PrairieView, Bruker). A single plane was chosen for imaging in each experiment. For most experiments, images were acquired at 256 by 256 pixels with a scanning rate of 3–4 Hz. The resolution was decreased and scanning rate was increased to ~6–7 Hz for experiments using repeated taste stimulation.</p><p>Tastants were delivered to the labellum or foreleg as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devineni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, we used a custom-built solenoid pinch valve system controlled by MATLAB software via a data acquisition device (Measurement Computing). Solenoid pinch valves (Cole Parmer) were opened briefly (~10 ms) to create a small liquid drop at the end of a 5 µL glass capillary, positioned such that the drop would make contact with the labellum or leg. Tastants were removed by a vacuum line controlled by a solenoid pinch valve. Proper taste delivery was monitored using a side-mounted camera (Veho VMS-004). Five s taste stimulation was used for all experiments. At least three trials of each stimulus were given to each fly. Other than experiments explicitly using repeated taste stimulation, at least 1 min rest was given between trials to avoid habituation. Tastants were used at the following concentrations: 10 mM quinine, 10 mM denatonium, 100 mM caffeine, 25 mM L-canavanine, and 100 mM sucrose.</p><p>Calcium imaging data were analyzed using MATLAB code from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devineni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>). Images were registered within and across trials to correct for movement in the x-y plane using a sub-pixel registration algorithm. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually. Average pixel intensity within the ROI was calculated for each frame. The average signal for 20 frames preceding stimulus delivery was used as the baseline signal, and the ∆F/F (change in fluorescence divided by baseline) for each frame was then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Connectome analysis</title><p>mlSEZt neurons in the connectome were identified using NeuPrint Explorer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuprint.janelia.org">https://neuprint.janelia.org</ext-link>), an online interface for searching the connectome data. Neuron morphology images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> were generated by NeuPrint Explorer. Connectivity analyses were performed using Python scripts to query the database. 3Ns (201 cells, including mlSEZt cells) were defined as neurons receiving at least three synapses from at least one mlSEZt neuron. Top 3Ns (32 cells) were defined as non-mlSEZt neurons receiving at least 20 total synapses from the mlSEZt population. 4Ns (1743 cells) were identified as neurons receiving at least three synapses from at least one top 3N, but we focused on strong 4Ns that receive at least 20 synapses from the top 3N population (322 cells) and also identified the top 30 4Ns that receive the strongest input (≥96 synapses). Graphs showing the distribution of connection strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F and I</xref>, top) represent data for all 3Ns (201 cells) or the strong 4Ns (322 cells). Graphs showing the brain regions targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F and I</xref>, bottom) represent data for the top 3Ns or 4Ns (32 or 30 cells, respectively). Brain regions can be viewed on NeuPrint Explorer and are based on the nomenclature in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito et al., 2014</xref>. The five 3Ns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref> represent examples of the top five cell types receiving the strongest total mlSEZt input (based on number of synapses), and they each receive input from at least four mlSEZt cells (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The five 4Ns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref> represent examples of the top cell types that receive the strongest total input from top 3Ns (based on number of synapses) and also receive input from at least three 3Ns (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, Version 9. Statistical tests and results are reported in the figure legends. Two groups were compared using paired or unpaired t-tests. More than two groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test comparing experimental flies to each control. All graphs represent mean ± SEM. Sample sizes are listed in the figure legends. No explicit power analyses were used to determine sample sizes prior to experimentation. Minimum sample sizes were decided prior to experimentation based on previous experience or pilot experiments revealing how many samples are typically sufficient to detect reasonable effect sizes. Additional samples were sometimes added if the initial results were inconclusive or more variable than expected, but never with the intent to make a non-significant p-value significant or vice versa. In general, the experimenter was not explicitly blinded to genotype during experimentation.</p><p>To generate the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the effects of activating bitter neuron subsets were compared to the effect of activating all bitter neurons. For each genotype and behavioral parameter, one-way ANOVAs were used to determine if there was an effect at any light intensity. If so, the strength of the effect was quantified by comparing the maximal effect at any intensity to the maximal effect observed with activating all bitter neurons. To do this, the difference between experimental flies and each control genotype was quantified, and the smaller of the two differences was used as a measure of the experimental effect. A strong or moderate effect was defined as an effect at least 80% or 40%, respectively, of the maximal value. Statistically significant effects that were less than 40% of the maximal value were defined as weak effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, behavioral experiments; brain dissections and immunostaining</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, connectome analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, behavioral experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, behavioral experiments; brain dissections and immunostaining</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, behavioral experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, behavioral experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, behavioral experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, brain dissection and immunostaining; calcium imaging</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84856-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data files for experiments and code for connectome analyses are publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/avdevineni/taste-activation">https://github.com/avdevineni/taste-activation</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:91689d997655e34f68b209f135f4ad6f1214e7ec;origin=https://github.com/avdevineni/taste-activation;visit=swh:1:snp:c5fe184904eaf3485cd09a15f4e450239ff22195;anchor=swh:1:rev:920e0cd3d5d03b02e30faa3129e0d2d6b7dad8d6">swh:1:rev:920e0cd3d5d03b02e30faa3129e0d2d6b7dad8d6</ext-link>).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Richard Axel for his generous support and helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alex C Keene (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that the work in its current form will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that the topic of the study is of general interest, they also felt that the work does not reach the level of significance and novelty expected for an <italic>eLife</italic> article. Specifically, the reviewers find that the study is divided into two parts. The first part is overall convincing, but does not offer sufficient advances beyond the current understanding and literature in the field. The second part has potential and contains some very interesting data. Unfortunately, the reviewers felt that the data of this part are too preliminary at this point. The reviewers discussed several possibilities to help you improve your study given its potential. First, they recommend shortening and re-organizing the manuscript and center it on part two of the study. Second, they recommend strengthening the second part with additional experiments and controls. We hope that the detailed reviews below will be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Deere et al. combine optogenetics, behavioral analysis and calcium imaging methods to carefully study the effects of bitter neuron activation on different body parts on behavior. While activation of bitter neurons in different organs drives mostly the same behavior, they find a few subtle differences in behavioral output upon neuronal activation between pharynx and labellum, for instance. Using trans-tango labeling and a split-Gal4 line the authors aim to explain their findings. The data are of high quality and contain interesting information for people in the field.</p><p>Line 155: The authors state that sugar neuron activation drives a stronger behavioral effect in starved as compared to fed flies. Given that the authors are comparing the two systems, it would be nice to add a possible explanation. For instance, this would suggest that hunger state modulates behavioral responses to sugar later in processing, but this is not/less the case for bitter.</p><p>Line 196: it would be interesting to hear and include the authors' interpretation of this result and what it says about the underpinning circuits.</p><p>Line 217ff: these are nice results and confirm previous observations, but it is unclear how far they support or fit into the narrative. I encourage the authors' to consider removing this part to make the paper a bit leaner and straight forward, and to present it only in the context of the next paragraph.</p><p>Line 241ff: the data indicates that the subset that diverges most is the labellar subset S-b. The authors talk about differences in expression levels and are careful to not compare the subsets directly. On the other hand, they plot the data in the same graphs so that one automatically compares them, but ok. I am a little worried about cell number. You are activating 13/19 vs. 3/19. As you state in the discussion, these number differences could explain the behavioral effects rather than being of different subtypes. To make it easier for the reader, it might be better to move the S-b data into the supplements and remove them from the comparison in the main figure to essentially compare legs vs. labellum vs. pharynx. If you carry out this comparison, then it's evident that the only difference is seen for learned odor preference (pharynx activation does not induce it). This makes perfect sense looking at the trans-tango data (no connections to higher brain centers, which I find very interesting).</p><p>Line 299ff: the trans-tango data are very nice, but have the authors considered integrating available EM data, e.g. from Neuprint, into their study? Such data could be used to trace the circuits further downstream. It would also help to test their main conclusion with other means, i.e. projection neurons integrate bitter taste from multiple organs. Is this true for other bitter/taste projection neurons?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>It is surprising that the activation of the bitter projection neuron does not induce learning. What are the connections of these neurons in higher brain regions?</p><p>Your data are of very high quality and very convincing. I am, however, not quite convinced by the interpretation.</p><p>Looking at the data, I see that pharynx induces different behaviors (in particular learning) than the other subsets. Your trans-tango data provides a possible explanation. Your other data suggest that, indeed, leg and labellum drive very similar behavior (with perhaps the exception of 'post-light locomotion). This also fits to the trans-tango data overall.</p><p>Therefore, it is difficult for me to follow your conclusion, e.g. abstract: 'These results suggest that different bitter inputs are selectively integrated early in the circuit, enabling the pooling of sensory information, and the circuit then diverges into multiple pathways that may have different behavioral roles.'</p><p>Given the high quality of your data, I suggest condensing the manuscript and perhaps focussing on the differences between pharynx and the other neurons a little more. Moreover, using more inactivation experiments could be helpful, too, to distinguish the differences between these subsets in the different behaviors you study. Finally, the paper is divided into two parts, and I am not convinced that the sugar neuron data is needed for the second part and vice versa. It might make sense to split the manuscript into two.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors tackle a particularly interesting question of how multiple taste cues from the same modality are integrated to form a behavioral response. The manuscript is scientifically sound, with well controlled experiments. The authors rely on optogenetic manipulations to define behavioral responses to different subsets of neurons. The field has tended to rely on relatively simple behavioral responses, such as PER, and a strength of this manuscript is the detailed characterization of locomotor behavior, learning, and reflexive feeding. This systematic characterization of bitter responsive neurons will be broadly useful to the field. In addition, the identification of second order neurons that selectively regulate PER provides a platform for studying integration. A number of concerns are noted that are readily addressable. First, there is a reliance on optogenetics that may not reflect the temporal or spatial patterns of natural compounds. The impact of the paper may be greater if these experiments were complemented with naturally occurring compounds. Second, as written much of the manuscript is descriptive, focusing on aspects that have previously been explored (such as the opposing valances of bitter and sugar neurons). Streamlining this part of the manuscript will make the significance more accessible. Overall, this manuscript provides a valuable resource for understanding how bitter tastants are coded, and will be of broad interest to groups researching sensory processing and behavioral regulation.</p><p>1. The paper focuses on the complexity of taste coding, however, it does not firmly establish why the optogenetic approach is needed. There are many limitations to this approach, including the fact that the subsets of neurons, and their temporal activation may not reflect those induced by food. Additional justification of the use of this system is important.</p><p>2. The conclusions of Figure 2 are unclear. One possibility is that the activation of bitter neurons induces locomotion, which results in less time on those quadrants. The other is that they are actively avoiding the quadrant. Without addressing this, it is not clear what this adds to the conclusions beyond the data presented in Figure 1.</p><p>3. The conclusion of the first four figures are factors that sweet and bitter neurons have oppositional valance, and that sugar is more potentially modulated by a huger state than bitter taste. These have been well described throughout the literature in multiple systems. At the authors' discretion, I suggest streamline these as it will make the novel aspects of the manuscript more accessible.</p><p>4. Are the GAL4 lines used to characterize distinct subsets of neurons exclusively expressed in these body regions or preferentially expressed in them? I presume the former, but it would be valuable to reference this and/or show expression if it has not been thoroughly described across all regions.</p><p>5. It would be helpful to directly compare subsets of sweet and bitter second order neurons in figure 7 to gain insight into whether the circuit design is shared between the tastants.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. In numerous cases the justification for the experimental approach is unclear. For example line 246 states 'We focused on bitter taste for these studies.' It would be helpful to know why the bitter taste was chosen over sweet.</p><p>2. The introduction is very well written and frames the question of how tastants are detected. However, the focus primarily on the sweet and bitter modalities, and discusses how these are sensed by Grs. The complexity described includes the more recent descriptions of other modalities and new classes of gustatory receptors. It seems important to describe these as well in order to convey how the complexity of the system that is being dissected.</p><p>3. Line 43 says 'like other sensory systems…' but the focus of the introduction is almost exclusively on taste. Much of this can be streamlined, and it would be helpful to add comparisons for context. For example, questions of sensory integration and combinatorial receptor activation have been addressed in much greater detail for olfaction and this may be worth mentioning.</p><p>4. Line 109: It's not clear what the first sentence means. Most tastes are likely to be feeding related. Is the point that most studies have used taste response to food components?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Deere et al. characterizes the behavior effects of optogenetic activation of sugar and bitter sensing GRNs. While activation of sugar-sensitive GRNs causes a brief decrease in locomotion, activation of bitter-sensitive GRNs increases locomotor activity in flies. Furthermore, the impact of sugar-GRN activation, but not bitter-GRN activation, is enhanced by food deprivation. The authors, also showed, pairing neutral odors with optogenetic activation of sugar-GRNs or bitter-GRNs can induce positive or negative valence to neutral odors in preference experiments in subsequent trials. After characterizing behavioral effects of optogenetic manipulation of sugar and bitter GRNs, the authors next focus on activation of bitter-sensing GRNs in different organs and discuss the differences and similarities between their behavioral effects. The authors observe some overlap between the behavior effects elicited by bitter-sensing GRN activation in different organs, legs, pharynx, labellum, etc. therefore they hypothesized bitter GRNs might share the same downstream neural circuits. Using transsynaptic labeling, they identified a group of neurons that receive input from different bitter sensing neurons, the mlSEZt neurons, and they showed that mlSEZt neurons showed ON and OFF responses to bitter tastant s but not sugar using calcium imaging. Interestingly, the response dynamics of mlSEZt neurons show different responses to bitter compounds, and the ON response of mlSEZt neurons habituated faster than the OFF response in response to repeated stimulation.</p><p>Overall, this is a promising study, however, I have some major technical concerns about the way experiments have been conducted. Without having some clarification of GRN activity during optogenetic activation and anatomical characterization of the GRN drivers used in the study, it is hard to interpret what the results mean.</p><p>1. In all of the optogenetic activation experiments, the authors are using constant light stimulation. Previous papers (Inagaki 2014, Nature Methods) have shown that constant light stimulation causes suppression of action potentials in GRNs. Hence, it is not clear how the stimulus protocols used in the manuscript are impacting GRN activity. Authors need to show that either GRNs are actually activated and not shut down by the prolonged optogenetic stimulation protocols they used, via electrophysiology or calcium imaging. Alternatively, they can change their activation protocols by shortening the stimulus period or using pulses of light instead of constant light activation. Without having some evidence, the GRNs are actually active during the periods of optogenetic activation, it is hard to interpret the results of the experiments in Figure 1-5.</p><p>2. For sugar-GRN activations, it would be good to use another sugar-GRN, such as Gr5a to confirm Gr64f results.</p><p>3. In figure 5, the authors are activating subsets of bitter-GRNs and measuring the effects of optogenetic stimulations in various behaviors. I would like to see the expression patterns of GRN drivers used in these experiments in flies expressing Chrimson. Chrimson transgene used in these experiments has a Td-tomato tag, so authors can stain for this transgene and show us exactly which neurons they are stimulating. Without detailed anatomical characterization of the driver lines used in the experiments, it is again hard to interpret the results.</p><p>4. See comment #2. The same concern here as Figure 5. Please show the expression pattern of the source GAL4s that are used for transsynaptic labeling. Without knowing the GRN expression, we can't interpret the results of downstream neurons.</p><p>5. In figure 8, are the ON and OFF responses of mlSEZt neurons displayed by arbors of the same neurons, or different neurons? I.e., is there any internal difference between different mlSEZt neurons, in terms of their response dynamics to bitter compounds?</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. In Figure 8 – —figure supplement 1C and D, it is better to include a diagram encircling the region of ROI in the brain. The arrows in Figure 8D are unclear.</p><p>2. For the experiments that involved optogenetic activation of both sugar sensing and bitter sensing neurons, how could you know that the behavior effect is not influenced by the possible different GAL4 expression levels of sugar sensing and bitter sensing GAL4 lines?</p><p>3. In Figure 1 – —figure supplement 1, there should be '(D)' in the last figure.</p><p>4. In Figure 8, adding experiments with Gr66a-lexA &gt; CsChrimson, mlSEZt-Split (the cleanest line) &gt; TNT might be helpful in figuring out whether mlSEZt neurons are necessary for the locomotor responses, innate and learned preference. Also, as a negative control, Gr5a-lexA &gt; CsChrimson, mlSEZt-Split &gt; TNT can be tested if reagents are available.</p><p>5. In Figure 8G, angular velocity significantly increases with high led intensity. Would it be possible to use higher led intensity to make sure that all mlSEZt populations are activated?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Selective integration of diverse taste inputs within a single taste modality&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As previously stated, the data is of high quality, and the results are convincing. The new results including the connectomics analysis are very interesting and integrate the findings in early sensory processing with higher-order processing.

Here are some issues that still remain.</p><p>Issues to be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>1. The images are too small in Figure 1C. I suggest making three columns: One for the labellum only, one for the legs only, and one for the pharynx only. For the labellum column, authors can zoom in to the labellum, and for the pharynx, they can only zoom in to the pharynx. It will make the results in 1D clearer. As it is, neurons are not clearly visible.</p><p>2. Figure 2D, I don't see the point of plotting opto-ctrl and getting negative values; I think it is easier to plot ctrl-opto and plot positive values rather than negative values. Nothing will change, except the plots will look better, in my opinion. Right now, it is confusing to see negative values. Same argument for Figure 2G. Also, some of the negative controls seem to have a high variance. Did the authors test for ANOVA and compare all controls and test animals with each other statistically? If yes, please indicate statistical significance in the plots.</p><p>3. I think Figure 6 is missing the VNC expression. Many leg neurons project to the VNC, showing only the brain Trans-tango signal is misleading.</p><p>4. I don't think there is any reason for 9 figures.

There is no experiment showing direct synaptic connectivity to bitter neurons. They can say bitter downstream neurons or show synaptic connectivity via EM or GRASP.</p><p>6. Authors use a 'dirty' GAL4 for functional imaging experiments rather than the 'clean' split line. I think it might be better to use the cleaner split-GAL4 for functional imaging since many neurons are labeled in SEZ and hard to know which neurons' projections are recorded during imaging.</p><p>7. Effects on behavior upon silencing or activating the clean split are much weaker. I think functional imaging is essential to demonstrate these are the real downstream bitter neurons.</p><p>8.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reviewers agree that the topic of the study is of general interest, they also felt that the work does not reach the level of significance and novelty expected for an eLife article. Specifically, the reviewers find that the study is divided into two parts. The first part is overall convincing, but does not offer sufficient advances beyond the current understanding and literature in the field. The second part has potential and contains some very interesting data. Unfortunately, the reviewers felt that the data of this part are too preliminary at this point. The reviewers discussed several possibilities to help you improve your study given its potential. First, they recommend shortening and re-organizing the manuscript and center it on part two of the study. Second, they recommend strengthening the second part with additional experiments and controls. We hope that the detailed reviews below will be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ perspective, and we have completely reworked the manuscript to address their comments and build a stronger story. This includes removing many experiments that the reviewers did not think were sufficiently novel or relevant, and adding many new results to strengthen and expand the story. We have made the following major revisions:</p><p>1) The paper now focuses entirely on the bitter pathway; all experiments with sugar neurons have been removed. Moreover, the paper focuses from the very beginning on the core question of how different bitter inputs are processed. Figures 1-4 of the original paper no longer exist in their previous form.</p><p>2) We have conducted new experiments using a high-resolution feeding assay (the optoPAD). Previously we only used proboscis extension as a simple readout of feeding initiation. The new experiments are important for testing more naturalistic feeding behavior in freely moving flies, as well as analyzing detailed parameters of feeding.</p><p>a) We activated bitter neuron subsets, and the results were consistent with our previous data using proboscis extension: all subsets strongly suppressed feeding, with certain feeding parameters affected more than others (Figure 2B-D).</p><p>b) We silenced bitter neuron subsets in the presence of natural bitter taste, which some reviewers asked for. In contrast to the activation experiments, silencing generally did not produce statistically significant effects compared to genetic controls (Figure 2E-G). Together with the activation data, these results support a model in which different bitter neuron subsets act in a parallel and largely redundant manner to regulate aversive behaviors.</p><p>c) We activated or silenced second-order mlSEZt neurons (Figure 8D-E). mlSEZt activation suppressed feeding, and we observed effects on certain feeding parameters (e.g. sip duration) but not others (e.g. number of sips). mlSEZt silencing did not have a significant effect. These findings suggest that mlSEZt cells suppress specific aspects of feeding behavior but act in parallel with other second-order bitter pathways, creating redundancy in the circuit.</p><p>3) We have presented control experiments to address concerns about the Gal4 lines and neuronal activation protocols.</p><p>a) Reviewers 2 and 3 asked about the specificity of Gal4 lines targeting bitter neuron subsets. We now emphasize that all of these Gal4 lines have been extensively characterized in previous studies, and we show our own images confirming their organ-specific expression (Figure 1C).</p><p>b) We have added new experiments to address concerns regarding the stimulation protocol, described further in our responses to specific reviewer comments (see below).</p><p>4) Given the reviewers’ interest in the second part of the paper, which focuses on downstream bitter pathways, we have expanded this part of the study. We reorganized the figures to bring some of the supplemental imaging experiments into the main figures, as they provide insight into how mlSEZt encodes taste, and we have added many new results:</p><p>a) We performed additional behavioral experiments with mlSEZt suggested by Reviewer 3. First, we tested the effect of higher intensity activation on locomotion, which revealed similar effects as the lower intensities. Second, we silenced mlSEZt while activating bitter-sensing neurons. We found that mlSEZt is not required for bitter neurons to affect locomotion, preference, or learning, as expected from the inability of mlSEZt activation to elicit these behaviors.</p><p>b) We used co-labeling experiments to show that mlSEZt cells are GABAergic, revealing that they transmit feedforward inhibition to the SLP. This has implications for the circuit analysis below.</p><p>c) We traced the neural circuits downstream from mlSEZt neurons using two methods, <italic>trans</italic>Tango and connectome analysis. These studies revealed that bitter information from mlSEZt cells is first processed in the SLP and SIP before being relayed to other areas, including the SMP, lateral horn, mushroom body, and descending neurons. There are strong interconnections between mlSEZt cells and feedback connections from third-order neurons to mlSEZt cells, suggesting extensive local processing. Several downstream neurons are poised to integrate bitter information with olfactory input, and at least one neuron integrates input from different second-order taste neurons. There are also connections to oviDN neurons that use sweet taste input to regulate egg-laying decisions, suggesting that they integrate sugar and bitter inputs. These studies are the first to uncover third- and fourth-order taste pathways in the higher brain.</p><p>Overall, we believe that these revisions have resulted in a much stronger manuscript that should reach the level of significance expected for <italic>eLife</italic>. It is striking how little is known about central taste processing in flies, and our study provides several new insights that will have broad interest to the field. This includes: (1) discovering that bitter neurons in different organs drive largely overlapping behaviors, which challenges the conventional model, (2) revealing principles of taste circuit connectivity at the first synapse, (3) characterizing the response properties and behavioral role of a new type of second-order bitter neuron, which remains one of the only second-order taste neurons to be studied, and (4) revealing circuits for taste processing in the higher brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Deere et al. combine optogenetics, behavioral analysis and calcium imaging methods to carefully study the effects of bitter neuron activation on different body parts on behavior. While activation of bitter neurons in different organs drives mostly the same behavior, they find a few subtle differences in behavioral output upon neuronal activation between pharynx and labellum, for instance. Using trans-tango labeling and a split-Gal4 line the authors aim to explain their findings. The data are of high quality and contain interesting information for people in the field.</p><p>Line 155: The authors state that sugar neuron activation drives a stronger behavioral effect in starved as compared to fed flies. Given that the authors are comparing the two systems, it would be nice to add a possible explanation. For instance, this would suggest that hunger state modulates behavioral responses to sugar later in processing, but this is not/less the case for bitter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all results related to sugar neuron activation and fed vs. starved comparisons, so this comment no longer applies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 196: it would be interesting to hear and include the authors' interpretation of this result and what it says about the underpinning circuits.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment refers to results with sugar neuron activation, which have been removed from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 217ff: these are nice results and confirm previous observations, but it is unclear how far they support or fit into the narrative. I encourage the authors' to consider removing this part to make the paper a bit leaner and straight forward, and to present it only in the context of the next paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these results from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 241ff: the data indicates that the subset that diverges most is the labellar subset S-b. The authors talk about differences in expression levels and are careful to not compare the subsets directly. On the other hand, they plot the data in the same graphs so that one automatically compares them, but ok. I am a little worried about cell number. You are activating 13/19 vs. 3/19. As you state in the discussion, these number differences could explain the behavioral effects rather than being of different subtypes. To make it easier for the reader, it might be better to move the S-b data into the supplements and remove them from the comparison in the main figure to essentially compare legs vs. labellum vs. pharynx. If you carry out this comparison, then it's evident that the only difference is seen for learned odor preference (pharynx activation does not induce it). This makes perfect sense looking at the trans-tango data (no connections to higher brain centers, which I find very interesting).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data would be cleaner if we ignore S-b activation, but we think it would be misleading to relegate that data to the supplemental figures without a strong rationale. We do not have strong evidence that the weak S-b effects are solely due to the low cell number; for example, pharyngeal activation using <italic>Gr9a-Gal4</italic> only labels one cell and yet had a very strong effect on many behaviors.</p><p>To draw conclusions about the functions of different organs (e.g. in the text and Figure 5B model), we are considering the S-a + I-a labellar data rather than the S-b data, just as the reviewer suggests. We think this is justified because positive results are more informative than negative results.</p><p>We agree that the difference in behavior and connectivity for the pharynx versus the other organs is interesting. We have added a sentence to make the point that the reviewer mentions (lines 636-638): “For example, bitter neurons in the leg and labellum elicited learning while pharyngeal neurons did not, and this difference may relate to the observation that only leg and labellar neurons connected strongly to the lateral and mediolateral tracts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 299ff: the trans-tango data are very nice, but have the authors considered integrating available EM data, e.g. from Neuprint, into their study? Such data could be used to trace the circuits further downstream. It would also help to test their main conclusion with other means, i.e. projection neurons integrate bitter taste from multiple organs. Is this true for other bitter/taste projection neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The NeuPrint (hemibrain) connectome, which is the only publicly available annotated connectome, does not include the SEZ, where bitter-sensing axons arborize. Thus, we cannot use the connectome to analyze connectivity to second-order neurons. We added a sentence mentioning this (lines 285-287).</p><p>However, we have now used the connectome to trace downstream circuits from mlSEZt neurons, as described above and shown in Figure 9. These studies reveal that input from mlSEZt cells is first processed in the SLP and SIP before being relayed to other areas, including the SMP, lateral horn, mushroom body, and descending neurons. We identified hierarchical interconnections between mlSEZt cells, prominent feedback circuits, downstream neurons that are poised to integrate olfactory and taste input, and neurons controlling egg-laying that may integrate sweet and bitter input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>It is surprising that the activation of the bitter projection neuron does not induce learning. What are the connections of these neurons in higher brain regions?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have now conducted extensive studies to identify downstream circuits from mlSEZt neurons. Postsynaptic partners of these neurons are primarily confined to the SLP and SIP. Moving one synapse downstream, we do observe connections to the mushroom body (the learning and memory center), but not to PPL1 dopamine neurons that convey bitter reinforcement signals during learning. The absence of these connections may relate to the inability of mlSEZt to elicit learned aversion, and we have pointed this out in the text (lines 533-536).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Your data are of very high quality and very convincing. I am, however, not quite convinced by the interpretation.</p><p>Looking at the data, I see that pharynx induces different behaviors (in particular learning) than the other subsets. Your trans-tango data provides a possible explanation. Your other data suggest that, indeed, leg and labellum drive very similar behavior (with perhaps the exception of 'post-light locomotion). This also fits to the trans-tango data overall.</p><p>Therefore, it is difficult for me to follow your conclusion, e.g. abstract: 'These results suggest that different bitter inputs are selectively integrated early in the circuit, enabling the pooling of sensory information, and the circuit then diverges into multiple pathways that may have different behavioral roles.'</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our conclusions have not been presented clearly. In our view, the similarities between the three organs (they all affect proboscis extension, feeding, locomotion, and positional aversion) are more striking than the differences. However, we agree that the differences are important too, and we repeatedly mention them. Perhaps the level of similarity versus difference is a matter of interpretation (a glass half-full versus half-empty scenario), and by carefully laying out the results (e.g. the table in Figure 5A) the reader can form their own interpretation.</p><p>We believe that our conclusions are fully compatible with the reviewer’s interpretation. By saying that “different bitter inputs are selectively integrated early in the circuit”, we mean that these inputs are integrated within some pathways (e.g. all three organs project to the medial tract), but not every pathway must receive input from all organs. We refer to this as “selective integration”, and we have created a new diagram (Figure 5B) to visually depict this model. We have also added more explanations in the text to describe it. For example (lines 270-276):</p><p>“These results generally support an integrative model of taste processing (Figure 1B, left) in which bitter inputs from different organs converge onto common downstream pathways to drive a diverse set of aversive behaviors. However, the fact that not all neuronal subsets elicited all behaviors, or preferentially elicited some behaviors over others, suggests that some downstream pathways may receive selective or preferential input from specific bitter-sensing cells. We refer to this model as “selective integration” (Figure 5B), and it lies in between the two models shown in Figure 1B.”</p><p>The example that the reviewer mentions regarding the pharynx is the most clear case where a behavioral difference may be attributable to a difference in connectivity, and we have added a sentence to explicitly describe this point (lines 636-638).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the high quality of your data, I suggest condensing the manuscript and perhaps focussing on the differences between pharynx and the other neurons a little more. Moreover, using more inactivation experiments could be helpful, too, to distinguish the differences between these subsets in the different behaviors you study. Finally, the paper is divided into two parts, and I am not convinced that the sugar neuron data is needed for the second part and vice versa. It might make sense to split the manuscript into two.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions, we have removed all of the sugar neuron data. We have also removed much of the basic characterization of bitter neuron activation (e.g. comparing starved versus fed) in order to focus on the role of different bitter neuron subsets.</p><p>In addition, we have added inactivation experiments where we silenced each subset of bitter neurons in a feeding assay (Figure 2E-G). We did not expect that this would have a strong effect because each subset alone is capable of suppressing feeding, suggesting that they act redundantly. Our results support this model: silencing bitter neuron subsets had relatively small and generally nonsignificant effects. We note that pharyngeal silencing showed the strongest trend toward increased feeding (lines 183-184), suggesting that there may be a stronger requirement for the pharynx than other organs.</p><p>We have not performed inactivation experiments with the other behaviors because this would require setting up new behavioral paradigms; our current setups only allow light stimulation. We would need to test natural bitter compounds and verify what kind of locomotor changes, preference, and learning they normally drive. We feel that setting up new assays is beyond the scope of this study. More importantly, our Gal4 lines do not allow us to silence 100% of bitter neurons in any given organ, and we do not anticipate observing strong effects by only partially silencing each organ (which is supported by our results in the feeding assay). This is the primary reason why we took the activation approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors tackle a particularly interesting question of how multiple taste cues from the same modality are integrated to form a behavioral response. The manuscript is scientifically sound, with well controlled experiments. The authors rely on optogenetic manipulations to define behavioral responses to different subsets of neurons. The field has tended to rely on relatively simple behavioral responses, such as PER, and a strength of this manuscript is the detailed characterization of locomotor behavior, learning, and reflexive feeding. This systematic characterization of bitter responsive neurons will be broadly useful to the field. In addition, the identification of second order neurons that selectively regulate PER provides a platform for studying integration. A number of concerns are noted that are readily addressable. First, there is a reliance on optogenetics that may not reflect the temporal or spatial patterns of natural compounds. The impact of the paper may be greater if these experiments were complemented with naturally occurring compounds. Second, as written much of the manuscript is descriptive, focusing on aspects that have previously been explored (such as the opposing valances of bitter and sugar neurons). Streamlining this part of the manuscript will make the significance more accessible. Overall, this manuscript provides a valuable resource for understanding how bitter tastants are coded, and will be of broad interest to groups researching sensory processing and behavioral regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments. We have completely reworked the manuscript to streamline the sections that the reviewer felt are too descriptive and not sufficiently novel. First, we removed all data regarding the sugar neurons, as these results are not directly relevant to the rest of the paper. Second, we now present the activation of all bitter-sensing neurons as merely a control to analyze the effects of bitter neuron subsets, rather than presenting these results as novel findings. These results are no longer described in separate figures.</p><p>Regarding the optogenetic approach and testing natural compounds, please see our response to point #1 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The paper focuses on the complexity of taste coding, however, it does not firmly establish why the optogenetic approach is needed. There are many limitations to this approach, including the fact that the subsets of neurons, and their temporal activation may not reflect those induced by food. Additional justification of the use of this system is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added some additional justification to the text (lines 121-128). We have several reasons for taking the activation approach, as opposed to performing neuronal silencing while flies taste natural bitter compounds:</p><p>1) Our goal was to test which behaviors can be driven by each subset of bitter neurons, rather than which subsets are required for behavior. The former question (addressed by neuronal activation) should reveal which neurons are connected to which behavioral circuits, even if different neurons have redundant functions. The latter question (addressed by neuronal silencing) will only reveal behavioral effects if neurons do not have redundant functions.</p><p>2) Related to the point above: Our Gal4 lines do not label 100% of the bitter neurons in any given organ. We would not expect to observe strong effects using neuronal silencing if there are still some functional bitter neurons in each organ, since redundant functions are very likely. Indeed, our new feeding experiments support this: we see very strong effects with neuronal activation and weak, nonsignificant effects with silencing.</p><p>3) The activation approach allows us to target neurons within any organ and precisely control the timing and duration of the stimulus. Conversely, presenting freely moving flies with natural bitter taste means that we cannot control which organs are stimulated, nor the stimulus timing/ duration. For example, if flies do not ingest the substrate then pharyngeal neurons will never be stimulated, and we cannot assess whether pharyngeal neurons are capable of driving behavior. How each organ samples bitter under natural conditions and which organs are required for each behavior are interesting questions, but ones that we plan to address in future studies.</p><p>We completely agree that optogenetic activation may not recapitulate natural activation, but this is a limitation of all optogenetic activation studies. For this reason, we first activated the entire population of bitter-sensing neurons and ensured that the behavioral effects are consistent with what we expect from previous studies of bitter taste. The concordance between natural and optogenetically evoked behaviors suggests that we are not activating bitter neurons in a totally unnatural way. We have also added new data using a different activation protocol: we compared the effect of continuous and 50 Hz pulsed light stimulation, and the behavioral effects were nearly identical (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C-D and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). These results suggest that the behavioral effects we observe are not specific to a particular stimulation protocol.</p><p>Finally, we have complemented our activation approach with inactivation experiments for one type of behavior, feeding. The weak effects of neuronal silencing, as compared with the very strong effects of neuronal activation, support the idea that bitter neurons function redundantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The conclusions of Figure 2 are unclear. One possibility is that the activation of bitter neurons induces locomotion, which results in less time on those quadrants. The other is that they are actively avoiding the quadrant. Without addressing this, it is not clear what this adds to the conclusions beyond the data presented in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 1 and 2 no longer exist in their previous form, so we are not sure if the reviewer would still have the same concern. In the revised manuscript, the effects of activating all bitter neurons are no longer presented as novel results; they are simply a control to test activation of bitter subsets.</p><p>We completely agree that positional aversion and locomotor stimulation could be linked, as we discussed in the original text. However, they are still very different behaviors displayed over different timescales, and it is possible that an active choice process contributes to positional aversion. It is not obvious that each bitter neuron subset should have identical effects in both assays, so we think it is reasonable to test their effects separately even if the results do end up being correlated. (Other behavioral measures we test are also intrinsically correlated, such as proboscis extension and feeding.) We have edited the text to include this rationale (lines 230-234).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The conclusion of the first four figures are factors that sweet and bitter neurons have oppositional valance, and that sugar is more potentially modulated by a huger state than bitter taste. These have been well described throughout the literature in multiple systems. At the authors' discretion, I suggest streamline these as it will make the novel aspects of the manuscript more accessible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this entire section of the paper and incorporated the bitter neuron results into other figures. All sugar neuron results have been removed as well as comparisons between hunger states. The paper now begins with the activation of bitter neuron subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are the GAL4 lines used to characterize distinct subsets of neurons exclusively expressed in these body regions or preferentially expressed in them? I presume the former, but it would be valuable to reference this and/or show expression if it has not been thoroughly described across all regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The Gal4 lines have been thoroughly characterized in previous studies, and they are exclusively expressed in either the leg, labellum, or pharynx. We cited the references in the original text but we have now edited the text to be more explicit about the specificity of these lines (lines 135-139). We have also added our own images confirming the organ specificity of expression (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It would be helpful to directly compare subsets of sweet and bitter second order neurons in figure 7 to gain insight into whether the circuit design is shared between the tastants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be interesting, but this has already been done by Snell et al. (<italic>Curr Biol</italic>, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. In numerous cases the justification for the experimental approach is unclear. For example line 246 states 'We focused on bitter taste for these studies.' It would be helpful to know why the bitter taste was chosen over sweet.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for a lack of clarity, and we have tried to ensure that the justification for each experiment is clearly described. In the revised manuscript, we have rewritten the Introduction to justify why we are studying bitter taste. We first describe the known functional diversity of sweet and bitter neurons (within and across organs). We then describe the overall question (how different inputs within a modality are processed) and previous work on the sugar pathway, which supports the segregated processing model. Finally, we discuss how very few studies have addressed this question in the bitter pathway, creating a gap in knowledge that we aim to fill.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The introduction is very well written and frames the question of how tastants are detected. However, the focus primarily on the sweet and bitter modalities, and discusses how these are sensed by Grs. The complexity described includes the more recent descriptions of other modalities and new classes of gustatory receptors.

While activation of sugar-sensitive GRNs causes a brief decrease in locomotion, activation of bitter-sensitive GRNs increases locomotor activity in flies. Furthermore, the impact of sugar-GRN activation, but not bitter-GRN activation, is enhanced by food deprivation. The authors, also showed, pairing neutral odors with optogenetic activation of sugar-GRNs or bitter-GRNs can induce positive or negative valence to neutral odors in preference experiments in subsequent trials. After characterizing behavioral effects of optogenetic manipulation of sugar and bitter GRNs, the authors next focus on activation of bitter-sensing GRNs in different organs and discuss the differences and similarities between their behavioral effects. The authors observe some overlap between the behavior effects elicited by bitter-sensing GRN activation in different organs, legs, pharynx, labellum, etc. therefore they hypothesized bitter GRNs might share the same downstream neural circuits. Using transsynaptic labeling, they identified a group of neurons that receive input from different bitter sensing neurons, the mlSEZt neurons, and they showed that mlSEZt neurons showed ON and OFF responses to bitter tastant s but not sugar using calcium imaging. Interestingly, the response dynamics of mlSEZt neurons show different responses to bitter compounds, and the ON response of mlSEZt neurons habituated faster than the OFF response in response to repeated stimulation.</p><p>Overall, this is a promising study, however, I have some major technical concerns about the way experiments have been conducted. Without having some clarification of GRN activity during optogenetic activation and anatomical characterization of the GRN drivers used in the study, it is hard to interpret what the results mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We believe that our responses below, in combination with new experiments and data, should fully address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In all of the optogenetic activation experiments, the authors are using constant light stimulation. Previous papers (Inagaki 2014, Nature Methods) have shown that constant light stimulation causes suppression of action potentials in GRNs. Hence, it is not clear how the stimulus protocols used in the manuscript are impacting GRN activity. Authors need to show that either GRNs are actually activated and not shut down by the prolonged optogenetic stimulation protocols they used, via electrophysiology or calcium imaging. Alternatively, they can change their activation protocols by shortening the stimulus period or using pulses of light instead of constant light activation. Without having some evidence, the GRNs are actually active during the periods of optogenetic activation, it is hard to interpret the results of the experiments in Figure 1-5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important issue to consider. We first want to clarify that prolonged light stimulation is only a concern for the locomotion (5 sec stimulation) and innate aversion (30 sec stimulation) experiments. The learning experiments used 1 Hz light pulses, and the PER and feeding experiments used short light stimulations (1-1.5 sec). In addition, for locomotion assays we are primarily assessing changes at light onset (first 1 sec).</p><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now conducted experiments using 50 Hz pulsed light stimulation to activate all bitter-sensing neurons in the locomotor and choice assays (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C-D and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). The behavioral effects of continuous versus pulsed activation were nearly identical, implying that continuous light activation does effectively activate the neurons. The same was true for sugar neurons, although these results are not included now that we are only focusing on bitter taste: either continuous or pulsed stimulation elicited the same behaviors.</p><p>In addition, it would be strange that we observed behavioral effects throughout the light stimulation period if the neurons were not actually activated. For 30 sec choice experiments, in no case does the level of aversion decrease during the stimulus period (Figure 4B-C), as would be expected if the neurons are shut down, and in most cases the aversion continuously increases.</p><p>We note that for the choice and learning experiments, we are emulating the exact protocols published by Aso and colleagues, whose results are highly regarded in the field (Aso et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014; Aso and Rubin, <italic>eLife</italic> 2016). Continuous 30 sec stimulation during choice assays also appears to be the protocol used to validate the effect of Chrimson in the original Chrimson paper (Klapoetke et al., 2014, Supp. Figure 16), as they do not mention anything about light pulses. In these papers, continuous 30 sec stimulation produced behavioral effects for a variety of neurons, including olfactory sensory neurons, olfactory projection neurons, bitter-sensing neurons, and mushroom body output neurons.</p><p>Finally, we note that the previous study mentioned by the reviewer (Inagaki et al., 2014) used a different optogenetic effector, ReachR. ReachR and Chrimson are derived from distinct opsins and are known to have different properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For sugar-GRN activations, it would be good to use another sugar-GRN, such as Gr5a to confirm Gr64f results.</p></disp-quote><p>All sugar neuron data have been removed from the paper, so this comment no longer applies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In figure 5, the authors are activating subsets of bitter-GRNs and measuring the effects of optogenetic stimulations in various behaviors. I would like to see the expression patterns of GRN drivers used in these experiments in flies expressing Chrimson. Chrimson transgene used in these experiments has a Td-tomato tag, so authors can stain for this transgene and show us exactly which neurons they are stimulating. Without detailed anatomical characterization of the driver lines used in the experiments, it is again hard to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that detailed anatomical characterization of the Gal4 lines is essential, and this characterization was performed by the previous studies we cited (Weiss et al., 2011; Ling et al., 2014; Chen and Dahanukar, 2017). They did the painstaking work of characterizing the presence or absence of expression in every labellar or tarsal sensilla and every cell type within the pharynx. We have also added our own images verifying the expression patterns of these lines, confirming that each line is expressed within only one of the three organs (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. See comment #2. The same concern here as Figure 5. Please show the expression pattern of the source GAL4s that are used for transsynaptic labeling. Without knowing the GRN expression, we can't interpret the results of downstream neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these images (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). We observed the expected Gal4 expression patterns, with neurons in different organs showing different projection patterns that have been previously characterized (Kwon et al., 2014).</p><p>For further transparency, we have also added additional examples of <italic>trans</italic>-Tango staining for each line; this shows the consistency (and slight variability) between labeling in different brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In figure 8, are the ON and OFF responses of mlSEZt neurons displayed by arbors of the same neurons, or different neurons? I.e., is there any internal difference between different mlSEZt neurons, in terms of their response dynamics to bitter compounds?</p></disp-quote><p>We wish that we could compare the responses of different mlSEZt neurons, but this was not feasible because (1) the projections of different neurons are intermingled in the SEZ and SLP, and (2) the cell bodies did not show bitter responses. We think it is likely that the same cells generate both ON and OFF responses because this is the situation for bitter sensory neurons as well as downstream PPL1 dopaminergic neurons (Devineni et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. In Figure 8 – —figure supplement 1C and D, it is better to include a diagram encircling the region of ROI in the brain. The arrows in Figure 8D are unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an image showing the ROIs (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the experiments that involved optogenetic activation of both sugar sensing and bitter sensing neurons, how could you know that the behavior effect is not influenced by the possible different GAL4 expression levels of sugar sensing and bitter sensing GAL4 lines?</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments have been removed from the paper, so this comment no longer applies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1 – —figure supplement 1, there should be '(D)' in the last figure.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure has been reorganized, so this comment no longer applies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 8, adding experiments with Gr66a-lexA &gt; CsChrimson, mlSEZt-Split (the cleanest line) &gt; TNT might be helpful in figuring out whether mlSEZt neurons are necessary for the locomotor responses, innate and learned preference. Also, as a negative control, Gr5a-lexA &gt; CsChrimson, mlSEZt-Split &gt; TNT can be tested if reagents are available.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed new experiments testing whether mlSEZt neurons are required for the effects of bitter neuron activation on locomotion, innate choice, and learning (Figure 8 —figure supplement 3). We did not expect that mlSEZt neurons would be required because their activation generally does not impact these behaviors. Indeed, none of the locomotor or preference behaviors were affected by mlSEZt silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 8G, angular velocity significantly increases with high led intensity. Would it be possible to use higher led intensity to make sure that all mlSEZt populations are activated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed these experiments (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2D). Using an even higher light intensity (44 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) elicited an increase in angular velocity, similar to the previously tested “high intensity” (35 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>) stimulation. This result strengthens the evidence that mlSEZt neurons do exert a real effect on turning, and we have modified the text accordingly so that we are not downplaying this result. The higher intensity still did not affect forward velocity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please address all reviewer comments with a detailed response and/or changes to the manuscript text and figures.

As previously stated, the data is of high quality, and the results are convincing. The new results including the connectomics analysis are very interesting and integrate the findings in early sensory processing with higher-order processing. Moreover, the new optoPAD data including neuronal inhibition is helpful to make the point of functional redundancy and, in combination with the later results, highlights a difference in redundancy at different levels of behavioral performance and learning.</p><p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns related to the first submission of this work in full. I am satisfied with their responses. In particular, I believe the paper in its current, more streamlined form is easier and more interesting to read after the removal of some of the data including the data on sugar sensing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments and for helping us improve the paper!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My previous comments have been addressed. Here are some issues that still remain.</p><p>Issues to be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>1. The images are too small in Figure 1C. I suggest making three columns: One for the labellum only, one for the legs only, and one for the pharynx only. For the labellum column, authors can zoom in to the labellum, and for the pharynx, they can only zoom in to the pharynx. It will make the results in 1D clearer. As it is, neurons are not clearly visible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the figure as suggested. We now show the labellum and pharynx separately, and images of all three organs have been cropped and enlarged to make the neurons more visible.</p><p>As an aside, we want to clarify that in Figure 1D, the classes and numbers of neurons labeled in each organ are based on previous studies that thoroughly characterized these Gal4 lines (Weiss et al., 2011; Ling et al., 2014; Chen and Dahanukar, 2017). This is stated in the figure legend. Our images confirm that each line is expressed in the correct organ-specific pattern and the cell numbers are similar, but we have not rigorously quantified the number and subtypes of labeled neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2D, I don't see the point of plotting opto-ctrl and getting negative values; I think it is easier to plot ctrl-opto and plot positive values rather than negative values. Nothing will change, except the plots will look better, in my opinion. Right now, it is confusing to see negative values. Same argument for Figure 2G.</p></disp-quote><p>To us, the most important thing is to show the direction of the effect and to keep the convention consistent across figures. The effects of activating or silencing all bitter neurons go in opposite directions, so one of these two experiments is going to have a negative value regardless of whether we choose to plot opto-ctrl or ctrl-opto. It is true that more of the Gal4 lines show an effect with activation rather than silencing, hence more negative bars than positive bars, but either way the reader is going to need to interpret negative bars somewhere in the figure.</p><p>In choosing between opto-ctrl or ctrl-opto, we find opto-ctrl to be more intuitive since we consider the control to be the reference point, which should be subtracted. We understand that others may have a different opinion, but we believe the reader will be able to interpret the data either way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, some of the negative controls seem to have a high variance.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have learned that individual flies are highly variable in this assay! Even without optogenetic stimulation, flies choosing between two identical food sources often have a strong preference for one food or the other. Any optogenetic manipulations must override this innate variability in order to produce an effect. For each experiment we tested a minimum of 40 flies per genotype, which is a similar or higher number than other papers that used this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors test for ANOVA and compare all controls and test animals with each other statistically? If yes, please indicate statistical significance in the plots.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, for every feeding parameter the experimental flies were compared to both controls by one-way ANOVA. All significant effects are denoted with asterisks. We decided not to add “n.s.” to all nonsignificant bars to avoid cluttering up the figure, as was stated in the legend: “Experimental effects not labeled with an asterisk are not significant”. This is the same convention we used in the other behavior figures.</p><p>We have now edited the legend to be more explicit: “For each feeding measure, experimental flies were compared to both controls, and effects not labeled with an asterisk are not significant.” If the reviewer feels that “n.s.” needs to be added to each nonsignificant bar then we can add this, but we thought the lack of significance is implied by the lack of an asterisk (and stated in the legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I think Figure 6 is missing the VNC expression. Many leg neurons project to the VNC, showing only the brain Trans-tango signal is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Although certain types of tarsal gustatory neurons are known to arborize within the VNC (e.g. sugar-sensing and pheromone-sensing cells), previous studies suggest that tarsal bitter-sensing neurons pass through the VNC without making synaptic arborizations there (Kwon et al., 2014). For this reason, we chose to focus on second-order pathways in the brain and did not stain the VNC for trans-Tango expression. Nevertheless, we agree that this is a limitation that we should acknowledge explicitly, and we have added two sentences to that effect (lines 291-294).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I don't think there is any reason for 9 figures. Figures 5-6 can be combined or shown as supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We see the reviewer’s point, and initially we also were reluctant to include 9 figures. However, we believe that the current organization works best for conveying the story by ensuring that each figure contains a conceptually linked set of data. We agree that Figures 5 and 6 are small enough to be combined, but they are conceptually quite different and it might be confusing to combine them. Keeping them separate should not present an extra burden to the reader since we are presenting the same number of panels either way.</p><p>We know that the majority of readers do not look at the supplemental figures, so we are reluctant to put anything critical in the supplement. Even if it is just a summary/model like Figure 5, it is important to understanding the story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I think it is too strong to say mlSEZt neurons are second-order bitter neurons. There is no experiment showing direct synaptic connectivity to bitter neurons. They can say bitter downstream neurons or show synaptic connectivity via EM or GRASP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to address this concern. In the Results section where we first characterize mlSEZt, we now state (lines 383-388):</p><p>“Together, these results strongly suggest that the mlSEZt neurons labeled by <italic>R29F12-Gal4</italic> are second-order bitter neurons: they have an identical morphology to second-order bitter neurons labeled by <italic>trans</italic>-Tango, their projections overlap with the axon terminals of bitter-sensing neurons, and they show clear bitter responses. We will therefore refer to mlSEZt neurons as second-order bitter neurons, although it is formally possible that they are downstream bitter neurons that are not directly connected to bitter-sensing cells.”</p><p>In the Abstract and earlier parts of the text that readers will encounter before getting to this section, we have modified the wording to refer to mlSEZt as a “downstream” or “putative second-order” bitter neuron. We hope that these modifications, taken together, ensure that the language reflects the strength of the evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Authors use a 'dirty' GAL4 for functional imaging experiments rather than the 'clean' split line. I think it might be better to use the cleaner split-GAL4 for functional imaging since many neurons are labeled in SEZ and hard to know which neurons' projections are recorded during imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we initially performed functional imaging using the less specific R29F12 line, we also performed imaging using the cleaner split-Gal4 line. This experiment is shown in Figure 7 —figure supplement 2C and mentioned in the text (lines 408-410). The neurons labeled in the clean line respond to bitter taste and show the same dynamics as the less specific line.</p><p>In addition, we are confident that we are imaging the correct neurons even in the “dirty” R29F12 line. Even though the expression pattern may look dirty when compressed into a maximum intensity projection, when examining expression in all three dimensions it is clear that the mlSEZt projections in the relevant SEZ or SLP regions do not overlap with other neurons. Our functional imaging methods allow for high spatial resolution in all three dimensions (using two-photon imaging with a 60X objective). We are able to unequivocally identify mlSEZt cells based on their morphology and trace their projections into the SEZ or SLP. To convey this to the reader, we have added back a sentence that was removed in the previous version (lines 338-339): “The projections of mlSEZt neurons in the SEZ and SLP could be clearly identified based on their location and morphology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Effects on behavior upon silencing or activating the clean split are much weaker. I think functional imaging is essential to demonstrate these are the real downstream bitter neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have imaged the mlSEZt neurons in the clean split-Gal4 line and shown that they respond to bitter taste (Figure 7 —figure supplement 2C). We agree that it is critical to know that these neurons are bitter-responsive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 9 is interesting, but it is not super relevant without really demonstrating whether mlSEZt neurons respond to bitter compounds. Also hard to demonstrate, the putative mLSEZt neurons they found in EM data are really mLSEZt neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have shown that the mlSEZt neurons in the clean split-Gal4 line do respond to bitter taste (Figure 7 —figure supplement 2C).</p><p>Regarding the connectome data, we used both automated and manual searches to identify every neuron with even a vaguely similar morphology to mlSEZt cells, and after manually sorting through hundreds of cells, we are fairly confident that we have identified all neurons that have the correct morphology. Thus, the population of 21 neurons we identified should include the bitter-responsive mlSEZt cells. Moreover, the third-order neurons that we identified using the connectome (Figure 9H) closely resemble the postsynaptic neurons to mlSEZt labeled by trans-Tango (Figure 9B-C), suggesting that we have identified the correct mlSEZt neurons.</p><p>However, it is possible that not all of the 21 cells we identified represent bitter-responsive mlSEZt cells, as we mention in the text (lines 501-502). This is a caveat that needs to be acknowledged, but we don’t think it undermines our overall results given that the population of third-order neurons closely matches the trans-Tango staining, and individual downstream neurons would need to be functionally validated in future studies anyway. In addition, our finding that the 21 putative mlSEZt cells are highly interconnected suggests that most of the downstream neurons we identified are likely to be at least indirectly influenced by true mlSEZt cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revised manuscript has been significantly reorganized to focus on bitter taste. The streamlining of results and inclusion of clarifying data significantly strengthen this manuscript, and further our understanding of bitter taste processing. With these changes, the authors have addressed all of my previous concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and thank the reviewer for helping us improve the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
