germ cells are reprogrammed to form the totipotent embryo. Pioneer transcription factors are essential for remodeling the chromatin and driving the initial wave of zygotic gene expression. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the pioneer factor Zelda is essential for development through this dramatic period of reprogramming, known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). However, it was unknown whether additional pioneer factors were required for this transition. We identified an additional maternally encoded factor required for development through the MZT, GAGA Factor (GAF). GAF is necessary to activate widespread zygotic transcription and to remodel the chromatin accessibility landscape. We demonstrated that Zelda preferentially controls expression of the earliest transcribed genes, while genes expressed during widespread activation are predominantly dependent on GAF. Thus, progression through the MZT requires coordination of multiple pioneer-like factors, and we propose that as development proceeds control is gradually transferred from Zelda to GAF.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells in an organism share the exact same genetic information, yet they still adopt distinct identities. This diversity emerges because only a selection of genes is switched on at any given time in a cell. Proteins that latch onto DNA control this specificity by activating certain genes at the right time. However, to perform this role they first need to physically access DNA: this can be difficult as the genetic information is tightly compacted so it can fit in a cell. A group of proteins can help to unpack the genome to uncover the genes that can then be accessed and activated. While these ‘pioneer factors’ can therefore shape the identity of a cell, much remains unknown about how they can work together to do so. For instance, the pioneer factor Zelda is essential in early fruit fly development, as it enables the genetic information of the egg and sperm to undergo dramatic reprogramming and generate a new organism. Yet, it was unclear whether additional helpers were required for this transition.</p><p>Using this animal system, Gaskill, Gibson et al. identified GAGA Factor as a protein which works with Zelda to open up and reprogram hundreds of different sections along the genome of fruit fly embryos. This tag-team effort started with Zelda being important initially to activate genes; regulation was then handed over for GAGA Factor to continue the process. Without either protein, the embryo died.</p><p>Getting a glimpse into early genetic events during fly development provides insights that are often applicable to other animals such as fish and mammals. Ultimately, this research may help scientists to understand how things can go wrong in human embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>zygotic genome activation</kwd><kwd>maternal-to-zygotic transition</kwd><kwd>pioneer factor</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Melissa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Melissa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Melissa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaskill</surname><given-names>Marissa M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Tyler J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Following fertilization, the pioneering transcription factors GAGA factor (GAF) and Zelda are independently required to reprogram the zygotic genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and activate the first wave of gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pronounced changes in cellular identity are driven by pioneer transcription factors that act at the top of gene regulatory networks. While nucleosomes present a barrier to the DNA binding of many transcription factors, pioneer factors can bind DNA in the context of nucleosomes. Pioneer-factor binding establishes accessible chromatin domains, which serve to recruit additional transcription factors that drive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zaret and Mango, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). These unique characteristics of pioneer factors enable them to facilitate widespread changes in cell identity. Nonetheless, cell-fate transitions often require a combination of pioneering transcription factors to act in concert to drive the necessary transcriptional programs. Indeed, the reprogramming of a specified cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell requires a cocktail of transcription factors, of which Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 function as pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the many examples of multiple pioneer factors functioning together to drive reprogramming, how these factors coordinate gene expression changes within the context of organismal development remains unclear.</p><p>Pioneer factors are also essential for the reprogramming that occurs in the early embryo. Following fertilization, specified germ cells must be rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed to generate a totipotent embryo capable of differentiating into all the cell types of the adult organism. This reprogramming is initially driven by mRNAs and proteins that are maternally deposited into the oocyte. During this time, the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally quiescent. Only after cells have been reprogrammed is the zygotic genome gradually activated. This maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is broadly conserved among metazoans and essential for future development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). Activators of the zygotic genome have been identified in a number of species (zebrafish – Pou5f3, Sox19b, Nanog; mice – Dux, Nfy; humans – DUX4, OCT4; fruit flies – Zelda), and all share essential features of pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is characterized by 13, rapid, synchronous nuclear divisions. Zygotic transcription gradually becomes activated starting about the eighth nuclear division, and widespread transcription occurs at the 14th nuclear division when the division cycle slows and the nuclei are cellularized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). The transcription factor Zelda (Zld) is required for transcription of hundreds of genes throughout zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and was the first identified global genomic activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nien et al., 2011</xref>). Embryos lacking maternally encoded Zld die before completing the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staudt et al., 2006</xref>). Zld has the defining features of a pioneer transcription factor: it binds to nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDaniel et al., 2019</xref>), facilitates chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) and this leads to subsequent binding of additional transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yáñez-Cuna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By contrast to the essential role for Zld in flies, no single global activator of zygotic transcription has been identified in other species. Instead, multiple transcription factors function together to activate zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). Work from our lab and others has implicated additional factors in regulating reprogramming in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Specifically, the enrichment of GA-dinucleotides in regions of the genome that remain accessible in the absence of Zld and at loci that gain accessibility late in ZGA, suggest that a protein that binds to these loci functions with Zld to define cis-regulatory regions during the initial stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). Three proteins, GAGA factor (GAF), chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL proteins (CLAMP), and Pipsqueak (Psq) are known to bind to GA-dinucleotide repeats and are expressed in the early embryo, implicating one or all these proteins in reprogramming the embryonic transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soruco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggin and Tjian, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soeller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lehmann et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>CLAMP was first identified based on its role in targeting the dosage compensation machinery, and it preferentially localizes to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larschan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soruco et al., 2013</xref>). Psq is essential for oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horowitz and Berg, 1996</xref>), and it has been suggested to have a role as a repressor and in chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez-Perez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). GAF, encoded by the <italic>Trithorax-like</italic> (<italic>Trl</italic>) gene, has broad roles in transcriptional regulation, including functioning as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>), repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mishra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busturia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernués et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horard et al., 2000</xref>), and insulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohtsuki and Levine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wolle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaye et al., 2017</xref>). Through interactions with chromatin remodelers, GAF is instrumental in driving regions of accessible chromatin both at promoters and distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada and Hirose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsukiyama and Wu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Judd et al., 2021</xref>). Analysis of hypomorphic alleles has suggested an important function for GAF in the early embryo in both driving expression of <italic>Ultrabiothorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx)</italic>, <italic>Abdominal B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B)</italic>, <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en)</italic>, and <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz)</italic> and in maintaining normal embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>). Given these diverse functions for GAF, and that it shares many properties of a pioneer transcription factor, we sought to investigate whether it has a global role in reprogramming the zygotic genome for transcriptional activation.</p><p>Investigation of the role of GAF in the early embryo necessitated the development of a system to robustly eliminate GAF, which had not been possible since GAF is essential for maintenance of the maternal germline and is resistant to RNAi knockdown in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejarano and Busturia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>). For this purpose, we generated endogenously GFP-tagged GAF, which provided the essential functions of the untagged protein, and used the deGradFP system to deplete GFP-tagged GAF in early embryos expressing only the tagged construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>). Using this system, we identified an essential function for GAF in driving chromatin accessibility and gene expression during the MZT. Thus, at least two pioneer-like transcription factors, Zld and GAF, must cooperate to reprogram the zygotic genome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> following fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GAF binds the same loci throughout ZGA</title><p>To investigate the role of GAF during the MZT, we used Cas9-mediated genome engineering to tag the endogenous protein with super folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) at either the N- or C-termini, sfGFP-GAF(N) and GAF-sfGFP(C), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>). There are two protein isoforms of GAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benyajati et al., 1997</xref>). Because the N-terminus of GAF is shared by both isoforms, the sfGFP tag on the N-terminus labels all GAF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, the two reported isoforms differ in their C-termini, and thus the C-terminal sfGFP labels only the short isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Whereas null mutants in <italic>Trithorax-like</italic> (<italic>Trl</italic>), the gene encoding GAF, are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>), both sfGFP-tagged lines are homozygous viable and fertile. Additionally, in embryos from both lines sfGFP-labeled GAF is localized to discrete nuclear puncta and is retained on the mitotic chromosomes in a pattern that recapitulates what has been previously described for GAF based on antibody staining in fixed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raff et al., 1994</xref>).

We hand sorted homozygous <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> stage 3 (nuclear cycle (NC) 9) and stage 5 (NC14) embryos and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) using an anti-GFP antibody. While alternative splicing generates two GAF protein isoforms that differ in their C-terminal polyQ domain, in the early embryo only the short isoform is detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benyajati et al., 1997</xref>). We confirmed the expression of the short isoform in the early embryo by blotting extract from 0 to 4 hr AEL (after egg laying) N- and C-terminally tagged GAF embryos with an anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The long isoform was undetectable in extract from embryos of both sfGFP-tagged lines harvested 0–4 hr AEL, but was detectable at low levels in extract from <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos harvested 13–16 hr AEL. Thus, we conclude that during the MZT the C-terminally sfGFP-labeled short isoform comprises the overwhelming majority of GAF present in the <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> embryos. We identified 3391 GAF peaks at stage 3 and 4175 GAF peaks at stage 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To control for possible cross-reactivity with the anti-GFP antibody, we performed ChIP-seq on <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> stage 3 and stage 5 embryos in parallel. Since there are no GFP-tagged proteins in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> embryos, any peaks identified with the anti-GFP antibody would be the result of non-specific interactions and excluded from further analysis. No peaks were called in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> dataset for either stage, confirming the specificity of the peaks identified in the <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Further supporting the specificity of the ChIP data, the canonical GA-rich GAF-binding motif was the most highly enriched sequence identified in ChIP peaks from both stages, and these motifs were centrally located in the peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Peaks were identified in the regulatory regions of several previously identified GAF-target genes, including the <italic>heat shock</italic> promoter (<italic>hsp70)</italic>, <italic>even-skipped (eve), Krüppel (Kr), Ubx</italic>, and <italic>en</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggin and Tjian, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmour et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soeller et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Read et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kerrigan et al., 1991</xref>).

A total of 2955 peaks were shared between the two time points, representing 87% of total stage 3 peaks and 71% of total stage 5 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This demonstrates that GAF binding is established prior to widespread ZGA and remains relatively unchanged during early development, similar to what has been shown for Zld, the major activator of the zygotic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). We compared GAF-binding sites we identified in the early embryo to previously identified GAF-bound regions in S2 cells, which are derived from 20 to 24 hr old embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the difference in cell-type and antibody used, 56% (1906) of stage 3 peaks and 43% (1811) of stage 5 peaks overlapped peaks identified in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). It was previously noted that GAF binding in 8–16 hr embryos was highly similar to GAF occupancy in the wing imaginal disc harvested from the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Slattery et al., 2014</xref>), and our data indicate that this binding is established early in development prior to activation of the zygotic genome. Nonetheless, peaks unique to each tissue likely represent GAF-binding events as they are centrally enriched for GA-rich GAF-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, while a majority of GAF-binding sites are maintained in both the embryo and cell culture, a subset of GAF-binding sites is likely tissue specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Maternal GAF is required for embryogenesis and progression through the MZT</title><p>Early embryonic GAF is maternally deposited in the oocyte, and this maternally deposited mRNA can sustain development until the third instar larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>). To investigate the role of GAF during the MZT therefore necessitated a system to eliminate this maternally encoded GAF. RNAi failed to successfully knockdown GAF in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>), and female germline clones cannot be generated as GAF is required for egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejarano and Busturia, 2004</xref>). To overcome these challenges, we leveraged our N-terminal sfGFP-tagged allele and the previously developed deGradFP system to target knockdown at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>). The deGradFP system uses a genomically encoded F-box protein fused to a nanobody recognizing GFP, which recruits GFP-tagged proteins to a ubiquitin ligase complex. Ubiquitination of the GFP-tagged protein subsequently leads to efficient degradation by the proteasome.

This knockdown was robust, as we failed to identify any NC10 - 14 embryos with nuclear GFP signal, and none of the embryos carrying both the deGradFP nanobody and the sfGFP-tagged GAF hatched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on live embryo imaging, the majority of embryos died prior to NC14, indicating that maternal GAF is essential for progression through the MZT. We identified a small number of GFP-expressing, gastrulating escapers. It is unclear if these embryos had an incomplete knockdown of maternally encoded sfGFP-GAF(N), or if a small percentage of embryos survived until gastrulation in the absence of GAF and that the GFP signal was the result of zygotic gene expression. Nonetheless, none of these embryos survived until hatching. Despite being able to maintain a strain homozygous for the N-terminal, sfGFP-tagged GAF, quantitative analysis revealed an effect on viability.

We found that 45% (397) of the down-regulated genes were proximal to a GAF peak. By contrast, only 17% (99) of up-regulated genes are near GAF peaks, similar to the 15% of genes with unchanged expression levels that were proximal to GAF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The significant enrichment for GAF-binding sites proximal to down-regulated genes as compared to up-regulated supports a role for GAF specifically in transcriptional activation (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=1.95, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test).

This analysis suggests that the down-regulated genes identified by RNA-seq are unlikely to be due to a general failure in activating zygotic gene expression, but rather specifically identify genes that depend on GAF for expression. Because zygotic gene expression is required for degradation of a subset of maternal mRNAs, if the genome is not activated, maternal transcripts are not properly degraded and therefore are increased in RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2008</xref>).

While this demonstrates that a subset of genes requires both GAF and CLAMP for proper expression during ZGA, a majority of GAF-regulated genes only depend on GAF for expression, independent of CLAMP. GAF and CLAMP have similar, but not identical binding preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaye et al., 2018</xref>), which is reflected in their partially, but not completely overlapping genome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

We found that sfGFP-GAF(N) levels were unchanged upon <italic>zld</italic> knockdown compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>), demonstrating that neither GAF nor Zld protein levels are affected by the knockdown of the other factor. Based on the roles for Zld and GAF in activating the zygotic genome, we investigated whether these proteins were required to activate distinct or overlapping target genes. We compared genes down-regulated in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos to genes down-regulated when Zld was inactivated optogenetically throughout zygotic genome activation (NC10-14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDaniel et al., 2019</xref>). We identified 135 genes down-regulated in both datasets, comprising 42% of the total number of down-regulated genes dependent on Zld and 15% of the total down-regulated genes dependent on GAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). An even lower degree of overlap is observed when only direct targets are considered with 49 down-regulated targets shared between Zld and GAF, which have 232 and 397 direct targets, respectively. By contrast only 29 up-regulated genes were shared between the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Genes that required both factors for activation include the gap genes previously mentioned (<italic>gt, kni, hkb, Kr, tll</italic>) as well as genes involved in cellular blastoderm formation such as <italic>slow as molasses</italic> (<italic>slam</italic>) and <italic>bottleneck</italic> (<italic>bnk</italic>). While Zld and GAF share some targets, they each are required for expression of hundreds of individual genes.</p><p>Activation of the zygotic genome is a gradual process that initiates with transcription of a small number of genes around NC8. Transcripts can therefore be divided into categories based on the timing of their initial transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lott et al., 2011</xref>). Previous data suggested that while Zld was required for activation of genes throughout the MZT, early genes were particularly sensitive to loss of Zld and that GAF might be functioning later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). To determine when GAF-dependent genes were expressed during ZGA, we took all the genes that could be classified based on their timing of activation during the MZT (as determined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and divided them based on their dependence on Zld and GAF for activation: those down-regulated in both GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> and Zld<sup>CRY2</sup> embryos (Both), those down-regulated only in Zld<sup>CRY2</sup> embryos (Zld<sup>CRY2</sup>), and those down-regulated only in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos (GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Genes activated by Zld, both those regulated by Zld alone (Zld<sup>CRY2</sup>) and those regulated by both Zld and GAF (Both) were enriched for genes expressed early (NC10-11) and Mid (NC12-13). By contrast, 73% of genes activated by GAF alone (GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup>) were expressed either late (early NC14) or later (late NC14) (p=1.3×10<sup>−14</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=3.13, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). This analysis supports a model in which GAF and Zld are essential activators for the initial wave of ZGA and that GAF has an additional role, independent of Zld, in activating widespread transcription during NC14.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The majority of GAF and Zld-binding sites are occupied independently of the other factor</title><p>To further delineate the relationship between Zld- and GAF-mediated transcriptional activation during the MZT, we determined whether GAF binding was dependent on Zld. Not only are a substantial subset of genes dependent on both Zld and GAF for wild-type levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), but 42% of GAF-binding sites at stage 5 are also occupied by Zld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The GAF peaks that are co-bound with Zld include many of the strongest GAF peaks identified at stage 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Zld is known to facilitate the binding of multiple different transcription factors (Twist, Dorsal, and Bicoid), likely by forming dynamic subnuclear hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yáñez-Cuna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dufourt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>).

Mouse H3.3-GFP chromatin was used as a spike-in to normalize for immunoprecipitation efficiency between samples.

This high degree of overlap indicates that our ChIP-seq experiments identified a robust set of high-confidence GAF-bound regions. To determine whether GAF requires Zld for binding, we analyzed GAF occupancy upon <italic>zld</italic> knockdown at this set of 3800 high-confidence peaks. The majority (3674) of these high-confidence GAF peaks were maintained in the <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background and were bound at roughly equivalent levels when normalized to the spike-in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We identified a set of high-confidence Zld peaks, by overlapping the Zld peaks from our control (<italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic>) embryos with previously published data for Zld at NC14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to GAF binding when Zld is depleted, the majority of the 6003 high-confidence Zld peaks were maintained when GAF was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> ChIP data we observed a global reduction in Zld peak heights as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that GAF knockdown causes a global reduction in Zld binding. However, technical, rather than biological differences, may account for this overall decrease (see Materials and methods). Among the high-confidence Zld peaks, DESeq2 identified 105 Zld-binding sites that differed in occupancy between GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos and controls: 86 sites decreased and 19 sites increased.</p><p>Because of the limited number of significantly different peaks identified upon removal of either Zld (3.3% of GAF peaks changed) or GAF (1.7% of Zld peaks changed), we sought to determine whether there were global changes in the distribution of these factors. For this purpose, we ranked peaks in each dataset based on the number of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) and determined if the peak ranks were correlated between the mutant and control. We identified a high degree of correlation in peak rank for both comparisons (Pearson correlation, r = 0.93 for GAF ChIP in <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> and <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N); zld-RNAi</italic> embryos and r = 0.88 for Zld ChIP in <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> and GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Thus, the overall distribution of binding sites is maintained for each factor in the absence of the other.</p><p>At some loci, pioneer factors have been shown to function together to stabilize binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donaghey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>). If either GAF or Zld stabilized genomic occupancy of the other factor, we would expect to identify a loss of binding specifically at loci that are co-bound by both factors. We identified a set of GAF and Zld co-occupied sites by overlapping our high-confidence GAF peaks and high-confidence Zld peaks. Peaks with at least 100 bp overlap were considered to be shared and used for our set of co-bound regions. To test likely direct effects of GAF on Zld occupancy, we determined the number regions that showed significant changes in Zld binding in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos that were bound by GAF. One out of the 86 regions at which Zld binding decreased in the GAF knockdown and 5 out of 19 that increased overlapped with regions bound by GAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Contrary to our expectation if GAF was directly promoting Zld occupancy, there was no enrichment for co-bound regions and those that lost Zld binding. We investigated the reciprocal effect of Zld on GAF occupancy by determining the number regions that showed significant changes in GAF binding in <italic>zld-</italic>RNAi embryos that were also bound by Zld. Fifty-one of the 101 regions that had decreased GAF binding were also bound by Zld, suggesting a potential direct effect of Zld on GAF occupancy at these regions. By contrast, only 6 of the 25 regions that had increased GAF binding were also bound by Zld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). GAF-binding regions that were decreased in the absence of Zld were significantly enriched for co-bound sites as compared to those GAF-binding sites that were maintained upon Zld depletion (p=4.8×10<sup>−5</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=1.19, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). Based on the enrichment for Zld binding at these GAF-bound decreased sites, we hypothesized that Zld might be pioneering chromatin accessibility at these regions to promote GAF binding. Indeed, these regions were enriched for loci that depend on Zld for chromatin accessibility (p=2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=4.07, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test): 38 of the 51 GAF and Zld co-bound sites at which GAF requires Zld for occupancy also require Zld for accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, at this limited set of regions the pioneer factor Zld may function to establish accessible chromatin that is necessary to promote robust GAF binding. Nonetheless, the majority of Zld- and GAF-binding sites are occupied in the absence of the other factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GAF is essential for accessibility at hundreds of loci during ZGA</title><p>GAF interacts with chromatin remodelers and is required to maintain chromatin accessibility in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada and Hirose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsukiyama and Wu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Judd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, GAF-binding motifs are enriched at regions of open chromatin that are established at NC12 and NC13 and that are bound by Zld but do not depend on Zld for accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). To directly test the function of GAF in determining accessible chromatin domains during the MZT, we performed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq on six replicates of single GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> and control (<italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic>) embryos harvested 2–2.5 hr AEL. His2AV-RFP signal for each embryo was visually inspected prior to performing ATAC-seq to ensure that embryos did not have grossly distorted nuclear morphology. In contrast to our control, replicates from the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos showed higher variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that developmental defects caused by the lack of GAF might have lowered our ability to detect subtle changes in accessibility. Nonetheless, we identified 1523 regions with significant changes in accessibility in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to controls; 607 regions lost accessibility and 916 regions gained accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Sites that lost accessibility were among the regions with the highest ATAC-signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). 32% (197) of the regions that lost accessibility were significantly enriched for GAF binding, as determined by stage 5 <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> ChIP-seq, when compared to open regions with no change in accessibility (p=2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=2.4, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The enrichment for GAF-binding sites in those regions that depend on GAF for accessibility suggests that GAF may directly drive accessibility at these regions. Therefore, we focused our analysis on the subset of regions that depend on GAF for accessibility, which we define as those that lost accessibility in the absence of GAF. Consistent with the enrichment of GAF-binding sites in promoters, 45% of all regions that depend on GAF for accessibility were in promoters. Enrichment for promoters was even larger in those regions that were bound by GAF and dependent on GAF for accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, regions that gain accessibility in the absence of GAF are not enriched for promoters, supporting that this is likely an indirect effect of GAF knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>Ubx</italic>, a previously identified embryonic GAF-target gene, is an example of a gene that requires GAF for chromatin accessibility at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Ubx</italic> similarly requires GAF occupancy for gene expression as the transcript was significantly down-regulated in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, GAF binding at the <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter is required for both chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Together, our data demonstrate that GAF is required for chromatin accessibility at hundreds of loci during the MZT, and that this activity occurs preferentially at promoters.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>GAF is required for chromatin accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of regions that change in accessibility in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> controls, stage 5 GAF-sfGFP(C) ChIP-seq was used to identify GAF-bound target regions.

To more broadly investigate how GAF and Zld shape chromatin accessibility during early development, we focused on regions co-occupied by both factors as identified by ChIP-seq (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>).

Only seven of the 1192 regions co-bound by both Zld and GAF decreased in accessibility upon removal of either factor. By contrast, 104 regions require GAF for accessibility and 190 require Zld. Regions that require GAF for accessibility had a higher average GAF ChIP-seq peak height than regions that require Zld. Similarly, the Zld ChIP-seq signal was higher in regions where Zld is necessary for accessibility. Thus, both GAF and Zld are individually required for accessibility at distinct genomic regions co-occupied by both factors, and this requirement is correlated with occupancy as reflected in ChIP-seq peak height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). GAF is also required for accessibility at 83 additional regions at which GAF is bound without Zld (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of sites bound by both Zld and GAF (891) did not change in chromatin accessibility when either factor was removed, suggesting that at these locations GAF and Zld may function redundantly to facilitate chromatin accessibility or that other factors were sufficient to maintain accessibility at these sites. Thus, during the MZT GAF and Zld are individually required for chromatin accessibility at distinct co-bound regions.

By contrast, GAF-binding motifs are enriched at regions that dynamically gain chromatin accessibility later during the MZT at NC12 or NC13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). If Zld preferentially drives chromatin accessibility early in the MZT and GAF is preferentially required later, we would expect that regions that require GAF for accessibility would be enriched for regions that gain accessibility at NC12 and NC13. To test this prediction, we compared our ATAC-seq data to ATAC-seq on embryos precisely staged by nuclear cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). Of the GAF-bound, GAF dependent accessible regions that were identified in the staged ATAC-seq data, three were open by NC11, 17 were newly opened at NC12, and 42 were newly opened at NC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), demonstrating that GAF-bound, GAF-dependent regions are enriched for regions that dynamically open at NC12 or NC13 as compared to regions that are already accessible at NC11 (p=5.7×10<sup>−7</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=3.2, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). Indeed, the <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter dynamically gained accessibility at NC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Confirming that the loss of accessibility observed at late-opening regions was not due to differences in staging between the control (<italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic>) and GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos, the vast majority of sites that gained accessibility at NC13 (2452) were unchanged in accessibility in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to GAF, Zld-bound, Zld-dependent accessible regions were enriched for regions already accessible at NC11: 1182 were open by NC11, 343 were newly opened at NC12, and 244 were newly opened at NC13 (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, log<sub>2</sub>(odds ratio)=2.7, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Together, these analyses show that GAF is preferentially required for chromatin accessibility at regions that gain accessibility over the MZT, while Zld is required for accessibility at regions that are open early.</p><p>The preferential requirement for GAF-mediated accessibility during NC12 and NC13 allowed us to test whether GAF binding preceded the establishment of chromatin accessibility at these regions or whether this accessibility was co-incident with GAF binding. We determined whether the 42 regions that depended on GAF for accessibility and that gained accessibility at NC13 were already bound by GAF at stage 3 (NC9) or whether these regions were among those that were only occupied by GAF at stage 5 (NC14). All 42 of these regions were bound by GAF at stage 3 and stage 5, demonstrating that GAF occupancy at these regions precedes accessibility and supports a role for GAF as a pioneer factor at these regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through a combination of Cas9-genome engineering and the deGradFP system, we have depleted maternally encoded GAF and demonstrated that GAF is required for progression through the MZT.

Distinct from embryos lacking maternal <italic>zld,</italic> a subset of GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos display more intense defects. We identified defects in a subset of GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as early as NC10, which is consistent with our genomics data indicating that GAF is required for proper expression of some of the earliest genes expressed during ZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is possible that some of the phenotypic defects observed in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos are the result of GAF knockdown in the female germline. However, GAF null female germline clones are unable to produce eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejarano and Busturia, 2004</xref>), which stands in contrast to the large number of GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos produced by females expressing sfGFP-GAF(N) and the deGradFP nanobody fusion. Together these phenotypic differences between null mutants and our deGrad-based knockdown along with our genomics data identifying misregulation of previously identified embryonic GAF-targets in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos demonstrate an essential function for GAF in the early embryo.</p><p>Live imaging of GFP-tagged, endogenously encoded GAF demonstrated that GAF is mitotically retained in small foci. This is similar to what was reported for antibody staining on fixed embryos, which showed GAF localized at pericentric heterochromatin regions of GA-rich satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Platero et al., 1998</xref>). Because this prior imaging necessitated fixing embryos, it was unclear if mitotic retention of GAF was required for mitosis. Our system enabled us to determine that in the absence of GAF nuclei can undergo several rounds of mitosis albeit with noticeable defects (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). We conclude that GAF is not strictly required for progression through mitosis. However, the nuclear defects observed in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos support the model that GAF is broadly required for nuclear division and chromosome stability, in addition to its role in transcriptional activation during ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>). Our imaging also identified high nuclear mobility in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to control embryos; nuclei of a subset of embryos showed a dramatic ‘swirling’ pattern of movement (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This defect is potentially due a DNA damage response that inactivates centrosomes to promote nuclear fallout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sibon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takada et al., 2003</xref>), or general disorder in the cytoskeletal network that is responsible for nuclear migration and division in the syncytial embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sullivan and Theurkauf, 1995</xref>). Altogether, our phenotypic analysis of GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos shows for the first time that maternal GAF is required for progression through the MZT, and suggests GAF has an early, global role in nuclear division and chromosome stability.</p><p>In addition to GAF and Zld, the transcription factor CLAMP is expressed in the early embryo and functions in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soruco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urban et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urban et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rieder et al., 2019</xref>). While CLAMP, like GAF, binds GA-dinucleotide repeats, the two proteins preferentially bind to slightly different GA-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaye et al., 2018</xref>). GAF and CLAMP can compete for binding sites in vitro, and, in cell culture, when one factor is knocked down the occupancy of the other increases, suggesting that CLAMP and GAF compete for a subset of binding sites and may have partial functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaye et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrate that GAF, like CLAMP, is essential in the early embryo, indicating that these two GA-dinucleotide-binding proteins cannot completely compensate for each other in vivo during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our sequencing analysis identified that a majority of genes that require GAF for expression are distinct from those that are regulated by CLAMP. Thus, while GAF and CLAMP may have some overlapping functions, they are independently required to regulate embryonic development during the MZT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GAF is necessary for widespread zygotic genome activation and chromatin accessibility</title><p>GAF is a multi-purpose transcription factor with known roles in transcriptional regulation at promoters and enhancers as well as additional suggested roles in high-order chromatin structure. Our analysis showed that during the MZT GAF acts largely as an activator, directly binding and activating hundreds of zygotic transcripts during ZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We identified thousands of regions bound by GAF throughout the MZT, and these regions were preferentially associated with genes whose transcription decreased when maternally encoded GAF was degraded. This function may be driven, in part, through GAF-mediated chromatin accessibility as we identified hundreds of regions that depend on GAF for accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This activity, in both transcriptional activation and mediating open chromatin, is similar to Zld, the only previously identified essential activator of the zygotic genome in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and is shared with genome activators in other species, such as Pou5f3 and Nanog (zebrafish) and Dux (mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). Our data support a pioneer-factor like role for GAF in this process as we demonstrated that GAF is already bound early in the MZT to regions that require GAF for accessibility later. Thus, GAF occupancy precedes GAF-mediated accessibility at a subset of sites.</p><p>In addition to a direct role in mediating chromatin accessibility through the recruitment of chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada and Hirose, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsukiyama and Wu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Judd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>), GAF may also indirectly affect chromatin accessibility through a role in shaping three-dimensional chromatin structure. Sixty-seven percent of the regions that lost chromatin accessibility in the absence of GAF did not overlap a GAF-binding site as identified by ChIP-seq. Thus, at these regions GAF may function indirectly through the ability to facilitate enhancer-promoter loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mahmoudi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melnikova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petrascheck et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, GAF-binding motifs are enriched at TAD boundaries which form during the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hug et al., 2017</xref>), and GAF binding is enriched at Polycomb group dependent repressive loops that form following NC14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ogiyama et al., 2018</xref>). Further investigation is necessary to determine the role of GAF in establishing three-dimensional chromatin architecture in the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GAF and Zld are uniquely required to reprogram the zygotic genome</title><p>Reprogramming in culture requires a cocktail of transcription factors that possess pioneer factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in zebrafish and mice multiple pioneering factors are required for the rapid and efficient reprogramming that occurs during the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). Here we have shown that, in addition to the essential pioneer factor Zld, GAF is a pioneer-like factor required for both gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. By analyzing the individual contributions of these two factors, we have begun to elucidate the different mechanisms by which multiple pioneer factors can drive dramatic changes in cell identity.</p><p>While some pioneer factors work together to stabilize their interaction on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chronis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donaghey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu and Kraus, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>) our data support primarily independent genome occupancy by Zld and GAF. Our reciprocal ChIP-seq data demonstrated that at regions bound by GAF and Zld, binding of each factor was largely retained in the absence of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Analysis of chromatin accessibility further supports these independent roles. We would predict that if Zld binding were lost in the absence of GAF or vice versa that at regions occupied by both factors either Zld or GAF individually would be required for accessibility. However, we identified only seven regions that lost accessibility in the absence of either Zld or GAF. By contrast, we identified more than one hundred regions that were individually dependent on each factor alone, and 891 regions that did not change in accessibility upon loss of either Zld or GAF. These data support independent roles for Zld and GAF in establishing or maintaining accessibility. Furthermore, we propose that because each factor can retain genome occupancy in the absence of the other that this may explain the 891 regions that remain accessible in the absence of either Zld or GAF: in the absence of Zld, GAF may be able to maintain accessibility and vice versa. However, until we investigate the chromatin landscape upon the removal of both Zld and GAF we cannot rule out that at these regions other factors may be instrumental in maintaining accessibility. Indeed, Duan et al. identify an essential role for the GA-dinucleotide-binding protein CLAMP in directing Zld binding and promoting chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>At most loci, our data support independent binding for GAF and Zld. Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate a possible global role for GAF on Zld occupancy as the Zld ChIP-seq signal is considerably lower in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to controls. We would predict that if GAF is directly functioning to stabilize Zld binding then this effect would be more evident at regions where both GAF and Zld bind, but this is not what we observed. Nonetheless, because of the proposed role of GAF in regulating three-dimensional chromatin architecture, GAF may be globally required for robust Zld occupancy. Furthermore, at a small subset of loci our data support a pioneering role for Zld in promoting GAF binding. In this experiment, the endogenously tagged GAF allowed us to use antibodies directed against the GFP epitope for ChIP. The use of the epitope tag enabled us to robustly control for immunoprecipitation efficiency by using another GFP-tagged protein as a spike-in control for the immunoprecipitation of GAF. In this manner, we identified 101 GAF-bound regions that decreased upon Zld knockdown. Of these, 51 were Zld-bound regions and 38 of these depend on Zld for chromatin accessibility. Thus, at a small subset of sites the pioneering function of Zld may be required to stabilize GAF binding.</p><p>We propose that there is a handoff between Zld and GAF pioneer-like activity as the embryo progresses through the MZT: Zld functions primarily at the initiation of zygotic genome activation and GAF functions primarily later during the major wave of zygotic transcription. We identified that genes regulated by Zld are enriched for those activated during NC10-13, while genes that depend on GAF are enriched for those that initiate expression during NC14. Similarly, we determined that the majority of regions that require Zld for accessibility are already accessible at NC11 while those that require GAF are enriched for regions that gain accessibility at NC12 and NC13. This is supported by prior analysis that showed that the Zld-binding motif is enriched at regions that are already accessible at NC11 and the GAF-binding motif is enriched at regions that dynamically gain accessibility later during the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>). Based on this evidence, we propose that there is a gradual handoff in the control of transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling from Zld to GAF as the MZT progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). During the initial stages of the MZT, the nuclear division cycle is an incredibly rapid series of synthesis and mitotic phases. At NC14, this cycle slows, and these different dynamics likely influence the mechanisms by which accessibility can be established. While it is unclear how Zld establishes accessibility, GAF interacts with chromatin remodelers. It is possible that the activities of these complexes may have a more substantial impact once the division cycle slows.</p><p>Together our data support the requirement for at least two pioneer-like transcription factors, Zld and GAF, to sequentially reprogram the zygotic genome following fertilization and allow for future embryonic development. It is likely that there are additional factors that function along with Zld and GAF to define accessible <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions and drive genome activation. Future studies will enable more detailed mechanistic insights into how multiple pioneering factors work together to reshape the transcriptional landscape and transform cell fate in the early embryo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:3605;

Global Zld-binding signal may have been lower in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> background because GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos die at variable times around the MZT. To attempt account for this variability, we collected embryos from a tight 2–2.5 hr AEL timepoint rather than sorting. Therefore, a portion of these embryos collected for ChIP-seq may have been dead. Additionally, the immunoprecipitation efficiency can vary between experiments and thus might have been lower in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> ChIP-seq as compared to the control. Alternatively, as discussed in the Results section, GAF may be broadly required for robust Zld occupancy.</p><p>To control for these technical factors, we performed an analysis based on peak rank, in addition to peak intensity. The number of reads aligning within each peak was quantified using featureCounts from the Subread package (v1.6.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liao et al., 2014</xref>).

Embryos were dechorionated in bleach, mounted in halocarbon 700 oil, and imaged on a Nikon Ti-2e Epifluorescent microscope using 60x magnification. Embryos with nuclei that were not grossly disordered as determined by the His2Av-RFP marker were selected for single embryo ATAC-seq. Six replicates were analyzed for each genotype.

Analysis was restricted to fragments &lt; 100 bp, which, as described previously, are most likely to originate from nucleosome-free regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). To maximize the sensitivity of peak calling, reads from all replicates of GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> and control embryos were combined. Peak calling was performed on combined reads using MACS2 with parameters -f BAMPE <monospace>--keep-dup</monospace> all -g 1.2e8 <monospace>--call-summits</monospace>. This identified 64,133 accessible regions. To facilitate comparison to published datasets with different sequencing depths, peaks were filtered to include only those with a fold-enrichment over background &gt; 2.5 (as determined by MACS2). This resulted in 36,571 peaks that were considered for downstream analysis. Because greater sequencing depth can result in the detection of a large number of peaks with a lower level of enrichment over background, this filtering step ensured that peak sets were comparable across all datasets. 201 bp peak regions (100 bp on either side of the peak summit) were used for downstream analysis. Reads aligning within accessible regions were quantified using featureCounts, and differential accessibility analysis was performed using DESeq2 with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 and a fold change &gt; 2 as thresholds for differential accessibility. Previously published ATAC-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>), GSE86966; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>), GSE83851; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nevil et al., 2020</xref>), GSE137075. were re-analyzed in parallel with ATAC-seq data from this study to ensure identical processing of data sets. Heatmaps and metaplots of z score-normalized read depth were generated with DeepTools. MEME-suite was used to for de novo motif discovery for differentially accessible ATAC peaks and to match discovered motifs to previously known motifs from databases. Genome browser tracks were generated using bigWigs with the Gviz package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahne and Ivanek, 2016</xref>). Numbers used for all Fisher’s exact tests are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Erica Larschan and Jingyue Duan for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.</p><p>This manuscript by Gaskill and Gibson et al. presents compelling evidence that GAGA-factor acts as an additional pioneer factor in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The authors use state of the art genome engineering technology and protein degradation techniques to demonstrate that GAF is essential for ZGA and embryonic viability and is needed for the expression of a set of genes that are known to be bound by GAF.</p><p>All the reviewers appreciated the importance and the potential impact of the work, but all raised issues with experimental approaches with so many confounding factors making it difficult to interpret the results with confidence (the detailed critiques can be found below in individual reviews).</p><p>In the light of <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy to invite revisions only when revision experiments are unlikely to change major conclusion of the paper, we decided that this manuscript must be rejected at this point. However, we would like to note that all the reviewers are quite enthusiastic about this manuscript, and if you can address major concerns, we would be ready to review the revised manuscript as a new submission, which will be handled by the same set of editors/reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Gaskill et al. perform a thorough investigation of the role of GAF as a pioneer transcription factor during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Using an elegant system for tagging and acute degradation of GAF in embryos, the authors show that: (i) the tagged version of the protein is functional and recapitulates the expected binding properties (Figure 1); (ii) acute proteasomal degradation of the protein prior to ZGA leads to severe defects in embryo viability (Figure 2); (iii) degradation of GAF leads to a significant downregulation of zygotic gene expression at ZGA (Figure 3) independently of Zelda (Figure 4); and, (iv) loss of GAF leads to a significant reduction of chromatin accessibility.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, the data are presented in a logical manner and the findings are supported by the data. The formal identification of GAF as a critical factor for ZGA is important and the results will open up new avenues for investigation of how these molecular mechanisms orchestrate the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p><p>My main criticism of the work is the lack of a biochemical characterisation of GAF binding to nucleosomes to demonstrate a pioneer activity, and further biochemical evidence regarding the level of interaction with Zelda at the protein level. Combined, these experiments might bring a significant level of clarity to some of the results presented in Figure 4 and 5 by elucidating whether GAF is able to bind nucleosomes independently of Zelda.</p><p>In addition, I have another three major points:</p><p>1) I find the logic regarding the conclusions drawn in Figure 4 difficult to follow. In particular, the authors conclude that &quot;GAF does not broadly depend on Zld for chromatin occupancy in the early embryo&quot;. However, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B shows significant differences in the binding intensities upon Zelda RNAi. Therefore, I find it difficult to reconcile these two aspects. I appreciate that the effect might be global, since both Zelda targets and non-Zelda GAF target peaks seem to change, but this needs to be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The same point applies where the authors state: &quot;Zld binding to target loci is largely unperturbed in the absence of GAF&quot;. However, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D again shows a significant effect in the binding of Zelda upon GAF removal.</p><p>3) I find Figure 5F very difficult to follow and I cannot match the numbers reported in the main text that describe this analysis. This is also the case for Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. The authors should make this part more accessible. In addition, it might be more informative to perform a direct comparison of the ATAC-seq maps generated here and those for Zelda mutants from Hannon et al., 2017. Further analysis on the specific changes in nucleosome occupancy changes after Zelda or GAF depletion measured by these datasets might already help in demonstrating the pioneer activity of GAF.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript under review, Gaskill et al., address the longstanding question of the role of GAF in the process of MZT including zygotic genome activation. The question of GAF's role in early development was addressed in the past (Bhat et al., 1996) through conventional genetic means where it was found that elimination of maternal GAF results in a highly pleiotropic, messy, lethal phenotype. Gaskill et al. bring a welcome, timely, and modern approach to revisiting this problem by combining CRISPR, new approaches for generating conditional loss of function (DegradFP), and genomics. In doing so, they recover essentially the same messy pleiotropic loss of function phenotype.</p><p>While it would not be impossible to work with such a messy phenotype, in my opinion the authors have not taken sufficient care to ensure that their conclusions are free of possible confounding effects of the GAF loss of function phenotype. As highlighted below, there are several examples where conclusions are over-stated, technical or biological issues remain unaddressed, and -significantly- at least one of the presented experiments is designed so poorly that the rigor of the entire study has to be called into serious doubt (See major issue 1 as well as 3 below).</p><p>If done well, the experiments in this study are important to do and the results would be valuable for not only the developmental biology community, but to the broader field of transcriptional regulation and epigenetics. I make the comments below mindful of the difficulties of life in the pandemic, and I have tried to see a way to fix the study without suggesting that significant parts of it be re-done more carefully. Unfortunately, I am not confident that the existing data are suitable for publication as detailed below.</p><p>1) Significant lethality of <italic>sfGFP-GAF</italic> (30% hatch rate). While this phenotype is concerning, what is more of an issue is that my interpretation of the westerns in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggest that substantially less protein is produced from the N-terminally tagged line as well. This expression problem does not appear to be mentioned in the text, but it definitely should be. What is the quantitative difference between protein levels in these westerns? Does this raise concerns that the “wild-type” samples are not really very wild-type? When does the lethality occur? Specifically, does this effect of the N-terminal GFP-GAF allele affect any of the conclusions?</p><p>More concerning is that the authors mixed these two alleles (in different copy numbers as well) for the GAF vs Zld ChIP-seq experiments. As stated in the Materials and methods: these experiments done comparing one versus two copies of the GFP tagged GAF allele, but *also* that the zld RNAi sample used the N-terminal tagged GAF allele (in one copy) and the control used the C-terminal tagged allele (in two copies). As mentioned above, it appears that there is a difference in the expression levels of these two alleles, which is presumably magnified significantly by choosing to compare hets and homozygotes. This experiment could easily have been done on N-terminal hets as controls. This falls well below the bar for acceptable experimental design.</p><p>2) Re: conclusion: &quot;maternal GAF is essential for progression through the MZT&quot;. The method of knockdown via DegradFP driven by mat-α-GAL4-VP16 begins eliminating GAF in mid-oogenesis. To underscore, this is not an “embryo-specific” knockdown. At the very least, it is a knockdown slightly later than what would be achieved in a germline clone. To the extent that the lethal phenotype has been examined in this manuscript, it remains unclear if it reflects a requirement of GAF specifically for the MZT, or if it reflects a requirement of GAF in some other biological process. There are high degrees of similarity between the DegradFP phenotype and the Trl[13C] phenotype reported in (Bhat '96) where ambiguity about the timing of GAF function also limited insight to when and how GAF is truly required. While the conclusion is not technically incorrect, the implication that this phenotype unambiguously implicates GAF as a regulator of the biological process of MZT (as opposed to oogenesis, genome integrity, chromatin architecture in general, et cetera) is not true.</p><p>Also, the GAF loss-of-function phenotype bears absolutely no resemblance to the Zld loss of function phenotype, as the authors further conclude. As the authors are aware, the vast majority of zld germline clones are virtually indistinguishable from wild-type embryos through the cleavage stages, and nearly perfectly phenocopy embryos injected with the Pol 2 inhibitor α amanitin at least at the gross morphological scale. Some minor changes in cell cycle timing occurs in zld mutants, and occasionally an extra mitotic division (also seen with Pol 2). But these cleavages are mostly completed with the fidelity typical of a wild type embryo. In dramatic contrast, GAF loss-of-function results in likely pleiotropic phenotypes that either result in or are caused by errors in mitosis or extensive DNA damage. Importantly, since effects like this are not achieved by inhibiting transcription, this phenotype is likely not due to effects on the ZGA component of MZT. This is consistent with the acute effect of GAF loss of function resulting in disruption of additional unknown maternal processes. But the extent that these disrupted maternal processes specifically impact the MZT, as opposed to other maternally-supplied biological functions, has not been demonstrated in this study.</p><p>3) Given the GAF loss of function phenotype: how can the authors be sure that the GAF[degradFP] embryos are at a comparable stage to &quot;wild-type&quot; in their genomic experiments? When gene expression is observed to be GAF-dependent, what steps have the authors taken to ensure that quantitative differences in gene expression stem from loss of GAF and are not confounded by the fact that in a 2-2.5 hr bulk collection that nearly all of the DegradFP embryos are in the process of dying, developing asynchronously, with likely extensive DNA Damage, et cetera? From the Materials and methods section, it seems that for some of the experiments, nothing at all was done. I have a hard time imagining how there is a way around this, since embryos with extensive damaged nuclei cannot be expected to continue transcribing RNA normally, and in fact there is evidence that they very much do not (Iampietro, Dev Cell 2014). Timing is also important here, since many of the genes that are listed as being sensitive to GAF loss of function are just beginning to be expressed, any delay in development would only exacerbate differences between the two experimental samples. For instance, the enrichment for up-regulated maternal genes could either reflect a role for GAF in the process of MZT, in general, or just that the embryos are either significantly delayed or outright die before they have a chance to undergo ZGA. As described above, this does not prove that GAF is involved in the process of MZT. Again, on the basis of these results, it cannot reliably be concluded, that GAF is directly playing a role in the process of ZGA.</p><p>4) Looking at the GAF[degradFP] coverage in the bigWig files supplied to GEO, I am strongly concerned that there is a major global difference in the normalized read counts (at least five fold lower peak heights all over the genome, but also with substantially higher background in the DegradFP sample), which should not really be there if the different samples are truly comparable to one another. Is this difference biological or technical? Such huge differences (if they are not just an error in generating the bigWig files) I think would certainly overburden algorithmic normalization in programs like DESeq2. Not to mention that it makes evaluation of the magnitude of differences seen in the ATAC experiments impossible to do through a genome browser, and has significantly colored my interpretation of the results with the DegradFP approach towards the negative (see above). The authors need to address the reason for this difference in magnitude, as well as provide information such as read counts per sample, mapping rates, fraction of mitochondrial reads (for ATAC data). If the issue is due to significant differences in recovered reads between the two genotypes, the question should be asked whether it is a good idea to publish these particular datasets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Gaskill and Gibson et al. presents compelling evidence that GAGA-factor acts as an additional pioneer factor in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The authors use state of the art genome engineering technology and protein degradation techniques to demonstrate that GAF is essential for ZGA and embryonic viability and is needed for the expression of a set of genes that are known to be bound by GAF. This data provides confirmation that previous results in cell lines translate well in vivo and that the previously established mechanistic role for GAF in opening chromatin and establishing paused Pol II holds true in animals. While this manuscript contains compelling findings and will be of high general interest, the authors' reciprocal ChIP-seq data is not convincing and needs to be repeated.</p><p>1) The reciprocal ChIP-seq experiments are simply not convincing in their current form. The authors want to use this data to claim that GAF or Zelda depletion does not impact the binding of the other factor, so that they can say that there is not cooperativity on the &quot;vast majority of target sites&quot;. However, they note that there is a global decrease in GAF binding after Zelda depletion and a global decrease in Zelda binding after GAF depletion. They attempt to get around this issue by citing vague technical issues and using rank order comparisons instead, but this analysis is not appropriate in this case. If GAF and Zelda were binding cooperatively, wouldn't one expect there to be a global decrease in the binding of one after depletion of the other, and not necessarily a change in peak rank order? The authors speculate in the Materials and methods section as to why technical reasons could have caused this difference, however, what they should do is perform properly controlled experiments that control for these technical variables so that they can nail this finding with certainty. This is not a trivial issue, as a major conclusion of the paper is that GAF and Zelda act as independent pioneer factors with slightly different activation times in the embryo</p><p>a) Why was the zld-RNAi GAF ChIP-seq experiment performed in the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> background and then compared to the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(C)</italic> dataset? This experiment should be repeated with the proper control, GAF ChIP-seq in the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(C)</italic> background. Furthermore, it is concerning that it seems the authors simply performed the zld-RNAi GAF ChIP-seq experiment and then compared back to a previously generated GAF-ChIP-seq dataset; ChIP-seq is an assay subject to a large amount of technical variance and if experiments are to be quantitatively compared as they are in the manuscript, they must be performed at the same time and processed in parallel to minimize this variance.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Gaskill et al. perform a thorough investigation of the role of GAF as a pioneer transcription factor during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Using an elegant system for tagging and acute degradation of GAF in embryos, the authors show that: (i) the tagged version of the protein is functional and recapitulates the expected binding properties (Figure 1); (ii) acute proteasomal degradation of the protein prior to ZGA leads to severe defects in embryo viability (Figure 2); (iii) degradation of GAF leads to a significant downregulation of zygotic gene expression at ZGA (Figure 3) independently of Zelda (Figure 4); and, (iv) loss of GAF leads to a significant reduction of chromatin accessibility.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, the data are presented in a logical manner and the findings are supported by the data. The formal identification of GAF as a critical factor for ZGA is important and the results will open up new avenues for investigation of how these molecular mechanisms orchestrate the maternal-to-zygotic transition.</p><p>My main criticism of the work is the lack of a biochemical characterisation of GAF binding to nucleosomes to demonstrate a pioneer activity, and further biochemical evidence regarding the level of interaction with Zelda at the protein level. Combined, these experiments might bring a significant level of clarity to some of the results presented in Figure 4 and 5 by elucidating whether GAF is able to bind nucleosomes independently of Zelda.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that reviewer 1 finds the manuscript clear and that the findings are supported by the data.</p><p>Our lab has done several experiments to determine which factors, if any, Zelda is interacting with on the protein level. A graduate student performed IP mass spec, yeast 2-hybrid, and BioID experiments to identify proteins that directly interact with Zelda. Although multiple proteins were identified as potential Zld-interacting factors, we were unable to verify any of these through co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot. We speculate that Zld may interact transiently with a large number of factors, potentially through it’s low-complexity transcription activation domain (Hamm et al., JBC 2015). GAF-interacting partners have been identified using affinity purification coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry (Lomaev et al., 2017), and Zelda was not identified as a GAF-interacting factor in this study. Based on these previously generated data, we anticipate that if we were to perform co-immunoprecipitation studies with GAF and Zld we would not identify an interaction. We recognize that the biochemical identification of interactions depend on many factors, including purification conditions, making it impossible to rule out protein:protein interactions with a negative result. Therefore, although we cannot definitively state that GAF and Zelda are not interacting on a protein level, previous data suggests it is unlikely. Further supporting independent roles for GAF and Zld in shaping the chromatin landscape, GAF is required for chromatin accessibility in S2 tissue-culture cells, in which Zld is not expressed at detectable levels.</p><p>We also agree that nucleosome binding assays with GAF would be interesting and informative, however we believe they are beyond the scope of the current manuscript. A major challenge to this line of experimentation is that we have thus far been unable to purify soluble full length GAF protein in bacterial culture, and therefore anticipate purifying sufficient amounts of full-length GAF will require extensive troubleshooting. Given the difficulty of these experiments we believe it is outside the scope of this study. Although GAF has not yet been shown to directly bind nucleosomes, it has been extensively shown in vitro and in cell culture to promote chromatin accessibility at promoters through the recruitment of chromatin remodelers (Okada and Hirose, 1998; Tsukiyama et al., 1994; Xiao et al., 2001; Tsukiyama and Wu, 1995; Fuda et al., 2015; Judd et al., 2020). Our new analysis includes data demonstrating that GAF binds to regions before accessibility is established. However, we acknowledge that GAF has not been shown to directly bind nucleosomes and therefore it is not proven to have all of the features of a canonical pioneer factor. Therefore, we have removed “pioneer factor” from the title of our manuscript and refer to GAF within the manuscript as a “pioneer-like factor”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I have another three major points:</p><p>1) I find the logic regarding the conclusions drawn in Figure 4 difficult to follow. In particular, the authors conclude that &quot;GAF does not broadly depend on Zld for chromatin occupancy in the early embryo&quot;. However, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B shows significant differences in the binding intensities upon Zelda RNAi. Therefore, I find it difficult to reconcile these two aspects. I appreciate that the effect might be global, since both Zelda targets and non-Zelda GAF target peaks seem to change, but this needs to be clarified in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in this section. In response to the concerns of other reviewers, we have repeated these GAF ChIP-seq experiments to better control for any global effects the loss of Zld might have on GAF occupancy. We performed ChIP-seq for <italic>sfGFP-GAF (N)</italic> in a <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background with paired heterozygous <italic>sfGFP-GAF (N)</italic> embryos as controls. We further included a spike-in control to allow for normalization (chromatin from mouse cells expression GFP-tagged histone H3). In the new GAF ChIP data after z-score and spike-in normalization, we no longer observe a global decrease in GAF binding in the <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background. When we perform differential binding analysis on these data we again identify relatively few sites (3.3% of total GAF peaks) that are significantly changed. We have extensively rewritten this section of the manuscript and changed Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, C to incorporate the new data and clarify our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The same point applies where the authors state: &quot;Zld binding to target loci is largely unperturbed in the absence of GAF&quot;. However, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D again shows a significant effect in the binding of Zelda upon GAF removal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and have rewritten this section to clearly convey our conclusions. We emphasize that although we observe a global decrease in Zld binding upon GAF depletion, a very small subset of Zld binding sites were statistically significantly changed in the absence of GAF (1.7%). Therefore, we conclude that at the majority of Zld binding sites the ability of Zld to bind target loci is not ablated when GAF is depleted. See rewritten section in the comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I find Figure 5F very difficult to follow and I cannot match the numbers reported in the main text that describe this analysis. This is also the case for Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. The authors should make this part more accessible. In addition, it might be more informative to perform a direct comparison of the ATAC-seq maps generated here and those for Zelda mutants from Hannon et al., 2017. Further analysis on the specific changes in nucleosome occupancy changes after Zelda or GAF depletion measured by these datasets might already help in demonstrating the pioneer activity of GAF.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in this section. In response to another reviewer’s comments, we performed ATAC-seq on single-embryo replicates. We repeated and expanded our analysis with these new data (new Figure 5 and Figure 6). We now incorporate the ATAC-seq in <italic>zld</italic> mutants from Hannon et al., 2017 in Figure 6. We also investigated when during the MZT regions that require either Zld or GAF for gain accessibility based on data from Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016. We have therefore re-written the Results and Discussion and worked to make these sections more accessible. We have also updated Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement1, Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement1, and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 to incorporate our new data and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript under review, Gaskill et al., address the longstanding question of the role of GAF in the process of MZT including zygotic genome activation. The question of GAF's role in early development was addressed in the past (Bhat et al., 1996) through conventional genetic means where it was found that elimination of maternal GAF results in a highly pleiotropic, messy, lethal phenotype. Gaskill et al. bring a welcome, timely, and modern approach to revisiting this problem by combining CRISPR, new approaches for generating conditional loss of function (DegradFP), and genomics. In doing so, they recover essentially the same messy pleiotropic loss of function phenotype.</p><p>While it would not be impossible to work with such a messy phenotype, in my opinion the authors have not taken sufficient care to ensure that their conclusions are free of possible confounding effects of the GAF loss of function phenotype. As highlighted below, there are several examples where conclusions are over-stated, technical or biological issues remain unaddressed, and -significantly- at least one of the presented experiments is designed so poorly that the rigor of the entire study has to be called into serious doubt (See major issue 1 as well as 3 below).</p><p>If done well, the experiments in this study are important to do and the results would be valuable for not only the developmental biology community, but to the broader field of transcriptional regulation and epigenetics. I make the comments below mindful of the difficulties of life in the pandemic, and I have tried to see a way to fix the study without suggesting that significant parts of it be re-done more carefully. Unfortunately, I am not confident that the existing data are suitable for publication as detailed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer notes that the “experiments are important to do and that the results would be valuable” to both the developmental biology and transcription fields and regret that the reviewer did not feel we have “taken sufficient care to ensure our free of confounding effects”. To address these concerns, we have included new ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data as well as additional data and analysis to further support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Significant lethality of sfGFP-GAF (30% hatch rate). While this phenotype is concerning, what is more of an issue is that my interpretation of the westerns in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggest that substantially less protein is produced from the N-terminally tagged line as well. This expression problem does not appear to be mentioned in the text, but it definitely should be. What is the quantitative difference between protein levels in these westerns? Does this raise concerns that the “wild-type” samples are not really very wild-type? When does the lethality occur? Specifically, does this effect of the N-terminal GFP-GAF allele affect any of the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns about the <italic>sfGFP-GAF (N)</italic> line. We were also concerned about any confounding effects, which was the reason we used <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> homozygous embryos as our controls for every genomics experiment. By comparing to this control, we will have eliminated from our analysis effects caused by the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> allele alone. We are confident the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> is rescuing essential GAF function, as we have verified the line is homozygous viable and fertile and recapitulates GAF nuclear localization characteristics. Additionally, in this revised manuscript we discuss additional ChIP-seq experiments performed on <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> heterozygous embryos. Through comparison of these newly generated data for <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> binding to binding sites identified for the C-terminally tagged version (GAF-sfGFP(C)), which has a 66% hatching rate, we identify a high-degree of overlap. 91% of loci identified in GAF-sfGFP(C) embryos are also identified in <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). This demonstrates that the N-terminal sfGFP tag does not alter the ability of GAF to localize to subnuclear domains or to bind specific target loci in the genome. Together, we feel this is strong evidence that, despite the reduced hatching rate, <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> recapitulates the majority of GAF function. This analysis is described in the text.</p><p>To address the question of protein levels in the two tagged versions of GAF, we performed fluorescent quantification of GFP signal in nuclei of <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> and <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> homozygous embryos. This strategy allowed us to directly compare single embryos, while our western blots (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) were performed on bulk collections. This quantification did not identify any significant difference in the fluorescent GFP signal between the two genotypes, suggesting GAF protein levels are not reduced in <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos compared to <italic>GAF-sfGFP(C)</italic> embryos. We have included these data in the manuscript in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and described this experiment in the text.</p><p>It is challenging to determine the precise timing of the lethality of the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos as it appears to be variable. We observe that approximately half of the <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> homozygous embryos successfully progress to gastrulation. Therefore, a subset of <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos die prior to gastrulation, while the remainder die at some point following gastrulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More concerning is that the authors mixed these two alleles (in different copy numbers as well) for the GAF vs Zld ChIP-seq experiments. As stated in the Materials and methods: these experiments done comparing one versus two copies of the GFP tagged GAF allele, but *also* that the zld RNAi sample used the N-terminal tagged GAF allele (in one copy) and the control used the C-terminal tagged allele (in two copies). As mentioned above, it appears that there is a difference in the expression levels of these two alleles, which is presumably magnified significantly by choosing to compare hets and homozygotes. This experiment could easily have been done on N-terminal hets as controls. This falls well below the bar for acceptable experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed ChIP-seq for sfGFP-GAF(N) in a <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background with paired heterozygous <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos as controls. Our data for sfGFP-GAF(N) binding from heterozygous embryos identified 6373 GAF peaks. When we compared these to the 4175 GAF peaks identified in the GAF-sfGFP(C) homozygous ChIP-seq dataset, we identified that 91% of GAF-sfGFP(C) peaks identified were maintained in the sfGFP-GAF(N) dataset, and peaks unique to either dataset are among the weakest sites identified (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Thus, the location of the sfGFP tag on GAF does not significantly alter the ability of GAF to bind specific genomic loci. To further enable comparison of GAF binding between control and <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi embryos, we included a spike-in control to allow for normalization (chromatin from mouse cells expression GFP-tagged histone H3.3). With the new GAF ChIP data after z-score and spike-in normalization, we no longer observe a global decrease in GAF binding in the <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background. These new ChIP-seq data support the previous conclusions that GAF remains bound to nearly all the same loci in the presence and absence of Zld. We have updated Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,C as well as the text to reflect these new data. We were also able to identify 101 GAF-binding sites that were altered upon the depletion of <italic>zld</italic>, and these have been discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Re: conclusion: &quot;maternal GAF is essential for progression through the MZT&quot;. The method of knockdown via DegradFP driven by mat-α-GAL4-VP16 begins eliminating GAF in mid-oogenesis. To underscore, this is not an “embryo-specific” knockdown. At the very least, it is a knockdown slightly later than what would be achieved in a germline clone. To the extent that the lethal phenotype has been examined in this manuscript, it remains unclear if it reflects a requirement of GAF specifically for the MZT, or if it reflects a requirement of GAF in some other biological process. There are high degrees of similarity between the DegradFP phenotype and the Trl[13C] phenotype reported in (Bhat '96) where ambiguity about the timing of GAF function also limited insight to when and how GAF is truly required. While the conclusion is not technically incorrect, the implication that this phenotype unambiguously implicates GAF as a regulator of the biological process of MZT (as opposed to oogenesis, genome integrity, chromatin architecture in general, et cetera) is not true.</p></disp-quote><p>While we highlight that the expression of the degradFP enzyme is driven by the <italic>nanos</italic> promoter and not <italic>mat-α</italic>-GAL4-VP16, we acknowledge the point of the reviewer has raised, and we have changed the language in the manuscript to better reflect this caveat.</p><p>We agree that is important to acknowledge potential downstream effects of GAF knockdown at oogenesis. Nonetheless, a number of reasons support our hypothesis that the majority of the effects we identify are the result of GAF knockdown in the embryo:</p><p>1) Females in which GAF null germline clones have been generated are rarely able to produce eggs. As reported in Bejarano and Busturia, 2004, of 807 female GAF null germline clones only 23 could produce eggs. Furthermore, most of the eggs produced by these germline clones were unfertilized. These observations suggest that GAF is required during oogenesis for egg production. By contrast, our knockdown system does not show this egg-laying defect, suggesting that the essential functions of GAF in the germline are not inhibited.</p><p>2) In Bhat et al., 1996 the authors investigate GAF protein and mRNA levels in the ovary and embryos of wild-type control and <italic>Trl[13C]</italic> hypomorphic GAF mutants. Based on their studies, they conclude that the reduction in <italic>Trl</italic> mRNA deposited in the <italic>Trl[13C]</italic> embryos, and the resulting reduction of GAF protein levels in the embryo, likely produce the nuclear division defects observed. Although they cannot conclusively rule out that the described phenotypes are an indirect effect of GAF knockdown in the germline, they conclude that is unlikely given their observations that GAF protein levels are similar in the ovaries of wild-type controls and <italic>Trl[13C]</italic> mutants. Therefore, the shared phenotypes between our GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos and the hypomorphic embryos from <italic>Trl[13C]</italic> mothers in Bhat et al., 1996 are suggestive that GAF knockdown is primarily occurring in the embryo. Nonetheless, our system has advantages over the <italic>Trl[13C]</italic> allele. While Bhat et al. observed variation in phenotype and GAF-expression levels both between and within embryos, our system robustly eliminates GAF protein in every embryo examined and uniformly in all nuclei.</p><p>3) Analysis of our genomics data indicates that the effects we observe are the direct consequence of GAF knockdown in the embryo. Our RNA-seq analysis identified only a subset of genes expressed at NC14 that were downregulated in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos and these were significantly enriched for genes with a proximal GAF-binding site (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D). Further supporting the RNA-seq data and that it reflects the loss of GAF function in the embryo, we identify multiple, zygotically expressed, previously identified GAF-target genes as down-regulated in our RNA-seq analysis, such as <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic>.</p><p>In summary, we agree that we cannot rule out that some of the phenotypic and gene expression differences between the control and GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos are due to loss of GAF protein in the female germline. Nonetheless, we feel that the evidence strongly supports that many of the effects we identify are due to protein loss in the embryo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the GAF loss-of-function phenotype bears absolutely no resemblance to the Zld loss of function phenotype, as the authors further conclude. As the authors are aware, the vast majority of zld germline clones are virtually indistinguishable from wild-type embryos through the cleavage stages, and nearly perfectly phenocopy embryos injected with the Pol 2 inhibitor α amanitin at least at the gross morphological scale. Some minor changes in cell cycle timing occurs in zld mutants, and occasionally an extra mitotic division (also seen with Pol 2). But these cleavages are mostly completed with the fidelity typical of a wild type embryo. In dramatic contrast, GAF loss-of-function results in likely pleiotropic phenotypes that either result in or are caused by errors in mitosis or extensive DNA damage. Importantly, since effects like this are not achieved by inhibiting transcription, this phenotype is likely not due to effects on the ZGA component of MZT. This is consistent with the acute effect of GAF loss of function resulting in disruption of additional unknown maternal processes. But the extent that these disrupted maternal processes specifically impact the MZT, as opposed to other maternally-supplied biological functions, has not been demonstrated in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that the phenotypic defects of a subset of GAF knockdown embryos are more dramatic than the effects of maternal <italic>zld</italic> null embryos during NC10-13. Nonetheless, we would like to point out that there are multiple reports of defects in <italic>zld</italic> null embryos prior to NC14. For example, in Liang et al., 2008, nuclear fallout is reported in maternal <italic>zld</italic> null embryos prior to NC14, which we have also observed when imaging maternal <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi embryos. In that same paper, it is described that in early NC14 maternal <italic>zld</italic> null embryos the actin network becomes disorganized and begins to degenerate, leading to highly disorganized nuclei. It is reported in Staudt et al., 2006 that embryos injected with <italic>vielfaltig (</italic>renamed <italic>zld</italic>) dsRNA begin to display anaphase bridges and abnormally condensed chromatin as early as NC10, with these defects becoming more frequent through subsequent nuclear cycles. (Indeed, the gene was originally named <italic>vielfaltig</italic>, meaning versatile or manifold, because of these wide-ranging phenotypic defects.) Therefore, we have edited the text for clarity to reflect that a subset of the GAF knockdown embryos have similar phenotypes to what has been previously published for maternal <italic>zld</italic> knockdown embryos, while a subset of GAF knockdown embryos display more dramatic phenotypes likely due to additional roles of GAF for genome stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the GAF loss of function phenotype: how can the authors be sure that the GAF[degradFP] embryos are at a comparable stage to &quot;wild-type&quot; in their genomic experiments? When gene expression is observed to be GAF-dependent, what steps have the authors taken to ensure that quantitative differences in gene expression stem from loss of GAF and are not confounded by the fact that in a 2-2.5 hr bulk collection that nearly all of the DegradFP embryos are in the process of dying, developing asynchronously, with likely extensive DNA Damage, et cetera? From the Materials and methods section, it seems that for some of the experiments, nothing at all was done. I have a hard time imagining how there is a way around this, since embryos with extensive damaged nuclei cannot be expected to continue transcribing RNA normally, and in fact there is evidence that they very much do not (Iampietro, Dev Cell 2014). Timing is also important here, since many of the genes that are listed as being sensitive to GAF loss of function are just beginning to be expressed, any delay in development would only exacerbate differences between the two experimental samples. For instance, the enrichment for up-regulated maternal genes could either reflect a role for GAF in the process of MZT, in general, or just that the embryos are either significantly delayed or outright die before they have a chance to undergo ZGA. As described above, this does not prove that GAF is involved in the process of MZT. Again, on the basis of these results, it cannot reliably be concluded, that GAF is directly playing a role in the process of ZGA.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to perform a bulk collection of embryos for our RNA-seq experiment precisely because the nuclear defects in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos makes exactly staging the embryos challenging and because of the issues the reviewer raises given the initiation of gene expression. Given the dramatic changes in gene expression that can occur within minutes during zygotic genome activation, we used tightly timed bulk collection to alleviate potential timing differences that would be exacerbated by single-embryo RNA-seq. To address the concerns above, we analyzed our RNA-seq data by selecting for those genes that initiate expression late in ZGA (late nuclear cycle 14, NC14; the “later” class of genes defined by Li et al., 2014). If expression defects are caused by a failure of the embryos to reach ZGA, we would expect a global decrease in all genes expressed at this timepoint in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to control. Instead, our analysis demonstrated that many non-GAF target transcripts activated during late NC14 are expressed at similar levels in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to control embryos. By contrast, a substantial proportion of genes activated at NC14 with a proximal GAF-binding site (as identified by our ChIP-seq) are downregulated in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos as compared to controls (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D). Thus, during NC14 direct GAF target transcript expression is affected by GAF knockdown while numerous non-GAF target transcripts are activated normally. This additional analysis suggests our tightly timed bulk collection succeeded in enriching for NC14 embryos and that expression differences identified in our RNA-seq data are not caused by a timing delay in GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos compared to controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Looking at the GAF[degradFP] coverage in the bigWig files supplied to GEO, I am strongly concerned that there is a major global difference in the normalized read counts (at least five fold lower peak heights all over the genome, but also with substantially higher background in the DegradFP sample), which should not really be there if the different samples are truly comparable to one another. Is this difference biological or technical? Such huge differences (if they are not just an error in generating the bigWig files) I think would certainly overburden algorithmic normalization in programs like DESeq2. Not to mention that it makes evaluation of the magnitude of differences seen in the ATAC experiments impossible to do through a genome browser, and has significantly colored my interpretation of the results with the DegradFP approach towards the negative (see above). The authors need to address the reason for this difference in magnitude, as well as provide information such as read counts per sample, mapping rates, fraction of mitochondrial reads (for ATAC data). If the issue is due to significant differences in recovered reads between the two genotypes, the question should be asked whether it is a good idea to publish these particular datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that our ATAC-seq data were noisy. Since our lab has had success with single embryo ATAC-seq, we decided to collect single embryos from control and GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> embryos from the 2-2.5 hr time point. Single-embryo ATAC-seq assays are not subject to the same timing issues as RNA-seq as the changes in accessibility identified by Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016 over the MZT are less dramatic than the changes in transcript levels during the same time point. Nonetheless, we performed these experiments in six biological replicates to minimize effects of differences in developmental timing. We imaged individual embryos to confirm that they had nuclei that were not grossly disordered using His2av-RFP prior to performing the ATAC-seq. The data from this experiment were much improved, and we have updated and expanded new Figures 5 and 6 using the data from our single embryo ATAC-seq experiment.</p><p>We have updated Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement1, Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 2 with our new data and expanded analysis, as well as the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Gaskill and Gibson et al. presents compelling evidence that GAGA-factor acts as an additional pioneer factor in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The authors use state of the art genome engineering technology and protein degradation techniques to demonstrate that GAF is essential for ZGA and embryonic viability and is needed for the expression of a set of genes that are known to be bound by GAF. This data provides confirmation that previous results in cell lines translate well in vivo and that the previously established mechanistic role for GAF in opening chromatin and establishing paused Pol II holds true in animals. While this manuscript contains compelling findings and will be of high general interest, the authors' reciprocal ChIP-seq data is not convincing and needs to be repeated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer finds the that the manuscript contains “compelling findings and will be of high general interest.” We have repeated the reciprocal ChIP-seq data and re-analyzed these data to address the concerns raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The reciprocal ChIP-seq experiments are simply not convincing in their current form. The authors want to use this data to claim that GAF or Zelda depletion does not impact the binding of the other factor, so that they can say that there is not cooperativity on the &quot;vast majority of target sites&quot;. However, they note that there is a global decrease in GAF binding after Zelda depletion and a global decrease in Zelda binding after GAF depletion. They attempt to get around this issue by citing vague technical issues and using rank order comparisons instead, but this analysis is not appropriate in this case. If GAF and Zelda were binding cooperatively, wouldn't one expect there to be a global decrease in the binding of one after depletion of the other, and not necessarily a change in peak rank order? The authors speculate in the Materials and methods section as to why technical reasons could have caused this difference, however, what they should do is perform properly controlled experiments that control for these technical variables so that they can nail this finding with certainty. This is not a trivial issue, as a major conclusion of the paper is that GAF and Zelda act as independent pioneer factors with slightly different activation times in the embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the point raised by reviewer 3 and the other reviewers that better controlled experiments eliminating technical variables would bring clarity to the global decrease in GAF and Zld binding observed in the knockdown backgrounds of the other factor. We therefore performed ChIP-seq for <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> in a <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background with paired heterozygous <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> embryos as controls. We further included a spike-in control to allow for normalization (chromatin from mouse cells expression GFP-tagged histone H3.3). In our new GAF ChIP-seq data after z-score and spike-in normalization we no longer observe a global decrease in GAF binding in the <italic>zld-</italic>RNAi background. These new data support the previous conclusion that GAF remains bound to the majority of target loci in both the presence and absence of Zld, with only 3.3% of GAF peaks statistically significantly changed in the <italic>zld-</italic>RNAi background. However, we performed additional analysis on the 101 GAF-binding sites that decrease when Zld is lost. We find these sites are enriched for Zld-bound regions that depend on Zld for accessibility. Therefore, at a small subset of GAF-binding sites, pioneering activity of Zld may be required for GAF occupancy. However at the majority of GAF-binding sites GAF does not depend on Zld for occupancy. We used this new GAF ChIP data to generate Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,C, and we have incorporated textual changes.</p><p>We agree with reviewer 3’s assessment that we cannot rule out that the global decrease we observed in Zld binding upon the loss of GAF is biological. However, we expect that if Zld required GAF for occupancy we would see a change in Zld binding in the absence of GAF specifically at regions where the two factors are co-bound. We based this assumption on previously published data on pioneer-factor cooperativity. For example, in Donaghey et al., 2018 the authors found that GATA4 can stabilize FOXA2 binding at a subset of sites where the two factors are bound when they are ectopically expressed in cell culture. Additionally, when OSKM occupancy was investigated during MEF reprogramming it was found that the cooperative binding of O, S, and K was required for targeting of these factors specifically to sites that were co-occupied by the three factors (Chronis et al., 2017). In contrast, the Zld-binding sites that decrease in the absence of GAF are depleted for GAF and Zld co-bound regions when compared to unchanged Zld binding sites. Therefore, at these sites GAF is not directly stabilizing Zld binding or creating local chromatin accessibility. We have clarified the text to more clearly convey this.</p><p>Comparisons to previously published reciprocal ChIP-seq data also reinforces our conclusion that neither GAF nor Zld is broadly required for the binding of the other factor to target loci. In Sun et al., 2015 the authors tested the dependency of the transcription factors Dorsal and Zld on the binding of the other factor during the MZT in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Like us, they used DESeq to call differential binding sites for Dorsal peaks between control and <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi embryos and for Zld peaks in Dorsal mutant and control embryos. They determined that Zld is required for Dorsal binding to a subset of sites, as 19.4% of Dorsal peaks are significantly decreased and 37.8% are significantly changed in the <italic>zld</italic> RNAi background. By contrast, only 2.5% of Zld peaks are significantly changed in the absence of Dorsal. Therefore, the authors conclude that Zld is required for Dorsal binding, but that Dorsal is not required for Zld binding. Our data shows only 3.3% of GAF peaks significantly change upon the loss of Zld and 1.7% of Zld peaks significantly change upon the loss of GAF when we call differential binding with DESeq2 (Figure 4E,F). Therefore, both of our ChIP-seq experiments more closely resemble the impact of Dorsal loss on Zld than the impact of Zld loss on Dorsal. Nevertheless, we have modified the language in our manuscript to make it clear that we cannot rule out an influence of GAF on global Zld binding (Results, Discussion) and to emphasize that there is a small subset of GAF-binding sites that depend on the pioneering activity of Zld for occupancy (Results, Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Why was the zld-RNAi GAF ChIP-seq experiment performed in the sfGFP-GAF(N) background and then compared to the sfGFP-GAF(C) dataset? This experiment should be repeated with the proper control, GAF ChIP-seq in the sfGFP-GAF(C) background. Furthermore, it is concerning that it seems the authors simply performed the zld-RNAi GAF ChIP-seq experiment and then compared back to a previously generated GAF-ChIP-seq dataset; ChIP-seq is an assay subject to a large amount of technical variance and if experiments are to be quantitatively compared as they are in the manuscript, they must be performed at the same time and processed in parallel to minimize this variance. Were the ZLD ChIP-seq experiments and controls performed at the same time and processed in parallel?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have repeated the ChIP-seq for sfGFP-GAF(N) in the <italic>zld</italic> RNAi background with paired heterozygous <italic>sfGFP-GAF(N)</italic> controls. In our Zld ChIP-seq experiment, we performed the ChIP-seq for Zld in the GAF<sup>deGradFP</sup> and paired homozygous sfGFP-GAF(N) controls in parallel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why are the authors not utilizing input controls in these ChIP-seq comparisons? Instead of using CPM, why not display fold change over input? This might be a more robust way of dealing with technical differences that lead to global changes as a result of IP efficiency, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously published ChIP-seq data for Zld at NC14 (Harrison et al., 2011) and GAF in S2 cells (Fuda et al., 2015) that we used for comparisons to our ChIP-seq in the paper did not have publicly available input controls. Therefore, we used CPM normalization for all ChIP-seq data so that we would have a consistent normalization method for ChIP-seq data throughout the paper. Upon revision we have decided to use z-score normalization for all ChIP-seq heatmaps. With our new ChIP-seq data for GAF in a <italic>zld</italic> RNAi background with paired controls using spike-in and z-score normalization we no longer observe a global decrease in GAF signal in the <italic>zld</italic>-RNAi background. However, we continue to observe a global decrease in Zld ChIP signal in GAF knockdown embryos compared to controls using both z-score normalized and input normalization heatmap generation. For consistency, we used z-score normalization throughout.</p></body></sub-article></article>
