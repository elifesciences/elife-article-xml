nutrients, especially those not readily biosynthesized, is a critical physiological process for maintaining homeostasis. Numerous studies have indicated that intestinal absorption is mediated by various membrane transporters. Citrate, a crucial bioactive compound produced as an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, is absorbed in the small intestine through carrier-mediated systems because of its high hydrophilicity. While the luminal absorption of citrate is mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1/SLC13A2), the mechanism governing the release of the transported citrate into the bloodstream remains unknown. Here, we explored the transporters responsible for intestinal citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, focusing on highly expressed orphan transporters in the small intestine as candidates. Consequently, SLC35G1, originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1, a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, was found to play a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport was diminished by chloride ions at physiologically relevant extracellular concentrations. This suggests that SLC35G1, to our best knowledge, is the first transporter identified to be extremely sensitive to chloride ions among those functioning on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. This study provides valuable insights into the intestinal absorption of citrate and significantly contributes to elucidating the poorly understood molecular basis of the intestinal absorption system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SLC35G1</kwd><kwd>intestinal absorption</kwd><kwd>citrate</kwd><kwd>highly chloride-sensitive</kwd><kwd>basolateral membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008731</institution-id><institution>Nakatomi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasujima</surname><given-names>Tomoya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SLC35G1 is the first highly chloride-sensitive transporter localized on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, responsible for citrate absorption.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Citrate plays a crucial role as a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, contributing to the generation of metabolizable energy. Since citrate is obtained not only through biosynthesis but also from the diet, the existence of an intestinal absorption system has long been acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Browne et al., 1978</xref>). Luminal absorption is predominantly mediated by Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent dicarboxylate transporter 1 (NaDC1/SLC13A2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Pajor, 2006</xref>; however, the transporter responsible for the release of citrate and its metabolites across the basolateral membrane remains unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Pajor, 2014</xref>). SLC62A1, which was initially recognized as a pyrophosphate transporter linked to joint mineralization, has recently been reported to facilitate citrate efflux in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Szeri et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is important to note that the role of SLC62A1 has been mainly implicated in osteoblasts, prostate, skeletal muscle, brain, and the cardiovascular system. It may have the major role in the systemic disposition of citrate rather than the intestinal absorption. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying citrate absorption at the basolateral membrane, we explored the transporters implicated in the process. Our study provides novel insights into basolateral membrane transporters, addressing a previously poorly understood aspect in intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To identify a novel citrate transporter expressed in the small intestine, we conducted a comprehensive in silico screening to narrow down candidate orphan transporters. This initial screening involved bioinformatics analysis of gene expression database to identify candidate transporters that showed significant expression in intestine but were not or little characterized previously. Following the in silico screening, we cloned the candidate transporters, had them transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and evaluated them for citrate transport activity by [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate uptake assay. Through this process, we discovered that SLC35G1, a member of the solute carrier (SLC) 35 family and originally identified as a partner of stromal interaction molecule 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</xref>), is capable of transporting citrate at the plasma membrane. While the functions of nucleoside-sugar transporters on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane have been identified for certain SLC35 family members, including SLC35A, SLC35B, SLC35C, and SLC35D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ishida and Kawakita, 2004</xref>), the roles of SLC35E, SLC35F, and SLC35G have not yet been fully elucidated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. SLC35G1 was indicated to be mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the earlier study, in which SLC35G1 was tagged with GFP. A possibility is that SLC35G1 was wrongly directed to ER due to the modulation in the study. For the functional analysis, we first established Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells stably expressing SLC35G1. Using these cells, we observed a linear increase in SLC35G1-mediated citrate uptake with time, specifically during the first 10 min in Hanks’ solution mimicking the cytosolic ion content by eliminating Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The acidic condition (pH 5.5) was used to gain sufficient uptake for functional analysis. Therefore, the uptake at 10 min was evaluated in subsequent studies. A kinetic analysis revealed that the SLC35G1-specific uptake of citrate exhibited saturation kinetics, with a <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of 1.10 nmol/min/mg protein and a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 519 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, the specific uptake of citrate by SLC35G1 was extensively inhibited by extracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with an <italic>IC</italic><sub>50</sub> value of 6.7 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Melkikh and Sutormina, 2008</xref>), the Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration is lower in the cytosol (5 mM) than in the extracellular conditions (120 mM). Therefore, SLC35G1 could be a potential citrate exporter. It is notable that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the use of K-gluconate in place of Na-gluconate, which induces plasma membrane depolarization, had no impact on the specific uptake, suggesting that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport is independent of membrane potential. Additionally, we examined the effect of various compounds (200 μM), to explore the potential role of SLC35G1 in their transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The tested compounds were TCA cycle intermediates (fumarate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, pyruvate, and succinate) as substrate candidate carboxylates analogous to citrate, diverse anionic compounds (BSP, DIDS, probenecid, pravastatin, and taurocholate) as those that might be substrates or inhibitors, and diverse cationic compounds (cimetidine, quinidine, and verapamil) as those that are least likely to interact with SLC35G1. Among them, certain anionic compounds significantly reduced SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake, suggesting that they may interact with SLC35G1. However, we could not identify any structural features commonly shared by these compounds, except that they have anionic moieties. At the concentration of 200 μM, competing substrates with an affinity comparable to that of citrate could inhibit SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake by about 30%. Therefore, it is likely that the compounds that did not exhibit a significant effect have no affinity or at least a lower affinity than citrate to SLC35G1. SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake showed pH dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To investigate whether SLC35G1 utilizes an H<sup>+</sup> gradient as a driving force for citrate transport, we examined the effect of the protonophore nigericin in the uptake solution at pH 5.5 to dissipate the H<sup>+</sup> gradient across the plasma membrane. However, treatment with nigericin did not affect the specific uptake of citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), excluding this possibility. Based on these, it is likely that SLC35G1 is a facilitative transporter, although we cannot exclude another possibility that its sensitivity to extracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> might imply its operation as a citrate/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchanger. Given that one carboxylate can be protonated with a p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of 5.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Contreras-Trigo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), SLC35G1 may preferably transport dianionic citrate, like NaDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Pajor and Sun, 1996</xref>). Finally, we determined the role of SLC35G1 in the transcellular transport of citrate at the basolateral membranes using SLC35G1-transfected polarized MDCKII cells on Transwell permeable membrane filters. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, SLC35G1 predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCKII cells. Transport studies were performed under pH gradient conditions (apical pH 5.5 and basal pH 7.4) in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> (144 mM) to mimic intestinal physiological conditions. SLC35G1-transfected cells showed no significant change in intracellular citrate accumulation from the apical side, compared to mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). However, apical-to-basolateral transcellular transport was significantly higher in SLC35G1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). On the other hand, SLC35G1 overexpression affected neither intracellular accumulation nor transcellular transport from the basolateral side. This is reasonable since the basolaterally localized SLC35G1 operates for efflux but not for uptake in the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the extracellular environment. These results suggest that SLC35G1 plays a role in the intestinal absorption of citrate at the basolateral membrane as an exporter under physiological conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional characteristics of SLC35G1 stably expressed in MDCKII cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the SLC35 members and identified functions.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that SLC35G1 is highly expressed in the digestive tract, especially in the upper part of the small intestine, including the duodenum and jejunum, followed by the testis and pancreas. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining of the human jejunum clearly showed that SLC35G1 is localized on the basolateral membrane, as indicated by the co-localization of ATP1A1, a marker protein on the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate the physiological impact of SLC35G1 on intestinal citrate absorption, we examined the effect of SLC35G1 knockdown on citrate uptake in human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, a commonly used model for studying intestinal absorbency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Yee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), in the absence of Cl<sup>-</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, citrate uptake was significantly reduced following RNA interference with siRNAs targeting SLC35G1 mRNA, providing evidence of the involvement of SLC35G1 in intestinal citrate absorption. The reduction in citrate uptake was not indicative of off-target effects, as multiple siRNAs with distinct nucleic acid sequences yielded similar reductions. Moreover, the expression of SLC35G1 mRNA was reduced by these siRNAs, confirming successful silencing of SLC35G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The correlation between the decrease in citrate uptake and mRNA levels suggests that SLC35G1 is primarily involved in citrate uptake. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that endogenous SLC35G1 in polarized Caco-2 cells cultured on Transwell membranes was also localized on the basolateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that intestinal citrate transport at the basolateral membrane is primarily mediated by SLC35G1. Additionally, it acts cooperatively with NaDC1, which is reported to be highly expressed in the jejunum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Pajor, 1995</xref>), for citrate absorption on the apical membrane, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Role of SLC35G1 in intestinal citrate absorption.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of SLC35G1 mRNA expression in various human tissues using quantitative real-time PCR.

Briefly, an RT reaction was performed to obtain a cDNA mixture, using 1 µg of the human intestine total RNA (BioChain Institute, Newark, CA), an oligo(dT) primer, and the highly efficient reverse transcriptase ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The SLC35G1 cDNA was then amplified by PCR, using KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo) and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAGATGCGGCCTCAGGACAG</named-content>-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAGCCTCCCCACCCATATCCC</named-content>-3′. These primers were designed based on the GenBank sequences for SCL35G1 (accession number: NM_001134658.2).

Briefly, MDCKII cells were transfected with the plasmid carrying the SLC35G1 cDNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 as a transfection reagent. The cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 800 μg/mL G418 for 2–3 weeks. Subsequently, G418-resistant clones were selected and assessed for the transport of [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate. MDCKII cells stably expressing SLC35G1 with high citrate transport activity were used in subsequent studies.</p><p>MDCKII cells stably expressing SLC35G1 (1.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, 1 mL/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 48 h until they reached confluence. For standard transport assays, cells were preincubated in substrate-free uptake buffer, which was Hanks’ solution modified to reflect cytosolic conditions (142.06 mmol/L K-gluconate, 0.812 mmol/L MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.379 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.441 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.952 mM Ca-gluconate, 25 mM D-glucose) and supplemented with 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES; pH 5.5), for 5 min. Subsequently, uptake assays were initiated by replacing the substrate-free uptake buffer with an uptake buffer containing a [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate (0.25 mL). For initial uptake analysis experiments, the uptake period was set to 10 min in the initial phase, in which uptake was in proportion to time. Other experiments were conducted in a time-dependent manner, as specified. When examining the effects of various compounds on citrate uptake, the test compounds were added to the buffer only during the uptake period. All procedures were performed at 37°C. Assays were stopped by adding 2 mL of ice-cold substrate-free uptake buffer, followed by two washes with an additional 2 mL of the same buffer. The cells were solubilized in 0.5 mL of 0.2 mol/L NaOH solution containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting for uptake evaluation. The cellular protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (3). In experiments to examine the effect of ionic conditions, K-gluconate in the control uptake solution was replaced as indicated. Uptake solutions were supplemented with 10 mM MES (pH 6.5 and below) or 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0 and above) in experiments to examine the effect of pH. In experiments to examine the effect of nigericin as an agent for intracellular acidification, a mannitol-based buffer (250 mM mannitol, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM D-glucose, 10 µM nigericin, and 20 mM MES) was used and uptake assays were conducted for 10 min at pH 5.5 and 37°C in the presence (10 μM) or absence (control) of nigericin after pretreatment for 5 min with or without nigericin under the same conditions. To estimate nonspecific uptake, uptake assays were conducted in mock cells transfected with an empty pCI-neo vector. The specific uptake of citrate by SLC35G1 was estimated by subtracting the uptake in mock cells from that in SLC35G1-transfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Transcellular transport study</title><p>MDCKII cells were seeded at a density of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells on each polycarbonate membrane insert in a 12-well Transwell plate and cultured for 5 days.

To initiate transcellular transport from the apical side to the basolateral side, 0.5 mL of the Hanks’ solution (pH 5.5) containing [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate was replaced in the apical chamber. For transport in the opposite direction (basolateral side to apical side), 1.5 mL of Hanks’ solution (pH 7.4) containing [<sup>14</sup>C]citrate was replaced in the basal chamber. To monitor transcellular transport, samples (100 µL from basal chamber and 50 µL from the apical chamber) were periodically collected, replenishing each collected volume with an equal volume of fresh buffer. At the end of the transport study, the assays were stopped by adding ice-cold Hanks’ solution (1 mL for the apical chamber and 3 mL for the basolateral chamber), followed by washing the cells twice with the same buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 mL of 0.2 M NaOH solution containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 1 hr.

The studies presented in this manuscript identify SLC35G1 as the most likely transporter that mediates the release of absorbed citrate from intestinal cells into the serosal side. This fills an important gap in our current knowledge on the transcellular absorption of dietary citrate. The exclusive localization of the transporter in the basolateral membrane of human intestinal cells and the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and the inhibition of the transporter function by chloride support this conclusion.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(i) The substrate specificity experiments have been done with relatively low concentrations of potential competing substrates, considering the relatively low affinity of the transporter for citrate. Given that NaDC1 brings in not only citrate as a divalent anion and also other divalent anions such as succinate, it is possible that SLC35G1 is responsible for the release of not only citrate but also other dicarboxylates. However the substrate specificity studies show that the dicarboxylates tested did not compete with citrate, meaning that SLC35G1 is selective for the citrate (2-), but this conclusion might be flawed because of the low concentration of the competing substrates used in the experiment. Furthermore, the apical NaDC1 is not selective for citrate; in fact, it transports citrate with a much lower affinity than it transports dicarboxylates such as succinate. If what the authors suggest that SLC35G1 is selective for citrate is correct, there must be another transporter for the efflux of dicarboxylates. The authors should have performed a dose-response experiment for the dicarboxylates tested as potential substrates before making the conclusion that SLC35G1 is selective for citrate.</p><p>(ii) The authors have used MDCK cells for assessment of the transcellular transfer of citrate via SLC35G1, but it is not clear whether this cell line expresses NaDC1 in the apical membrane as the enterocytes do. Even though the authors expressed SLC35G1 ectopically in MDCK cells and showed that the transporter localizes to the basolateral membrane, the question as to how citrate actually enters the apical membrane for SLC35G1 in the other membrane to work remains unanswered.</p><p>(iii) The role of chloride in the efflux of citrate remains not evaluated in detail. Similarly, the potential role of membrane potential in the transport function of SLC35G1 remains unknown. Since the SLC35G1-mediated uptake appears to be similar in the presence and absence of potassium, the authors argue that membrane potential has no role in the transport process. Since it is proposed that the divalent citrate is the substrate for the transporter, it is difficult to reconcile with the conclusion that the membrane potential has no impact on the transport process, especially given the fact that no other exchangeable anion has been shown or suggested. Even if chloride is the potential exchangeable anion, it still begs the question as to the stoichiometry of citrate:chloride if membrane potential plays no role. Obviously, additional work is needed to figure out the actual transport mechanism for SLC35G1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98853.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors convincingly show that SLC35G1 mediates uptake of citrate which is dependent on pH and chloride concentration.

However, this comparison has weaknesses when considering the physiological pH for SLC35G1 and NaDC1. NaDC1 binds citrate at a pH of ~5.4 (the pKa of citrate is 5.4, so there is a lot of dianionic citrate present under physiological circumstances). SLC35G1 binds citrate under pH conditions of ~7.5, where a very small amount of dianionic citrate is present. The data clearly show a pH dependence of transport, and the authors rule out proton coupling, but the discrepancy between the pH dependence and the physiological expectations should be addressed/commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. Citrate exists mostly in its trianionic form under near neutral pH conditions in biological fluids, as you pointed out. Its dianionic form represents only a small portion (about 1/100) of total citrate due to the pKa. However, significant SLC35G1-specific uptake was observed under near neutral pH conditions (Figure 1G). Therefore, although SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport is less efficient under physiologically relevant near neutral pH conditions, it could still play a role particularly in the intestinal absorption process, in which the concentration gradient of dianionic citrate could be maintained by continuous supply by NaDC1-mediated apical uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rationale for the series of compounds tested in Figure 1F, which includes metabolites with carboxylate groups, a selection of drugs including anion channel inhibitors and statins, and bile acids, is not described. Moreover, the lessons drawn from this experiment are vague and should be expanded upon. It is not clear what, if anything, the compounds that reduce citrate uptake have in common.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting the need for clarity regarding the compounds tested in Figure 1F. The tested compounds were TCA cycle intermediates (fumarate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, pyruvate, and succinate) as substrate candidate carboxylates analogous to citrate, diverse anionic compounds (BSP, DIDS, probenecid, pravastatin, and taurocholate) as those that might be substrates or inhibitors, and diverse cationic compounds (cimetidine, quinidine, and verapamil) as those that are least likely to interact with SLC35G1. Among them, certain anionic compounds significantly reduced SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake, suggesting that they may interact with SLC35G1. However, we could not identify any structural features commonly shared by these compounds, except that they have anionic moieties. We acknowledge that it requires further elaboration to clarify such structural features. We have revised the relevant section on p. 3 (line 25 - 32) to include these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transporter is described as a facilitative transporter, but this is not established definitively.

While we have described SLC35G1 as a facilitative transporter based on our current data, we acknowledge that this has not been definitively proven, as you pointed out, and we cannot exclude the possibility that its sensitivity to extracellular Cl- might imply its operation as a citrate/Cl- exchanger. To examine the possibility, we would need to manipulate the chloride ion gradient across the plasma membrane. Particularly, generating an outward Cl- gradient to see if it could enhance citrate uptake could be a potential strategy. However, current techniques do not allow us to effectively generate the Cl- gradient, thus preventing us from conclusively verifying this possibility. We recognize the importance of further investigating this aspect in future studies. Your suggestion highlights an important area for additional research to fully understand the transport mechanism of SLC35G1.

As you pointed out, we cannot rule out the possibility that dicarboxylates might be recognized by SLC35G1 with low affinity as the tested concentration was relatively low. However, at the concentration of 200 μM, competing substrates with an affinity comparable to that of citrate could inhibit SLC35G1-specific citrate uptake by about 30%. Therefore, it is likely that the compounds that did not exhibit significant effect have no affinity or at least lower affinity than citrate to SLC35G1. Further studies should explore a broader range of concentrations for potential substrates including those with lower affinity. It would help clarify the substrate recognition characteristics of SLC35G1 and if it indeed has a unique preference for citrate over dicarboxylates. We have additionally mentioned that on p. 3, line 32 – 35.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) The authors have used MDCK cells for assessment of the transcellular transfer of citrate via SLC35G1, but it is not clear whether this cell line expresses NaDC1 in the apical membrane as the enterocytes do.

The mechanism of apical citrate entry in MDCKII cells is unknown, although NaDC1 or a similar transporter may be involved. However, this set of experiments have successfully demonstrated the basolateral localization of SLC35G1 and its operation for citrate efflux. Attempts to clarify the apical entry mechanism may need to be included in future studies for more detailed characterization of the model system using MDCKII cells. This would help in fully understanding the transcellular transport system for citrate. Investigation using Caco-2 cells or MDCKII cells double transfected with NaDC1 and SLC35G1 would also need to be induced in future studies to gain more definitive insights into the transcellular transport mechanism for citrate in the intestine, delineating the suggested cooperative role of NaDC1 and SLC35G1. We would be grateful for your understanding of our handling regarding this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) There is one other transporter that has already been identified for the efflux of citrate in some cell types in the literature (SLC62A1, PLoS Genetics; 10.1371/journal.pgen.1008884), but no mention of this transporter has been made in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up the relevance of SLC62A1, which has recently been identified as a citrate efflux transporter in some cell types (PLoS Genet, 16, e1008884, 2020).

Using a combination of cellular transport assays, they show that SLC35G1 can mediate citrate transport in small intestinal cell lines. Furthermore, they investigate its expression and localization in both human tissue and cell lines. Limited evidence exists to date on both SLC35G1 and citrate uptake in the small intestine, therefore this study is an important contribution to both fields. However, the main claims by the authors are only partially supported by experimental evidence.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors convincingly show that SLC35G1 mediates uptake of citrate which is dependent on pH and chloride concentration. Putting their initial findings in a physiological context, they present human tissue expression data of SLC35G. Their Transwell assay indicates that SLC35G1 is a citrate exporter at the basolateral membrane.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Further confirmation and clarification are required to claim that the SLC indeed exports citrate at the basolateral membrane as concluded by the authors. Most experiments measure citrate uptake, but the authors state that SLC35G1 is an exporter, mostly based on the lack of uptake at physiological conditions faced at the basolateral side. The Transwell assay in Figure 1L is the only evidence that it indeed is an exporter. However, in this experiment, the applied chloride concentration was not according to the proposed model (120 mM at the basolateral side). The Transwell assay, or a similar assay measuring export instead of import, should be carried out in knockdown cells to prove that the export indeed occurs through SLC35G1 and not through an indirect effect. Related to the mentioned chloride sensitivity, it is unclear how the proposed model works if the SLC faces high chloride conditions under physiological conditions though it is inhibited by chloride.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting these important points. We used the Cl--rich medium in transcellular transport studies, as stated in the relevant section in Meterials and Methods (p. 6, line 2 – 5). The Cl- concentration (144 mM) was comparable to the physiological concentration in extracellular body fluids. To clarify that experimental condition, we have additionally noted that in the text (p. 4, line 9) and the legends of Figs. 1K and 1L. The results indicate that basolaterally localized SLC35G1 can mediate citrate export effectively under the Cl--rich extracellular condition. The transport mechanism regulated by Cl- is unclear, but it is difficult to further clarify the mechanism at this time. We recognize the importance of further investigating the aspect in future studies, including the possibility that SLC35G1 might be a citrate/Cl- exchanger, as pointed out by Reviewer #1 (3rd comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The figures are very tiny and difficult to see.

The mechanism for the entry of citrate into MDCK cells used in the present manuscript is not known. If the authors prefer to use MDCK cells because of their superior use for polarization, they can use a double transfection (NaDC1 and SLC35G1) to differentially express the two transporters in the apical versus and basolateral membrane and then use the cells for trans cellular transport of citrate.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our reply to your second review comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The substrate specificity experiments should use concentrations higher than 0.2 mM for competing dicarboxylates because the Km for citrate is only 0.5 mM. It is likely that NaDC1 brings in citrate and other dicarboxylates into enterocytes and then SLC35G1 mediates the efflux of these metabolic intermediates into blood.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our reply to your first review comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) One major aspect of the transport function of this newly discovered citrate efflux transporter that has not been explored is the role of membrane potential in the transport function. The transporter is not coupled to Na or K or even H; so then the transport of citrate via this transporter must be electrogenic. Of course, this would be perfect for the transporter to function in the efflux of citrate because of the inside-negative membrane potential, but the authors need to show that the transporter is electrogenic. This can be examined through Caco-2 cells and/or MDCK cells expressing SLC35G1 and examining the impact of changes in membrane potential (valinomycin and K) on the transport of citrate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. As shown in Figure 1D, the use of K-gluconate in place of Na-gluconate, which induces plasma membrane depolarization, had no impact on the specific uptake of citrate, suggesting that SLC35G1-mediated citrate transport is independent of membrane potential.
