organized within the mammalian brain is poorly understood. Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the ‘postsynaptic density’ (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane, thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a ‘synaptoplasm’ consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes, and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of up to 60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft. Together, these information-rich tomographic maps present a detailed molecular framework for the coordinated activity of synapses in the adult mammalian brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron tomography</kwd><kwd>cryoCLEM</kwd><kwd>postsynaptic density</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBF005/1046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>René AW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/001aqnf71</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V022644/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>René AW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011151/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovatt</surname><given-names>Charlie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/202932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/695568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>529085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Komiyama</surname><given-names>Noboru H</given-names></name><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>John AG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/648432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>John AG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kukulski</surname><given-names>Wanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The molecular composition of glutamatergic synapses is highly complex, reflecting the many different molecular machines required to subserve diverse synaptic functions, including learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ebrahimi and Okabe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakahata and Yasuda, 2018</xref>). Indeed, more than a thousand different synaptic proteins have been identified in the mouse and human forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayés et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roy et al., 2018</xref>). How this ensemble of macromolecules is structurally organized within adult mammalian brain synapses is currently unknown.</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has the potential to reveal the native 3-dimensional molecular architecture of mammalian brain synapses, but with the limitation that samples must be vitreous and less than ~300 nm thick. Although primary neurons grown on EM grids can overcome this constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tao et al., 2018</xref>), the environment in which in vitro cultured cells grow differs markedly from tissues. Indeed, primary neurons in vitro appear unable to reach the molecular and functional maturity of neurons from the brain itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris and Pettit, 2007</xref>). While brain synapses can be isolated by biochemical fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whittaker, 1959</xref>), these enrichment steps delay cryopreservation by at least an hour and involve non-physiological buffers that together cause deterioration of certain macromolecular structures. An example is the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules, which rapidly depolymerize within a matter of 1–3 minutes if the provision of nucleotide triphosphates or cellular integrity becomes compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchison, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pollard and Mooseker, 1981</xref>).</p><p>To minimize deterioration of tissue samples, we developed an ‘ultra-fresh’ sample preparation workflow without fractionation by combining mouse genetic labelling of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) with cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryoCLEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Guided by the mouse genetic fluorescent label in our cryoCLEM workflow, we also reconstructed in-tissue cryoET volumes of synapses from vitreous cryo-sections of mouse cortex and hippocampus. These ultra-fresh and in-tissue structural data indicate that the near-physiological molecular architecture of glutamatergic synapses was highly variable in composition, copy number, and distribution of organelles and macromolecular assemblies. The molecular density of protein complexes in the postsynaptic cytoplasm was variable and did not indicate a conserved higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane corresponding to a postsynaptic density (PSD).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (CryoCLEM)-targeted cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of mouse forebrain synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the ‘ultra-fresh’ preparation of synapses for cryoCLEM. <italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> knockin mice were culled, forebrain was dissected, homogenized in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and plunge-frozen on cryoEM grids. 2 min was the time taken to cull, dissect, and cryopreserve samples on EM grids.

we used knockin mice, in which the gene encoding Psd95 (<italic>Dlg4</italic>) was engineered to include an in-frame, C-terminal fusion of the fluorescent tag EGFP (<italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Psd95 is a membrane-associated cytoplasmic protein that concentrates exclusively within mature glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El Husseini et al., 2000</xref>) and forms supercomplexes with ionotropic glutamate receptors that reside in the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frank et al., 2016</xref>). Fresh <italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> mouse forebrains, encompassing cortex and hippocampus, were homogenized in ice-cold ACSF, then immediately vitrified on EM grids. Sample preparation was completed within 2 min, the time taken to cull the mouse, dissect and homogenize the forebrain, and plunge-freeze the sample on a blotted cryoEM grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The GFP signal from <italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> knockin mice pinpoints the location of mature glutamatergic synapses without over-expression or any detectable effect on synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, cryoEM grids were imaged on a cryogenic fluorescence microscope (cryoFM), revealing Psd95-GFP puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), absent in WT control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which resembled those observed by confocal fluorescent imaging of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Using a cryoCLEM workflow, the same grids were then imaged by cryoEM, and fluorescent Psd95-GFP puncta were mapped onto the cryoEM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These cryoCLEM images showed Psd95-GFP puncta that were invariably associated with membrane-bound subcellular compartments (100–1300 nm diameter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To resolve the molecular architecture within Psd95-containing puncta, we acquired 93 Psd95-GFP cryoCLEM-guided cryo-electron tomographic tilt series from five adult mouse forebrains. Aligned tilt series were reconstructed to produce three-dimensional tomographic maps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3 fig1video4 fig1video5 fig1video6 fig1video7">Figure 1—videos 1–7</xref> showing representative tomographic volumes of ultra-fresh synapses). As expected, all GFP-positive membranes were attached to a neighbouring membrane, of which 78% were closed compartments and enriched in synaptic vesicles that characterize the presynaptic compartment. All but three of the presynaptic compartments (96%) contained docked synaptic vesicles tethered 2–8 nm from the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, our Psd95-GFP cryoCLEM workflow enabled identification of the pre- and post-synaptic membranes of glutamatergic synapses (hereon referred to as PreSM and PoSM, respectively).</p><p>The high quality of the tomographic maps enabled assignment of cytoskeletal elements within the synapse, including extensive networks of filamentous actin (F-actin). These were identifiable with a diameter of 7 nm and apparent helical arrangement of subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanson, 1967</xref>) in all PoSM compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and in 49 ± 7% (mean ± SEM, n=5 mice) of PreSM compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In PreSM compartments that lacked an apparent F-actin cytoskeletal network, we cannot exclude the possibility that actin is present in monomeric form or very short actin filaments, which cannot be unambiguously identified in our tomograms. Microtubules were identified (25 nm diameter) in 15 ± 2% of PreSM compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and F</xref>), but as expected, were absent from the PoSM. Notwithstanding the mechanical stress of detaching synaptic terminals to cryopreserve whole synapses, this extensive actin and microtubular cytoskeleton corroborates the maintenance of macromolecular structures near to their physiological context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular crowding within the synapse</title><p>We first assessed the overall architecture of macromolecules within the synapse by measuring macromolecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith and Langmore, 1992</xref>) (see methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> detailing how molecular density was measured and how confounding errors were avoided). Based on conventional EM experiments of fixed, dehydrated, heavy-metal-stained tissue, glutamatergic synapses are marked by the presence of a 30–50 nm layer of densely packed proteins opposite the active zone on the cytoplasmic side of the PoSM, called the postsynaptic density (PSD) that defines every glutamatergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheng and Kim, 2011</xref>). However, within fresh, adult brain synapse structures reported here, this region of higher density at the postsynaptic membrane was not a conserved feature of all Psd95-GFP-containing glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and see also the central density profiles of each synapse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">9</xref>). The distribution of molecular densities was variable with half the population of synapses showing a significant relative increase in molecular density in proximal versus distal regions (5–30 nm versus 50–200 nm from the PoSM) of cytoplasm in the postsynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The remaining subpopulations of synapses did not have a higher density or contained a significantly lower relative molecular density at regions proximal to the PoSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test with Bonferroni correction, p&lt;0.05, n=682 and 5673 voxels). These data suggest that a higher density of proteins characteristic of the PSD is not a conserved feature with adult mouse brain glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To examine further molecular crowding within anatomically intact postsynaptic compartments, fresh, acute brain tissues of 7 adult <italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> mice were cryopreserved by high-pressure freezing. Next, 70–150 nm thin, vitreous cryo-sections of the cortex and hippocampus were collected by cryo-ultramicrotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zuber et al., 2005</xref>). Glutamatergic synapses were identified by cryoCLEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and cryo-electron tomograms were collected revealing the native in-tissue 3D architecture of glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2">Figure 2—videos 1–2</xref>). The PoSM was identified by cryoCLEM and the PreSM by the presence of numerous synaptic vesicles. These in-tissue 3D tomographic maps also resolved individual cytoskeletal elements, membrane proteins, and numerous other subcellular structures that were consistent with those observed in ultra-fresh synapse cryoET data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The in-tissue molecular architecture of glutamatergic synapses in the adult mammalian brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryoCLEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) workflow using thin vitreous cryo-sections from forebrains of adult <italic>Dlg4<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> knockin mice to determine the in-tissue architecture of glutamatergic synapses.

The PSD has been a defining structure of glutamatergic synapses and has been most frequently observed by conventional EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheng and Kim, 2011</xref>), including when using more recent methods that involve freeze-substitution into organic solvents, followed by heavy-metal staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). We addressed the hypothesis that the occurrence of a PSD might be related to sample preparation and staining techniques of conventional EM by preparing the same mouse brain samples for conventional EM and were indeed able to reproduce the conserved occurrence of a PSD. We, therefore, suggest that the appearance of a PSD in room temperature EM experiments could arise during sample preparation.

However, interpretation of synaptosome architectures may be compromised by lengthy sample preparation in non-physiological solutions that may cause a loss of cytoplasm and the native molecular architecture. Indeed, the marked absence of microtubules in synaptosomes is indicative of sample deterioration. It was also previously challenging to identify glutamatergic synapses definitively. Consequently, synaptosomes that lacked an apparent postsynaptic thickening were actively excluded from data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>More recent cryoCLEM and cryoET studies of primary neuronal cell cultures identified glutamatergic synapses with some but not all showing a subtly higher concentration of macromolecules juxtaposed to the PoSM relative to distal regions deep within the postsynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). These data were consistent with ultra-fresh synapse tomograms from adult brain, including the preservation of microtubules in the presynaptic compartment. A greater fraction of ultra-fresh adult synapses resembled the minority of primary neuronal synapses that lacked a relative increase in molecular crowding at the PoSM. In anatomically intact brain slice preparations that were nearer to the physiological state of adult brain, even fewer instances of synapses were observed with a relative increase in molecular crowding of the cytoplasm at the PoSM. We suggest that these subtle differences of molecular crowding are likely a consequence of synapse heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) or the source, in vitro cell culture versus adult brain, of central synapses. More broadly, these cryoET data were consistent in suggesting that a relatively higher concentration of proteins juxtaposed to the PoSM is neither conserved nor a defining feature of glutamatergic synapses.</p><p>The synaptic architectures reported here were nevertheless consistent with the existence of specialized protein nanodomains of particular synaptic constituents detected by fluorescence labeling, including Psd95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang et al., 2016</xref>).

Cleft height was highly variable and on average 65% greater than that observed by conventional EM, which is also likely explained by the harsh treatments and the well-characterised shrinkage associated with chemical fixation of tissues in conventional EM. More broadly, these comparisons highlight the advantages of combining recent advances in cryoET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turk and Baumeister, 2020</xref>) with genetic knock-in labelling to determine the molecular architecture of fresh tissues.</p><p>Notwithstanding the absence of a conserved PSD, the arrangement of prominent constituents, including branched F-actin networks, organelles, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and transsynaptic adhesion complexes, appeared to define the architecture of each glutamatergic synapse. Overall, the apparent variability of molecular and membrane architectures, from one synapse tomogram to the next, is in keeping with the enormous diversity of glutamatergic synapse types in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Since submission of our manuscript, several reports of synapse cryoET from within cultured primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Held et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Held et al., 2024b</xref>) and mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glynn et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsui et al., 2024</xref>) were prepared by cryoFIB-milling. These new datasets are largely consistent with the data reported here. While cryoFIB-milling has the advantage of overcoming the local knife damage caused by cryo-sectioning, it introduces amorphization across the whole sample that diminishes the information content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Amoudi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lovatt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lucas and Grigorieff, 2023</xref>).

Note, projecting multiple tomographic slices, often used to analyse molecular density of the synapse, will only provide accurate profiles of the cytoplasm if the PoSM is perfectly oriented in the <italic>z</italic>-direction of the tomographic volume. Inspecting the line profiles of each tomographic slice showed that the majority tomograms contained synapses that were slightly tilted with respect to the <italic>z</italic>-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We observed that projections of these synapses caused the PoSM membrane to smear resulting in erroneous cytoplasmic profiles that contained molecular density from the membrane itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This highlighted a risk of projecting multiple tomographic slices to measure molecular density within a specific compartment. We, therefore, avoided directly generating a 2D projection of multiple tomographic slices of each tomographic volume. Instead, to avoid this error, individual profiles of each tomographic slice were aligned to the plasma membrane peak before profiles were averaged to estimate the relative density of molecular crowding within sub-volumes of the PreSM and PoSM compartments of each synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

All membrane proteins with a long axis extending ~14 nm out of the membrane and an apparent two-fold symmetry axis were picked. The orientation of the normal vector to the membrane surface was determined to define the initial orientation of each subtomogram. The Euler angle defining the final in-plane rotation angle (phi in the av3 annotation) was randomized. The full set of subtomogram positions was split into two independent half sets, one for all odd and one for all even subtomogram numbers. The two half sets were processed independently. For initial alignment and averaging, subtomograms with a box size of 64 × 64 × 64 voxels (~76.4 × 76.4 × 76.4 nm<sup>3</sup>) were extracted from the respective tomograms and averaged. The initial average shows a long, thin stalk. After one iteration of alignment using a low pass filter of 30 Å and a complete in-plane angular search, twofold symmetry was applied for further iterations. During all steps of alignment and averaging, the missing wedge was modelled as the sum of the amplitude spectra determined from 100 randomly seeded noise positions for each tomogram. After six iterations, subtomograms with a box size of 96 × 96 × 96 voxels (~53.7 × 53.7 × 53.7 nm<sup>3</sup>) were re-extracted from tomograms with a voxel size of 5.97 Å. Subtomogram positions were reprojected onto the respective tomogram for visual inspection, and misaligned subtomogram positions as well as subtomograms that had converged to the same position were removed, reducing the final number of subtomograms to 2368 subtomograms (odd = 1182 and even = 1186). The two averages were then further refined for 4 iterations using a cylindrical mask tightly fit around the obtained structure and including the membrane and subsequently for six more iterations using a cylindrical mask excluding the membrane.

Examining every single Psd95-GFP puncta in our cryoCLEM dataset of 93 synapses marked a postsynaptic membrane that was also attached to a presynaptic membrane, suggesting synaptic contacts are established in the brain with a high avidity that is not affected by sample preparation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Software, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animals were treated in accordance with UK Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and NIH and ARRIVE guidelines.

They make several major interesting discoveries: polyhedral vesicles that have not been observed before in neurons; analysis of the intermembrane distance, and a link to potentiation, essentially updating distances reported from plastic-embedded specimen; and find that the postsynaptic density does not appear as a dense accumulation of proteins in all vitrified samples (less than half), a feature which served as a hallmark feature to identify excitatory plastic-embedded synapses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The presented work is thorough: the authors compare purified, endogenously labeled synapses to wild-type synapses to exclude artifacts that could arise through the homogenation step, and, in addition, analyse plastic embedded, stained synapses prepared using the same quick workflow, to ensure their findings have not been caused by way of purification of the synapses. Interestingly, the 'thick lines of PSD' are evident in most of their stained synapses.</p><p>(2) I commend the authors on the exceptional technical achievement of preparing frozen specimens from a mouse within two minutes.</p><p>(3) The approaches highlighted here can be used in other fields studying cell-cell junctions.</p><p>(4) The tomograms will be deposited upon publication which will enable neurobiologists and researchers from other fields to carry on data evaluation in their field of expertise since tomography is still a specialized skill and they collected and reconstructed over 100 excellent tomograms of synapses, which generates a wealth of information to be also used in future studies.</p><p>(5) The authors have identified ionotropic receptor positions and that they are linked to actin filaments, and appear to be associated with membrane and other cytosolic scaffolds, which is highly exciting.</p><p>(6) The authors achieved their aims to study neuronal excitatory synapses in great detail, were thorough in their experiments, and made multiple fascinating discoveries. They challenge dogmas that have been in place for decades and highlight the benefit of implementing and developing new methods to carefully understand the underlying molecular machines of synapses.</p><p>Impact on community:</p><p>The findings presented by Peukes et al. pertaining to synapse biology change dogmas about the fundamental understanding of synaptic ultrastructure. The work presented by the authors, particularly the associated change of intermembrane distance with potentiation and the distinct appearance of the PSD as an irregular amorphous 'cloud' will provide food for thought and an incentive for more analysis and additional studies, as will the discovery of large membranous and cytosolic protein complexes linked to ionotropic receptors within and outside of the synaptic cleft, which are ripe for investigation. The findings and tomograms available will carry far in the synapse fields and the approach and methods will move other fields outside of neurobiology forward. The method and impactful results of preparing cryogenic, unlabeled, unstained, near-native synapses may enable the study of how synapses function at high resolution in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100335.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peukes</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Redwood City</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lovatt</surname><given-names>Charlie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Rosalind Franklin Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Didcot</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leistner</surname><given-names>Conny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boulanger</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morado</surname><given-names>Dustin R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Science for Life Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stockholm</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>Martin JG</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Leeds</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leeds</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kukulski</surname><given-names>Wanda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Bern</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bern</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Fei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Komiyama</surname><given-names>Noboru H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>John AG</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Seth GN</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edinburgh</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>René AW</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Leeds</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leeds</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The authors survey the ultrastructural organization of glutamatergic synapses by cryo-ET and image processing tools using two complementary experimental approaches.

We apologise if we have omitted referencing or discussing any earlier cryoET work. This was certainly not our intention, and we include a more complete discussion of published cryoET work on synapses in our revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer is concerned that the synaptic vesicles in some synapse tomograms are “stretched” and that this may reflect poor preservation. We would like to point out that such non-spherical synaptic vesicles have also been previously reported in cryoET of primary neurons grown on EM grids (Tao et al., J. Neuro, 2018). Indeed, there is no reason per se to suppose synaptic vesicles are always spherical and there are many diverse families of proteins expressed at the synapse that shape membrane curvature (BAR domain proteins, synaptotagmin, epsins, endophilins and others). We will add further discussion of this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer regards ‘cryo-sectioning’ as outdated and cryoET data from these preparations as “poor quality”. We respectfully disagree. Preparing brain tissues for cryoET is generally considered to be challenging. The first successful demonstration of preparing such samples was before the advent of the cryoEM resolution revolution (with electron counting detectors) by Zuber et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,2005) preparing cryo-sections/CEMOVIS of in vitro brain cultures. We followed this technique to prepare tissue cryo-sections for cryoET in our manuscript. Recently, cryoFIB-SEM liftout has been developed as an alternative method to prepare tissue samples for cryoET (Mahamid et al., J. Struct. Biol., 2015) and only more recently this method became available to more laboratories. Both techniques introduce damage as has been described (Han et al., J. Microsc., 2008; Lucas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2023). Importantly no like-for-like, quantitative comparison of these two methodologies has yet been performed. We have recently demonstrated that the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils within human brain is preserved down to the protein fold level in samples prepared by cryo-sectioning (Gilbert et al., Nature, 2024). We will add further detail on the process by which we excluded poor quality tomograms from our analysis, which we described in detail in our methods section.</p><p>The reviewer asks what the physiological effect is of adding 20% w/v ~40,000 Da dextran? This is a reasonable concern since this could in principle exert osmotic pressure on the tissue sample. While we did not investigate this ourselves, earlier studies have (Zuber <italic>et al</italic>, 2005) showing cell membranes were not damaged by and did not have any detectable effect on cell structure in the presence of this concentration of dextran.</p><p>The reviewer is not convinced by our analysis of the apparent molecular density of macromolecules in the postsynaptic compartment that in conventional EM is called the postsynaptic density. However, the reviewer provides no reasoning for this assessment nor alternative approaches that could be attempted. We would like to add that we have tested multiple different approaches to objectively measure molecular crowding in cryoET data, that give comparable results. We believe that our conclusion – that we do not observe an increased molecular density conserved at the postsynaptic membrane, and that the PSD that we and others observed by conventional EM does not correspond to a region of increased molecular density - is well supported by our data. We and the other reviewers consider this an important and novel observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review)</bold>:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors set out to visualize the molecular architecture of the adult forebrain glutamatergic synapses in a near-native state.

By thorough quantification of tomograms from plunge- and high-pressure frozen samples, the authors show that the previously reported 'post-synaptic density' does not occur at high frequency and therefore not a defining feature of a glutamatergic synapse.</p><p>Subsequently, the authors are able to reproduce the frequency of post-synaptic density when preparing conventional electron microscopy samples, thus indicating that density prevalence is an artifact of sample preparation. The authors go on to describe the arrangement of cytoskeletal components, membraneous compartments, and ionotropic receptor clusters across synapses.</p><p>Demonstrating that the frequency of the post-synaptic density in prior work is likely an artifact and not a defining feature of glutamatergic synapses is significant. The descriptions of distributions and morphologies of proteins and membranes in this work may serve as a basis for the future of investigation for readers interested in these features.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors perform a rigorous quantification of the molecular density profiles across synapses to determine the frequency of the post-synaptic density. They prepare samples using two cryogenic electron microscopy sample preparation methods, as well as one set of samples using conventional electron microscopy methods. The authors can reproduce previous reports of the frequency of the post-synaptic density by conventional sample preparation, but not by either of the cryogenic methods, thus strongly supporting their claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their generous assessment of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use cryo-electron tomography to thoroughly investigate the complexity of purified, excitatory synapses. They make several major interesting discoveries: polyhedral vesicles that have not been observed before in neurons; analysis of the intermembrane distance, and a link to potentiation, essentially updating distances reported from plastic-embedded specimen; and find that the postsynaptic density does not appear as a dense accumulation of proteins in all vitrified samples (less than half), a feature which served as a hallmark feature to identify excitatory plastic-embedded synapses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1)The presented work is thorough: the authors compare purified, endogenously labeled synapses to wild-type synapses to exclude artifacts that could arise through the homogenation step, and, in addition, analyse plastic embedded, stained synapses prepared using the same quick workflow, to ensure their findings have not been caused by way of purification of the synapses. Interestingly, the 'thick lines of PSD' are evident in most of their stained synapses.</p><p>(2)I commend the authors on the exceptional technical achievement of preparing frozen specimens from a mouse within two minutes.</p><p>(3)The approaches highlighted here can be used in other fields studying cell-cell junctions.</p><p>(4)The tomograms will be deposited upon publication which will enable neurobiologists and researchers from other fields to carry on data evaluation in their field of expertise since tomography is still a specialized skill and they collected and reconstructed over 100 excellent tomograms of synapses, which generates a wealth of information to be also used in future studies.</p><p>(5) The authors have identified ionotropic receptor positions and that they are linked to actin filaments, and appear to be associated with membrane and other cytosolic scaffolds, which is highly exciting.</p><p>(6) The authors achieved their aims to study neuronal excitatory synapses in great detail, were thorough in their experiments, and made multiple fascinating discoveries. They challenge dogmas that have been in place for decades and highlight the benefit of implementing and developing new methods to carefully understand the underlying molecular machines of synapses.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors show informative segmentations in their figures but none have been overlayed with any of the tomograms in the submitted videos. It would be helpful for data evaluation to a broad audience to be able to view these together as videos to study these tomograms and extract more information. Deposition of segmentations associated with the tomgrams would be tremendously helpful to Neurobiologists, cryo-ET method developers, and others to push the boundaries.</p><p>Impact on community:</p><p>The findings presented by Peukes et al. pertaining to synapse biology change dogmas about the fundamental understanding of synaptic ultrastructure. The work presented by the authors, particularly the associated change of intermembrane distance with potentiation and the distinct appearance of the PSD as an irregular amorphous 'cloud' will provide food for thought and an incentive for more analysis and additional studies, as will the discovery of large membranous and cytosolic protein complexes linked to ionotropic receptors within and outside of the synaptic cleft, which are ripe for investigation. The findings and tomograms available will carry far in the synapse fields and the approach and methods will move other fields outside of neurobiology forward. The method and impactful results of preparing cryogenic, unlabelled, unstained, near-native synapses may enable the study of how synapses function at high resolution in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their supportive assessment of our manuscript.

These new datasets are largely consistent with the data reported here. CryoFIB-SEM has the advantage of overcoming the local knife damage caused by cryo-sectioning but introduces amorphization across the whole sample that diminishes the information content (Al-Amoudi et al., 2005; Lovatt et al., 2022; Lucas and Grigorieff, 2023). We have recently shown cryoET data is capable of revealing subnanometer resolution in-tissue protein structure from vitreous cryo-sections (Gilbert et al., 2024) and near-atomic structures within cryo-sections has recently been demonstrated (Elferich et al., 2025).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although there is variation between individual synapses, PSDs are clearly visible in several previous cryo-ET studies (even if it's not as striking as in heavy-metal stained samples). In fact, although the contrast of the images is generally poor, PSDs are also visible in several examples shown in Figure 1 - Supplement 3. Not being able to detect them seems more of a problem of the workflow used here than of missing features. The authors should also discuss why heavy-metal stains would accumulate on a non-existing structure (PSD) in conventional EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that apparent higher molecular density can be observed in example tomographic data of earlier cryoET studies. We also report individual examples of similar synapses in our dataset. A key strength of our approach is that we have assessed the molecular architecture of large numbers of adult brain synapses acquired by an unbiased approach (solely guided by PSD95 cryoCLEM), which indicate that a higher molecular density proximal to the postsynaptic membrane is not a conserved feature of glutamatergic synapses in the adult brain. There is no rationale for our cryoCLEM approach being a ‘problem of the workflow’.</p><p>The reviewer misunderstands the weaknesses of conventional/room temperature EM workflows (including resin-embedding and freeze substitution). It is unavoidable that most proteins are damaged by denaturation and/or washed away by washing samples in organic solvents (methanol/acetone that directly denature most proteins) during tissue preparation for conventional EM. It is therefore conceivable that in such preparations a relative increase in contrast proximal to the postsynaptic membrane (‘PSD’) would appear if cytoplasmic proteins were washed away during these harsh organic solved washing steps, leaving only those denatured proteins that are tethered to the postsynaptic membrane. It is not that the PSD is absent in cryoEM, rather that this difference in molecular crowding is not evident when tissues are imaged directly by cryoEM and have not undergone the harsh sample preparation required for conventional/room temperature EM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Whether the synapses examined here are in a more physiological state than those analyzed in other papers remains absolutely unclear. For example, the quality of the tomographic slice shown in Figure 1C is poor, with the majority of synaptic vesicles looking suspiciously elongated.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this in our public reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How were actin filaments segmented and quantified (e.g. for Fig 1E)? Apart from actin, can the authors show some examples of other macromolecular complexes (e.g. ribosomes) that they are able to identify in synapses (based on the info in supplementary tables)? Also, the mapping of glutamatergic receptors is not convincing, as the molecules were picked manually. To analyze their distribution, they should be mapped as comprehensively as possible by e.g. template matching.</p></disp-quote><p>Actin filaments identified by ~7 nm diameter with ~70° branch points were manually segmented in IMOD. The number of filaments was counted per postsynaptic compartment. We have amended the methods section to include this description.</p><p>“In the PoSM, F-actin formed a network with ~70° branch points (Figure 1–figure supplement 1C) likely formed by Arp2/3, as expected(Pizarro-Cerdá 2017,Fäßler 2020) . Putative filament copy number in the PoSM was estimated by manual segmentation in IMOD.” Manual picking was validated by the quality of the subtomogram average, which although only reached modest resolution (25 Å) is consistent with the identification of ionotropic glutamate receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the section &quot;Synaptic organelles&quot; the authors should provide some general information on the average number and size of synaptic vesicles (for the in-tissue tomograms).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided this information in the methods section:</p><p>“The average diameter of synaptic vesicles was 40.2 nm and the minimum and maximum dimensions ranged from 20 to 57.8 nm, measured from the outside of the vesicle that included ellipsoidal synaptic vesicles similar to those previously reported (Tao et al., 2018).” A detailed survey of the presynaptic compartment, including the number of presynaptic vesicles was not the focus of our manuscript. We have deposited all tomograms from our dataset for any further data mining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the &quot;flat tubular membranes compartments&quot; be attributed to ER? The angular vesicles certainly have a typical ER appearance, as such morphology has been seen in several cryo-ET studies of neuronal and non-neuronal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In neuronal cells we regard it as unsafe to describe an intracellular organelle as being endoplasmic reticulum on the basis of morphology alone (eg. Smooth ER described widely in conventional EM) because of the apparent diversity of distinct organelles. As described in our methods section, we could have confidence that a membrane compartment is ER when we observe ribosomes tethered to the membrane. In instances where flat/tubular membranes did not have associated ribosomes, we take the cautious view that there is not sufficient evidence to define these as ER.</p><p>Importantly, polyhedral vesicles were distinct from the flat/tubular membranes that resembled ER and are at present organelles of unknown identity. It will be important in future experiments to determine what are the protein constituents of these distinct organelle types to understand both their functions and how these distinct membrane architectures are assembled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, the sentences in lines 198-199 are simply wrong. Additionally, features of even higher membrane curvature are common in the ER (e.g. Collado et al., Dev Cell 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this excellent paper (Collado et al.). We agree that the sentence describing the curvature being higher than all other membranes except mitochondrial cristae is wrong. We have removed this sentence in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5)The quality of the tomographic data for the in-tissue sample is low, likely due to cryo-sectioning-induced artifacts, as extensively documented in the literature. Additionally, the authors used 20% dextran as cryo-protectant for high-pressure freezing, which contrasts with statements like those in lines 342-344. Given that several publications describing the in-tissue targeting of synapses (e.g. from Eric Gouaux's lab) are available, the quality of the tomographic data presented in this work is underwhelming and limits the conclusions that can be drawn, not providing a solid basis for future studies of in-tissue synapse targeting. However, the complete workflow (excluding the sectioning part) can be adapted for a cryo-FIB approach. The authors should discuss the limitations of their approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript preprint was deposited in the Biorxiv several years before Matsui/Gouaux’s recent ELife paper that reported a novel work-flow for in-tissue cryoET. It is difficult to directly compare data from our and Matsui/Gouaux’s approach because the latter reported a dataset of only 3 tomograms. Note also that Matsui/Gouaux followed our approach of using 20% dextran 40,000 as a cryo-preservative. The use of 20% dextran 40,000 as a cryo-protectant was first established by Zuber et al., 2005 (PMID: 16354833) and shown avoid hyper-osmotic pressure and cell membrane rupture. However, Matsui/Gouaux additionally included 5% sucrose in their cryoprotectant. We did not include sucrose as cryo-preservative because this exerts osmotic pressure and was not necessary to achieve vitreous tissues in our workflow.</p><p>Before high-pressure freezing, Matsui/Gouaux also incubated tissue slices in a HEPES-buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (that included 2 mM CaCl2 but did not include glucose as an energy source) for 1 h at room temperature to label AMPA receptors with Fab fragment-Au conjugates. Under these conditions, neurons can elicit both physiological and excitotoxic action potentials (even though AMPARs were themselves antagonised with ZK-200775). The absence of glucose is a concern, and it is unclear to what extent tissue viability is affected by this incubation step. In contrast, we chose to use an NMDG-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid for slice preparation and high-pressure freezing that is a well-established method for preserving neuronal viability (Ting et al., 2018).</p><p>We addressed the supposed limitations of cryo-sectioning versus cryoFIB-SEM in our public response. In particular, we have recently shown that cryo-sectioning produced a subnanometer resolution in-tissue structure of a protein, that has so far only been achieved for ribosome within cryoFIB-SEM sample preparations. A discussion of cryo-sectioning versus cryoFIB-SEM must be informed by new data that directly compares these methods, which is not the subject of our eLife paper. We also cite a recent preprint directly comparing cryoFIB-milled lamellae with cryo-sections and showing that near atomic resolution structures can also be obtained from the latter sample preparations (Elferich et al., 2025).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors show (in Supplementary) putative tethers connecting SV and the plasma membrane. Is it possible to improve the image quality (e.g. some sort of filtering or denoising) so that the tethers appear more obvious? Can the authors observe connectors linking synaptic vesicles?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested multiple iterative reconstruction and denoising approaches, including SIRT and noise2noise filtering in Isonet. We observed instances of macromolecular complexes linking one synaptic vesicle with another. However, there was no question we sought to answer by performing a quantitative analysis of these linkers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4F is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this omission. We have corrected this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Most quantifications lack statistical analyses. These need to be included, and only statistically significant findings should be discussed. Terms like &quot;significantly&quot; (e.g. Line 144) should only be used in these cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the term ‘significantly’ in the results section line 143 and line 166 in revised text, we cite figure 1H and 2F showing analyses in which we have in fact performed statistical tests (t-tests with Bonferroni correction) comparing the voxel intensities in regions of the cytoplasm that are proximal versus distal to the postsynaptic membrane. We have amended the main text to include the details of the statistical test that we performed. Also, we neglected to include a description of the statistical test in line 241, which cites Figure 3G. We have corrected this in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Can the authors comment on why only 1-2 grids are prepared per mouse brain (in M&amp;M -section)?</p></disp-quote><p>We prepared only two grids in order to have prepared samples within 2 minutes, to limit deterioration of the sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 Supplement 2 and its legend are confusing (averaging of non-aligned versus aligned post-synaptic membrane). Can the authors describe more clearly their molecular density profile analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that this figure legend was insufficient. We have included a detailed description of our molecular density profile analysis in the methods section entitled ‘Molecular density profile analysis’. In the revised manuscript we have now also included a citation to this methods section in Figure – figure 1 supplement 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please clarify with higher precision the areas were recorded in relation to the fluorescent spots (e.g. Figures 3A-C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a white rectangular annotation in the cryoCLEM inset panels of Figures 3A-C to indicate the field of view of each corresponding tomographic slice. This shows that PSD95-GFP puncta localise to the postsynaptic compartments in each tomogram.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4 Supplement 2D is not clear: the connection between receptors and actin should be shown in a segmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. A ‘connection’ is not clear, which is expected because the cytoplasmic domain of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits is composed of a non-globular/intrinsically disordered sequence. We have amended our description of the proximity of actin cytoskeleton to ionotropic glutamate receptor clusters in the main text replacing “associated with” to “adjacent to”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 341: the reference is referred to by a number (56) at the end of the sentence, rather than by name.</p></disp-quote><p>Good spot.

The authors make many exciting discoveries, e.g. PSD appearance, new polyhedral vesicles, ionotropic receptor positions, and intermembrane distance changes even within the synaptic cleft, but title their manuscript &quot;The molecular infrastructure of glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian forebrain&quot;. It is also a bit misleading, since one would have expected more molecular detail and molecular maps as part of the work, so the authors may think about updating the title to reflect their exciting work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognising the exciting discoveries in our manuscript. Summarising all these in a title is challenging. We intend ‘molecular infrastructure’ to mean a structure composed of many molecules including proteins (by analogy ‘transport infrastructure’ is composed of many roads, ports and train lines).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be in the spirit of eLife and open science if the authors could submit their segmentations alongside the tomographic data to either EMPIAR or pdb-dev (if they accept it) or the new CZII cryoET data portal for neurobiologists, method developers, and others to use.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have deposited in subtomogram averaged map of AMPA receptor in EMDB, and all tilt series and 4x binned tomographic reconstructions described in our manuscript (figure 1- table1 and figure 2 -table 2), together with segmentations in EMPIAR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Methods: the authors establish an exciting new workflow to get from living mice to frozen specimens within 2 minutes and perform many unique analyses that would be useful to different fields. Their methods section overall is well described and contains criteria and details that should allow others to apply experiments to their scientific problems. However, it would be very helpful to expand on the methods in the 'annotation and analysis [...]' and &quot;Subtomogram averaging&quot; sections, to at least in short describe the steps without having to embark on a reference journey for each method and generally provide more detail. For the annotation section, the software used for annotation is not listed. Table 1 only contains the list of the counts of organelles etc. identified in each tomogram, no processing details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the methods section ‘annotation and analysis’ including software used (IMOD). We have also included a slightly more detailed description of subtomogram averaging. We did not include ‘processing details’ because there are none - identification of constituents in each tomogram was carried out manually, as described in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Some of the tomograms submitted as videos may have slipped through as an early version since they appear to be originating from not perfectly aligned tiltseries; vesicles and membranes can be observed 'rubberbanding'. The authors should go through and check their videos.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for suggesting we double check our tomogram videos. All movies are representative tomographic reconstructions from ultra-fresh synapse preparations (Figure 1 – videos 1-7) and synapses in tissue cryo-sections (Figure 2 – videos 1-2). We have double checked that the videos correspond to tomograms that were aligned as good as possible. In general, tissue cryo-section tomograms reconstructed less well than ultra-fresh synapse tomograms, which limits the information content of these data, as expected. Consequently, the reconstructions shown in these videos were all reconstructed as best we could (testing multiple approaches in IMOD, and more recent software packages, eg. AreTomo). While we think it is important to share all tomograms, regardless of quality, we were careful to exclude tomograms for analysis that did not contain sufficient information for analysis (as described in the methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Minor suggestions:</bold></p><p>(1) Page 13, line 341, reference 56, but references are not numbered.

While our subtomgram average of 2522 subvolumes provided decent evidence that these are ionotropic receptors, we are reluctant to label specific putative domains of individual subvolumes in the raw tomographic slice because the resolution of the raw tomogram (particularly in the Z-direction) is worse and may not be sufficient to resolve definitely each domain layer.
