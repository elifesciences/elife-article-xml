been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells in our body are sealed by a surrounding membrane that allows them to control which molecules can enter or leave. Desired molecules are often imported via transport proteins that require a source of energy. One way that transporter proteins achieve this is by simultaneously moving positively charged particles called protons across the membrane.</p><p>Proteins called POTs (short for proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters) use this mechanism to import small peptides and drugsin to the cells of the kidney and small intestine. Sitting in the centre of these transporters is a pocket that binds to the imported peptide which has a gate on either side: an outer gate that opens towards the outside of the cell, and an inner gate that opens towards the cell’s interior<bold>.</bold> The movement of protons from the outer to the inner gate is thought to shift the shape of the transporter from an outwards to an inwards-facing state. However, the molecular details of this energetic coupling are not well understood.</p><p>To explore this, Lichtinger et al. used computer simulations to pinpoint where protons bind on POTs to trigger the gates to open. The simulations proposed that two sites together make up the outward-facing gate, which opens upon proton binding. Lichtinger et al. then validated these sites experimentally in cultured human cells that produce mutant POTs.</p><p>After the desired peptide/drug has attached to the binding pocket, the protons then move to two more sites further down the transporter. This triggers the inner gate to open, which ultimately allows the small molecule to move into the cell.</p><p>These findings represent a significant step towards understanding how POTs transport their cargo. Since POTs can transport a range of drugs from the digestive tract into the body, these results could help researchers design molecules that are better absorbed. This could lead to more orally available medications, making it easier for patients to adhere to their treatment regimen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computational</kwd><kwd>free energy</kwd><kwd>solute carrier protein</kwd><kwd>protonation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218514/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lichtinger</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name><name><surname>Newstead</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Biggin</surname><given-names>Philip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/X035603/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biggin</surname><given-names>Philip C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Since the membrane permeability of common solutes spans ten orders of magnitude, some molecules diffuse readily across the membrane, while the translocation of others requires facilitation by carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stillwell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pizzagalli et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the processes by which small molecules cross membranes is of key pharmacological interest owing to their role in drug delivery, which may be mediated by passive diffusion, protein carriers, or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sugano et al., 2010</xref>). The solute-carrier (SLC) superfamily encompasses 65 families of more than 450 genes, with substrates ranging in size from simple ions to complex macromolecules used in metabolism and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pizzagalli et al., 2021</xref>). Within this superfamily, the SLC15 family includes POTs that have significant homology through all domains of life and are evolutionarily ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniel et al., 2006</xref>). Of the four mammalian family members, PepT1 (SLC15A1), and PepT2 (SLC15A2) are the most well studied. The former is predominantly expressed in the small intestine and characterised as a low-aﬃnity, high-capacity transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fei et al., 1994</xref>). The latter has a broader expression pattern including the kidneys, lungs, and brain and is described as high-aﬃnity, low-capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kottra and Daniel, 2004</xref>). As secondary-active transporters, they couple uphill substrate translocation to the symport of protons down their electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fei et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rubio-Aliaga et al., 2000</xref>). The peptide–proton stoichiometry is not conserved between different substrates and POT family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker et al., 2014</xref>). For PepT1, stoichiometries of 1:1 and 2:1 have been reported for neutral/basic and acidic di-peptides, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fei et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steel et al., 1997</xref>). For PepT2, a 2:1 stoichiometry was reported for the neutral di-peptide D-Phe-L-Ala and 3:1 for anionic D-Phe-L-Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1999</xref>). Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fei et al., 1999</xref> have found 1:1 stoichiometries for either of D-Phe-L-Gln (neutral), D-Phe-L-Glu (anionic), and D-Phe-L-Lys (cationic). Here, we work under the assumption of a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides, motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism.</p><p>POT family transporters belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and share a conserved topology of two six-helix bundles that form the functional transport domain, their N-and C-termini facing the cytoplasm.

From these structures emerges a picture where the intracellular gate is constituted by broad close-packing of hydrophobic residues on TM 4, 5, 10, and 11, with possible stabilisation from the conserved D170–K642 salt-bridge. The extracellular gate appears to be spread along the cleft between the N-and C-terminal bundles, with contributions from the H87 (TM 2) – S321 (TM 7) polar interaction network as well as the R206 (TM 5) – D342 (TM 8) and K64 (TM 1) – D317 (TM 7) salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This is intriguing, because the mammalian H87 residue is only conserved in some prokaryotic homologues, and R206–D342 just among mammalian POTs. We speculate based on this feature that the extracellular gating mechanism could be less conserved than POT alternating access in general. As for the intracellular gating mechanism, an involvement of the D170–K642 salt bridge has been suggested, and the OF structure shows close-packing of several hydrophobic residues (F184, Y183, F187, L630, and Y634) that constrict access to the binding site from the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker et al., 2021</xref>). It is not known thus far how the opening of the intracellular gate (i.e. the OCC→IF transition) is triggered, and how it is coupled to proton movement and the presence of substrate.</p><p>POTs accommodate their substrates in a highly conserved binding pocket, interfacing between an acidic patch on the C-terminal bundle and a basic patch on the N-terminal bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). For di-peptides, the N-terminus is coordinated by E622 (TM 10) together with N192 (TM 5) and N348 (TM 8), while the C-terminus engages R57 (TM 1, or the equivalent arginine (R27) residue in PepT1) as well as Y94 (TM 2). Another conserved tyrosine, Y61 (TM 1), hydrogen-bonds to features of the peptide backbone.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez Molledo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Killer et al., 2021</xref>). Tri-peptides may adopt a similar orientation as di-peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guettou et al., 2014</xref>), or sit vertically in the transporter binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>), although it has been suggested that this vertical electron density could alternatively be explained by a bound HEPES molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez Molledo et al., 2018</xref>). Considering the consensus structural interaction pattern, we decided to investigate primarily the role of E622 and R57 in holding the substrate, and also note that R57 is part of the highly conserved E53xxER motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newstead, 2017</xref>). The second glutamate in this motif (E56) in particular has been linked to proton coupling experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). Since R57 interacts with both the ExxER glutamates and the substrate C-terminus, we hypothesise that it may play an important role in substrate–proton coupling.</p><p>In this study, we use extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD simulations (totalling close to 1 ms of sampling) to show how changes in protonation states of H87 and D342 control the OCC↔OF transition as an extracellular gate. We validate the importance of these residues for transporter function in cell-based transport assays. We also elucidate the role of E53xxER glutamates and the substrate-engaging E622 in controlling the OCC↔IF transition, thereby identifying a clear molecular basis for the directionality of proton movement coupling to conformational changes. Furthermore, we establish several distinct effects of the presence of substrate, coupling ligand binding with protein conformational changes and also linking it to protonation of the E56 and E622 titratable residues. Taken together, our work provides for the first time a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbiased MD identifies extra and intracellular gate opening triggers</title><p>We began our computational investigation by embedding PepT2 structures (using the sequence of the rat homologue) in the OF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker et al., 2021</xref>), IF (alphafold prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), and inwards-facing partially occluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Killer et al., 2021</xref>) conformations in 3:1 POPE:POPG membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, details in Materials and methods).

To decide which conditions to probe apart from the apo, standard protonation states as obtained above, we investigated the extent to which the H87–S321, R206–D342, K64–D317, and D170–K642 interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c</xref>) are formed in the OF (closed intracellular gate) and IF (closed extracellular gate) conformational states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the IF state, we found that H87–S321 and D342–R206 are consistently interacting, whereas the K64–D317 interaction, while formed in ≈72% of MD frames, is unstable and of a transient nature and, therefore, unlikely to contribute much to extracellular gate stability. The D170–K642 salt bridge, in turn, is only formed in ≈22% of OF-state frames, thus likely not substantially adding to the stability of the intracellular gate. We, therefore, decided to mainly focus on probing the H87–S321 and D342–R206 interactions with respect to control of the extracellular gate. Since no salt bridges or other specific interactions involving protonatable residues seem to demarcate the intracellular gate, we decided to focus on ExxER motif glutamates (E53 and E56) and E622 for their effects on intracellular gate opening.</p><p>Guided thus in our choice of which residues to investigate, we probed whether the OCC state opens spontaneously to OF or IF states in a range of different protonation-state and mutation conditions (as assessed by projection of unbiased MD runs onto intuitive collective variables, or CVs, defined as the centre-of-mass distance between the tips and bases of the N-and C-terminal bundles, respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We found that the extracellular gate remains stably closed in triplicates of 1 μs-long MD when H87 or D342 are protonated individually, but the OCC state can open spontaneously on the simulated time scale to an OF conformation when both are protonated simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> for plots of the opposite gate in the same trajectories, showing how ﬂexibility of the intra-and extracellular gates is anti-correlated). A comparable effect is found in the presence of the physiological peptide substrate L-Ala–L-Phe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, panels 5–6). We have also tested further combinations of mutations and protonation state changes relating to the putative extracellular gating interactions (D317 protonation and mutations of R206, S321, D342 to alanine, with and without H87 protonation) as well as some control mutants which we did not expected to have an effect (I135L, T202A, Q340A, and the salt bridge-swapped mutant R206D &amp; D342R, combined with H87 protonation). Across our 48 * 1 μs unbiased MD runs collated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, we observed three full extracellular-gate opening events, in conditions where H87 was protonated and the D342–R206 salt bridge was also disrupted either by D342 protonation or mutation to alanine (D342A). We also saw one partial opening event when in addition to H87 protonation we also mutated S321 to alanine (S321A). The data thus suggests that for spontaneous extracellular-gate opening to occur on this time scale in unbiased MD, disruption of the OCC-state H87 interaction network is essential, and the D342 salt bridge appears to make an additive contribution towards extracellular-gate stability (though this is not a strict correlation, as illustrated by the S321A partial opening event). The intracellular gate, by contrast, is more ﬂexible than the extracellular gate even in the apo, standard protonation state; however, following either protonation of the conserved E53 and E622 residues or the insertion of Ala-Phe substrate, the intracellular gate becomes more ﬂexible and can spontaneously open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref> for the corresponding plots of the extracellular gate opening).</p><p>Although these unbiased simulations show a large amount of stochasticity and drawing clean conclusions from the data are diﬃcult, we can already appreciate a possible mechanism where protons move down the transporter pore, first engaging H87 and D342 to favour the OF state and then moving to the ExxER motif (E53 and/or E56) and E622 to favour the IF orientation, driving successive conformational changes along the way. The initial unbiased approach taken in this section, therefore, serves to generate hypotheses for testing by a more rigorous investigation of the protonation state-dependent conformational changes. To this end, we set out to employ enhanced sampling simulations for obtaining conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation state and substrate binding conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2D-PMFs show proton-dependent driving forces of PepT2 alternating access</title><p>To overcome the time-scale limitations of MD simulations and sample important slow degrees of freedom, many enhanced sampling approaches have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hénin et al., 2022</xref>) and employed in the computational study of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harpole and Delemotte, 2018</xref>). An important class of methods that includes (among others) the popular techniques of steered MD (SMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izrailev et al., 1999</xref>), umbrella sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torrie and Valleau, 1977</xref>), metadynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barducci et al., 2008</xref>), adaptive biasing force (ABF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darve et al., 2008</xref>), and the accelerated weight histogram method (AWH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindahl et al., 2014</xref>) uses a small number of collective variables (CVs) along which to bias the simulation, thus improving exploration of important regions of phase space if the CV includes the relevant slow degrees of freedom (DOFs). If the CV is not optimal, problems can manifest in the form of hysteresis (starting-state dependence) when moving between known end-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lichtinger and Biggin, 2023</xref>). This is the case for the PepT2 OCC↔OF transition with the simple tip-CV illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. Using either metadynamics or SMD with replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS), the end-state from which the simulations were started is always favoured in the resulting potential of mean force (PMF), with the hysteresis effect totalling ≈40 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for each method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We have recently developed a strategy to overcome such hysteresis issues in conformational sampling which we call MEMENTO (Morphing Endstates by Modelling Ensembles with iNdependent TOpologies), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lichtinger and Biggin, 2023</xref>), and have implemented it as the freely available and documented PyMEMENTO package. MEMENTO generates paths between known end-states by coordinate morphing followed by fixing the geometries of un-physical morphed intermediates. Since these paths by definition connect the correct end-states (unlike biased MD methods like SMD, where not reaching the target state in slow orthogonal DOFs is a common source of hysteresis), they can drastically reduce hysteresis in enhanced sampling compared to SMD as a path generation method. We have shown this for several validation cases, including a large-scale conformational change in the bacterial membrane transporter LeuT. After running the initial 1D-REUS from MEMENTO replicates along a simple CV guess, we can use the generated MD data to iteratively improve CVs using principal component analysis (PCA), thereby capturing slow motions from long end-state sampling that propagates through MEMENTO as differences between replicates.</p><p>Here, we ran triplicates of MEMENTO for the OCC↔OF (standard protonation states and H87&amp;D342 protonated) and OCC↔IF (standard protonation states and E53 protonated) conformational changes, followed initially by 1D-REUS along the tip-CV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The results are much more consistent than SMD or metadynamics along the same CV, and the shapes of the PMFs fit well with the trends we previously observed in unbiased MD from the OCC state. Since, however, significant differences between replicates remained, we used principal component analysis (PCA, see Materials and methods for details) on the sampling collected of the standard protonation state transitions to derive sets of 2-dimensional CVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) that capture the main gate-opening motions in the first PC, and the direction along which the differing replicates can be best separated out as the second PC (these correspond to cleft sliding and twisting motions).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-96507-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>First Principal Component (PC) of occluded (OCC) to outwards-facing (OF) state.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-96507-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Second Principal Component (PC) of occluded (OCC) to outwards-facing (OF) state.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-96507-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>First Principal Component (PC) of occluded (OCC) to inwards-facing (IF) state.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-96507-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Second Principal Component (PC) of occluded (OCC) to inwards-facing (IF) state.</title></caption></media><p>Equipped with these CVs, we first studied the protonation-state dependence of the OCC↔OF transition. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows (2D-PMFs in part a, projections onto PC 1 in part b), the OCC state in standard protonation states form a basin that is metastable with respect to OF (lying ≈3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> higher than OF, separated by a barrier of ≈3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). Protonation of H87 still leads to a metastable OCC basin, although it is raised by ≈4 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> and the barrier is decreased to ≈1.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. Protonating D342, in turn, does not affect the relative free energies of the OCC and OF states, but does lower the transition barrier by ≈1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. These effects are additive, so that protonation of both H87 and D342 abolishes the metastable OCC state-an observation which agrees with the ability of the OCC state thus protonated to spontaneously transition to OF in unbiased MD (see the Discussion for a comparison with the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2017</xref> on PepT<sub>So</sub> on this point).</p><p>We have also computed 2D-PMFs in further protonation-state and mutation conditions to gain a better understanding of how the H87 and D342–R206 interaction networks control the extracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for the 2D-PMFs, all 1D-reprojections are shown for reference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). From the data presented thus far, it is not clear whether the effect of H87 pronation on the OCC → OF transition is due merely to the loss of hydrogen-bond interactions with S321, or whether the introduction of a positive charge in this location makes a significant mechanistic contribution. To address this question, instead of protonating H87 we mutated it to alanine (H87A). In the resulting PMF, the OCC state is raised less with respect to OF compared to the protonated version, and the transition barrier increases to ≈5 kcal mol<sup>–1</sup>, suggesting that there exists an interaction made by positively charged H87 that becomes particularly relevant in the transition region. Further analysis of the H87 interaction networks in our 2D-REUS trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>) reveals that when H87 is protonated, the interaction with S321 is substituted by an interaction with D317 that is strongest in the transition region. Interestingly, this suggests an alternative mechanistic role for the essential D317, which-as discussed above-we have not found forming the structurally observed salt bridge with K64 consistently in our simulations.</p><p>An equivalent investigation of the D342A mutation results in a PMF that shows both a decrease in the transition barrier, and-as opposed to D342 protonation-also raises the OCC state in energy with respect to OF. This may be explained by the fact that protonated D342 can still hydrogen-bond with R206, so although the interaction is less prominent it presumably still contributes somewhat to OCC state stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). As a control, we also show that although the protonation of E53/E56 can affect the relative OCC vs OF free energies, there is no lowering of the transition barrier (while they do have an effect on the transition barrier separating OCC from IF, as discussed below). Convergence analysis and representative 2D-REUS histograms for our OCC ↔ OF PMFs can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>.</p><p>We next employed an equivalent approach to investigate the OCC↔IF transition. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, in standard protonation states, the OCC state forms a well-defined basin, connecting to a broader and shallower IF basin raised ≈2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> over OCC via a barrier of just over ≈3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. When either E53 or E622 are protonated, IF drops to a similar free energy level as OCC and the transition barrier lowers by ≈1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. These effects are additive, so that when both E53 and E622 are protonated, the IF state is favoured by ≈3.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, and is accessible from OCC via a barrier of only ≈1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. As for the OCC↔OF transitions, these results explain the behaviour we had previously observed in the unbiased MD of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. The stochastic partial intracellular gate opening seen with those runs can be rationalised through the lower transition barrier from OCC to IF compared to the transition to OF in our PMFs, together with the broad and ﬂat shape of the IF-state basin. Additionally, we have also computed all the equivalents of these PMFs in the presence of Ala-Phe substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which we will discuss in the section below. All projections onto PC 1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and convergence analysis is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. Taken together, the PepT2 apo 2D-PMFs provide a detailed view of the way the alternating access cycle is driven by proton movement from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the transporter that ﬁts well with its biological function of using two protons from the extracellular medium to energise cycling from OF to IF, and back spontaneously once the protons have left (see the Discussion below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Substrate coupling of alternating access includes several distinct mechanisms</title><p>Given the evidence presented so far, which provides a plausible model for how protons drive alternating access based just on an investigation of the apo states, it remains unclear how coupling of proton transport to the substrate is achieved-that is, why the transporter cannot be driven by protons without the presence of substrate (and would thus just leak protons across the membrane). To investigate the mechanism underpinning peptide–proton coupling, we constructed simulation boxes that included a bound Ala-Phe substrate molecule (see Materials and methods for details). We then calculated the Ala-Phe aﬃnity using ABFE simulations in different protein states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). First, we observed that the aﬃnity is similar in the OF and IF states, indicating that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from OF to IF. We did find, however, that protonation of E622 (i.e. the salt bridge parter of the substate N-terminus) significantly decreases substrate aﬃnity. Given that protonation of E622 also favours the OCC→IF transition, we suggest a dual function of E622 protonation that includes both stabilising the IF state with respect to OCC and facilitating substrate release from holo IF.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Results of absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations, showing that the aﬃnity of Ala-Phe substrate does not depend much on the conformational state (outwards-facing, OF vs inwards-facing, IF), but is significantly decreased on E622 protonation.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Protein state</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">AF dipeptide aﬃnity/kcal mol<sup>−1</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.0 ± 0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7.0 ± 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF &amp; E622 prot</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.9 ± 0.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To explore what effect the substrate has on the PepT2 conformational landscape, we repeated a set of our 2D-PMFs in the presence of substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For both the OCC↔OF and OCC↔IF transitions, the 2D-PMFs have similar shapes in the apo and holo states. For OCC↔OF, however, we found an increased width of the OCC state basin in the direction of PC 2, which-as is evident after projection onto PC 1-stabilises OCC with respect to OF by ≈1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> as an effect of increased OCC ﬂexibility in the orthogonal DOF. We find a similar stabilisation when E53 or E56 are protonated, but not when both H87 and D342 are protonated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This indicates that the presence of substrate in conformations approaching the OCC state from OF may trigger proton movement further down into the transporter-driven by entropic gains from increased ﬂexibility in orthogonal DOFs.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dependence of free energy surface on presence or absence of substrate.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 2D-PMF for the OCC↔OF transition from replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS) starting with Ala-Phe-bound PepT2 Morphing Endstates by Modelling Ensembles with iNdependent TOpologies (MEMENTO) paths.

In the projection onto PC 1, this manifests as a broader free energy well and a lower barrier towards IF, even if the relative energies of the basins are not significantly affected. This effect is similarly apparent when E53 is protonated, but not with E622 protonation, which instead leads to a raised transition barrier ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). We reason that this is due to a more ﬂexible substrate orientation (disengaging the N-terminus) when E622 is neutral. While, taking these observations together, substrate binding does lead to an OCC→IF bias, it also seems unlikely that E622 is protonated at the moment when the OCC→IF transition happens in the holo transporter. This may suggest a further intermediate protonation step that our simulations have not captured (see our Discussion below).</p><p>As noted above, another possibility for the substrate to engage with the transport cycle is found in R57 interacting both with the substrate C-terminus and with the ExxER glutamates, protonation of which drives the transporter towards the IF state, as our PMFs demonstrate. A natural hypothesis then is that substrate binding-which engages R57-loosens the R57 interaction with E53 thus enabling the protonation of those residues and progress along the alternating access cycle. To test this hypothesis, we conducted triplicate constant-pH simulations (CpHMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swails et al., 2014</xref>) to probe the E53 and E56 pKa values in all combinations of OCC/OF and apo/holo conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Concerning the E53 pKa value, we see a potential response to substrate binding in the OF state (though the error bars calculated from the triplicate standard deviations overlap) but not in OCC. On the other hand, we do see a raising of the E56 pKa beyond error in holo OF or OCC states compared to apo, amounting to ≈0.6 log units in both cases. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, the pKa values estimated for successive data chunks across the CpHMD trajectories vary significantly with simulation time in a complex superposition of timescales, and with a dynamic range larger than the replicate error bars. As an alternative to the replicate-based representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we have, therefore, also analysed the pooled data for each condition as histograms of pKa values estimated from short chunks of our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). From this, we recover the same effect of substrate binding on the E56 pKa in the OF and OCC states, as well as a potential effect on the E53 pKa in the OF state only. Since the shift in E56 pKa was more robust across conformational states, we focus on this residue in the following validation and discussion, although we note that if there was in fact a significant raising of the E53 pKa as well, this would further strengthen our conclusions about substrate coupling to E53 and/or E56 protonation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Use of constant pH simulations to investigate influence of substrate on pKa values.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) E53 and E56 pKa values from constant-pH molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in the apo and holo as well as the outwards-facing (OF) and occluded (OCC) states, estimated as mean ± standard deviation from triplicate runs (using the full simulation data for fitting the titration curves).

On the other hand, we were not able in initial trials to obtain suﬃcient transition counts to converge an alternative explicit-solvent CpHMD method as implemented in GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aho et al., 2022</xref>). To validate our results, we, therefore, also constructed a thermodynamic cycle of substrate binding and E56 protonation in the OF state by including data from separate ABFE calculations as connecting thermodynamic legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The ABFE results show a complementary effect of the E56 protonation state on substrate aﬃnity, closing the thermodynamic cycle, and validating our CpHMD simulations using an orthogonal MD technique. We conclude that substrate binding does indeed facilitate protonation of E56 (whence, we stipulate, the proton moves to E53, which is situated in close proximity). If the neglected membrane environment in the hybrid-solvent CpHMD did produce significant artifacts in the pKa values, then it would appear that there is error cancellation when assessing the impact of substrate binding as a difference of pKa values in the apo and holo conditions.</p><p>It should be noted that-as throughout this study, see the discussion below-in studying the coupling between substrate binding and protonation-state changes at the E53 and E56 we have not made the substrate C-terminus protonatable. Since, in order to induce E56 protonation, the substrate C-terminus needs to engage R57 in a salt bridge, its pKa is likely to be low, rendering the assumption reasonable for those substrate conformations. However, it is possible that the system could also adopt states in which the ExxER motif salt-bridge network is stable in a way similar to the apo condition while the substrate gets protonated when oriented away from R57. If such conformations contribute significantly to this semi-grand canonical ensemble, the E53 and E56 (of the ExxER motif) pKa values estimated without taking them into account may exhibit some bias. By undersampling more apo-like conformations in the holo state in this way, it is possible that the calculations presented here overestimate the substrate-induced pKa shift of E56, although the direction of change would be expected to be the same, because the substrate can still engage R57 when it is deprotonated (we speculate that the histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> for the holo state may become bi-modal in this case). While the possibility would need to be taken into account for a more rigorous quantitative estimate of the E53 and E56pKa value shifts, the pKa calculations would become much harder to converge since the slow degree of freedom of substrate re-orientation would need to equilibrate to the protonation-state changes (which happen fast since they are treated as Monte-Carlo moves in an implicit solvent at regular intervals). Here, we content ourselves with the more qualitative observation that an appropriately positioned substrate in the canonical, structurally observed binding pose facilitates protonation of the ExxER glutamates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Validation in cell-based transport assays</title><p>To experimentally validate the results of an MD investigation, the first step is to probe the importance of the key implicated residues for protein function.

Starting at the apo OCC state without any protons bound, we find in our 2D-PMFs that proton binding to H87 and D342 stabilises OF with respect to OCC (with H87 being the major contributor). Given that H87 and D342 are accessible from the acidic extracellular bulk, and in light of the transition-region stabilisation from the H87 (protonated)–D317 interaction we have identified, our simulations suggest an interpretation where protonation happens in the OCC state, driving the OCC→OF transition by stabilising the OF state over OCC. However, if the OCC→OF transition is kinetically accessible on experimental timescales without prior protonation events (beyond what our MD was able to sample), it would also be consistent with our data that OCC→OF is spontaneous in standard protonation states, and H87 and (possibly) D342 are merely the initial sites of protonation once OF is reached, providing further stabilisation. [It may seem like the latter model is favoured by the fact that in our PMFs, OCC lies higher than OF, even when neither H87 nor D342 are protonated. We believe, however, that there is a danger of overinterpreting this feature of the PMF. Any combination of effects from forcefields, lipid composition, and the population shifts afforded by transmembrane electrochemical gradients could perturb the conformational equilibria. It would, therefore, not be meaningful to interpret the shape of a single PMF in this way; only responses of the PMF to protonation-state or substrate-binding changes should be used to inform our view of the conformational cycle, since these are likely to benefit from error cancellation with respect to factors that act on the overall protein conformations (which are conserved between the different conditions in which the PMFs were sampled).] We note in this context the limitation of using non-reactive MD methods for sampling the PepT2 conformational changes. In principle, a multi-dimensional PMF calculated with a reactive MD method where one CV is an explicit proton movement coordinate could disambiguate between the possible scenarios here. However, we believe that such a fully coupled treatment of proton movement and large-scale conformational changes is not yet computationally feasible, and focussed here on achieving convergence of the conformational sampling in discrete protonation-state combinations. The question of whether proton binding happens in OCC or OF, therefore, warrants further investigation, and indeed the co-existence of several mechanisms may be plausible. Nonetheless, this study contributes important details to a mechanistic understanding of the thermodynamics of proton-coupled alternating access.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the PepT2 alternating-access transport cycle proposed in this work.</title><p>Protons located at a question mark indicate a proton-transfer step with an as-of-yet unknown mechanism regarding intermediate residues.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96507-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our results with regards to the driving forces behind the OCC→OF motion agree with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2017</xref>, who found spontaneous opening of PepT<sub>Xc</sub> towards OF after protonating the equivalent histidine to H87 (PepT2).

Our simulations suggest that the involvement of D317 in the extracellular gating mechanism of PepT2 is by interacting with the protonated H87 to stabilise the transition region for extracellular gate opening. The mechanism of extracellular gating is, therefore, conserved less widely than the overall alternating access mechanism. This point is further highlighted by our results indicating a role of the D342–R206 salt bridge, which is conserved only among mammalian POTs, but not in PepT<sub>So</sub> and PepT<sub>Xc</sub> which do have the TM 2 histidine. This may explain why spontaneous opening in unbiased MD was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2017</xref> for PepT<sub>Xc</sub> following just H87 protonation, while for PepT2 in this work, protonation of D342 is also required.</p><p>Once the transporter is in the OF conformation, the substrate enters the binding site. We have treated this step alchemically in our ABFE simulations, so that the data presented here is agnostic of the orientation of the entering substrate and the sequence of engagement of the binding-site residues; previous MD simulations have suggested, however, that positioning of the peptide N-terminus precedes the C-terminus moving into place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker et al., 2021</xref>). Substrate binding then has two distinct effects: first, it exerts a small thermodynamic bias towards the OCC state via increased ﬂexibility in degrees of freedom orthogonal to the overall OF→OCC transition. Second, through engaging R57, substrate entry increases the pKa value of E56 in the ExxER motif, thus thermodynamically facilitating the movement of protons further down the transporter cleft. We can also speculate that-in addition to this thermodynamic favouring of E56 protonation-there might be a kinetic effect on proton transfer from moving the positively charged R57 out of the way of the incoming proton. This could be investigated using reactive MD or QM/MM simulations (both approaches have been employed for other protonation steps of procaryotic peptide transporters, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>), however the putative path is very long (≈1.7 nm between H87 and E56) and may or may not involve a large number of intermediate protonatable residues, in addition to binding site water. While such an investigation is possible in principle, it is beyond the scope of the present study. Likewise, a coupled enhanced-sampling treatment involving both proton movement and large-scale conformational changes-as discussed above for the ordering of steps in the OCC → OF transition-would make for interesting future work, once it becomes computationally tractable.</p><p>Our data is not fully determinate with respect to whether protons move to E56 before or after the OF→OCC conformational transition (our CpHMD, for example, remains agnostic on this matter since the shift in the E56 pKa value induced by the substrate is evident in both the OCC and OF states). We may interpret the fact that OCC is raised in energy while H87 is protonated and substrate-induced OCC stabilisation is not found when H87 and D342 are protonated (but does occur when E56 is protonated) as an indication that proton movement is favoured before the transition into OCC is complete. On the other hand, the transition-region interaction between protonated H87 and D317 could also be interpreted as a potential facilitator of the OF→OCC transition. We thus speculate that the proton movement processes may happen as an ensemble of different mechanisms, and potentially occur contemporaneously with the conformational change. This, in addition to a ﬂexible binding pocket, may also contribute to the substrate promiscuity mechanism.</p><p>We note at this stage that-throughout our study-we have not investigated the possibility of the substrate C-terminus itself becoming (transiently) protonated. This would need to be taken into account when treating proton movement through the transporter explicitly in the future (see the discussion of such approaches above). There is evidence in our simulations that an additional protonation site-aside from H87, D342, E53, E56, and E622-may be involved in the mechanism, since E622 protonation, while biasing the transporter towards IF, also increases the OCC→IF transition barrier if Ala-Phe substrate is bound (we therefore indicate the proton movements at these stages with a question mark in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There is thus the intriguing possibility that the substrate itself may temporarily hold the proton, although given the nature of the data presented here only speculation is currently possible on this point. What is clear from our 2D-PMFs, regardless, is that protonation of ExxER glutamates does act as an intracellular gate trigger (and may also pull the transporter through the chemical equilibria all the way from OF). Taking together our 2D-PMFs and ABFE simulations, it is also clear that E622, in addition to being essential for peptide recognition, plays two further roles: its protonation both facilitates substrate release and makes an additive contribution to the IF-directed bias exerted by the intracellular gate triggers (whether E622 forms ‘part’ of the intracellular gate remains then as a merely linguistic question). At this stage, we do not yet have an understanding of how exactly intracellular gate opening (which involves breaking an assembly of several hydrophobic residues) is effected by the protonation of these glutamate residues. This question should prove interesting to study in future work. Once the substrate (driven by E622 protonation) and the protons (driven by their electrochemical potential gradient) have left through the open intracellular gate into the intracellular bulk, the resulting apo, standard-protonation-state IF conformation has a thermodynamic preference to return to OCC as evidenced in our 2D-PMFs. We thus arrive back at the starting state and have completed the proton-and substrate-coupled alternating access cycle.</p><p>In support of our MD data, we present mutational analysis in cell-based transport assays. Mutations of H87, S321, and D342 to alanine all significantly decrease transport activity, with H87A having the strongest effect. Taken together with similar results in the literature on E53, E56, R57, D317, and E622 (as referenced above), all residues implicated by our study have, therefore, been confirmed their importance for transport via mutagenesis. While the cell-based assay used here cannot differentiate for example between proton-coupling and non-proton-coupling residues, our results still provide a useful first step towards the validation of the gating mechanisms we propose with our PMFs, and should prove informative for the future design of more in-depth experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, this study utilises the recent wealth of bacterial and mammalian peptide transporter structures to construct a model of their alternating access mechanism. We explain how the movement of two protons through the transporter drives the accompanying conformational changes, as well as how conformational changes and proton-movement events are coupled to the presence of substrate. Questions regarding some of the finer details, notably the precise sequence of proton movements and conformational transitions (if a single such sequence exists) and whether a further protonation site contributes to the mechanism remain open for future investigation. Nonetheless, the evidence supplied here addresses the alternating access proton-symport mechanism in unprecedented detail, particularly through the extensive use of free-energy simulation techniques. This information will prove useful for the project of employing peptide transporters as vehicles for drug delivery-especially since what determines the eﬃcacy of a transporter substrate is not only related to aﬃnity but crucially also to an ability of the substrate to move through the steps of the alternating access cycle once bound to the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Definition of tip and base bundle CVs</title><p>For the analysis and interpretation of our unbiased MD runs, as well as for the use as a CV for initial metadynamics and umbrella sampling trials, we constructed the tip-CV and base-CV as centre-of-mass distances between the Cα atoms of the top and bottom 11 residues of the N-terminal and C-terminus bundles respectively, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>.

This may be due to a variety of factors; one possibility is instability in the protein following the removal of the bound substrate in our simulations. In contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>), embedding replicates 1 and 3 of the alphafold IF state behave well. We picked the end-coordinates of replicate 3 as our IF state, due to the wider opening of its intracellular gate. We then sought to derive an OCC state via MD from replicate 1, see the paragraph below. We also note that embeddings from the OF cryo-EM structure (7NQK) remain stable in the OF conformation, we picked replicate 1 for our work.</p><p>To derive an OCC state from an IF box, we conducted five replicates of well-tempered metadynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barducci et al., 2008</xref>) as implemented in PLUMED 2.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tribello et al., 2014</xref>) along the base-bundle CV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), using eight walkers, hill height 1 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> with sigma 0.022 nm deposited every 500 steps, and a bias factor of 100. From the resulting set of trajectories, we picked frames around the mark of 20 ns simulation time and a base-CV value of around 2.0 nm (we chose these values based on visual inspection of the trajectories, where we noticed that base-CV values significantly below 2.0 nm lead to artefacts such as partial unfolding of the ends of helices, as did continuing the metadynamics simulations for longer than necessary to obtain the desired states). We ran triplicate 100 ns-long unbiased MD from the obtained states for each of the five replicates, and found the OCC state obtained from the first replicate to be stably situated within the range of base-CV values observed in the OF-state trajectories. The micro-second-long unbiased MD runs as well as our 2D-PMFs confirm that this protein conformation is a stable basin, and that different protonation states of key residues can drive its opening to either the IF or OF states. While this does not rule out the existence of different OCC states, it confirms the properties of the conformation we found as a functional OCC state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Unbiased MD of the OCC state</title><p>Unbiased MD runs of the OCC state in different conditions were conducted in triplicates using the same simulation parameters as for the long Cα-restrained equilibrations described in the section on equilibration, but removing all restraints.

For this, we changed our mdp files to use the stochastic dynamics integrator (doubling as a thermostat) and set the relevant free-energy ﬂags, including soft-core van-der-Waals interactions (alpha = 0.5, power = 1, sigma = 0.3) and the couple-intramol=yes ﬂag for consistency with larger ligands in other work.

This was done for each of the triplicate MEMENTO runs, giving three candidate ligand binding poses. For the pose that was found to have the highest single-replicate aﬃnity, four replicates of unbiased, restraint-free 200 ns-long equilibrations were also started from the frames, processed with MDRestraintsGenerator and used to make replicates for ABFE runs to give an error estimate as mean plus-minus standard deviation.

This includes key coordinate files and python scripts, as well as simulation trajectories projected onto the CVs of interest in plumed output format, and relevant processed files for PMF, pKa and ABFE calculations. This should sufficient to reproduce the work here. Sharing full trajectory data by default is currently not practical since the simulation data accumulated as production runs during this study totals around 7 TB (for comparison, zenodo imposes a maximum limit of 50 GB). We do already share trajectory projections onto CVs used in free energy calculations (amounting to around 14GB), which will enable other researchers to reanalyse the simulation runs as far as convergence is concerned. Should a structural reanalysis be desired, we will be happy to share the subset of trajectory data required for the analysis in question and coordinate with the requesting researcher regarding how to best achieve the transfer logistically.

It is widely accepted that conformational transitions of proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are linked with gating hydrogen bonds and salt bridges involving protonatable residues, whose protonation triggers gate openings. Through unbiased MD simulations, the authors identified extra-cellular (H87 and D342) and intra-cellular (E53 and E622) triggers. The authors then validated these triggers using free energy calculations (FECs) and assessed the engagement of the substrate (Ala-Phe dipeptide). The linkage of substrate release with the protonation of the ExxER motif (E53 and E56) was confirmed using constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations and cell-based transport assays. An alternating-access mechanism was proposed. The study was largely conducted properly, and the paper was well-organized. However, I have a couple of concerns for the authors to consider addressing.</p><p>(1) As a proton-coupled membrane protein, the conformational dynamics of hsPepT2 is closely coupled to protonation events of gating residues. Instead of using semi-reactive methods like CpHMD or reactive methods such as reactive MD, where the coupling is accounted for, the authors opted for extensive non-reactive regular MD simulations to explore this coupling. Note that I am not criticizing the choice of methods, and I think those regular MD simulations were well designed and conducted. But I do have two concerns.</p><p>(a) Ideally, proton-coupled conformational transitions should be modelled using a free energy landscape with two or more reaction coordinates (or CVs), with one describing the protonation event and the others describing the conformational transitions. The minimum free energy path then illustrates the reaction progress, such as OCC/H87D342- ↔ OCC/H87HD342H ↔ OF/H87HD342H as displayed in Figure 3. Without including the protonation as a CV, the authors tried to model the free energy changes from multiple FECs using different charge states of H87 and D342. This is a practical workaround, and the conclusion drawn (the OCC↔OF transition is downhill with protonated H87 and D342) seems valid. However, I don't think the OF states with different charge states (OF/H87D342-, OF/H87HD342-, OF/H87D342H, and OF/H87HD342H) are equally stable, as plotted in Figure 3b. The concern extends to other cases like Figures 4b, S7, S10, S12, S15, and S16. While it may be appropriate to match all four OF states in the free energy plot for comparison purposes, the authors should clarify this to ensure readers are not misled.</p><p>(b) Regarding the substrate impact, it appears that the authors assumed fixed protonation states. I am afraid this is not necessarily the case. Variations in PepT2 stoichiometry suggests that substrates likely participate in proton transport, like the Phe-Ala (2:1) and Phe-Gln (1:1) dipeptides mentioned in the introduction. And it is not rigorous to assume that the N- and C-termini of a peptide do not protonate/deprotonate when transported. I think the authors should explicitly state that the current work and the proposed mechanism (Figure 8) are based on the assumption that the substrates do not uptake/release proton(s).</p><p>(2) I have more serious concerns about the CpHMD employed in the study.</p><p>(a) The CpHMD in AMBER is not rigorous for membrane simulations.

This protein is one of the most well-studied mammalian POT transporters that provides a good model with enough insight and structural information to be studied computationally using advanced enhanced sampling methods employed in this work. The authors have used microsecond-level MD simulations, constant-PH MD, and alchemical binding free energy calculations along with cell-based transport assay measurements; however, the most important part of this work is the use of enhanced sampling techniques to study the conformational dynamics of PepT2 under different conditions.</p><p>The study attempts to identify links between conformational dynamics and chemical events such as proton binding, ligand-protein interactions, and intramolecular interactions. The ultimate goal is of course to understand the proton-coupled peptide and drug transport by PepT2 and homologous transporters in the solute carrier family.</p><p>Some of the key results include (1) Protonation of H87 and D342 initiate the occluded (Occ) to the outward-facing (OF) state transition; (2) In the OF state, through engaging R57, substrate entry increases the pKa value of E56 and thermodynamically facilitates the movement of protons further down; (3) E622 is not only essential for peptide recognition but also its protonation facilitates substrate release and contributes to the intracellular gate opening. In addition, cell-based transport assays show that mutation of residues such as H87 and</p><p>D342 significantly decrease transport activity as expected from simulations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This is an extensive MD based study of PepT2, which is beyond the typical MD studies both in terms of the sheer volume of simulations as well as the advanced methodology used.

The molecular dynamics approaches are convincing, but with limitations that could be addressed in the manuscript, including lack of incorporation of a protonation coordinate in the free energy landscape, possibility of protonation of the substrate, errors with the chosen constant pH MD method for membrane proteins, dismissal of hysteresis emerging from the MEMENTO method, and the likelihood of other residues being affected by peptide binding. Some changes to the presentation could be considered, including a better description of pKa calculations and the inclusion of error bars in all PMFs. Overall, the findings will appeal to structural biologists, biochemists, and biophysicists studying membrane transporters.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers for providing their feedback on our manuscript, and also for recognising the variety of computational methods employed, the amount of sampling collected and the experimental validation undertaken. Following the individual reviewer comments, as addressed point-by-point below, we have prepared a revised manuscript, but before that we address some of the comments made above in the general assessment:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“lack of incorporation of a protonation coordinate in the free energy landscape”.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that of course it would be highly desirable to treat protonation state changes explicitly and fully coupled to conformational changes. However, at this point in time, evaluating such a free energy landscape is not computationally feasible (especially considering that the non-reactive approach taken here already amounts to almost 1ms of total sampling time). Previous reports in the literature tend to focus on either simpler systems or a reduced subset of a larger problem. As we were trying to obtain information on the whole transport cycle, we decided to focus here on non-reactive methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“possibility of protonation of the substrate”.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out this possibility, which we had not discussed explicitly in our manuscript. Briefly, while we describe a mechanism in which protonation of only protein residues (with an unprotonated ligand) can account for driving all the necessary conformational changes of the transport cycle, there is some evidence for a further intermediate protonation site in our data (as we commented on in the first version of the manuscript as well), which may or may not be the substrate itself. A future explicit treatment of the proton movements through the transporter, when it will become computationally tractable to do so, will have to include the substrate as a possible protonation site; for the present moment, we have amended our discussion to alert the reader to the possibility that the substrate could be an intermediate to proton transport. This has repercussions for our study of the E56 pKa value, where – if protons reside with a significant population at the substrate C-terminus – our calculated shift in pKa upon substrate binding could be an overestimate, although we would qualitatively expect the direction of shift to be unaffected. However, we also anticipate that treating this potential coupling explicitly would make convergence of any CpHMD calculation impractical to achieve and thus it may be the case that for now only a semi-quantitative conclusion is all that can be obtained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“errors with the chosen constant pH MD method for membrane proteins”.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that – as reviewer #1 has reminded us – the AMBER implementation of hybrid-solvent CpHMD is not rigorous for membrane proteins, and as such added a cautionary note to our paper. We also explain how the use of the ABFE thermodynamic cycle calculations helps to validate the CpHMD results in a completely orthogonal manner (we have promoted this validation, which was in the supplementary figures, into the main text in the revised version). We therefore remain reasonably confident in the results presented with regards to the reported pKa shift of E56 upon substrate binding, and suggest that if the impact of neglecting the membrane in the implicit-solvent stage of CpHMD is significant, then there is likely an error cancellation when considering shifts induced by the incoming substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“dismissal of hysteresis emerging from the MEMENTO method”.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We have shown in our method design paper how the use of the MEMENTO method drastically reduces hysteresis compared to steered MD for path generation, and find this improvement again for PepT2 in this study. We address reviewer #3’s concern about our presentation on this point by revising our introduction of the MEMENTO method, as detailed in the response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“the likelihood of other residues being affected by peptide binding”.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have investigated in detail the involvement of several residues in proton-coupled di-peptide transport by PepT2. Short of the potential intermediate protonation site mentioned above, the set of residues we investigate form a minimal set of sorts within which the important driving forces of alternating access can be rationalised. We have not investigated in substantial detail here the residues involved in holding the peptide in the binding site, as they are well studied in the literature and ligand promiscuity is not the problem of interest here. It remains entirely possible that further processes contribute to the mechanism of driving conformational changes by involving other residues not considered in this paper. We have now made our speculation that an ensemble of different processes may be contributing simultaneously more explicit in our revision, but do not believe any of our conclusions would be affected by this.</p><p>As for the additional suggested changes in presentation, we provide the requested details on the CpHMD analysis. Furthermore, we use the convergence data presented separately in figures S12 and S16 to include error bars on our 1D-reprojections of the 2D-PMFs in figures 3, 4 and 5. (Note that we have opted to not do so in figures S10 and S15 which collate all 1D PMF reprojections for the OCC ↔ OF and OCC ↔ IF transitions in single reference plots, respectively, to avoid overcrowding those necessarily busy figures). We have also changed the colours schemes of these plots in our revision to improve accessibility. We have additionally taken the opportunity to fix some typos and further clarified some other statements throughout the manuscript, besides the requests from the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors have performed all-atom MD simulations to study the working mechanism of hsPepT2. It is widely accepted that conformational transitions of proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are linked with gating hydrogen bonds and salt bridges involving protonatable residues, whose protonation triggers gate openings. Through unbiased MD simulations, the authors identified extra-cellular (H87 and D342) and intra-cellular (E53 and E622) triggers. The authors then validated these triggers using free energy calculations (FECs) and assessed the engagement of the substrate (Ala-Phe dipeptide). The linkage of substrate release with the protonation of the ExxER motif (E53 and E56) was confirmed using constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations and cellbased transport assays. An alternating-access mechanism was proposed. The study was largely conducted properly, and the paper was well-organized. However, I have a couple of concerns for the authors to consider addressing.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to note here that it may be slightly misleading to the reader to state that “The linkage of substrate release with the protonation of the ExxER motif (E53 and E56) was confirmed using constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations and cell-based transport assays.” The cellbased transport assays confirmed the importance of the extracellular gating trigger residues H87, S321 and D342 (as mentioned in the preceding sentence), not of the substrate-protonation link as this line might be understood to suggest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) As a proton-coupled membrane protein, the conformational dynamics of hsPepT2 are closely coupled to protonation events of gating residues. Instead of using semi-reactive methods like CpHMD or reactive methods such as reactive MD, where the coupling is accounted for, the authors opted for extensive non-reactive regular MD simulations to explore this coupling. Note that I am not criticizing the choice of methods, and I think those regular MD simulations were well-designed and conducted. But I do have two concerns.</p><p>a) Ideally, proton-coupled conformational transitions should be modelled using a free energy landscape with two or more reaction coordinates (or CVs), with one describing the protonation event and the other describing the conformational transitions. The minimum free energy path then illustrates the reaction progress, such as OCC/H87D342- → OCC/H87HD342H → OF/H87HD342H as displayed in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewer that the ideal way of describing the processes studied in our paper would be as a higher-dimensional free energy landscapes obtained from a simulation method that can explicitly model proton-transfer processes. Indeed, it would have been particularly interesting and potentially informative with regards to the movement of protons down into the transporter in the OF → OCC → IF sequence of transitions. As we note in our discussion on the H87→E56 proton transfer:</p><p>“This could be investigated using reactive MD or QM/MM simulations (both approaches have been employed for other protonation steps of prokaryotic peptide transporters, see Parker et al. (2017) and Li et al. (2022)). However, the putative path is very long (≈ 1.7 nm between H87 and E56) and may or may not involve a large number of intermediate protonatable residues, in addition to binding site water. While such an investigation is possible in principle, it is beyond the scope of the present study.”</p><p>Where even sampling the proton transfer step itself in an essentially static protein conformation would be pushing the boundaries of what has been achieved in the field, we believe that considering the current state-of-the-art, a fully coupled investigation of large-scale conformational changes and proton-transfer reaction is not yet feasible in a realistic/practical time frame. We also note this limitation already when we say that:</p><p>“The question of whether proton binding happens in OCC or OF warrants further investigation, and indeed the co-existence of several mechanisms may be plausible here”.</p><p>Nonetheless, we are actively exploring approaches to treat uptake and movement of protons explicitly for future work.</p><p>In our revision, we have expanded on our discussion of the reasoning behind employing a non-reactive approach and the limitations that imposes on what questions can be answered in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without including the protonation as a CV, the authors tried to model the free energy changes from multiple FECs using different charge states of H87 and D342. This is a practical workaround, and the conclusion drawn (the OCC→ OF transition is downhill with protonated H87 and D342) seems valid. However, I don't think the OF states with different charge states (OF/H87D342-, OF/H87HD342-, OF/H87D342H, and OF/H87HD342H) are equally stable, as plotted in Figure 3b. The concern extends to other cases like Figures 4b, S7, S10, S12, S15, and S16. While it may be appropriate to match all four OF states in the free energy plot for comparison purposes, the authors should clarify this to ensure readers are not misled.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in their assessment that the aligning of PMFs in these figures is arbitrary; no relative free energies of the PMFs to each other can be estimated without explicit free energy calculations at least of protonation events at the end state basins. The PMFs in our figures are merely superimposed for illustrating the differences in shape between the obtained profiles in each condition, as discussed in the text, and we now make this clear in the appropriate figure captions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Regarding the substrate impact, it appears that the authors assumed fixed protonation states. I am afraid this is not necessarily the case. Variations in PepT2 stoichiometry suggest that substrates likely participate in proton transport, like the Phe-Ala (2:1) and Phe-Gln (1:1) dipeptides mentioned in the introduction. And it is not rigorous to assume that the N- and C-termini of a peptide do not protonate/deprotonate when transported. I think the authors should explicitly state that the current work and the proposed mechanism (Figure 8) are based on the assumption that the substrates do not uptake/release proton(s).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an assumption inherent in the current work. While we do “speculate that the proton movement processes may happen as an ensemble of different mechanisms, and potentially occur contemporaneously with the conformational change” we do not in the previous version indicate explicitly that this may involve the substrate. We make clear the assumption and this possibility in the revised version of our paper. Indeed, as we discuss, there is some evidence in our PMFs of an additional protonation site not considered thus far, which may or may not be the substrate. We now make note of this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for what information can be drawn from the given experimental stoichiometries, we note in our paper that “a 2:1 stoichiometry was reported for the neutral di-peptide D-Phe-L-Ala and 3:1 for anionic D-Phe-L-Glu. (Chen et al., 1999) Alternatively, Fei et al. (1999) have found 1:1 stoichiometries for either of D-Phe-L-Gln (neutral), D-Phe-L-Glu (anionic), and D-Phe-L-Lys (cationic).”</p><p>We do not assume that it is our place to arbit among the apparent discrepancies in the experimental data here, although we believe that our assumed 2:1 stoichiometry is additionally “motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I have more serious concerns about the CpHMD employed in the study.</p><p>a) The CpHMD in AMBER is not rigorous for membrane simulations. The underlying generalized Born model fails to consider the membrane environment when updating charge states. In other words, the CpHMD places a membrane protein in a water environment to judge if changes in charge states are energetically favorable. While this might not be a big issue for peripheral residues of membrane proteins, it is likely unphysical for internal residues like the ExxER motif. As I recall, the developers have never used the method to study membrane proteins themselves. The only CpHMD variant suitable for membrane proteins is the membrane-enabled hybrid-solvent CpHMD in CHARMM. While I do not expect the authors to redo their CpHMD simulations, I do hope the authors recognize the limitations of their method.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss the limitations of the AMBER CpHMD implementation in the revised version. However, despite that, we believe we have in fact provided sufficient grounds for our conclusion that substrate binding affects ExxER motif protonation in the following way.</p><p>In addition to CpHMD simulations, we establish the same effect via ABFE calculations, where the substrate affinity is different at the E56 deprotonated vs protonated protein. This was figure S20 before, though in the revised version we have moved this piece of validation into a new panel of figure 6 in the main text, since it becomes more important with the CpHMD membrane problem in mind. Since the ABFE calculations are conducted with an all-atom representation of the lipids and the thermodynamic cycle closes well, it would appear that if the chosen CpHMD method has a systematic error of significant magnitude for this particular membrane protein system, there may be the benefit of error cancellation. While the calculated absolute pKa values may not be reliable, the difference made by substrate binding appears to be so, as judged by the orthogonal ABFE technique.</p><p>Although the reviewer does “not expect the authors to redo their CpHMD simulations”, we consider that it may be helpful to the reader to share in this response some results from trials using the continuous, all-atom constant pH implementation that has recently become available in GROMACS (Aho et al 2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00516">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00516</ext-link>) and can be used rigorously with membrane proteins, given its all-atom lipid representation.</p><p>Unfortunately, when trying to titrate E56 in this CpHMD implementation, we found few protonationstate transitions taking place, and the system often got stuck in protonation state–local conformation coupled minima (which need to interconvert through rearrangements of the salt bridge network involving slow side-chain dihedral rotations in E53, E56 and R57). Author response image 1 shows this for the apo OF state, Author response image 2 shows how noisy attempts at pKa estimation from this data turn out to be, necessitating the use of a hybrid-solvent method.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>All-atom CpHMD simulations of apo-OF PepT2.</title><p>Red indicates protonated E56, blue is deprotonated.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96507-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Difficulty in calculating the E56 pKa value from the noisy all-atom CpHMD data shown in Author response image 1.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96507-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It appears that the authors did not make the substrate (Ala-Phe dipeptide) protonatable in holosimulations. This oversight prevents a complete representation of ligand-induced protonation events, particularly given that the substrate ion pairs with hsPepT2 through its N- &amp; C-termini. I believe it would be valuable for the authors to acknowledge this potential limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we implicitly assumed from the outset that the substrate does not get protonated, which – as by way of response to the comment above – we now acknowledge explicitly. This potential limitation for the available mechanisms for proton transfer also applies to our investigation of the ExxER protonation states. In particular, a semi-grand canonical ensemble that takes into account the possibility of substrate C-terminus protonation may also sample states in which the substrate is protonated and oriented away from R57, thus leaving the ExxER salt bridge network in an apo-like state. The consequence would be that while the direction of shift in E56 pKa value will be the same, our CpHMD may overestimate its magnitude. It would thus be interesting to make the C-terminus protonatable for obtaining better quantitative estimates of the E56 pKa shift (as is indeed true in general for any other protein protonatable residue, though the effects are usually assumed to be negligible). We do note, however, that convergence of the CpHMD simulations would be much harder if the slow degree of freedom of substrate reorientation (which in our experience takes 10s to 100s of nanoseconds in this binding pocket) needs to be implicitly equilibrated upon protonation state transitions. We discuss such considerations in the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that describes a series of molecular dynamics studies on the peptide transporter PepT2 (SLC15A2).

One possibility is for this to be the substrate itself (see the response to reviewer #1 above) though within the scope of this study the precise pathway by which protons move down the transporter and the exact ordering of conformational change and proton transfer reactions remains a (partially) open question. We acknowledge this, denote it with question marks in the mechanistic overview we give in Figure 8 and also “speculate that the proton movement processes may happen as an ensemble of different mechanisms, and potentially occur contemporaneously with the conformational change”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some things are a little unclear. For instance, where does the state that they have defined as occluded sit on the diagram in Figure 1a? - is it truly the occluded state as shown on the diagram or does it tend to inward- or outward-facing?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1a is a simple schematic overview intended to show which structures of PepT2 homologues are available to use in simulations. This was not meant to be a quantitative classification of states. Nonetheless, we can note that the OCC state we derived has extra- and intracellular gate opening distances (as measured by the simple CVs defined in the methods and illustrated in Figure 2a) that indicate full gate closure at both sides. In particular, although it was derived from the IF state via biased sampling, the intracellular gate opening distance in the OCC state used for our conformational change enhanced sampling was comparable to that of the OF state (ie, full closure of the gate), see Figure S2b and the grey bars therein. Therefore, we would schematically classify the OCC state to lie at the center of the diagram in Figure 1a. Furthermore, it is largely stable over triplicates of 1 μslong unbiased MD, where in 2/3 replicates the gates remain stable, and the remaining replicate there is partial opening of the intracellular gate (as shown in Figure 2 b/c under the “apo standard” condition). We comment on this in the main text by saying that “The intracellular gate, by contrast, is more flexible than the extracellular gate even in the apo, standard protonation state”, and link it to the lower barrier for transition to IF than to OF. We did this by saying that “As for the OCC↔OF transitions, these results explain the behaviour we had previously observed in the unbiased MD of Figure 2c.” We acknowledge this was not sufficiently clear and have added details to the latter sentence to help clarify better the nature of the occluded state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pKa calculations and their interpretation are a bit unclear. Firstly, it is unclear whether they are using all the data in the calculations of the histograms, or just selected data and if so on what basis was this selection done. Secondly, they dismiss the pKa calculations of E53 in the outward-facing form as not being affected by peptide binding but say that E56 is when there seems to be a similar change in profile in the histograms.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we have provided two distinct analyses of the raw CpHMD data. Firstly, we analysed the data by the replicates in which our simulations were conducted (Figure 6, shown as bar plots with mean from triplicates +/- standard deviation), where we found that only the effect on E56 protonation was distinct as lying beyond the combined error bars. This analysis uses the full amount of sampling conducted for each replicate. However, since we found that the range of pKa values estimated from 10ns/window chunks was larger than the error bars obtained from the replicate analysis (Figures S17 and S18), we sought to verify our conclusion by pooling all chunk estimates and plotting histograms (Figure S19). We recover from those the effect of substrate binding on the E56 protonation state on both the OF and OCC states. However, as the reviewer has pointed out (something we did not discuss in our original manuscript), there is a shift in the pKa of E53 of the OF state only. In fact, the trend is also apparent in the replicate-based analysis of Figure 6, though here the larger error bars overlap. In our revision, we added more details of these analyses for clarity (including more detailed figure captions regarding the data used in Figure 6) as well as a discussion of the partial effect on the E53 pKa value.</p><p>We do not believe, however, that our key conclusions are negatively affected. If anything, a further effect on the E53 pKa which we had not previously commented on (since we saw the evidence as weaker, pertaining to only one conformational state) would strengthen the case for an involvement of the ExxER motif in ligand coupling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lichtinger et al. have used an extensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the conformational dynamics and transport cycle of an important member of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs), namely SLC15A2 or PepT2.

The authors have used microsecond-level MD simulations, constant-PH MD, and alchemical binding free energy calculations along with cell-based transport assay measurements; however, the most important part of this work is the use of enhanced sampling techniques to study the conformational dynamics of PepT2 under different conditions.</p><p>The study attempts to identify links between conformational dynamics and chemical events such as proton binding, ligand-protein interactions, and intramolecular interactions. The ultimate goal is of course to understand the proton-coupled peptide and drug transport by PepT2 and homologous transporters in the solute carrier family.</p><p>Some of the key results include:</p><p>(1) Protonation of H87 and D342 initiate the occluded (Occ) to the outward-facing (OF) state transition.</p><p>(2) In the OF state, through engaging R57, substrate entry increases the pKa value of E56 and thermodynamically facilitates the movement of protons further down.</p><p>(3) E622 is not only essential for peptide recognition but also its protonation facilitates substrate release and contributes to the intracellular gate opening. In addition, cell-based transport assays show that mutation of residues such as H87 and D342 significantly decreases transport activity as expected from simulations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This is an extensive MD-based study of PepT2, which is beyond the typical MD studies both in terms of the sheer volume of simulations as well as the advanced methodology used. The authors have not limited themselves to one approach and have appropriately combined equilibrium MD with alchemical free energy calculations, constant-pH MD, and geometry-based free energy calculations. Each of these 4 methods provides a unique insight regarding the transport mechanism of PepT2.</p><p>(2) The authors have not limited themselves to computational work and have performed experiments as well. The cell-based transport assays clearly establish the importance of the residues that have been identified as significant contributors to the transport mechanism using simulations.</p><p>(3) The conclusions made based on the simulations are mostly convincing and provide useful information regarding the proton pathway and the role of important residues in proton binding, protein-ligand interaction, and conformational changes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Some of the statements made in the manuscript are not convincing and do not abide by the standards that are mostly followed in the manuscript. For instance, on page 4, it is stated that &quot;the K64-D317 interaction is formed in only ≈ 70% of MD frames and therefore is unlikely to contribute much to extracellular gate stability.&quot; I do not agree that 70% is negligible. Particularly, Figure S3 does not include the time series so it is not clear whether the 30% of the time where the salt bridge is broken is in the beginning or the end of simulations. For instance, it is likely that the salt bridge is not initially present and then it forms very strongly. Of course, this is just one possible scenario but the point is that Figure S3 does not rule out the possibility of a significant role for the K64-D317 salt bridge.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out that the statement and Figure S3 as they were do not adequately support our decision to exclude the K64-D317 salt-bridge in our further investigations. The violin plot shown in Figure S3, visualised as pooled data from unbiased 1 μs triplicates, did indeed not rule out a scenario where the salt bridge only formed late in our simulations (or only in some replicates), but then is stable. Therefore, in our revision, we include the appropriate time-series of the salt bridge distances, showing how K64-D317 is initially stable but then falls apart in replicate 1, and is transiently formed and disengaged across the trajectories in replicates 2 and 3. We have also remade the data for this plot as we discovered a bug in the relevant analysis script that meant the D170-K642 distance was not calculated accurately. The results are however almost identical, and our conclusions remain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Similarly, on page 4, it is stated that &quot;whether by protonation or mutation - the extracellular gate only opens spontaneously when both the H87 interaction network and D342-R206 are perturbed (Figure S5).&quot; I do not agree with this assessment. The authors need to be aware of the limitations of this approach. Consider &quot;WT H87-prot&quot; and &quot;D342A H87-prot&quot;: when D342 residue is mutated, in one out of 3 simulations, we see the opening of the gate within 1 us. When D342 residue is not mutated we do not see the opening in any of the 3 simulations within 1 us. It is quite likely that if rather than 3 we have 10 simulations or rather than 1 us we have 10 us simulations, the 0/3 to 1/3 changes significantly. I do not find this argument and conclusion compelling at all.</p></disp-quote><p>If the conclusions were based on that alone, then we would agree. However, this section of work covers merely the observations of the initial unbiased simulations which we go on to test/explore with enhanced sampling in the rest of the paper, and which then lead us to the eventual conclusions.</p><p>Figure S5 shows the results from triplicate 1 μs-long trajectories as violin-plot histograms of the extracellular gate opening distance, also indicating the first and final frames of the trajectories as connected by an arrow for orientation – a format we chose for intuitively comparing 48 trajectories in one plot. The reviewer reads the plot correctly when they analyse the “WT H87-prot” vs “D342A H87-prot” conditions. In the former case, no spontaneous opening in unbiased MD is taking place, whereas when D342 is mutated to alanine in addition to H87 protonation, we see spontaneous transition in 1 out of 3 replicates. However, the reviewer does not seem to interpret the statement in question in our paper (“the extracellular gate only opens spontaneously when both the H87 interaction network and D342-R206 are perturbed”) in the way we intended it to be understood. We merely want to note here a correlation in the unbiased dataset we collected at this stage, and indeed the one spontaneous opening in the case comparison picked out by the reviewer is in the condition where both the H87 interaction network and D342-R206 are perturbed. In noting this we do not intend to make statistically significant statements from the limited dataset. Instead, we write that “these simulations show a large amount of stochasticity and drawing clean conclusions from the data is difficult”. We do however stand by our assessment that from this limited data we can “already appreciate a possible mechanism where protons move down the transporter pore” – a hypothesis we investigate more rigorously with enhanced sampling in the rest of the paper. We have revised the section in question to make clearer that the unbiased MD is only meant to give an initial hypothesis here to be investigated in more detail in the following sections. In doing so, we also incorporate, as we had not done before, the case (not picked out by the reviewer here but concerning the same figure) of S321A &amp; H87 prot. In the third replicate, this shows partial gate opening towards the end of the unbiased trajectory (despite D342 not being affected), highlighting further the stochastic nature that makes even clear correlative conclusions difficult to draw.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the MEMENTO methodology is novel and interesting, the method is presented as flawless in the manuscript, which is not true at all. It is stated on Page 5 with regards to the path generated by MEMENTO that &quot;These paths are then by definition non-hysteretic.&quot; I think this is too big of a claim to say the paths generated by MEMENTO are non-hysteretic by definition. This claim is not even mentioned in the original MEMENTO paper. What is mentioned is that linear interpolation generates a hysteresis-free path by definition. There are two important problems here: (a) MEMENTO uses the linear interpolation as an initial step but modifies the intermediates significantly later so they are no longer linearly interpolated structures and thus the path is no longer hysteresisfree; (b) a more serious problem is the attribution of by-definition hysteresis-free features to the linearly interpolated states. This is based on conflating the hysteresis-free and unique concepts. The hysteresis in MD-based enhanced sampling is related to the presence of barriers in orthogonal space. For instance, one may use a non-linear interpolation of any type and get a unique pathway, which could be substantially different from the one coming from the linear interpolation. None of these paths will be hysteresis-free necessarily once subjected to MD-based enhanced sampling techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly do not intend to claim that the MEMENTO method is flawless. The concern the reviewer raises around the statement &quot;These paths are then by definition non-hysteretic&quot; is perhaps best addressed by a clarification of the language used and considering how MEMENTO is applied in this work.</p><p>Hysteresis in the most general sense denotes the dependence of a system on its history, or – more specifically – the lagging behind of the system state with regards to some physical driver (for example the external field in magnetism, whence the term originates). In the context of biased MD and enhanced sampling, hysteresis commonly denotes the phenomenon where a path created by a biased dynamics method along a certain collective variable lags behind in phase space in slow orthogonal degrees of freedom (see Figure 1 in Lichtinger and Biggin 2023, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00140">https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00140</ext-link>). When used to generate free energy profiles, this can manifest as starting state bias, where the conformational state that was used to seed the biased dynamics appears lower in free energy than alternative states. Figure S6 shows this effect on the PepT2 system for both steered MD (heavy atom RMSD CV) + umbrella sampling (tip CV) and metadynamics (tip CV). There is, in essence, a coupled problem: without an appropriate CV (which we did not have to start with here), path generation that is required for enhanced sampling displays hysteresis, but the refinement of CVs is only feasible when paths connecting the true phase space basins of the two conformations are available. MEMENTO helps solve this issue by reconstructing protein conformations along morphing paths which perform much better than steered MD paths with respect to giving consistent free energy profiles (see Figure S7 and the validation cases in the MEMENTO paper), even if the same CV is used in umbrella sampling.</p><p>There are still differences between replicates in those PMFs, indicating slow conformational flexibility propagated from end-state sampling through MEMENTO. We use this to refine the CVs further with dimensionality reduction (see the Method section and Figure S8), before moving to 2D-umbrella sampling (figure 3). Here, we think, the reviewer’s point seems to bear. The MEMENTO paths are ‘non-hysteretic by definition’ with respect to given end states in the sense that they connect (by definition) the correct conformations at both end-states (unlike steered MD), which in enhanced sampling manifests as the absence of the strong starting-state bias we had previously observed (Figure S7 vs S6). They are not, however, hysteresis-free with regards to how representative of the end-state conformational flexibility the structures given to MEMENTO really were, which is where the iterative CV design and combination of several MEMENTO paths in 2D-PMFs comes in.</p><p>We also cannot make a direct claim about whether in the transition region the MEMENTO paths might be separated from the true (lower free energy) transition paths by slow orthogonal degrees of freedom, which may conceivably result in overestimated barrier heights separating two free energy basins. We cannot guarantee that this is not the case, but neither in our MEMENTO validation examples nor in this work have we encountered any indications of a problem here.</p><p>We hope that the reviewer will be satisfied by our revision, where we replace the wording in question by a statement that the MEMENTO paths do not suffer from hysteresis that is otherwise incurred as a consequence of not reaching the correct target state in the biased run (in some orthogonal degrees of freedom).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure S1: it would be useful to label the panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the bottom of page 4, it is written that &quot;the extracellular gate only opens spontaneously when both the H87 interaction network and D342-R206 are perturbed (Figure S5).&quot; But it is hard to interpret that from the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our response to reviewer #3.
