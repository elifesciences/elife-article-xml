One of the major inducers of chlamydial persistence is interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released by immune cells as a mechanism of immune defence. IFN-γ activates the catabolic depletion of L-tryptophan (Trp) via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), resulting in persistent <italic>Ctr</italic>. Here, we show that IFN-γ induces the downregulation of c-Myc, the key regulator of host cell metabolism, in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of c-Myc rescued <italic>Ctr</italic> from IFN-γ-induced persistence in cell lines and human fallopian tube organoids. Trp concentrations control c-Myc levels most likely via the PI3K-GSK3β axis. Unbiased metabolic analysis revealed that <italic>Ctr</italic> infection reprograms the host cell tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support pyrimidine biosynthesis. Addition of TCA cycle intermediates or pyrimidine/purine nucleosides to infected cells rescued <italic>Ctr</italic> from IFN-γ-induced persistence. Thus, our results challenge the longstanding hypothesis of Trp depletion through IDO as the major mechanism of IFN-γ-induced metabolic immune defence and significantly extends the understanding of the role of IFN-γ as a broad modulator of host cell metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd><kwd>c-Myc</kwd><kwd>interferon-gamma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2018-ADG/NCI-CAD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudel</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTG 2157/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudel</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The central immune modulator interferon-gamma downregulates the proto-oncogene c-Myc to shut down host cell metabolism and interfere with infection of epithelial cells by obligate intracellular pathogenic <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (<italic>Ctr</italic>) is an obligate intracellular human pathogen, which causes a broad range of acute and chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fenwick, 2012</xref>). It is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STD), with more than 130 million new cases annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Newman et al., 2015</xref>). Infection of the urogenital tract by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> can lead to urethritis, infertility, ectopic pregnancies, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Svenstrup et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, left untreated, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection increases the risk of HIV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galvin and Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 1995</xref>) and might contribute to the development of cervical and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gagnaire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hare et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koskela et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). The pathogen extensively interferes with the physiology of the infected cell, since it depends entirely on its host cell as a replicative niche during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Chlamydiae</italic> have a unique biphasic life cycle, consisting of two physiologically and morphologically distinct forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaylord, 1954</xref>). This gram-negative bacterium initiates its developmental cycle by attachment and invasion of the host cell by the elementary body (EB), the non-dividing infectious form of the pathogen. Inside the cell, EB stay within the endosomes, which they modify rapidly to create a replicative niche termed ‘inclusion’, to avoid lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackstadt et al., 1997</xref>). EB differentiate into reticulate bodies (RB), which is the non-infectious replicating form of the pathogen. It takes several rounds of cell division until RB re-differentiate back into EB and the progenies are released by host cell lysis or extrusion, an exocytosis like mechanism, to infect neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hybiske and Stephens, 2007</xref>). Apart from active infection, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> can turn into a dormant state called persistence and can remain over a long time, maybe even years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suchland et al., 2017</xref>) within its host cell and thereby establish a chronic infection. During the persistent state, the pathogen remains viable and replicates its genome, but it exhibits decreased metabolic activity and inhibited cell division, which leads to the formation of enlarged pleomorphic aberrant bodies (AB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). The transition to the persistent form might represent an important chlamydial survival mechanism against antibiotics and the immune response of the host, since this process is reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beatty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). The conversion to this dormant stage is induced by penicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamura and Manire, 1968</xref>), iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raulston, 1997</xref>), amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allan and Pearce, 1983b</xref>), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beatty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). IFN-γ is an immune-regulated cytokine, which is involved in the cell-intrinsic immunity against several intracellular pathogens, including <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacMicking, 2012</xref>). The downstream signalling pathways activated by IFN-γ are highly species specific and differ dramatically between mouse and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). In human cells, the anti-chlamydial effect of IFN-γ is predominantly mediated by the induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that catalyses the initial step of L-tryptophan (Trp) degradation to <italic>N</italic>-formyl kynurenine and kynurenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taylor and Feng, 1991</xref>). <italic>Ctr</italic> as a Trp auxotroph needs to take up Trp from the host cell for its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). Trp depletion by IFN-γ treatment therefore leads to persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beatty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrne et al., 1986</xref>). However, <italic>Ctr</italic> contain a tryptophan synthase operon comprised of genes encoding the tryptophan repressor (TrpR) and tryptophan synthase α and β subunits (TrpA and TrpB, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> with an intact tryptophan synthase operon have been shown to produce Trp from indole, a metabolic activity that can rescue these strains from IFN-γ-induced growth restriction, if indole is available at the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ziklo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>IFN-γ belongs to the type II interferons that bind to the extracellular domain of the IFN-γ receptor, which is a heterodimer of the two subunits IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. The intracellular domains of the IFNGR1 subunits are associated with Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), while the IFNGR2 subunits are associated with Jak2. Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 results in phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1). STAT1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 701 and serine 727 leads to its homodimerization and nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, STAT1 homodimers bind to IFN-γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements in the promoters of target genes to regulate their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krause et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramana et al., 2000</xref>). IFN-γ can function as both a growth inhibiting and promoting cytokine in a STAT1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asao and Fu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramana et al., 2000</xref>). Binding of STAT1 homodimers to the consensus GAS elements in the <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter inhibits its expression transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramana et al., 2000</xref>). Concurrently, <italic>c-myc</italic> expression is not only negatively regulated by STAT1 but <italic>stat1</italic> is also a negative target gene of c-Myc. Hence, c-Myc and STAT1 regulate each other in a negative feedback loop at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schlee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor c-Myc targets genes involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell growth, translation, metabolism, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battey et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duesberg and Vogt, 1979</xref>). Furthermore, c-Myc activity increases energy production, anabolic metabolism, promotion of aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis, inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang, 1999</xref>). Glutaminolysis increases the production of biomass by providing TCA cycle intermediates via anaplerosis, which enhances their availability for the production of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kress et al., 2015</xref>). c-Myc also critically controls nucleotide biosynthesis by directly regulating the expression of genes that encode the enzymes involved in the production of precursors of all nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mannava et al., 2008</xref>). For example, c-Myc directly controls the cis-regulatory element in the 5’-UTR of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, which catalyses the first committed step in purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2014</xref>). In pyrimidine biosynthesis, the rate-limiting step is catalysed by carbamoyl aspartate dehydratase (CAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans and Guy, 2004</xref>), which is also regulated by c-Myc as a response to growth stimulatory signals, such as activation of EGFR/RAS/MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makinoshima et al., 2014</xref>), Hif 1/2 α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordan et al., 2007</xref>), or estrogen receptor/Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2003</xref>) pathways. We recently identified a central role of c-Myc in the control of the metabolism in <italic>Chlamydia-</italic>infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rajeeve et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has a reduced genome and only very limited metabolic capacity. For example, they have a truncated TCA cycle and lack the ability to synthesize purine and pyrimidine nucleotides de novo but acquire ATP and nucleosides from the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McClarty and Tipples, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tipples and McClarty, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Expression of IDO and depletion of Trp has been previously described as the main reason for interferon-induced persistence in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiyar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Panzetta et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that IFN-γ induces a STAT1-dependent depletion of c-Myc in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells, which de-regulates the host metabolism and induces <italic>Chlamydia</italic> persistence. Importantly, addition of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate or pyrimidine/purine nucleosides were sufficient to prevent persistence and restore chlamydial replication. Our data demonstrate a central role of c-Myc-regulated metabolic pathways in the IFN-γ-induced persistence of <italic>Ctr</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFN-γ treatment prevents c-Myc induction and impairs the development of <italic>Chlamydia</italic></title><p>c-Myc is an important regulator of host cell metabolism and is indispensable for chlamydial acute infection and progeny formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rajeeve et al., 2020</xref>). Since <italic>Chlamydia</italic> adapts a parasitic lifestyle, and it has been shown that several environmental conditions affecting host cell metabolism like iron and amino acid starvation also induce chlamydial persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allan and Pearce, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raulston, 1997</xref>), we investigated the role of c-Myc in chlamydial persistence. From our previous study, it was known that ablation of c-Myc expression interfered with chlamydial development and progeny formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rajeeve et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate if <italic>Chlamydia</italic> enter a persistence state in c-Myc-depleted cells, we infected a HeLa 229 cell line with an anhydrotetracycline (AHT)-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for c-Myc in the absence and presence of the inducer. In agreement with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rajeeve et al., 2020</xref>), silencing of c-Myc expression prevented normal inclusion formation and chlamydial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>). We then cultivated cells for 24 hr with AHT to suppress c-Myc expression (conditions 3 and 4; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At this 24 hr time point, infection load and c-Myc levels were similarly low for conditions 3 and 4. We then either added AHT for another 12 hr (condition 3) or removed AHT (condition 4) to re-establish c-Myc expression (see scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to the cells with silenced c-Myc, removal of AHT efficiently restored inclusion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>), suggesting that suppression of c-Myc induces a persistence state in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. The bacteria obtained in the conditions 2, 3, and 4 were replated on fresh HeLa cell to test if they formed infectious EB under these conditions. These so-called secondary infections demonstrated that the development of EB was severely affected in condition 3, but not in the conditions 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

We therefore investigated the connection of persistence induced by IFN-γ and c-Myc depletion. Interestingly, IFN-γ-treated cells failed to stabilize c-Myc upon <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, induction of persistence by antibiotic treatment, which targets the bacterial rather than host cell metabolism, did not alter c-Myc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Nevertheless, both modes of persistence induction caused a failure of the bacteria to produce infectious progenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). To test whether silencing of c-Myc also induces depletion of Trp in <italic>Ctr,</italic> we monitored the transcription of the chlamydial Trp synthase gene <italic>trp</italic>B which is strongly induced upon endogenous Trp depletion by IFN-γ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). However, silencing of c-Myc did not cause significant changes in <italic>trp</italic>B transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>), indicating that c-Myc depletion does not affect endogenous Trp levels in <italic>Ctr</italic>.</p><p>c-Myc protein stability is regulated by two phosphorylation sites with opposing functions. Serine 62 phosphorylation (pS62) stabilizes c-Myc whereas threonine 58 phosphorylation (pT58) promotes c-Myc degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vervoorts et al., 2006</xref>). IFN-γ treatment led to decreased phosphorylation of c-Myc at serine 62, a modification that prevents the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>) while phosphorylation at threonine 58 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results were obtained, if protein bands of the Western blot were normalized to actin as loading control. However, since c-Myc levels varied significantly upon IFN-γ exposure, normalization to c-Myc protein levels revealed strongly increased phosphorylation at Thr58 (4- and 7-fold, IFN- γ and IFN-γ/infected, respectively) and a mild increase at Ser62 (1.3- and 2-fold, IFN-γ and IFN-γ/infected, respectively). These data are consistent with a role for Thr58 phosphorylation in IFN-γ-mediated downregulation of c-Myc. c-Myc was also depleted upon IFN-γ treatment of primary cells from human fimbriae (Fimb), although the concentration of IFN-γ required to achieve the same effect was five times higher than in HeLa 229 cells (10 ng/mL in HeLa 229 compared to 50 ng/mL in Fimb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Similar results were obtained with a serovar D strain involved in STD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>).</p><p>IFN-γ is known to signal via the JAK-STAT pathway via phosphorylation of STAT1 and subsequent transcriptional regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Treatment with IFN-γ led to the phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727 and tyrosine 701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and prevented the induction of c-Myc protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) upon <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection. To verify that interferon transcriptionally depletes c-Myc via STAT1 signalling, we used siRNA against STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). STAT1 depletion rescued c-Myc levels and chlamydial growth in primary infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). When bacteria from IFN-γ-treated and STAT1-depleted cells were transferred to fresh cells, infectious progeny could be recovered, indicating that STAT1 downregulates c-Myc and prevents chlamydial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>). Since IFN-α also signals through STAT1, we tested whether IFN-α also downregulates c-Myc and chlamydial growth. Although c-Myc levels and the bacterial load were slightly reduced upon IFN-α treatment, it failed to induce strong c-Myc depletion and chlamydial persistence suggesting that type I and II IFNs have different effects on c-Myc levels and chlamydial replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>The IFN-γ response in humans and mice is entirely different, limiting the use of murine systems as models for human pathogenic <italic>Ctr</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore established an IFN-γ-induced persistence model in human fallopian tube organoids. Healthy tissue obtained from patients that underwent hysterectomy was used to establish organoid cultures.

Moreover, the IFN-γ-STAT1 signalling axis was active in human organoids and efficiently prevented the induction of c-Myc upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

These cells were used as infection models for IFN-γ-induced persistence under constant c-Myc expression. Bacterial replication efficiency and the ability to produce infectious progenies were studied. Interestingly, ectopic expression of c-Myc suppressed growth inhibition induced by IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and supported the development of infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Even after extended exposure of infected cells for 24 hr to IFN-γ, expression of c-Myc rescued progeny formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Thus, we validated if exogenous indole recovers chlamydial growth and leads to infectious progenies. Intriguingly, indole addition resulted not only in suppression of persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and formation of infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>), but also in the stabilization of c-Myc in both infected and non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether Trp alone is sufficient to support <italic>Chlamydia</italic> development also in the absence of c-Myc. To address this question, we depleted c-Myc by AHT-inducible shRNA-mediated gene silencing and supplemented the medium with Trp as done in previous experiments. These cells were used for infection studies with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and the formation of progeny was analysed via Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Since excess Trp cannot overcome the suppression of c-Myc, we tested if the constant expression of c-Myc in a Trp-free environment would be able to rescue chlamydial growth. Therefore, WII-U2OS cells were cultivated in Trp-free medium, induced with AHT, treated with IFN-γ, and infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Bacterial replication efficiency and the ability to produce infectious progeny was examined by Western blotting. Neither chlamydial development nor a secondary infection could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). In addition, c-Myc was not stabilized upon chlamydial infection in the absence of Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that viable bacteria and Trp are required for the stabilization of c-Myc. These data support the role of c-Myc in Trp- or indole-mediated rescue from IFN-γ-induced chlamydial persistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Trp addition leads to activation of pGSK3β/c-Myc axis and restores chlamydial infection</title><p>Since we observed that Trp and c-Myc are both required for the development of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, we next investigated the mechanism by which this amino acid regulates c-Myc levels. IFN-γ, upon binding to its receptor, activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT) and induces the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>). If c-Myc is stabilized by the phosphorylation at serine 62 by the MAPK pathway, dephosphorylated active GSK3β phosphorylates c-Myc at threonine 58, followed by its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Both the MAPK and PI3K pathways activated during infection are critical for chlamydial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capmany et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siegl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Subbarayal et al., 2015</xref>).

IFN-γ activated the PI3 kinase pathway as evident from the phosphorylation of AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>).

LAT1 is a system L-amino acid transporter with high affinity for branched chain and bulky amino acids, including Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhutia et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>LAT1</italic> promoter has a binding site for c-Myc and it has been shown that overexpression of c-Myc leads to an increased expression of LAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhutia et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the protein levels of LAT1 during a chlamydial infection and upon IFN-γ treatment were investigated by Western blotting. Accumulation of LAT1 protein was detected in a time-dependent manner in infected HeLa 229 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, LAT1 protein levels were strongly reduced in IFN-γ-treated cells, irrespective of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Following c-Myc expression, LAT1 levels in infected cells were rescued even in the presence of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Differences in reduction of LAT1 levels between HeLa 229 and U2OS cells might be due to a better survival of c-Myc overexpression that can be pro-apoptotic in U2OS cells. Interestingly, the Trp-degrading enzyme IDO, which was strongly induced by IFN-γ treatment as expected, was only partially suppressed by c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

To investigate whether induction of LAT1 by c-Myc increases Trp uptake, we also measured Trp levels in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Unexpectedly, c-Myc expression had no major effect on Trp uptake in untreated and IFN-γ-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To directly measure the impact of c-Myc expression on the IDO activity, we determined the levels of kynurenine as the first and rate-limiting steps in Trp breakdown. To our surprise, c-Myc expression strongly enhanced the production of kynurenine in all IFN-γ-treated samples whereas infection alone or in cells with constant c-Myc expression had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that the relatively low Trp levels in the IFN-γ-treated, c-Myc-expressing cells depend on an increased turn-over.

In contrast, levels of arginine were strongly reduced upon infection, while intracellular levels of the urea cycle metabolites ornithine and citrulline were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, treatment of infected cells with IFN-γ lowered the induction of glutamate as well as aspartate, serine, and glycine. Moreover, levels of most TCA cycle metabolites, in particular aconitate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, were also reduced upon IFN-γ treatment, suggesting that reprogramming of host cell metabolism is a major part of the IFN-γ response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Interestingly, re-expression of c-Myc restored levels of the TCA cycle metabolites citrate, aconitate and α-ketoglutarate, as well as the amino acids glutamine, glutamate, and glycine in IFN-γ-treated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that these metabolites are required for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> development.</p><p>We also investigated intracellular levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and nucleosides as well as intermediates of nucleotide metabolism, as <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is an auxotroph for nucleotides.

This reduction in essential precursors for chlamydial DNA replication may explain why <italic>Chlamydia</italic> enter persistence in the presence of IFN-γ. In addition, overexpression of c-Myc enhanced levels of nucleoside triphosphates and strongly increased intracellular levels of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine in IFN-γ-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Another possibility is that IFN-γ-induced reduction of ATP levels generally slowed down metabolic processes and induced chlamydial persistence.</p><p>Based on the observation that IFN-γ leads to a reduction in TCA cycle intermediates and nucleotides in host cells, we investigated whether chlamydial growth after IFN-γ-induced persistence could be overcome by the supplementation of specific metabolic precursors. We therefore treated WII-U2OS and HeLa 229 cells with IFN-γ, followed by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection and addition of the cell-permeable dimethyl ester of α-ketoglutarate (DMKG) or a mixture of nucleosides (A, C, G, U). In both cell lines, the growth of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> was rescued by the addition of either DMKG or nucleosides and both conditions produced infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). Moreover, restoration of chlamydial development could also be achieved by the sole addition of pyrimidine nucleosides (U+C), and to a minor extend also by purine nucleosides (A+G) (Western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, purines seem to restore inclusion formation more efficiently than pyrimidines (bar diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, addition of citrate also showed the tendency to rescue chlamydial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Even in primary human Fimb cells could the addition of DMKG restore the development of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that IFN-γ broadly alters the metabolism of host cells to limit the availability of metabolic precursors for pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis to promote chlamydial persistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The chlamydial Trp synthase pathway is not involved in c-Myc- and DMKG-mediated rescue of IFN-γ persistence</title><p>Since <italic>Ctr</italic> have an intact Trp synthase operon the effects of c-Myc on the rescue of IFN-γ-induced persistence could be indirect, for example, by the provision of precursors of the Trp synthase.

Chlamydial infection of the epithelial cells lining the genital tract leads to the secretion of cytokines, like IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchholz and Stephens, 2008</xref>) and GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lehr et al., 2018</xref>), which attract myeloid and lymphoid cells towards the site of infection. This local immune response leads to chronic inflammation and may promote the development of malignancy including ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shan and Liu, 2009</xref>). In addition, IFN-γ secreted by infiltrating T cells and NK cells provokes persistence of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in epithelial cells. The current model of the immune defence elicited by IFN-γ in human cells centred around the induction of IDO and the consecutive degradation of Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beatty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is auxotroph for Trp and enters persistence if this amino acid is degraded in the infected cell.</p><p>Our detailed molecular analysis of the IFN-γ-induced metabolic alterations in the host cells challenges this model and shifts the focus to the key transcription factor and proto-oncogene c-Myc as a central regulator of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> persistence. We provide evidence that IFN-γ acts via the GSK3β-STAT1 axis to deplete c-Myc levels and demonstrate that constitutive expression of c-Myc is sufficient to rescue <italic>Chlamydia</italic> from persistence induced by IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, this effect was also evident in human fallopian tube organoids, a newly developed physiologically relevant model for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection.</p><p>The pathway governing persistence uncovered in our study was indeed dependent on the levels of Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), since <italic>Chlamydia</italic> failed to grow in the absence of this amino acid even in the presence of continuous c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). Conversely, the depletion of c-Myc and Trp addition was not sufficient to achieve normal chlamydial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Nevertheless, our results clearly show that both Trp and c-Myc are required for efficient bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> utilizes Trp to synthesize proteins, like the outer membrane protein MOMP, a Trp-rich polypeptide. Our findings that Trp but also indole, which <italic>Ctr</italic> can use as a substrate for Trp synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>), affects the level of c-Myc was unexpected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). It was shown previously that glutamine deprivation lowers levels of adenosine nucleotides and suppresses c-Myc in cancer cells by a mechanism dependent on the c-Myc 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dejure et al., 2017</xref>). We show here that Trp induces the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β and thereby prevents the degradation of c-Myc by the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of GSK3β also occurs during normal chlamydial infection and causes the accumulation of c-Myc protein, as GSK3β leads to a destabilization of c-Myc by phosphorylation on the threonine 58 and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">AlZeer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 1994</xref>). This finding suggests that Trp contributes to the rescue of <italic>Ctr</italic> from persistence by activating the pGSK3ß/c-Myc axis. Interestingly, c-Myc transcriptionally activates expression of the tryptophan transporter LAT-1, thereby increasing the uptake of Trp as part of a positive feedback regulation. Moreover, Trp depletion induced by IFN-γ signalling via STAT1 leads to loss of c-Myc expression, indicating that this amino acid functions as a central regulator of host cell metabolism and determines the decision between chlamydial development vs. the induction of persistence.</p><p>Detailed analysis of supernatants and extracts of infected cells also pointed to a broader impact of IFN-γ treatment on host cell metabolism. While Trp levels were significantly increased in infected cells and strongly reduced by IFN-γ treatment, constitutive expression of c-Myc failed to restore Trp levels in IFN-γ-treated cells despite preventing <italic>Chlamydia</italic> persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Our data suggest that the highly efficient IDO prevents the restoration of Trp levels in the presence of IFN-γ even under constitutive c-Myc expression. Increased Trp levels induced by c-Myc expression are compensated by the enhanced degradation of Trp to kynurenine induced by IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and I</xref>). All genital <italic>Ctr</italic> isolates possess Trp synthase activity which in the presence of indole mediates IFN-γ resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldwell et al., 2003</xref>). However, c-Myc expression also rescued a <italic>trp</italic>BA mutant from IFN-γ persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) excluding a role of the Trp synthase and endogenous Trp synthesis in this pathway. This already indicated that additional metabolic pathways regulated by c-Myc expression may be responsible for preventing persistence induced by IFN-γ. Unbiased metabolomics analysis of IFN-γ-treated, infected and c-Myc-expressing cells, and subsequent hierarchical clustering analyses revealed a grouping of all cells permissive for chlamydial replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; infected, c-Myc infected, c-Myc IFN-γ infected), suggesting that this is the metabolic profile required for chlamydial replication.</p><p>Since c-Myc acts as a major metabolic regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dejure and Eilers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stine et al., 2015</xref>), we systematically investigated the c-Myc-dependent alterations in metabolite levels in response to bacterial infection and IFN-γ treatment. This analysis revealed that several intermediates of the TCA cycle, including citrate, aconitate, and α-ketoglutarate, as well as glutamate, were increased upon chlamydial infection, but significantly depleted upon IFN-γ treatment and restored when c-Myc was re-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, several nucleotides, in particular ATP and CTP, were among the top metabolites upregulated upon chlamydial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, glutamate and alanine, which are both upregulated by infection, repressed in response to IFN-γ treatment and restored by c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), are central metabolites for <italic>Chlamydia,</italic> since they serve as precursors for cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Otten et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we could observe a strong increase in the levels of citrate in c-Myc overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Citrate is required for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are scavenged by the bacteria from the host cell, as <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lack citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase and thus have only an incomplete TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). The finding of others that reduced uptake of glucose may play a role in IFN-γ-induced chlamydial persistence supports our model, since glycolysis fuels the TCA and nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shima et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells showed a drastic reduction in the levels of arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, arginine levels were not restored upon c-Myc re-expression in IFN-γ-treated infected cells. It is possible that arginine is shuttled into the urea cycle, as we observed significantly higher levels of ornithine and citrulline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which can be used for polyamine biosynthesis, that stabilize DNA and are essential for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Dam et al., 2002</xref>). Further work is required to elucidate the exact role of arginine metabolism in chlamydial infection.</p><p>Here, we show a central role of c-Myc in the control of the host cell metabolism during IFN-γ-mediated innate immune defence against <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. The effect of IFN-γ-mediated c-Myc downregulation included substantial remodelling of host cell metabolism, including reduced abundance of TCA cycle intermediates, which are usually replenished via c-Myc-dependent glutaminolysis and anaplerosis. Thus, the enhanced production of amino acids, nucleotides and lipids, and, additionally, TCA cycle intermediates transferred from the host cell to the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mehlitz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rajeeve et al., 2020</xref>) may all be affected by IFN-γ treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kress et al., 2015</xref>). The central role of host TCA cycle and nucleotide biosynthesis for chlamydial development is also supported by our finding that supplementing cell-permeable α-ketoglutarate or nucleosides can overcome the IFN-γ-induced persistent state of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). It can therefore be concluded that c-Myc is required for <italic>Ctr</italic> to induce metabolic reprogramming of the host cell to avoid nutrient shortage during replication and prevent the induction of persistence.</p><p>There is no doubt that Trp plays a central role in the control of chlamydial replication induced by IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taylor and Feng, 1991</xref>). In the human host, depletion of Trp is the major effector mechanism of IFN-γ and the presence of a Trp synthase operon in the genital chlamydial isolates supports a central role of Trp in chlamydial persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002</xref>). However, our finding that both the substrate and the product of the Trp synthase, indole and Trp, control the levels of c-Myc suggests that Trp plays a role in signalling in chlamydial persistence beyond its sole function as an amino acid. IFN-γ depletes the essential amino acid Trp and causes a reduction in the levels of c-Myc, which affects the metabolic state of the host cell in a way that prevents chlamydial replication and induces persistence. It is very likely that similar mechanisms are also involved in IFN-γ-induced persistence of other intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ganesan and Roy, 2019</xref>). In addition, IFN-γ also restricts the infection of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karupiah et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weizman et al., 2017</xref>).

After the respective time, medium was collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the cells were washed with ice-cold 154 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were harvested after adding 480 µL cold MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O (80/20, v/v) (Merck) to each sample containing Lamivudine (Sigma) standard (10 µM). The cell suspension was collected by centrifugation and transferred to an activated (by elution of 1 mL CH<sub>3</sub>CN [Merck]) and equilibrated (by elution of 1 mL MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O [80/20, v/v]) C18-E SPE-column (Phenomenex). The eluate was collected and evaporated in SpeedVac and was dissolved in 50 μL CH<sub>3</sub>CN/5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (25/75). Each sample was diluted 1:1 (cells) or 1:5 (medium) in CH<sub>3</sub>CN. Five µL of sample was applied to HILIC column (Acclaim Mixed-Mode HILIC- 1, 3 µm, 2.1 * 150 mm). Metabolites were separated at 30°C by LC using a DIONEX Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Solvent A: 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O (5/95), Solvent B: 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O (95/5); Gradient: linear from 100% B to 50% B in 6 min, followed by 15 min const. 40% B, then returning to 100% B within 1 min) at a flow rate of 350 µL/min. After chromatographic separation, masses (m/z) were acquired using a Q-Exactive instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive and negative ionization mode in the scan range between 69 and 1000 m/z with a resolution of 70,000. AGC target was set to 3×10<sup>6</sup> and maximum injection time was set to 200 ms. Sheath, auxiliary, and sweep gas were set to 30, 10, and 3, respectively, and spray voltage was fixed to 3.6 kV. S-lens RF level was set to 55.0, the capillary and the Aux gas heater were heated to 320°C and 120°C, respectively. Peak determination and semi-quantitation were performed using TraceFinder software. Obtained signal intensities were normalized to the internal standard (lamivudine) and a cell number, which was determined by crystal violet staining. In brief, for the crystal violet staining cells were fixed with 4% PFA/Sucrose (Roth), stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Merck) dissolved in 20% ethanol (Roth), washed with water, dried overnight, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. The pellet of the cell samples was dried, resuspended in 0.2 M sodium hydroxide (Roth), cooked for 20 min at 95°C, and absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism or MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Significantly changed metabolite levels were determined by ANOVA with subsequent FDR correction, where a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*) and Tukey HSD was applied as post hoc test. Hierarchical clustering, PCA, and pathway analyses were done and resulting plots were generated by MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Generation and culture of human fallopian tube organoids</title><p>Generation of human organoids was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kessler et al., 2019</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Data need strengthening in terms of (a) quantification, (b) statistical analyses, (c) controls and (d) consistency of models used.</p><p>(a) Quantification:</p><p>Strengthen all instances of quantification based on western blots: a single Western blot is not acceptable evidence. Report the level of variance for technical replicates, or variability among independent biological replicates. (See for example Figure 4B, E; S4C, H; Figure S1C.)</p><p>In Figure 1B, there is a significant increase in c-Myc protein in condition 2 compared to condition 1 (~300%). However, in Figure S1C, the increase from t0 to 30 hpi, appears to be very mild (~50%) in c-Myc protein levels compared with at 0 hpi (in the non-IFNγ-treated samples). In light of these variations, please report on the reproducibility of Ctr-mediated c-Myc induction.</p><p>Figures 4A-C, S4A-B, S4D.

We simply wanted to demonstrate in this experiment that mutant Chlamydia behave as wildtype and can be rescued with metabolites.

We in general normalize to actin (as loading control) to have similar normalization conditions in all figures. In case of such a strong variation of c-Myc levels like after IFN-g treatment, the normalization to loading controls gives a wrong picture. If we normalize pThr58 to c-Myc levels, we get a 4- and 7-fold increase after IFN-γ and IFN-γ/infection, respectively. These data are therefore in line with a role of pThr58 in the downregulation of c-Myc and the model we propose for GSK3b and AKT. The model we included in the manuscript shows more or less the textbook knowledge of IFN-g signalling, which we included for the better understanding of the readers. We are happy to remove these models if the reviewer prefer their deletion.</p><p>We have included the following statement in Line 168:</p><p>“while phosphorylation at threonine 58 was unchanged (Figure 1E). These results were obtained, if protein bands of the western blot were normalized to actin as loading control.
