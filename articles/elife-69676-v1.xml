segregation is essential in all living organisms. The ParA-ParB-<italic>parS</italic> system is widely employed for chromosome segregation in bacteria. Previously, we showed that <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> ParB requires cytidine triphosphate to escape the nucleation site <italic>parS</italic> and spread by sliding to the neighboring DNA (Jalal et al., 2020). Here, we provide the structural basis for this transition from nucleation to spreading by solving co-crystal structures of a C-terminal domain truncated <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB with <italic>parS</italic> and with a CTP analog. Nucleating ParB is an open clamp, in which <italic>parS</italic> is captured at the DNA-binding domain (the DNA-gate). Upon binding CTP, the N-terminal domain (NTD) self-dimerizes to close the NTD-gate of the clamp. The DNA-gate also closes, thus driving <italic>parS</italic> into a compartment between the DNA-gate and the C-terminal domain. CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products are likely associated with reopening of the gates to release DNA and recycle ParB. Overall, we suggest a CTP-operated gating mechanism that regulates ParB nucleation, spreading, and recycling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic></kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>spreading</kwd><kwd>molecular gates</kwd><kwd>ParA ParB parS</kwd><kwd>CTP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF\R\201020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung B K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG150448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jalal</surname><given-names>Adam S B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P018165/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung B K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/J/000PR9791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Ngat T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221776/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>Tung B K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019/003321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Badrinarayanan</surname><given-names>Anjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structural and biochemical approach shows that CTP binding and hydrolysis regulate nucleation, spreading, and recycling of a chromosome segregation protein ParB.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper chromosome segregation is essential in all domains of life.

The ParB-DNA nucleoprotein complex stimulates the ATPase activity of ParA, driving the movement of the <italic>parS</italic> locus (and subsequently, the whole chromosome) to the opposite pole of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>). ParB spreads by sliding along the DNA, in a manner that depends on the binding of a co-factor, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balaguer F de et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). A co-crystal structure of a C-terminal domain truncated <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ParB (ParBâCTD) together with CDP showed the nucleotide to be sandwiched between adjacent subunits, thus promoting their dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). A similar arrangement was seen in the co-crystal structure of an N-terminal domain (NTD) truncated version of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> ParB homolog, PadC, bound to CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>). Self-dimerization at the NTD of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB creates a clamp-like molecule that enables DNA entrapment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Biochemical studies with <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParBs showed that CTP facilitates the dissociation of ParB from <italic>parS</italic>, thereby switching ParB from a nucleating mode to a sliding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>). ParB can hydrolyze CTP to CDP and inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>); however, hydrolysis is not required for spreading since ParB in complex with a non-hydrolyzable CTP analog (CTPÉ£S) can still self-load and slide on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PadC does not possess noticeable CTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>). As such, the role of CTP hydrolysis in bacterial chromosome segregation is not yet clear.</p><p>Here, we solve co-crystal structures of a C-terminal domain truncated <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB in complex with either <italic>parS</italic> or CTPÉ£S to better understand the roles of CTP binding and hydrolysis. Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), the NTDs of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB also self-dimerize upon binding to nucleotides, thus closing a molecular gate at this domain (the NTD-gate). Furthermore, the two opposite DNA-binding domains (DBD) move closer together to close a second molecular gate (the DNA-gate). We provide evidence that the CTP-induced closure of the DNA-gate drives <italic>parS</italic> DNA from the DBD into a 20-amino-acid long compartment between the DNA-gate and the C-terminal domain, thus explaining how CTP binding enables ParB to escape the high-affinity <italic>parS</italic> site to spread while still entrapping DNA. Lastly, we identify and characterize a ParB âclamp-lockedâ mutant that is defective in CTP hydrolysis but otherwise competent in gate closing, suggesting a possible role for CTP hydrolysis/release of hydrolytic products in the reopening ParB gates and in recycling ParB. Collectively, we suggest a CTP-operated gating mechanism that might regulate ParB nucleation, spreading, and recycling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-crystal structure of a <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> complex reveals an open conformation at the NTD</title><p>We sought to solve a co-crystal structure of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB nucleating at <italic>parS</italic>.

In contrast to the open conformation of the ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> structure, nucleotide-bound NTDs from opposite subunits self-dimerize (with an interface area of 2111 Ã<sup>2</sup>, as determined by PISA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krissinel, 2015</xref>), thus adopting a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Ten amino acids form hydrogen-bonding contacts with three phosphate groups of CTPÉ£S, either directly or via the coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These phosphate-contacting residues are referred to as P-motifs 1â3, respectively (P for phosphate motif, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Four amino acids at helix Î±1 and the Î±1âÎ²2 intervening loop provide hydrogen-bonding interactions to the cytosine ring, hence are termed the C-motif (C for cytosine motif, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Hydrogen-bonding contacts from the G79 main chain and the S74 side chain to the amino group at position 4 of the cytosine moiety further distinguish CTP from UTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken all together, our structural data are consistent with the known specificity of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB for CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conformational changes between the nucleating and the spreading state of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB</title><p>A direct comparison of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> structure to the ParBâCTD-CTPÉ£S structure further revealed the conformational changes upon nucleotide binding. In the nucleating state, as represented by the ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> structure, helices Î±3 and Î±4 from each subunit bundle together (32<sup>o</sup> angle between Î±3 and Î±4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, in the spreading state, as represented by the ParBâCTD-CTPÉ£S structure, Î±3 swings outwards by 101<sup>o</sup> to pack itself with Î±4â² from the opposing subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nucleotide binding most likely facilitates this âswinging-outâ conformation since both Î±3 and the Î±3âÎ±4 loop, that is, P-motif 3 make numerous contacts with the bound CTPÉ£S and the coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The reciprocal exchange of helices ensures that the packing in the Î±3âÎ±4 protein core remains intact, while likely driving the conformational changes for the rest of the NTD as well as the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, residues 44â121 at the NTD rotate wholesale by 94<sup>o</sup> to dimerize with their counterpart from the opposing subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Also, residues 161â221 at the DBD rotate upward by 26<sup>o</sup> in a near rigid-body movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As a result, the opposite DBDs are closer together in the spreading state (inter-domain distance = ~ 27 Ã) than in the nucleating state (inter-domain distance = ~ 36 Ã) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). By overlaying the CTPÉ£S-bound structure onto the <italic>parS</italic> DNA complex, it is clear that the DBDs in the spreading state clash severely with DNA, hence are no longer compatible with <italic>parS</italic> DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The crosslinking reaction was quenched with 1 mM DTT and ParB (Q35C) was purified away from excess BMOE and DTT using a Zeba buffer exchange column (see Materials and methods). Approximately 70% ParB (Q35C) was in a crosslinked form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>). CTPÉ£S was required to convert apo-ParB (Q35C) to a closed clamp form before crosslinking. Without CTPÉ£S, most apo-ParB (Q35C) is in an open clamp form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>). For all BLI reactions in this figure, 5 ÂµM of ParB (Q35C) and 1 mM CTP/CTPÉ£S were used. Each BLI experiment was triplicated and a representative sensorgram is presented.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5s4sdata1"><label>Figure 5âfigure supplement 4âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Data used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69676-fig5-figsupp4-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69676-fig5-figsupp4-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Previously, it was shown that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB-CTP forms a protein clamp that entraps DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>); however, the location of DNA within the clamp is not yet clear. To locate such DNA-entrapping compartment, we employed a double crosslinking assay while taking advantage of the availability of crosslinkable cysteine residues in all three domains of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB variant with crosslinkable NTD and CTD interfaces (Q35C I304C) was first constructed and purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). ParB (Q35C I304C) could form high molecular weight (HMW) species near the top of the polyacrylamide gel in the presence of CTP, a 3 kb <italic>parS</italic> plasmid, and the crosslinker BMOE (lane 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). The HMW smear on the polyacrylamide gel contained both protein and DNA as apparent from a dual staining with Coomassie and Sybr Green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). Slowly migrating DNA-stained bands were also observed when resolved on an agarose gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). The HMW smear most likely contained DNA-protein catenates between a circular <italic>parS</italic> plasmid and a denatured but otherwise circularly crosslinked ParB (Q35C I304C) polypeptide. Indeed, a post-crosslinking treatment with Benzonase, a non-specific DNA nuclease (lane 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel) or the use of a linearized <italic>parS</italic> plasmid (lane 2 vs. lane 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) eliminated the HMW smear, presumably by unlinking the DNA-protein catenates. Lastly, the HMW smear was not observed when a plasmid containing a scrambled <italic>parS</italic> site was used (lane 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel) or when CTP was omitted from the crosslinking reaction (lane 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel), indicating that the DNA entrapment is dependent on <italic>parS</italic> and CTP. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that as with the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB homolog, <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB is also a CTP-dependent molecular clamp that can entrap <italic>parS</italic> DNA in between the NTD and the CTD.</p><p>Employing the same strategy, we further narrowed down the DNA-entrapping compartment by constructing a ParB (L224C I304C) variant in which both the DBD and the CTD are crosslinkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We found that crosslinked ParB (L224C I304C) also entrapped circular plasmid efficiently in a <italic>parS</italic>- and CTP-dependent manner, as judged by the appearance of the HMW smear near the top of the gel (lane 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left panel). By contrast, ParB (Q35C L224C) that has both the NTD and the DBD crosslinkable was unable to entrap DNA in any tested condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that ParB clamps entrap DNA within a compartment created by a 20-amino-acid linker in between the DBD and the CTD. To investigate further, we constructed a ParB (L224C I304C)-TEV variant, in which a TEV protease cleavage site was inserted within the DBD-CTD linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Again, ParB (L224C I304C)-TEV entrapped a circular <italic>parS</italic> plasmid efficiently in the presence of CTP (the HMW smear on lane 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). However, a post-crosslinking treatment with TEV protease eliminated such HMW smear, presumably by creating a break in the polypeptide through which a circular plasmid could escape (lane 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We also extracted crosslinked ParB (L224C I304C) from gel slices that encompassed the HMW smear and electrophoresed the eluted proteins again on a denaturing gel to find a single band that migrated similarly to a double-crosslinked protein (lane 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that a ParB dimer, rather than ParB oligomers, is the major species that entraps DNA. Taken together, we suggest that <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB dimer functions as a molecular clamp that entraps <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA within a DBD-CTD compartment upon CTP binding. This is also consistent with experiments that showed a premature and irreversible closing of ParB clamps, achieved either by an extended preincubation with CTPÉ£S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4B</xref>) or by pre-crosslinking a closed clamp form of ParB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4C</xref>), prevented nucleation at <italic>parS</italic> and DNA entrapment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB (E102A) is a clamp-locked mutant that is defective in clamp reopening</title><p>Next, we investigated the potential role(s) of CTP hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is unlikely to be required for DNA entrapment and translocation since ParB in complex with CTPÉ£S can still self-load and slide on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>M. xanthus</italic> ParB (N172A) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB (N112S) mutants, which bind but cannot hydrolyze CTP, failed to form higher-order protein-DNA complexes inside the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). However, these ParB variants are already impaired in NTD self-dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), hence the mechanistic role of CTP hydrolysis is still unclear. We postulated that creation of a ParB variant defective in CTP hydrolysis but otherwise competent in NTD self-dimerization would enable us to investigate the possible role of CTP hydrolysis. To this end, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis on the CTP-binding pocket of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Eleven purified ParB variants were assayed for CTP binding by a membrane-spotting assay (DRaCALA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and for CTP hydrolysis by measuring the release rate of inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, their propensity for NTD self-dimerization was also analyzed by crosslinking with BMOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, their ability to nucleate, slide, and entrap a closed <italic>parS</italic> DNA substrate was investigated by a biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Immobilizing a dual biotin-labeled DNA on a streptavidin-coated BLI surface created a closed DNA substrate that can be entrapped by ParB-CTP clamps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>).

E. coli</italic> does not possess a ParA/ParB homolog nor a <italic>parS</italic>-like sequence, thus it serves as a suitable heterologous host. <italic>C. crescentus parS</italic> sites 3 and 4 were engineered onto the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome at the <italic>ygcE</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). CFP-tagged ParB (WT/E102A) was expressed from a leaky lactose promoter (P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic>, no IPTG was added) on a medium-copy-number plasmid. CFP-ParB (WT/E102A) was produced at the same level, as judged by an immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed by ChIP-seq that CFP-ParB (WT) in an <italic>E. coli</italic> host spreads asymmetrically ~5 kb around <italic>parS</italic> sites. By contrast, the shape of the ParB (E102A) distribution was clearly different from that of ParB (WT); the profile was further expanded to both neighboring sides of <italic>parS</italic> (covering in total ~26 kb) at the expense of the enrichment at <italic>parS</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The more excessive spreading of ParB (E102A) might suggest that this variant, in the absence of CTP hydrolysis, persisted and perhaps slid further away from the loading site <italic>parS</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The reduced enrichment of ParB (E102A) at <italic>parS</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) might be due to reduced cytoplasmic ParB (E102A) available to re-nucleate at <italic>parS</italic> and/or due to stably entrapped ParB (E102A) sterically hindering further nucleation events. We also noted that the ChIP-seq profile of CFP-ParB (E102A) in <italic>E. coli</italic> is highly asymmetrical, with more enrichment in the 2905â2911 kb region than the 2885â2899 kb region (shaded areas, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The asymmetrical spreading is possibly due to an impediment in one direction by roadblocks such as RNA polymerases or DNA-bound proteins, which have been shown previously to be able to interfere with ParB spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balaguer F de et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of CFP-ParB (WT/E102A) foci inside cells and found a higher CFP signal for CFP-ParB (E102A) when compared with CFP-ParB (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The higher intensity of the localizations could be due to more DNA-bound ParB (E102A) molecules surrounding the <italic>parS</italic> locus, which is consistent with the ChIP-seq observation showing CFP-ParB (E102A) occupying a more extended genomic area in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Altogether, at least in the heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> host, the âclamp-lockedâ phenotype of ParB (E102A) implies a possible role of CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products in reopening wild-type ParB clamp to release DNA and to recycle ParB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we provide structural insights into the nucleating and sliding states of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB. Nucleating ParB is an open clamp in which <italic>parS</italic> DNA is held tightly (nM affinity) at the DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tran et al., 2018</xref>). The NTDs of nucleating ParB can adopt multiple alternative conformations, and crucially there is no contact between opposing NTDs. We liken this conformation of the NTD to that of an open gate (NTD-gate), through which <italic>parS</italic> DNA might gain access to the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In the sliding state, CTP promotes the self-dimerization of the NTDs, thus closing the NTD-gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Opposing DBDs also move approximately 10 Ã closer together, bringing about a conformation that is DNA incompatible. Again, we liken this conformation of the DBDs to that of a closed gate (DNA-gate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Overall, the DNA-gate closure explains how CTP binding might switch ParB from a nucleating to a sliding state.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB nucleating, sliding, and recycling cycle.</title><p>ParB (dark green) consists of three domains: an N-terminal CTP-binding domain (NTD), a central <italic>parS</italic> DNA-binding domain (DBD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and a 20 amino acid linker that connects the DBD and the CTD together. Nucleating ParB is an open clamp, in which <italic>parS</italic> DNA is captured at the DBD (the DNA-gate). Upon binding CTP (orange), the NTD self-dimerizes to close the NTD-gate of the clamp. CTP-binding and the exchange of helices Î±4 and Î±4â² (blue) stabilize this closed conformation. The DBD also move closer together to close the DNA-gate, potentially driving <italic>parS</italic> DNA into a compartment between the DNA-gate and the C-terminal domain. In the nucleotide-bound state, the DBD and the DNA-recognition helices (Î±6 and Î±6â², magenta) are incompatible with DNA binding. CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products (CDP and inorganic phosphate Pi) may reopen the gates to release DNA. Substitutions that affect key steps in the CTP biding/hydrolysis cycle are also indicated on the schematic diagram.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69676-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our data suggest that the closure of the two gates drives <italic>parS</italic> DNA into a compartment in between the DBD and the CTD. Previously, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>) compared the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParBâCTD-CDP co-crystal structure to that of a <italic>H. pylori</italic> ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> complex and proposed that DNA must be entrapped in the DBD-CTD compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Here, the available structures of nucleating and sliding ParB from the same bacterial species enabled us to introduce a crosslinkable cysteine (L224C) at the DBD, and subsequently provided a direct evidence that the DBD-CTD compartment is the DNA-entrapping compartment. The linker that connects the DBD and the CTD together is not conserved in amino acid sequence among chromosomal ParB orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>); however, we noted that the linker is invariably ~20 amino acid in length and positively charged lysines are over-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The biological significance of the linker length and its lysines, if any, is currently unknown. However, it is worth noting that a human PCNA clamp was proposed to recognize DNA via lysine-rich patches lining the clamp channel, and that these lysine residues help PCNA to slide by tracking the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De March et al., 2017</xref>). Investigating whether lysine residues in the DBD-CTD linker of ParB have a similar role is an important subject for the future.</p><p>If not already bound on DNA, the closed ParB clamp presumably cannot self-load onto <italic>parS</italic> owing to its inaccessible DBD. In this study, we showed that <italic>parS</italic> DNA promotes the CTP-dependent NTD-gate closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), thus is likely a built-in mechanism to ensure gate closure results in a productive DNA entrapment. However, the molecular basis for the <italic>parS</italic>-enhanced gate closure remains unclear due to the lack of a crystal structure of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> apo-ParB, despite our extensive efforts.</p><p>CTP functions as a molecular latch that stabilizes the closure of the NTD-gate of ParB. Here, we provide evidence that CTP hydrolysis might contribute to reopening the closed NTD-gate. A previous structure of a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParBâCTD-CDP complex also has its NTD-gate closed (CTP was hydrolyzed to CDP during the crystallization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), hence it is likely that both CTP hydrolysis and the subsequent release of hydrolytic products are necessary to reopen the gates. However, ParB has a weak to negligible affinity for CDP, hence the CDP-bound ParB species might be short-lived in solution and might not play a significant biological role. Once the clamp is reopened, entrapped DNA might escape via the same route that it first enters. Other well-characterized DNA clamps, for example, type II topoisomerases open their CTD to release trapped DNA. However, the CTDs of ParB are stably dimerized independently of <italic>parS</italic> and CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), hence we speculate that the CTD of ParB is likely to be impassable to the entrapped DNA. The released ParB clamp might re-nucleate on <italic>parS</italic> and bind CTP to close the gate, hence restarting the nucleation and sliding cycle. Such a recycling mechanism might provide a biological advantage since a ParB clamp once closed could otherwise become stably trapped on DNA and thus eventually diffuse too far from the <italic>parS</italic> locus, as evidenced by the ChIP-seq profile of the E102A variant (expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>) that is defective in CTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, how CTP hydrolysis contributes to the assembly of the centromere in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> is still unclear due to the caveat that ParB (E102A) is unstable in the native host.</p><p>The CTP-bound structure of a <italic>M. xanthus</italic> ParB-like protein, PadC, was solved to a high resolution (1.7 Ã); however, PadC does not possess noticeable CTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>). A co-crystal structure of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB with CDP was also solved to a high resolution (1.8 Ã) but represents a post-hydrolysis state instead. Lastly, our CTPÉ£S-bound <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB crystals diffracted to 2.7 Ã, thus preventing water molecules, including a potential catalytic water, from being assigned with confidence. Therefore, the mechanism of CTP hydrolysis by a ParB CTPase remains unresolved. Nevertheless, based on our alanine scanning experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), we speculate that Q58 (P-motif 1) and E102 (P-motif 2) might be involved in the catalytic mechanism of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB. Supporting this view, we noted that an equivalent Q37 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB does not contact the hydrolytic product CDP, and this residue is not conserved in the catalytic-dead <italic>M. xanthus</italic> PadC (F308, which does not contact CTP, occupies this position in PadC instead) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). E102 is also not conserved in M. <italic>xanthus</italic> PadC (F348 occupies this equivalent position) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Given that ParB is the founding member of a new CTPase protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), further studies are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanism of CTP hydrolysis so that the knowledge gained might be generalized to other CTPases.</p><p>Recently, an F-plasmid ParB was shown to form biomolecular condensates in vivo that might bridge distal ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walter et al., 2020</xref>). If and how CTP binding/hydrolysis and the flexibility of the NTD contribute to this process is unclear and will be an important challenge for future studies. It is equally important to better understand the in vivo interaction between ParB and ParA now that CTP is in the picture. Recent in vitro work with ParAB<sub>F</sub> showed that two protomers of a single ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer interact with a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer in the absence of CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). However, two ParBF protomers from two distinct dimers interact with a ParAF dimer in the presence of CTP and <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Which mode of action is dominant in vivo for a chromosomal ParAB<italic>S</italic> systems and whether interacting with ParA further facilitates CTP hydrolysis by ParB are still unknown. Future works will provide important insights to better understand the mechanism of ParA-directed DNA segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

First, single subunits taken from these two entries were trimmed using SCULPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BunkÃ³czi and Read, 2011</xref>) to retain the parts of the structure that aligned with the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParBâCTD sequence, and then all side chains were truncated to CÎ² atoms using CHAINSAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein, 2008</xref>). Comparison of these templates revealed a completely different relationship between the NTD and the DBD. Thus, we prepared search templates based on the individual domains rather than the subunits. The pairs of templates for each domain were then aligned and used as ensemble search models in PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>). For the DNA component, an ideal B-form DNA duplex was generated in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) from a 22 bp palindromic sequence of <italic>parS</italic>. A variety of protocols were attempted in PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>), the best result was obtained by searching for the two DNA duplexes first, followed by four copies of the DBD, giving a TFZ score of 10.5 at 4.5 Ã resolution. We found that the placement of the DBDs with respect to the DNA duplexes was analogous to that seen in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> complex. After several iterations of rebuilding in COOT and refining the model in REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>), it was possible to manually dock one copy of the NTD template (from 1VZ0) into weak and fragmented electron density such that it could be joined to one of the DBDs. A superposition of this more complete subunit onto the other three copies revealed that in only one of these did the NTD agree with the electron density. Inspection of the remaining unfilled electron density showed evidence for the last two missing NTDs, which were also added by manual docking of the domain template (from 1VZ0). For the final stages, TLS refinement was used with a single TLS domain defined for each protein chain and for each DNA strand.

Analysis of the likely composition of the ASU suggested that it contains two copies of the ParBâCTD monomer giving an estimated solvent content of ~50%. Molecular replacement templates were generated from the ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> complex solved above. Attempts to solve the structure in PHASER using individual subunits taken from the latter in both conformations did not yield any convincing solutions, suggesting that the subunits had adopted new conformations. Given that the two subunit conformations observed in the previous structure differed largely in the relative dispositions of DBD and NTDs, we reasoned that a better outcome might be achieved by searching for the DBD and NTD separately. This time PHASER successfully placed two copies of each domain in the ASU such that they could be reconnected to give two subunits in a new conformation. The result was subjected to 100 cycles of jelly-body refinement in REFMAC5 before rebuilding with BUCCANEER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowtan, 2006</xref>) to give a model in which 77% of the expected residues had been fitted into two chains and sequenced. The model was completed after further iterations of model editing in COOT and refinement with REFMAC5. In this case, TLS refinement was not used as this gave poorer validation results.

The impact of this study is on our general understanding of this novel class of nucleotide-dependent processes, and the role that nucleotide-protein interactions play in DNA binding and bacterial physiology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A CTP-dependent gating mechanism enables ParB spreading on DNA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Anthony G Vecchiarelli as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the work is exciting, high quality, will be of broad interest, and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, in the &quot;Recommendations to the Authors&quot; there are two control experiments that all three reviewers agree are simple to perform and required. Also, all three reviewers had concerns regarding the ChIP-seq data that need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) From Reviewer 1: A control experiment where the authors pre-treat ParB with cross-linker <italic>before</italic> addition of DNA substrate to show that premature and irreversible closing of the ring prevents interactions with parS as well as spreading/sliding. The pre-crosslinking might alter protein conformation in other ways (besides closing a gate) that might destroy the DNA binding site (so there are caveats). Nevertheless if crosslinking did not prevent DNA binding, that would affect the overall story.</p><p>2) From Reviewer 2: A linearized plasmid control. The authors use the binding to circular DNA as evidence that ParB is topologically constrained, compared to a 22 bp linear DNA substrate. But the latter might just be too short to make a stable (non-clamped) complex. The experiment is consistent with a clamped complex but does not formally show it. Or perhaps instead of Benzonase treatment, treat the complex with a restriction enzyme after the fact and show it disassembles. This data can be added as a supplemental figure so the authors don't need to repeat the original and redraw the figure. If not performed, then the language should reflect that the experiment does not prove topological constraints.</p><p>3) More critically, reviewers agree that the single MAJOR issue is the ChIP-seq data in Figure 8A. We all expected an expanded profile around parS sites with ParB[E102A] and that is clearly not happening. Also, the authors highlight the upstream extended signal that is amplified in the mutant and largely absent in WT, but this could just be a confounding interaction with the par operon or expression from the parB gene itself. All three reviewers appreciate the authors trying to bring their in vitro findings back into the cell, but it did not seem to work out as described in the text. Of note, the Gruber lab currently has a similar story on BioRxiv and their ChIP-seq data for their CTP-trap mutant of B.sub ParB shows an expansion of signal around the parS sites. As noted in our independent reviews, the authors need to re-interpret their ChIP-seq data, provide a better and more detailed explanation of these findings, and possibly tamper their claims.</p><p>Finally, please see the &quot;Recommendations to the Authors&quot; section from all three reviewers for suggestions to improve clarity and presentation before resubmission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Ln 302-304 and Figure 8</p><p>The description and interpretation of the [E102A] ChIP-seq data, as having a more &quot;extended profile&quot;, is not an entirely accurate. Figure 8A clearly shows that spread is only in one direction (upstream), and there is a massive signal around the parAB operon (particularly over the ParB gene) with [E102A] that is largely absent from the WT ChIP seq. This strong [E102A] signal over the parAB operon dissipates in both directions, and the spread from this specific location is described by the authors as [E102A]'s &quot;extended profile&quot;. This result is striking but not discussed by the authors. The authors need to expand their description and interpretation of the ChIP data as it relates to this region, and speculate as to what they think this upstream signal around the parAB operon may represent.</p><p>Ln 316-317 and Figure 9</p><p>Given the flexibility of the N-terminal domain, do the authors think it possible that this domain flexibility plays a role in ParB's ability to not only close the ring, but also associate with other ParB dimers and/or with ParA? Given that the ParA interaction interface is on this flexible domain, I think the data here interfaces quite nicely with the BioRxiv preprint from the Mizuuchi group (already cited in the paper) that was also recently reviewed by <italic>eLife</italic>: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.427996v1. In particular: They find ParB can bind to ParA either using the two protomers of a single dimer or two protomers from distinct dimers. The former occurs in the absence of ligands, the latter upon addition of either CTP or parS, thus presumably corresponding to the state of ParB found in the cells near a parS site. The discussion would benefit from the authors putting their findings in the context of other ParB interactions shown to be required for chromosome segregation â ParA interaction and ParB dimer oligomerization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The crosslinking at L224 supports the idea that DNA has left the DNA binding domain after clamp closure, consistent with the structural clashes observed. Where is L224 in the DNA binding region? The cartoon in Figure 5 places it at the C-terminal side of the DBD but it would help if the position of L224 was indicated on one of the structures, eg Figure 1B, in addition to the cartoons. Why is there a helix 10 in the structure (Figure 1) but not in the secondary structure of Figure 2-supp2? By my estimation L224 is in helix 10 but this is confusing.</p><p>2. Figure 8: The ChIPseq profile of E102A is confusing and warrants more explanation. The authors state it is &quot;notably more extended than the profile of&quot; wild-type ParB. The shaded area to which they refer does not center on a parS site. What is the explanation for this pattern? That the profile is more extended also predicts that the other parS peaks would be more extended, which does not appear to be the case. Why? If the peaks were normalized to the same height, would E102A peaks look broader?</p><p>3. I like the alanine scanning approach to target the residues that interact with CTP, in part because it is a more comprehensive survey of the CTP binding site, which is poorly understood compared to sites that bind ATP or GTP. This allowed them to identify E102A as a mutation that created a CTP dependent clamp with diminished dissociation rate because it could not hydrolyze CTP. But the analysis also created two other classes of mutants (pg 8). Although the authors would likely argue that their analysis is beyond the scope of the current study, it would add important insight to the story if the authors discussed or proposed explanations for the behavior of each class in the Discussion. For example, why do class II, which bind but do not hydrolyse CTP, behave differently than E102A? Based on their location could they be permanently closed?</p><p>4. Figure 5: There should be a linearized plasmid control. The authors use the binding to circular DNA as evidence that ParB is topologically constrained, compared to a 22 bp linear DNA substrate. But the latter might just be too short to make a stable (non-clamped) complex. The experiment is consistent with a clamped complex but does not formally show it. Or perhaps instead of Benzonase treatment, treat the complex with a restriction enzyme after the fact and show it disassembles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data on the recycling mechanism upon CTP hydrolysis presented in Figure 8A are not sufficiently convincing to conclude that without CTP hydrolysis (variant E102A) the clamped-ParB diffuse longer away from parS than wt ParB. Especially, the most important signal, which strongly extend the ParB signature over DNA on the left side, seems independent of parS loading; indeed, the peak is away from the first and weak parS site. It rather corresponds to the location of the parB gene, which suggests that the signal detected here does not correspond to sliding but rather to ParB synthesis. Therefore, this is against the author's conclusion that preventing CTP hydrolysis extend ParB sliding. In addition, the signal over the parB gene is increased 4-5 fold compare to wt while the parS-specific signals are decreased about 3-fold. This may prevent a direct comparison of the &quot;spreading&quot; signature. Also, if ParB (E102A) is trapped longer on DNA, one would expect that the ParB signal should be higher in between parS sites that are close together such as in between parS3-4-5-6. The authors should comment on this lack of increase, and discuss these in regard of the sliding model relatively to other assembly model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69676.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the work is exciting, high quality, will be of broad interest, and should be published in eLife.

This observation was previously reported for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB (Figure 6 of Jalal et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). There, a prolonged (30-60min) pre-incubation of ParB (WT) with CTPÉ£S eliminated most of ParB binding to and sliding from <italic>parS</italic>. CTPÉ£S, even in the absence of <italic>parS</italic> DNA, gradually converted apo-ParB from an open to a closed protein clamp (Jalal et al., 2020; Soh et al., 2019). If not already bound on DNA, the now inaccessible DNA-binding domain of ParB cannot bind <italic>parS</italic> to nucleate and to subsequently slide to accumulate on DNA.</p><p>In the current manuscript, we have repeated the same experiment but with a crosslinkable ParB (Q35C), as requested by the reviewer, and observed the same behavior in the BLI assay (now reported in Figure 5âfigure supplement 4B, 0 min vs. 30 min pre-incubation with CTPÉ£S).</p><p>We have also pre-crosslinked the closed-clamp form of ParB (Q35C) and subsequently used the crosslinked proteins in the same BLI assay (Figure 5âfigure supplement 4B). To do so, purified ParB (Q35C) was incubated with CTPÉ£S for 30 min, then 1 mM BMOE was added to crosslink the N-terminal domains of ParB (Q35C) together. The crosslinking reaction was quenched with 1 mM DTT and ParB (Q35C) was purified away from excess BMOE and DTT using a Zeba buffer exchange column (See Materials and methods). Approx. 70% ParB (Q35C) was in a crosslinked form, consistent with a previous report (Jalal et al., 2020). Note that CTPÉ£S was required to convert apo-ParB (Q35C) to a closed clamp form before crosslinking. Without CTPÉ£S, most apo-ParB (E35C) is in an open clamp form (Jalal et al., 2020).</p><p>We have now added a sentence to the Results section to bring this important control to the attention of readers:</p><p>âThis is also consistent with experiments that showed a premature and irreversible closing of ParB clamps, achieved either by an extended preincubation with CTPÉ£S (Jalal et al., 2020a and Figure 5âfigure supplement 4B) or by pre-crosslinking a closed clamp form of ParB (Figure 5âfigure supplement 4C), prevented nucleation at parS and DNA entrapment.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) From Reviewer 2: A linearized plasmid control.

Purified ParB (Q35C I304C), ParB (L224C I304C), and ParB (Q35C L224C) were used for reactions in lanes 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12, respectively (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Different DNA were employed in crosslinking reactions: a circular 3-kb <italic>parS</italic> plasmid (3 kb <italic>parS</italic> cir) or a 3-kb <italic>parS</italic> plasmid that had been linearized at an unique HindIII site by HindIII restriction enzyme (3 kb <italic>parS</italic> linear).</p><p>The high molecular weight (HMW) smear near the top of the polyacrylamide gel was observed only when ParB (Q35C I304C) or ParB (L224C I304C) was incubated with CTP and a circular <italic>parS</italic> plasmid (lanes 2 and 6, solid lines and asterisks, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1), but not when a linearized <italic>parS</italic> plasmid was used (lanes 4 and 8, dashed lines and asterisks) or when CTP was omitted (lanes 1 and 5). ParB (Q35C L224C), as expected, did not produce a HMW smear even in the presence of CTP and a circular <italic>parS</italic> plasmid (see also Figure 5âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>Overall, these results are consistent with a closed ParB clamp entrapping a topologically closed <italic>parS</italic> DNA, specifically within the DBD-CTD compartment. We have now revised the Results and Materials and Methods sections to describe these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More critically, reviewers agree that the single MAJOR issue is the ChIP-seq data in Figure 8A.

We have now revised the text and performed extra experiement to address the concern from the reviewers.</p><p>First, we have now described the ChIP-seq profile of ParB (E102A) in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> more accurately. Specifically, we removed this sentence ââ¦the ChIP-seq profile of FLAG-ParB (E102A) â¦ is notably more extended than the profile of FLAG-ParB (WT)â¦â. We highlighted the caveat associated with the instability of FLAG-ParB (E102A) protein in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and cautioned against interpreting the roles of CTP hydrolysis in native <italic>C. crescentus</italic> host, both in the Results and the Discussion sections. We wrote:</p><p>âBy contrast, the ChIP-seq profile of FLAG-ParB (E102A) is significantly reduced in height but has an extra peak over the parB coding sequence (Figure 8A, asterisk). [â¦] Again, due to the caveat of a lower ParB (E102A) protein level in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A), we could not reliably link the in vitro properties of ParB (E102A) to its behaviors in the native host.â</p><p>Second, to overcome the caveat of protein instability, we instead investigated the spreading of ParB (WT) vs. ParB (E102A) from <italic>parS</italic> by analysing the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> ParB/<italic>parS</italic> system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. <italic>E. coli</italic> does not possess a ParA/ParB homolog nor a <italic>parS</italic>-like sequence, thus it serves as a suitable heterologous host. <italic>C. crescentus parS</italic> sites 3 and 4 were engineered onto the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome at the <italic>ygcE</italic> locus (Figure 8B). CFP-tagged ParB (WT/E102A) was expressed from a leaky lactose promoter (P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic>, no IPTG was added) on a medium-copy-number plasmid. CFP-ParB (WT/E102A) was produced at the same level, as judged by an immunoblot (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1B).</p><p>We observed by ChIP-seq that CFP-ParB (WT) in an <italic>E. coli</italic> host spreads asymmetrically ~5 kb around <italic>parS</italic> sites. By contrast, the shape of the ParB (E102A) distribution was clearly different from that of ParB (WT); the profile was further expanded to both neighboring sides of <italic>parS</italic> (covering in total ~26 kb) at the expense of the enrichment at <italic>parS</italic> itself (Figure 8B). The more excessive spreading of ParB (E102A) might suggest that this variant, in the absence of CTP hydrolysis, persisted and perhaps slid further away from the loading site <italic>parS</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The reduced enrichment of ParB (E102A) at <italic>parS</italic> itself (Figure 8B) might be due to reduced cytoplasmic ParB (E102A) available to re-nucleate at <italic>parS</italic> and/or due to stably entrapped ParB (E102A) sterically hindering further nucleation events. We further noted that the ChIP-seq profile of CFP-ParB (E102A) in <italic>E. coli</italic> is highly asymmetrical, with more enrichment in the +2905-2911kb region than the +2885-2899kb region (shaded areas, Figure 8B). The asymmetrical spreading is possibly due to an impediment in one direction by roadblocks such as RNA polymerases or DNA-bound proteins, which have been shown previously to be able to interfere with ParB spreading (Balaguer et al., 2021; Breier and Grossman, 2007; Jalal et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2006; Rodionov et al., 1999; Soh et al., 2019). We also quantified the fluorescence intensity of CFP-ParB (WT/E102A) foci, and found a higher CFP signal for CFP-ParB (E102A) foci than that of CFP-ParB (WT) (Figure 8âfigure supplement 3). This is also consistent with a scenario where CFP-ParB (E102A) occupies a more extended genomic area in our <italic>E. coli</italic> host. Altogether, at least in the heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> host, the âclamp-lockedâ phenotype of ParB (E102A) implies a possible role of CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products in re-opening wild-type ParB clamp to release DNA and to recycle ParB.</p><p>Lastly, we also noted that two preprints from the Gruber and the Thanbichler labs also reported the same phenomenon that the enrichment/height at <italic>parS</italic> itself is reduced but the enriched area around <italic>parS</italic> is expanded in the âclamp-lockedâ mutants in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (Antar et al., 2021; Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, please see the &quot;Recommendations to the Authors&quot; section from all three reviewers for suggestions to improve clarity and presentation before resubmission.</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed responses to the specific points that reviewers have raised are given below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Ln 302-304 and Figure 8</p><p>The description and interpretation of the [E102A] ChIP-seq data, as having a more &quot;extended profile&quot;, is not an entirely accurate. Figure 8A clearly shows that spread is only in one direction (upstream), and there is a massive signal around the parAB operon (particularly over the ParB gene) with [E102A] that is largely absent from the WT ChIP seq. This strong [E102A] signal over the parAB operon dissipates in both directions, and the spread from this specific location is described by the authors as [E102A]'s &quot;extended profile&quot;. This result is striking but not discussed by the authors. The authors need to expand their description and interpretation of the ChIP data as it relates to this region, and speculate as to what they think this upstream signal around the parAB operon may represent.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see my response to point 3 in the Essential Revisions for Authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 316-317 and Figure 9</p><p>Given the flexibility of the N-terminal domain, do the authors think it possible that this domain flexibility plays a role in ParB's ability to not only close the ring, but also associate with other ParB dimers and/or with ParA? Given that the ParA interaction interface is on this flexible domain, I think the data here interfaces quite nicely with the BioRxiv preprint from the Mizuuchi group (already cited in the paper) that was also recently reviewed by eLife: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.24.427996v1. In particular: They find ParB can bind to ParA either using the two protomers of a single dimer or two protomers from distinct dimers. The former occurs in the absence of ligands, the latter upon addition of either CTP or parS, thus presumably corresponding to the state of ParB found in the cells near a parS site. The discussion would benefit from the authors putting their findings in the context of other ParB interactions shown to be required for chromosome segregation â ParA interaction and ParB dimer oligomerization.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points and we have expanded the Discussion as followed:</p><p>âRecently, an F-plasmid ParB was shown to form biomolecular condensates in vivo that might bridge distal ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers together (Guilhas et al., 2020; Walter et al., 2020). [â¦] Future work will provide important insights to better understand the mechanism of ParA-directed DNA segregation.â</p><p>We refrain from over-speculating here because we do not know enough and have not performed any experiments with phase separation or ParA in vivo. We, however, highlighted a few questions which we think are very important and hopefully they will motivate further investigation from multiple labs in our field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The crosslinking at L224 supports the idea that DNA has left the DNA binding domain after clamp closure, consistent with the structural clashes observed. Where is L224 in the DNA binding region? The cartoon in Figure 5 places it at the C-terminal side of the DBD but it would help if the position of L224 was indicated on one of the structures, eg Figure 1B, in addition to the cartoons. Why is there a helix 10 in the structure (Figure 1) but not in the secondary structure of Figure 2-supp2? By my estimation L224 is in helix 10 but this is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Residue L224 locates in the loop that connects helix 9 and helix 10 of the DNA-binding domain (DBD). So the reviewer is correct that L224 positions towards the far C-terminal side of the DBD. We have now indicated the positions of L224 in Figure 1B.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that helix 10 can be seen in the ParBâCTD-<italic>parS</italic> structure (Figure 1B) but not in the CTPÉ£S-bound structure. This is because of the poor electron density for helix 10 in the CTPÉ£S-bound structure, which prevented us from modeling in this last helix of the DBD. We have now mentioned this in the lenged of Figure 2 (that describes the CTPÉ£S-bound structure) to make this clear to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 8: The ChIPseq profile of E102A is confusing and warrants more explanation. The authors state it is &quot;notably more extended than the profile of&quot; wild-type ParB. The shaded area to which they refer does not center on a parS site. What is the explanation for this pattern? That the profile is more extended also predicts that the other parS peaks would be more extended, which does not appear to be the case. Why? If the peaks were normalized to the same height, would E102A peaks look broader?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see my response to point 3 in the Essential Revisions for Authors. Also, if the peaks were normalized to the same height, E102A peaks (in the ChIP-seq profiles for <italic>C. crescentus</italic>) are not broader either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I like the alanine scanning approach to target the residues that interact with CTP, in part because it is a more comprehensive survey of the CTP binding site, which is poorly understood compared to sites that bind ATP or GTP. This allowed them to identify E102A as a mutation that created a CTP dependent clamp with diminished dissociation rate because it could not hydrolyze CTP. But the analysis also created two other classes of mutants (pg 8). Although the authors would likely argue that their analysis is beyond the scope of the current study, it would add important insight to the story if the authors discussed or proposed explanations for the behavior of each class in the Discussion. For example, why do class II, which bind but do not hydrolyse CTP, behave differently than E102A? Based on their location could they be permanently closed?</p></disp-quote><p>We noted that Class II mutants ParB (Q58A) and ParB (E135A) already had an elevated crosslinking efficiency even in the absence of CTP (Figure 6C). This premature clamp closing might indeed result in a less than wild-type level of DNA entrapment (Figure 6D). The reason the clamp closes prematurely for Class II mutants is not yet clear, and cannot easily be rationalized based on our current crystal structures, especially for the Q85A substitution. We wish to investiagate this class of mutants more closely in the near future. We hope the reviewer will understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5: There should be a linearized plasmid control. The authors use the binding to circular DNA as evidence that ParB is topologically constrained, compared to a 22 bp linear DNA substrate. But the latter might just be too short to make a stable (non-clamped) complex. The experiment is consistent with a clamped complex but does not formally show it. Or perhaps instead of Benzonase treatment, treat the complex with a restriction enzyme after the fact and show it disassembles.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see my response to point 2 in the Essential Revisions for Authors.</p><p>References:</p><p>Antar H, Soh Y-M, Zamuer S, Bock FP, Anchimiuk A, Rios PDL, Gruber S. 2021.
