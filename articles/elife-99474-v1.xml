In human infants, it is well-established that social interactions influence speech acquisition and are hypothesized to modulate attentiveness and sensory processes, thereby affecting the speech-learning process. However, our understanding of how social interactions shape vocal ontogenetic processes in non-human mammals, particularly those which vocally learn, remains limited. In the bat <italic>Saccopteryx bilineata</italic>, pups acquire the adult vocal repertoire through a distinctive babbling behavior that shows interesting similarities to human infant babbling. While babbling encompasses many different syllable types, it is particularly noteworthy that pups learn song syllables by imitating adult singing males. The pups' social environment involves frequent interactions with their mothers, whereas adult males mainly serve as the primary source of acoustic input. We monitored the vocal ontogeny of wild pups, investigating whether their social environment influenced three aspects of babbling: the amount of vocal practice, the pups’ final syllable repertoire size and the production of the syllable types acquired through vocal learning. The results demonstrate that maternal behavioral displays significantly influence the amount of vocal practice, the presence and versatility of song syllable types in babbling and the percentage of mature song syllables. Our findings show that maternal feedback plays a significant role in the vocal ontogeny and learning processes of <italic>S. bilineata</italic>, thus enhancing our understanding of the relationship between social feedback and vocal development in mammalian vocal learners.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Babies learn to speak by imitating the sounds made by those around them. This process is shaped not only by their passive exposure to language, but also by the smiles, gestures and other forms of encouragement displayed by their caregivers.</p><p>The impact of this social feedback has been extensively researched in people, yet it is still poorly understood in the rare non-human species that also learn their vocalizations by imitating adults. Most studies in such animals have focused on interactions between a single tutor and tutee in captivity, failing to acknowledge the influence of other individuals in the wild.</p><p>Found in the rainforests of Central and South America, greater sac-winged bats provide a unique opportunity to explore the social mechanisms of vocal learning. Much like human babies, their pups babble; they spent nearly a third of their daytime activity vocalizing and practising the songs they hear from adult males. However, it is with their mothers that these pups most frequently interact.</p><p>To investigate whether maternal feedback influences vocal learning, Fernandez et al. followed nineteen greater sac-winged pups from wild colonies in Panama and Costa Rica over two breeding seasons. They focused on three vocal learning measures: how long pups practiced babbling for, the number and diversity of song syllables they produced, and how ‘mature’ these were compared to those of adult males. The team also tracked how often mothers interacted with their respective babies (by hovering overhead or touching them, for example), as well as the number of adult males in the vicinity.</p><p>Statistical analyses showed that pups with more involved mothers babbled longer each day, and for more days overall; they also produced a wider variety of adult-like sounds, and a higher percentage of syllables that sounded like those produced by an adult singer. In contrast, the number of singing males nearby did not improve any measure of vocal learning. By shedding light on how social feedback influences song acquisition in non-human species, the findings by Fernandez et al. help to better understand the factors that shape vocal learning, and the evolution of language.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social feedback</kwd><kwd>saccopteryx bilineata</kwd><kwd>vocal ontogeny</kwd><kwd>vocal learning</kwd><kwd>babbling</kwd><kwd>social environment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Elsa-Neumann Stipendium des Landes Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>Ahana Aurora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/804352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knörnschild</surname><given-names>Mirjam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-tutorial feedback shapes song acquisition in a mammalian vocal learner.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocal development and learning are often fundamentally social processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carouso-Peck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gultekin and Hage, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janik and Slater, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). Vocal production learning (VPL) is a continuous trait encompassing various levels, including vocal convergence (i.e. gradual change of vocalizations based on social input) and vocal imitation of species-specific or heterospecific vocalizations and artificial sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janik and Knörnschild, 2021</xref>). The social environment influences all levels of VPL to varying degrees, either passively through acoustic input or actively through vocal and behavioral feedback. For example, the social environment of goat kids passively influences the acoustic convergence of their innate contact call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briefer and McElligott, 2012</xref>). Songbird species require acoustic input for successful song learning but vary in the degree to which they require social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García, 2019</xref>). Social feedback has also been shown to influence the maturation patterns of the adult vocal repertoire in marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gultekin and Hage, 2017</xref>). To gain a deeper understanding of vocal learning and development, it is important to explore the social factors that influence it, the extent of their impact, and the consequences when these factors are absent. Questions about how the social environment influences vocal development and learning have begun to receive more research attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bistere et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carouso-Peck and Goldstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gultekin and Hage, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">West and King, 1988</xref>). However, there is need for more studies that explore interactions beyond the tutor-tutee relationship. Only a few studies have addressed this to date (i.e. zebra finch: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bistere et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carouso-Peck and Goldstein, 2019</xref>; i.e. brown-headed cowbird: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">West and King, 1988</xref>), demonstrating the significance of this research direction. Further studies are needed – particularly in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García, 2019</xref>) – to broaden the range of study species, with a special focus on mammalian vocal learners. In this study, we explored the role of social feedback in one of the few non-human mammalian vocal learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janik and Knörnschild, 2021</xref>), the greater sac-winged bat <italic>Saccopteryx bilineata</italic>. This neotropical bat species is known for its extensive vocal repertoire, which includes male song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr and von Helversen, 2004</xref>). During ontogeny, pups acquire a part of the adult vocal repertoire by imitating the territorial song of adult male tutors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>). This learning process is expressed through a vocal practice known as ‘pup babbling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knörnschild et al., 2006</xref>). Pup babbling shows parallels to human infant babbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>), which makes <italic>S. bilineata</italic> a particularly exciting mammalian vocal-learning species to study. Babbling is a conspicuous and unique behavior: Over the course of 7 weeks, pups spend almost 30% of their active daytime hours babbling. Babbling bouts are 7 min on average but can last up to 43 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). Babbling bouts are composed of multisyllabic repetitive vocal sequences (i.e. syllable trains) containing adult-like syllable types (i.e. syllable types of the adult vocal repertoire) and undifferentiated proto-syllables (i.e. syllables only produced by babbling pups) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). Both male and female pups babble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>), which is different from the male-biased plastic song production found in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marler, 1970</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odom et al., 2014</xref> for female bird song). Although babbling bouts can result in maternal care in the form of nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strauss et al., 2010</xref>), babbling is clearly not a begging behavior; babbling differs from begging in structural composition (i.e. including adult and juvenile syllables) and its lack of context specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ter Haar et al., 2021</xref>). To solicit maternal care pups specifically produce isolation calls which they deliver in a fast repetitive manner. Pup babbling is not tied to a specific function – pups either babble alone in the day-roost or interact with their mothers, mainly through various additional behaviors which can occur singly or in interactive sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Remarkably, females never produce these behavioral displays outside of the babbling context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradbury and Emmons, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tannenbaum, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voigt et al., 2008</xref>). Adult males do not behaviorally interact with pups, but their vocalizations provide acoustic input in the form of conspecific adult song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr and von Helversen, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral displays and interactions during babbling and maternal influence on the amount of vocal practice.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) shows the typical social behaviors and interactions of mother-pup pairs during a babbling bout. Note: all these behaviors could occur singly or in an interactive way (i.e. a behavioral display was followed by another in less than one second). (<bold>A</bold>) In on average 80% of cases, the interaction was initiated by the pup, normally by crawling toward the mother while babbling. A mother initiated interactions by hovering in front of or landing next to her pup. (<bold>B</bold>) After the start of an interaction, mother and pup engaged in a number of different behaviors, which were performed equally by both mother and pup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>), with the exception of ‘wing poking’, which was mostly observed in pups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The different behaviors could variably succeed after one another (large arrows); however, ‘crawl towards’ and ‘crawl away’, as well as ‘short flights’ respectively ‘hover flights’ and a temporarily ‘change in the roosting spot’ were often observed in repetitive sequences (bold black arrows). Hover flights in front of the interactive partner were the most conspicuous behavior, followed by the short flights either next to the interaction partner or within the day roost. With increasing pup age, short flights became progressively longer, for example pups even briefly left the day roost and landed on an adjacent tree. (<bold>C</bold>) Interactions between mother and pup could be terminated in two ways: Either the pup continued to babble alone or the mother allowed nursing. Maternal behavior did not differ with regard to pup sex (SI). Drawing credit: C. A. S. Mumm. (<bold>D</bold>) shows the positive influence of the maternal behaviors displayed during babbling bouts on babbling bout duration [s] (N=19 pups, N=186 babbling bouts, GLMM, family Gamma with log link). (<bold>E</bold>) shows that higher maternal activity scores led to a longer babbling phase duration [days] (N=19 pups, LMER). The figure legends represent the raw data, whereas the fitted lines (with lower (2.5th percentile) and upper (97.5th percentile) confidence intervals) are based on the calculated model. Neither bout duration nor babbling phase duration differed between pup sex (SI).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99474-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We studied the vocal ontogeny of 19 pups from 6 wild colonies during two consecutive field seasons (May-September 2016–2017) in Panama and Costa Rica (see Materials and methods). In the present study, we investigated how two primary social factors—the number of singing males (i.e. tutors) and the maternal behaviors displayed during a babbling bout—influenced the following three aspects of pup vocal development and learning: (1) the amount of vocal practice, (2) final syllable repertoire size and, (3) various characteristics of the song syllables learned through vocal imitation while babbling.</p><p>To assess maternal influence, we counted the total number of maternal behavioral displays occurring during babbling, focusing only on interactive behaviors and excluding comfort behaviors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). Territorial song is produced by adult territorial males daily at dusk and dawn for acoustic territorial defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr and von Helversen, 2004</xref>). Thus, the number of singing males (i.e. tutors) present in a colony was used as a proxy for the amount of social acoustic input a given pup received during its ontogeny. Pup age was included in analyses to account for physical maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amount of vocal practice</title><p>The amount of vocal practice was defined as (a) the length of daily practice, that is babbling bout duration in seconds, and (b) the overall babbling phase duration, that is time in days from the first day of babbling until the last (see Materials and methods). The total number of maternal behaviors performed during babbling bouts, as well as pup age, had a significant effect on the duration of daily babbling bouts, whereas the number of tutors had no effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This finding does not result from the fact that longer bouts simply offer the possibility for more maternal displays (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). Interestingly, some mothers were more active than others in the sense that they showed more and different behavioral displays when interacting with pups. Therefore, we calculated a maternal activity score for each female to capture its overall behavioral activity (see Materials and methods). We found that the amount of maternal activity significantly influenced the duration of the babbling phase, whereas, once again, the number of male tutors did not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings show that maternal behaviors significantly shape the amount of time pups spend vocally practicing—age-related increases in endurance and physical maturity explain only part of the variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The influence of the social environment on the amount of vocal practice.</title><p>Response variables (first column): A: <italic>Babbling bout duration [s]:</italic> the babbling bout duration measured in seconds (N=19 pups, N=186 babbling bouts, GLMM, family Gamma with log link, random factor pup ID: repeated measurements over time of the same focal pups).

Babbling is therefore a behavioral indicator of learning. During babbling, the pup’s song precursors strongly resemble the songs of their acoustic tutors, regardless of their genetic relatedness to the tutor. The acoustic changes which the song syllables undergo cannot solely be attributed to maturation processes or convergence toward a species mean, indicating that pups are influenced by the songs they hear on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>). To understand how the social environment impacts learning processes, we examined the characteristic ‘buzz’ syllable types of the territorial song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The territorial song is composed of five different song syllable types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, pups differ in which and how many of these five different song syllable types are present in their babbling. We therefore calculated for each babbling bout the song syllable type versatility (see Materials and methods): high values indicate that the pups’ vocal practice contained many of these different types, low values indicate that the pups’ vocal practice contained fewer different syllable types. Furthermore, the most common song syllable type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>) was categorized into mature and precursor syllables (see Materials and methods) to assess whether the social environment had an influence on the presence of mature syllables in babbling. Subsequently, we investigated whether the social environment influenced the (a) total number of song syllables present in a babbling bout, (b) the song syllable type versatility in a babbling bout, and (c) the percentage of mature versus precursor syllables of the most common song syllable type in babbling bouts. Both maternal behaviors and pup age positively influenced the total number of buzz syllables in babbling bouts, while the number of male tutors had no effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, the versatility was influenced by maternal behavior and pup age, with no influence from the number of male tutors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The maternal behavior also influenced the percentage of mature song syllables present in babbling, with no effect of pup age and the number of male tutors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, we quantified the acoustic change of the most common learned syllable type (B2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>) during ontogeny and explored its relationship with maternal activity. We used classical acoustic parameters (e.g. duration, peak frequency) and linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs) to assess both traditional acoustic features and timbre (voice color) of B2 syllables (see Materials and methods). Discriminant function analyses were performed to obtain centroids (mean canonical scores for each individual) for the early and late babbling phase (see Materials and methods). Subsequently, we calculated Euclidean distances between the early and late babbling phase for each individual, where larger values indicated greater acoustic changes during the babbling phase. Our findings revealed a positive correlation between acoustic changes and maternal activity (Spearman rank correlation: r<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.73, p=0.0037, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Maternal influence on learned syllables in babbling bouts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) shows a typical multisyllabic territorial song produced by an adult male.

In <italic>S. bilineata,</italic> babbling very likely serves multiple functions which are not mutually exclusive. One function of babbling is the acquisition of the learned syllables of the territorial song. The territorial song is an important acoustic signal for adult bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knörnschild et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>S. bilineata</italic>, unlike most other mammals, females disperse after weaning, while most males stay in their natal colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagy et al., 2007</xref>). Adult males queue for territory access. Once they obtain a territory, they mark it through territorial singing, a daily activity influenced by various social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckenweber and Knörnschild, 2013</xref>). The territorial song encodes a group signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckenweber and Knörnschild, 2013</xref>) that may function as a password to identify social group members and potentially assists in the cooperative defense of the colony against unrelated intruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagy et al., 2012</xref>). This group signature might be acquired during the babbling phase, when pups listen to singing adult males. An intriguing aspect of this species is that, unlike most song-learning bird species, female pups show no differences from males in babbling behavior and vocal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>). This study corroborated this finding: female pups received the same maternal feedback, and their song syllable imitation did not differ in any way from male pups (as observed as well in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>). This phenomenon is rare among vocal learners and raises the question of why female pups match male vocal development despite not using the learned vocalizations later in life. One potential explanation might lie in the function of the territorial song for adult females: it serves as an acoustic signal to help females locate new suitable colonies after dispersal. The territorial song exhibits different dialects, with females showing a preference for local over foreign dialects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knörnschild et al., 2017</xref>). The own early practice and production of song might enhance the ability to evaluate male song and support mating decisions. The female preference for the dialect learned during ontogeny likely drives the selection of precise imitative learning in males. This might explain the exceptional and long vocal learning and practice phase during ontogeny. It could also explain why maternal feedback during this period positively influences the production (i.e. amount and versatility) of learned syllables. The process of vocal imitation involves learning through self-perception: An individual hears its own vocal output and matches it to the acoustic input of the tutor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2000</xref>). Increased practice of learned syllable types could strengthen the connection between acoustic perception and vocal production in a manner akin to the mechanisms observed in human infants and songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuhl, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, such practice is likely to improve fine-scale control of the vocal apparatus in a way that will eventually allow for the production of a mature syllable or song. Our data show that <italic>S. bilineata</italic> mothers also influence the presence of mature song syllables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) of the most commonly produced syllable type within babbling bouts. In human infants, contingent social feedback, both vocal and non-vocal (e.g. touch, smiling, moving closer to the infant), can positively influence babbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Schwade, 2008</xref>). For example, social feedback can increase the rate of production of mature speech sounds in babbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2003</xref>). However, it should be noted that this finding does not indicate that contingent social feedback increases the size of the infant’s babbling repertoire through imitation, but rather that it induces a shift toward the production of mature speech sounds that are already present in the infant’s repertoire. The debate about how much imitation is present in babbling during social interactions, and how this imitation manifests itself, is still ongoing. One interesting possibility is that infants imitate prosodic contours in dyadic interactions with their caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gratier and Devouche, 2011</xref>). In most songbird studies, similarity between tutor and tutee defines song learning success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García, 2019</xref>). While this study did not assess the similarity between pups and their adult tutors (due to the limited availability of song data from all adult tutors), we were able to investigate the acoustic trajectories of individual pups during their babbling phase. Our data demonstrates that higher maternal activity was associated with larger overall changes in acoustic parameters in the most commonly learned syllable type (B2). This finding serves as an initial indication that non-vocal interactions with the mother may influence a pup’s individual learning trajectories. Future studies will focus on the relationship between acoustic change, maternal feedback, and learning success, specifically investigating contingencies between particular pup vocalizations and maternal displays in natural settings. Playback experiments are an additional approach to test the impact of contingency on vocal learning. For example, one study in zebra finches demonstrated that contingent non-vocal maternal feedback affects imitation success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carouso-Peck and Goldstein, 2019</xref>), while another recent study found that female calls can promote song learning, but the role of contingency remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bistere et al., 2024</xref>). Beyond the territorial song, it remains unclear whether and which other syllables from the adult vocal repertoire are acquired through vocal learning. However, producing a diverse vocal repertoire that includes syllables with distinct spectro-temporal features may necessitate practice, regardless of whether they are learned socially or not. Vocal practice also involves the transitions between the different syllable types, and possibly even the acquisition of specific sequential orders for later multisyllabic adult vocalizations.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Terminology.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Term</th><th align="left" valign="top">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Syllable type</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sound unit with characteristic spectro-temporal features</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Undifferentiated proto-syllables</td><td align="left" valign="top">Syllables only produced by pups, occurring in babbling and vanish after weaning.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Adult-like syllable</td><td align="left" valign="top">Syllables which are present in the later adult vocal repertoire (after weaning).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Buzz syllable types of song</td><td align="left" valign="top">Territorial song syllables with discernible pulsed part; 5 distinct syllable types: B1, B2, B2 trill, B3, B4 (only syllable with smeared buzz part) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mature syllable</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mature syllables show no gap (e.g. between the pulsed and tonal part, within the buzzed part) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Precursor syllable</td><td align="left" valign="top">Distinct gaps within the pulsed part and/or between pulsed and tonal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Early babbling phase</td><td align="left" valign="top">First half of entire babbling phase</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Late babbling phase</td><td align="left" valign="top">Second half of entire babbling phase</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Song syllables</td><td align="left" valign="top">Syllables of which the territorial song is composed of (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>While we did not find a direct correlation between maternal feedback and the final syllable repertoire size of pups, babbling time may play a role in expanding the vocal repertoire, as indicated by the positive correlation trend between the final syllable repertoire size and the mean bout duration. Maternal behaviors significantly increased the amount of vocal practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which might indirectly support the maturation and acquisition of a large vocal repertoire. Such a relationship has already been documented in common marmosets, where social feedback influences the maturation (i.e. the development of the adult calls) of the vocal repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gultekin and Hage, 2017</xref>). It may appear surprising that the number of singing males did not influence any aspects of pup vocal practice and learning. In songbirds, acoustic input from and social interaction with the tutor plays a pivotal role in song learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García, 2019</xref>). In <italic>S. bilineata</italic>, direct interactions between pups and adult males were absent. Nevertheless, it is possible that the amount of adult male singing could influence pup practice. The present study cannot directly address this relationship, since the measure of song activity applied—the number of singing males—is an indirect indicator. In future studies, we will include the total number and duration of songs to which pups are exposed to and examine whether this might influence various aspects of their vocal practice and learning. Furthermore, the findings of this study are purely observational and future captive playback studies will provide further insight into how social effects affect vocal practice and learning.</p><p>In this study, we focused on how social feedback shaped babbling. However, babbling—itself a salient vocal signal—likely also influences social feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ter Haar et al., 2021</xref>). This might also apply to <italic>S. bilineata</italic> where pups initiated ~80% of social interactions, suggesting that maternal feedback is likely influenced by the pup’s vocal practice. In humans, parents are sensitive to their infants' vocalizations, can intuitively assess speech maturation, and are more likely to respond to sounds that resemble speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oller et al., 2001</xref>). This can initiate a positive feedback loop: when infants receive contingent adult feedback for their speech-like utterances, they tend to produce more speech-like vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Schwade, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Warlaumont et al., 2014</xref>). Babbling in humans is also hypothesized to serve as a vocal fitness signal, potentially evolved to elicit more parental care thus, gaining importance throughout human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oller et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, it would be highly interesting to study the role of hormones and neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Theofanopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of <italic>S. bilineata</italic>, it would be intriguing to investigate whether babbling elicits oxytocin release in mothers and whether, in turn, this hormone modulates maternal social feedback.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that maternal social feedback shapes different aspects of the vocal practice and learning of pups. As bats are highly social mammals that share key aspects of human brain architecture and vocal development, our findings will substantially advance our knowledge about how social interactions shape vocal learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Saccopteryx bilineata</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Saccopteryx bilineata; S. bilineata</italic>; greater sac-winged bat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild animals: two different populations (Costa Rica and Panamá), both male and female pups (N=19 mother-pup pairs) ‘see Material and methods, sections Study species, study sites, acoustic and behavioral data collection’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPSS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IBM SPSS Statistics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R Studio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft SASLab-Pro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft Bioacoustics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_014438">SCR_014438</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VLC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VLC media player</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study species</title><p><italic>Saccopteryx bilineata</italic> roosts in perennial stable groups, that is colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tannenbaum, 1975</xref>).

During all field seasons, we counted the number of singing males present in a colony, representing the indirect social environment of our focal pups. Since adult bats are individually banded with colored plastic rings on their forearms (A.C. Hughes Ltd. UK, size XCL, one band per forearm) and mothers only nurse their own, single pup, individual identity of our focal bats could be determined. The inter-individual distance outside of the mother-pup pairs and discrimination of the individually banded mothers between own and alien pups allowed for focal acoustic recordings and behavioral monitoring. After habituation, it was possible to record and observe focal bats within a distance of 2–4 m without noticeable disturbance.</p><p>During both field seasons, focal pups were recorded at least twice per week, during alternating morning or afternoon recording sessions (approximately 5-hr total recording time) throughout their vocal ontogeny (i.e. from birth until weaning, for more details see methods in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). We used high-quality ultrasonic recording equipment (500 kHz sampling rate, 16-bit depth resolution) to record the vocalizations. The recording set-up consisted of a microphone (Avisoft Ultra SoundGate 116Hm, with condenser microphone CM16, frequency range 1–200 kHz±3 dB, connected to a laptop computer Lenovo S21e) running the software Avisoft-Recorder (v4.2.05 R. Specht, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany). The microphone was mounted on a tripod, which was positioned in close distance to the day-roost and directed at the respective focal pup. Behaviors of mother-pup dyads during babbling were monitored using a combination of video recordings and simultaneously taking notes, to ensure that all behaviors were captured. The video camera was mounted next to the microphone on the tripod.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Acoustic data analysis</title><p>Acoustic analyses of babbling were performed on two different levels: the syllable level (i.e. the basic unit) and the babbling bout level (i.e. composed of syllable trains and interspersed with silent intervals; see Materials and methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The amount of vocal practice was measured in two ways: the duration (in seconds) of babbling bouts and the duration of the babbling phase. A babbling bout is composed of at least three syllable trains which belong to at least two different syllable train categories and has a minimum duration of 30 s (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). A syllable train is defined as a sequence of at least five syllables (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). A babbling bout was either terminated if a pup remained silent for longer than three minutes and/or when a pup was allowed to nurse. The babbling phase duration (in days) spans the period during which the pups were observed to engage in babbling. The day of birth was used to calculate pup age in general, age at babbling onset and the duration of the babbling phase (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). The daily bout duration (in seconds) and babbling phase duration (in days) was obtained during both field seasons (N=186 babbling bouts in total, Costa Rica 2016: N=123 bouts from 10 pups, Panama 2017: N=63 bouts from 9 pups). The final repertoire size of 10 pups (Costa Rica 2016) was analyzed for a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>; method details can be found there). The number of adult-like syllable types (i.e. the syllables that were identifiable as syllables of the later adult vocal repertoire) present in pup babbling at the time point of weaning represented the pups’ final syllable repertoire size. The territorial song is composed of different syllable types whose presence varies with behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckenweber and Knörnschild, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knörnschild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knörnschild et al., 2016</xref>). The typical territorial song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) which is sung at dawn and dusk starts with simple, short tonal syllables and ends with composite syllables (with pulsed and tonal components) which are called buzz syllables. The tonal and buzz syllables are categorized into different syllable types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). For this study, we focused on the buzz syllable types because those are the syllables imitated from tutors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>) and they encode most information about the signaler (i.e. individual-, group and population signature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckenweber and Knörnschild, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knörnschild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knörnschild et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the simple tonal syllable types are also present in other vocalization types, some of which are present directly after pup birth. To analyze the influence of the mothers’ behavior on the buzz syllable types we selected babbling bouts of 10 pups (N=90 babbling bouts, Costa Rica 2016) where we had simultaneous behavioral observations and acoustic recordings (with good signal-to-noise ratio). If possible, we selected one babbling bout per week and pup during the babbling phase and manually labeled all present buzz syllables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We defined five different buzz syllable types based on their spectro-temporal properties, namely B1, B2, B2 trill, B3, and B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) following our categorization in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>. Our visual classification was statistically confirmed in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>), and syllables in this study were classified by the same observer. In total, we manually labeled 9201 buzz syllables (N=90 babbling bouts, Costa Rica 2016). We then performed the following measures: (a) count of all present buzz syllables (but without B1 because it was not present in each pup) and (b) the buzz syllable versatility (R: <italic>vegan</italic> package, function diversity) including all five syllable types present in a babbling bout. Furthermore, we identified the number of mature and precursor syllables of the most common syllable type B2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref> and N=4847 B2 syllables, N=90 babbling bouts, Costa Rica 2016). Syllables were classified as precursor if there were distinct gaps within the pulsed part and/ or within the pulsed and tonal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is clearly not the case in mature syllables of adult males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We focused on B2 syllables because this was the most abundant syllable type in babbling bouts for all pups and because it is the syllable type characteristic of the typical adult male song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate the influence of the social environment on the change of acoustic properties during ontogeny, we measured 530 B2 syllables from eight pups (for two pups of the Costa Rica dataset there was not enough data from the entire ontogeny; therefore, they were excluded for this analysis) and 205 B2 syllables from adult males (for explanation see statistical analysis below). Again, we focused on B2 syllables because this was the most abundant syllable type in babbling bouts for all pups and because it is the syllable type characteristic of the typical adult male song (Figur 2 A). To be able to investigate the acoustic trajectory during ontogeny, we measured B2 syllables from different babbling bouts throughout the entire vocal ontogeny of each pup. For each pup, we normally selected three B2 syllables from one to three syllable trains per babbling bout (N=220 trains in total). It was not always possible to measure three B2 syllables from three trains in a babbling bout either because there were simply not so many B2 syllables (especially at the beginning of the babbling phase) or because the signal-to-noise ratio quality was not sufficient for acoustic measurements. To quantify the acoustic change during ontogeny, we separated the entire babbling period into an early and late babbling phase (for more details see statistical analysis below). For each pup, we analysed the same number of syllable trains per babbling phase (7–20 trains per pup for each babbling phase). Subsequently, we measured various acoustic parameters of the B2 syllables. For our acoustic parameter measurement analysis, we used the software Avisoft SASLab Pro (v.5.3.01, R. Specht, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany). Before measurements, we converted the sampling frequency of each acoustic recording from 500kHz to 250kHz to obtain a higher frequency resolution. The buzz syllables are composed of a pulsed (buzz-like) part preceding a tonal part. We extracted the same acoustic parameters for the pulsed and tonal part separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Acoustic parameters were subsequently averaged (separately for pulsed and tonal parts) for each train to minimize temporal dependence among syllables produced within close succession. Spectrograms for measuring syllable parts were created using a Hamming window with 1024–point Fourier transformation and 93.75% overlap (frequency resolution: 244 Hz, time resolution: 0.256ms). Syllable parts were multi-harmonic; measurements were taken from the harmonic containing most energy (i.e. clearest spectral shape) and the extracted acoustic parameters were subsequently calculated to the fundamental frequency (first harmonic) to make measurements comparable across the different syllable parts. For each syllable part, we measured one temporal (duration) and six spectrum-based parameters (peak-, minimum-, maximum frequency, bandwidth, entropy and harmonics-to-noise ratio). These spectrum-based parameters were measured at the center of each syllable part and at 9 points evenly distributed over each syllable (start, end, and seven intermediate locations). In addition, the six spectrum-based parameters were averaged over each syllable part (mean values) and the maximum spectral values of the entire syllable part were calculated. The spectrum-based parameters were used to estimate the frequency curvatures and entropy and harmonics-to-noise curvatures (henceforth referred to as entropy curvatures) of the syllable parts. Furthermore, we extracted acoustic features that were based on linear-frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs) since these capture important acoustic characteristics of bat vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez and Knörnschild, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knörnschild et al., 2017</xref>). Each LFCC describes the spectral properties of an entire acoustic signal, comprising its most important features in a compact form. The extracted features summarize both common acoustic parameters (e.g. peak frequency) and timbre (voice color). We used a customized MATLAB script in the toolbox ‘voicebox’ (v. R2014a) for the feature extraction. Each vocalization sequence was composed of B2 syllables of the same train containing the first four harmonics (F0-F3, frame length 0.01 s). We extracted 20 LFCCs from each vocal sequence and used them for subsequent statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>To describe and quantify the behaviors of mothers and pups during babbling bouts, videos were analyzed using VLC (VLC media player), complemented by field notes.

Inter-observer-reliability was 100% among the observers. Based on this ethogram, we counted the maternal behavioral displays (N=186 babbling bouts, N=3222 interactive behaviors, N=19 mothers) occurring during babbling, focusing only on the interactive behaviors, excluding comfort behaviors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>To assess the mothers’ influence over the course of the entire pup babbling phase, we calculated a maternal activity score (based on 186 babbling bouts).

We calculated also the mean hover rate per bout. We counted hover behaviors (i.e. hovering in mid-air in front of a roosting conspecific) separately because it is a very distinctive behavior that is never performed outside of a social context; for instance, hovering is produced by adult males during courtship in a multimodal display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr and von Helversen, 2004</xref>). The mean behavioral quotient and the mean hover rate were summed up, and we obtained a maternal activity score ranging from 0.03 to 3.03. Lower numbers accounted for less active mothers and higher numbers for more active ones. The activity score and the number of analyzed bouts did not correlate significantly (i.e. the activity score of a mother is not biased by the different number of bouts analyzed per mother-pup pair; Spearman-rank correlation test: r<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.27, p=0.25).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (RStudio 2021, version 1.4.1106) and SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 2022, version 29.0.0.0.(241)).

The maternal behavior (log transformed and subsequently standardized), the pup age (standardized) and the number of tutors (standardized) were the overdispersion as random factors (GLMM, binomial, N=85 babbling bouts, N=4847 buzz syllables).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>The pups’ acoustic movement during ontogeny</title><p>For each syllable part of the B2 syllable (i.e. buzz part and tonal part) we separately obtained derived parameters (i.e. frequency and entropy curvatures) by performing four separate principal component analyses (PCA) with varimax rotation on the parameters mentioned above (see acoustic data analysis) which reduced multicollinearity between original acoustic parameters. Furthermore, we decided to calculate separate PCAs for the colonies that were acoustically separated (i.e. the bats could not hear each other). PCA frequency curvature: 36 frequency parameters, that is peak, maximum, and minimum frequency, and bandwidth at 9 points evenly distributed over each syllable part; PCA entropy curvature: 18 entropy and harmonics-to-noise ratio parameters, that is entropy and harmonics-to-noise ratio at 9 points evenly distributed over each syllable part. All PCAs fulfilled Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett’s test criteria, ensuring the appropriateness of our data for PCAs.</p><p>Subsequently, we conducted two separate discriminant function analyses (DFAs) for the two colonies, respectively. The DFAs were adjusted to the unequal number of analyzed syllable parts per pup and male by computing group sizes based on prior probabilities. We split the dataset into two phases, namely an early and late babbling phase (i.e. babbling phase duration divided by two). We calculated the multidimensional signal space with the acoustic data from the early babbling phase (entire babbling phase divided by two, first half: early phase, second half: late phase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) and from the adult males and subsequently plotted the acoustic data from the late babbling phase into this signal space. This approach is like a test and training approach where a multidimensional space is calculated based on the training data and subsequently, the test data is analyzed based on the training set. We chose to integrate syllables from adult males to generate the signal space (DFA 1=early babbling phase), since it is known that pups become more similar to their tutors during ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knörnschild et al., 2010</xref>). Instead of including different adult males we summarized the syllables as a representative ‘generic’ male, as we had unequal (and sometimes insufficient) number of syllables from individual males. For each pup, we had the same number of syllable trains per babbling phase (range: 7–20 trains per babbling phase, N=8 pups). For both DFAs, we included the same parameters, namely, duration of the buzz part, duration of the tonal part, mean peak, minimum and maximum frequency of the buzzed respectively tonal part, and two derived parameters of the buzzed respectively tonal part, describing entropy curvatures (all with eigenvalues &gt;1). Furthermore, we included the first two linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC1, LFCC2). In total, we included 12 variables in both separate DFAs.</p><p>To assess the acoustic movement pups underwent during their babbling phase, we calculated the Euclidean distances between individual centroids of babbling phase 1 and phase 2 based on the DFAs. For each pup, we calculated the distance between itself in babbling phase 1 and babbling phase 2 (range distances: 0.46–2.96, with higher numbers depicting larger acoustic movement during ontogeny). Subsequently, we correlated the individual pup movements with the female activity index.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All data collection in Panama (2017) was approved by the local governmental authorities and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC 2017-0516-2020).

Over two field seasons, researchers tracked 19 bat pups from six wild colonies, examining vocal development aspects such as vocal practice duration, syllable repertoire size, and song syllable acquisition.

The paper uses a longitudinal approach, tracking the vocal ontogeny of bat pups from birth to weaning across six colonies and two field seasons, allowing the authors to assess how maternal interactions influence various aspects of vocal practice and learning, providing strong empirical evidence for the critical role of social feedback in non-human mammalian vocal learners. This kind of evidence highlights the complexity of the vocal learning phenotype and shows that it goes beyond the right auditory experience and having the right circuitry.</p><p>The paper offers a nuanced understanding of how specific maternal behaviors impact the acquisition and refinement of the vocal repertoire, while showing the number of male tutors - the source of adult song - did not have much of an effect. The correlation between maternal activity and acoustic changes in learned syllable types is a novel finding that underscores the importance of non-vocal social interactions in vocal learning. In vocal learning research, with some notable exceptions, experience is often understood as auditory experience. This paper highlights how, even though that is one important piece of the puzzle, other kinds of experience directly affect the development of vocal behavior. This is of particular importance in the case of a mammalian species such as Saccopteryx bilineata, as this kind of result is perhaps more often associated with avian species.</p><p>Moreover, the study's findings have broader implications for our understanding of vocal learning across species. By drawing parallels between bat and human vocal development (and in some ways to bird vocal development), the paper highlights common mechanisms that may underlie vocal practice and learning in both humans and other mammals. This interdisciplinary perspective enriches the field and encourages further comparative studies, ultimately advancing our knowledge of the evolutionary and developmental processes that shape vocal productive learning in all its dimensions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for this assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some weaknesses can be pointed out, but in fairness, the authors acknowledge them in one way or another.

Especially bats are a promising taxon for comparative studies because their vocal production and perception systems are highly sophisticated (due to their ability to echolocate).

Feedback typically entails some degree of response contingency, which is not explicitly established here. Although the authors qualitatively describe a variety of female displays that only occur within the babbling context, they also state that &quot;all these behaviors could occur singly or in an interactive way&quot; (Line 102). The authors go on to use aggregate counts of these diverse female displays in their analyses. It would of course be interesting to know whether distinct female displays are evoked differentially by pup behavior and whether specific female behaviors, in turn, predict subsequent pup vocalizations. A display-specific approach might also reveal more about the mechanisms by which the female behavior shapes babbling (e.g. specific reinforcement signals vs. more graded social facilitation or 'audience effect'). However, even without identifying such finegrained contingencies, the main text should at least mention the results shown in Figure 1A. Namely, that pups initiate ~80% of interactive behavioral sequences, suggesting that subsequent maternal displays are likely to be pup-contingent responses (i.e. feedback) and not simply co-occurring behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with Reviewer 1 that it would be very informative to investigate whether distinct female displays are evoked differentially by pup behavior, such as specific syllables within babbling. Or conversely, whether specific female behaviors precede particular pup vocalizations. For this study, we documented maternal behavior through direct observations, field notes, and/or video recordings. However, to capture potential contingencies between specific maternal behavioral displays and vocalization occurring in the millisecond range, other data collection methods (e.g. high-speed camera) will be required in the future.</p><p>Related to this, we have included the following statements (see below). Statement 1 also cites a very recent study in zebra finches, demonstrating that female calls can promote song learning success (Bistere et al. 2024, line 57, lines 304-305).</p><p>Lines 297-305: This finding serves as an initial indication that non-vocal interactions with the mother may influence a pup´s individual learning trajectories. Future studies will focus on the relationship between acoustic change, maternal feedback, and learning success, specifically investigating contingencies between particular pup vocalizations and maternal displays in natural settings. Playback experiments are an additional approach to test the impact of contingency on vocal learning. For example, one study in zebra finches demonstrated that contingent non-vocal maternal feedback affects imitation success (Carouso-Peck &amp; Goldstein, 2019), while another recent study found that female calls can promote song learning but the role of contingency remains to be determined (Bistere et al., 2024).</p><p>Lines: 332-334: This might also apply to <italic>S. bilineata</italic> where pups initiated ~ 80% of social interactions, suggesting that maternal feedback is likely influenced by the pup´s vocal practice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors claim that the number of maternal displays during babbling predicts the duration of babbling bouts (Figure 1D). I find this analysis - and others based on the raw number of behaviors during babbling - difficult to interpret given that the raw number of displays may depend upon the duration of the babbling bout over which they are counted. In other words, might the number of displays reflect the fact that more displays can occur within the interval of longer babbling bouts? It would be relatively straightforward to minimize this potential confound by testing whether female display *rates* predict longer bouts.</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated the display rates (maternal displays per bout duration) and conducted a GLMM (the same analysis after log-transformation and scaling) like in our original manuscript (model 1).</p><p>GLMM</p><p>summary(vocpracf)</p><p>Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: Gamma (log)</p><p>Formula: bout_dur ~ age.z + behavioural_quotient.log.z + nomales.z + (1 | ID) Data: set1</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">AIC</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">BIC</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">loglik</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">deviance</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">df.resid</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2594.9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2614.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-1291.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2582.9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">180</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Scaled residuals.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Min</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">1Q</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Median</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">3Q</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">-1.4604</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-0.7379</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-0.1924</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.5238</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.6564</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><caption><title>Random effects.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1">Groups Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1">Variance</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1">Std.Dev.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ID (Intercept)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0569</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.2385</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Residual</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.3664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.6053</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Number of obs: 186, groups: ID, 19.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table4" position="float"><label>Author response table 4.</label><caption><title>Fixed effects.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Estimate</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Std.

As reviewer 1 points out: more time offers more opportunities for the mother to show displays. The number of displays in longer bouts could just reflect that more displays are possible in a longer period. This could be a potential confounding factor. However, our analysis of display rates as an explaining factor shows that the relationship between bout duration and display rate is negative. This means that in longer bouts the displays increase (as seen in the first scenario), but they happen less frequently per time unit. This could indicate that in longer bouts, the mother takes breaks or longer periods of time between each display, which decreases the frequency of displays. This minimizes the risk of a potential confound, as it shows that the rate of displays tends to decrease rather than increase in longer bouts. In summary: The display rate does not appear to ‘favour’ longer bouts, as longer bouts are associated with a lower display rate. This speaks against the hypothesis that the number of displays only increases due to the longer bout duration. This also means that our analyses, which show that maternal displays influence song syllable production, are not biased or confounded by the bout duration. This suggests that maternal behaviour is targeted and selective, and represents a potentially contingent reaction to the pup´s vocal production, and is not simply determined by the duration of a bout.</p><p>We added this analysis in our supplementary material (Table S2) and pointed this out in the revision of our main manuscript (lines 136-138).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The introduction states that &quot;Pup babbling is not tied to a specific function.&quot; (Lines 75-78). This may be an important point worth exploring with this unique data set. For example, the termination of a babbling bout is defined in some cases by the onset of nursing. Have the authors (or others) tested whether babbling elicits nursing behavior? If so, this may represent a reinforcement mechanism that affects babbling rates and subsequent song outcomes. Similar functional shifts in developing vocal behavior have been reported in male chipping sparrows, in which juvenile begging calls - which initially elicit parental feeding behavior - can later be incorporated into 'sub-song' (i.e. babbling) during the development of courtship song (Lui, Wada, Nottebohm, PLOS ONE, 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this interesting study on chipping sparrows!</p><p>To address your question: Strauss et al. (2010) conducted a study on pup and maternal behaviors, demonstrating that babbling did not consistently result in nursing. When denied care, pups often returned to resting or grooming, a pattern we also observed in our study. While nursing might provide an additional reinforcement mechanisms, it is not the cause that evokes babbling – this is what we mean by stating “pup babbling is not tied to a specific function”. Babbling is not a begging behavior as described by Lui et al. 2009. As mentioned in the review of ter Haar et al. 2021, babbling differs structurally from begging in that it is composed of both adult-like and juvenile syllables and lacks context specificity. To solicit care (i.e. begging) pups produce several isolation calls in a fast repetitive manner. We added a more detailed explanation to make this distinction clear (lines 79-83).</p><p>Another interesting fact and probably more comparable to the study of the chipping sparrows – in which begging calls are incorporated into subsong practice – might be the isolation call syllables of <italic>S. bilineata</italic>. Directly after birth, <italic>S. bilineata</italic> pups produce multisyllabic isolation calls (see Knörnschild &amp; von Helversen 2008, Knörnschild et al. 2012, Fernandez &amp; Knörnschild 2017) that serve to solicit maternal care. For the first 2.5 weeks, pups only produce innate vocalizations, including echolocation and isolation calls (Fernandez et al. 2021). During the babbling phase, the syllables encoding the individual (and group) signature of the isolation call are also incorporated into babbling bouts. The production of isolation calls might also mark an initial step in the vocal learning process. However, in contrast to the subsong of chipping sparrows, babbling bouts in <italic>S. bilineata</italic> also include syllables acquired through vocal imitation. Thus, although we find similarities in vocal practice and development between chipping sparrows and <italic>S. bilineata,</italic> there are also distinct differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Are pups exposed to more male songs when the mother is present?</p><p>The number of singing males in each colony was used as a reasonable proxy for the amount of social acoustic input. However, I wonder if pups are exposed to more adult male songs when the mother is present and, relatedly, if females tend to remain present for longer if a pup is babbling (potentially increasing its exposure to male songs during the babbling phase).</p></disp-quote><p>The mother is always present when males are singing. In <italic>S. bilineata,</italic> males predominantly engage in territorial song twice daily: at dusk and dawn. After foraging at night, territorial singing males are the first to return to the roost, and females will only return when they hear male song. Pups are either attached to the mother´s belly or – when growing older – will fly into the roost followed by the mother. In the evening, males sing approximately half an hour before leaving for foraging. Females will usually leave first, followed by their pups, and males leave last. Hence, females/mothers are always present when pups are exposed to male acoustic input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Pup sex differences:</p><p>The authors test for sex differences within a subset of pups and briefly mention that vocal development is considered in both males and females. This presumably means that female pups also exhibit vocal imitation of adult male territorial songs, even though they only produce these vocalizations during the babbling phase, after which they stop singing entirely. If so, this would, to my knowledge, be a unique phenomenon among vocal learners and would be interesting to discuss in greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed your recommendation and discussed this topic in greater detail. We included the following part in our discussion (lines 257-269): An intriguing aspect of this species is that, unlike most song-learning songbird species, female pups show no differences from males in babbling behavior and vocal development (Fernandez et al. 2021). This study corroborated this finding: female pups received the same maternal feedback, and their song syllable imitation did not differ in any way from male pups (as observed as well in Knörnschild et al. 2010). This phenomenon is rare among vocal learners and raises the question of why female pups match male vocal development despite not using the learned vocalizations later in life. One potential explanation might lie in the function of the territorial song for adult females: it serves as an acoustic signal to help females locate new suitable colonies after dispersal. The territorial song exhibits different dialects, with females showing a preference for local over foreign dialects (Knörnschild et al., 2017). The own early practice and production of song might enhance the ability to evaluate male song and support mating decisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Characterization of song syllables:</p><p>The authors explain their acoustic analyses in detail within the methods, however, descriptions of the syllable classification procedures and acoustic movement analyses need to be presented more clearly in the main text, so readers unfamiliar with bioacoustics or previous work can follow the logic.

Moreover, we included an additional spectrogram in the supplementary material (Fig. S2) displaying examples of precursor and mature syllables for syllable B2.
