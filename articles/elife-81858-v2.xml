In this study, we found that the deletion of the myostatin (<italic>MSTN</italic>) gene positively regulates the expression of the intestinal tight junction-related genes <italic>TJP1</italic> and <italic>OCLN</italic> through the myosin light-chain kinase/myosin light chain pathway. The intestinal structure of <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs differed from wild-type, including by the presence of a thicker muscularis and longer plicae. Together, these changes affect the structure of intestinal microbiota. Mice transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs had myofibers with larger cross-sectional areas and higher fast-twitch glycolytic muscle mass. Microbes responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were enriched in both the <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs and recipient mice, and SCFAs levels were elevated in the colon contents. We also demonstrated that valeric acid stimulates type IIb myofiber growth by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway via G protein-coupled receptor 43 and ameliorates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy. This is the first study to identify the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene-gut microbiota-SCFA axis and its regulatory role in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MSTN</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>short chain fatty acids</kwd><kwd>porcine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32260817</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jin-Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32260026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quan</surname><given-names>Lin-Hu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Changbai Mountain Talent Project of Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>000007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quan</surname><given-names>Lin-Hu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013314</institution-id><institution>Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D18012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quan</surname><given-names>Lin-Hu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent in Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023QN27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jin-Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gut microbiota reshaped by myostatin gene variation has a positive effect on skeletal muscle growth by activating GPR43 through valeric acid, as a metabolite of gut microbiota.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The decline in muscle mass is a considerable health problem that reduces quality of life and increases the risks of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srikanthan and Karlamangla, 2014</xref>).

Myostatin (MSTN), a member of the transforming growth factor β family, is a major regulator of skeletal muscle growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>), substantial muscle hypertrophy characterizes animals and humans with <italic>MSTN</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McPherron et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceccobelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McPherron and Lee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kambadur et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mosher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuelke et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, various MSTN inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, have been evaluated for their potential to treat muscle disorders, such as sarcopenia and cancer-associated cachexia, in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, <italic>MSTN</italic> is not only expressed in skeletal muscle, but also in smooth muscle, including in the intestine, and participates in various metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sundaresan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verzola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esposito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovanecz et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the mutation of <italic>MSTN</italic> alters the composition of the intestinal microbiota in pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pei et al., 2021</xref>). However, how <italic>MSTN</italic> deletion affects the gut microbiota remains unclear.</p><p>Genetic variations have been shown to affect the composition of the gut microbiota. A mutation in human <italic>SLC30A2</italic> causes a reduction in intestinal zinc transport and greater abundance of <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidales</italic>, resulting in mucosal inflammation and intestinal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelleher et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, gut <italic>SLC2A1</italic> gene deletion alters the abundances of <italic>Barnesiella intestinis</italic> and <italic>Faecalibaculum rodentium</italic>, promotes fat accumulation, and impairs sugar tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest that host genes can influence the gut microbiota, and thereby regulate physiologic processes. Furthermore, surgery-induced changes in the intestinal structure, such as intestinal length, epithelial thickness, and surface area, can affect intestinal function and microbial composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seganfredo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicoletti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agus et al., 2018</xref>). Barrier defects are accompanied by major changes in the fecal microbiota and a significant reduction in the abundance of <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, which increases the vulnerability of the host to gastrointestinal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sovran et al., 2019</xref>). However, the relationships among host gene, intestinal structure and intestinal microbiota have not been fully established.</p><p>The intestinal microbiota has effects on muscle growth and development. For example, urease gene-rich microbes, including <italic>Alistipes</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic>, help maintain muscle mass in hibernating animals by promoting urea nitrogen salvage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Regan et al., 2022</xref>), and metabolize lactic acid to provide energy for long periods of exercise and increase endurance in runners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheiman et al., 2019</xref>). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbiota-derived metabolites that help maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, improve glucose and lipid metabolism, control energy expenditure, and regulate the immune system and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">den Besten et al., 2013</xref>). SCFAs are absorbed from the gut lumen and influence host skeletal muscle mass and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahiri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frampton et al., 2020</xref>). They are involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism primarily through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs), such as GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoddart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hul and Cani, 2019</xref>). Although SCFAs, which are gut microbial metabolites, play a role in skeletal muscle development, the mechanism involved requires further clarification.</p><p>Slow-twitch muscles are rich in mitochondria and have high oxidative capacity, whereas fast-twitch muscles generate ATP primarily through glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006</xref>). Aging and muscle atrophy result in gradual declines in muscle mass and strength, which are accompanied by an increase in the proportion of type I myofibers, which results in muscle weakness, owing to the preferential loss and atrophy of fast-twitch glycolytic type IIb myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haber and Weinstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faulkner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkendall and Garrett, 1998</xref>). Type IIb myofibers are larger in size and more glycolytic, and generate substantial contractile force, but have poorer resistance to fatigue, than type I myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). The activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was shown to promote the transition of myofibers from the oxidative to the glycolytic myofiber type by increasing expression of the glycolytic proteins hexokinase 2 (HK2), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), and pyruvate kinase isozyme 2 (PKM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumiya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verbrugge et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>MSTN affects the growth and function of skeletal muscle. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the intestinal microbiota remodeled by <italic>MSTN</italic> deletion is involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth. Because pigs are similar to humans in many respects, including with respect to their physiology, disease progression, and organ structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swindle et al., 2012</xref>), we used <italic>MSTN</italic><sup>−/−</sup> pigs to investigate the regulatory pathway of <italic>MSTN</italic> deletion on intestinal microbiota changes and the these relationships between intestinal microbiota and skeletal muscle growth and function.

Importantly, we have shown for the first time that <italic>MSTN</italic> gene deletion alters the intestinal barrier through the MLCK/p-MLC pathway, which would be expected to affect the composition of intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that the intestinal microbiota remodeled by <italic>MSTN</italic> gene deletion increases fast-twitch glycolytic muscle growth through an increase in the production of valeric acid, which activates the Akt/mTOR pathway through the SCFA receptor GPR43.

In the present study, <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs generated using TALEN genome editing showed inhibition of Smad, enlargement of type IIb myofibers, and overgrowth of skeletal muscle, often referred to as the ‘double-muscle’ phenotype. These findings are consistent with those of the previous studies performed in <italic>MSTN</italic> mutant mice and cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McPherron et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceccobelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McPherron and Lee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kambadur et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs exhibit stronger muscle hypertrophy and fiber enlargement, showing a significant ‘double-muscle’ phenotype. However, the degree of increased muscle mass and fiber size in mice after fecal microbiota transplantation is limited, with only significant increase observed in type IIb muscle fibers. Therefore, the phenotype of increased skeletal muscle mass in mice is not as significant as that in MSTN-KO pigs. We believe that the autonomous changes in muscle cells induced by MSTN KO may be its primary pathway, and our results strongly support the important role of MSTN-mediated changes in gut microbiota in skeletal muscle hypertrophy.</p><p>MSTN expression has been identified not only in skeletal muscles but also in the smooth muscle of blood vessels, the penis, and other tissues, where it co-localizes with α-smooth muscle actin and can affect organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verzola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esposito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kovanecz et al., 2017</xref>). Intestine also contains smooth muscle, and <italic>MSTN</italic> expression in intestine has been demonstrated; however, its role in the intestine is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sundaresan et al., 2008</xref>). The present study is the first to show that <italic>MSTN</italic> knockout leads to a loss of expression in the intestine, which was associated with a thicker intestinal muscularis and longer plicae in the pigs, indicating that <italic>MSTN</italic> knockout induces changes in intestinal morphology. The muscularis is important for intestinal motility, and its thickness relates to the peristaltic ability of the intestine. In addition, the height of the mucosal fold determines the surface area available for intestinal absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geda et al., 2012</xref>). The identified increases in small intestinal muscularis thickness and plical length imply that <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs have greater intestinal absorptive capacity.</p><p>Tight junctions between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells are a critical component of the intestinal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have shown that a disruption in the intestinal barrier leads to greater entry of bacterial products, including lipopolysaccharide, into the circulation, which triggers an inflammatory response in specific tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, the expression of the tight junction factor <italic>TJP1</italic> and <italic>OCLN</italic> was significantly higher in the intestines of <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs. Intestinal barrier function is regulated by the MLCK/MLC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinpitaksakul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chun et al., 2014</xref>), and interestingly, the expression of MLCK and the phosphorylation of MLC were significantly lower in <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs. These results suggest that MSTN may regulate intestinal tight junction function in pigs through the MLCK/MLC pathway. The IPEC-J2 cell line has morphological and functional similarities to porcine intestinal cells, and it therefore represents a good model for the assessment of intestinal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brosnahan and Brown, 2012</xref>). We found that inhibition of the MSTN receptor caused down regulation of MLCK and p-MLC and improved the tight junctions of IPEC-J2 cells. Therefore, we believe that the deletion of the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene in the intestine can affect the intestinal environment through the MLCK/MLC pathway. Importantly, changes in the intestinal environment and barrier function can alter the microbial composition of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seganfredo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicoletti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sekirov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tremaroli et al., 2015</xref>).

Therefore, the alterations in intestinal structure and barrier function induced by the deletion of the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene in the intestine may affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota.</p><p>FMT can lead to the transfer of both the host gut characteristics and metabolic phenotype from pigs to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). To determine the effect of the intestinal microbiota remodeled by <italic>MSTN</italic> gene deletion on skeletal muscle, the intestinal microbiota of <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and WT pigs were transplanted into mice. Interestingly, we found that mice transplanted with <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pig feces had larger GA muscles and muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and in particular larger type IIb myofibers, implying that the increase in size of the GA may be attributable to hypertrophy of type IIb myofibers. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Akt1</italic> transgene activation specifically increases GA mass and type IIb myofiber size through an mTOR-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumiya et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with the findings of the present study, in which significant activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway was identified alongside increases in GA mass and IIb myofiber CSA in the KO-M. In addition, augment of type IIb myofiber was associated with an increase in grip strength but a reduction in endurance during treadmill testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumiya et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, as expected, the KO-M had significantly higher grip strength but poor resistance to fatigue. Importantly, we found that SCFAs producing microbes <italic>Romboutsia</italic>, which was enriched in the <italic>MSTN<sup>−/−</sup></italic> pigs, was also significantly enriched in the recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>−D). The concentration of SCFAs was significantly higher in the colonic contents of the KO-M mice. Moreover, previous research has shown that treatment with the microbial metabolite SCFAs also ameliorates impairments in skeletal muscle, and especially in the GA muscle, by increasing MyoD expression and reducing atrogin-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahiri et al., 2019</xref>). In C2C12 cells, SCFAs also stimulates mitochondrial respiration and promotes a switch of energy production mode from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahiri et al., 2019</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the intestinal microbiota associated with <italic>MSTN</italic> gene deletion causes a growth of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle and improves function, which may be mediated by the enrichment of SCFA-producing microbes.</p><p>SCFAs are the principal metabolites generated by the intestinal microbiota and are involved in multiple physiological processes in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donohoe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canfora et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that valeric acid treatment increases myotube formation in myoblasts, and increases the mass of GA muscles and type IIb muscle fiber size in mice; meanwhile, in previous studies, acetic acid has been shown to improve mitochondrial metabolism and promote the formation of oxidative muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, valeric acid treatment increases the length of the small intestine, thereby improving its ability to absorb nutrients. This is conducive to muscle growth and development. SCFAs play a regulatory role principally by binding to GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stoddart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hul and Cani, 2019</xref>). In the present study, we found that <italic>FFAR2</italic> expression was higher in valeric acid-treated C2C12 cells and mice. Furthermore, the inhibition of GPR43 in mice and the knock down of <italic>FFAR2</italic> in myoblasts were found to prevent valeric acid-induced Akt/mTOR pathway activation, which implies that valeric acid promotes skeletal muscle growth by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway <italic>via</italic> the SCFA receptor GPR43. Because other SCFAs, such as acetic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pan et al., 2015</xref>) and butyric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2020</xref>), also promote skeletal muscle development, we analyzed the effects of various SCFAs in myoblast differentiation, and found that both valeric acid and butyric acid activate the Akt/mTOR pathway via GPR43, whereas acetic acid and propionic acid do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, only valeric acid was found to increase the expression of the myogenic differentiation factors MyoD and MyoG. Aging and long-term or high-dose glucocorticoid therapy induce skeletal muscle atrophy, which principally manifests as a loss of skeletal muscle mass, with a relatively selective loss of type IIb muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haber and Weinstein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faulkner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkendall and Garrett, 1998</xref>).

SCFAs (valeric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, or isobutyric acid) were added to the differentiation medium for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maruta and Yamashita, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). The cells were supplied with fresh differentiation medium every 2 days. Myotubes were obtained after 5 days of differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts at 80% confluence were transfected with 1 mg/mL of CRISPR/Cas9 compound plasmid (FFAR2_eSpCas9-2A-GFP) with a sgRNA sequence of <named-content content-type="sequence">AAGATCGTGTGCGCGCTGAC</named-content>.</p><p>To establish the model of Dex-induced myotube atrophy, myoblasts were treated with 100 μmol/L of Dex at the beginning of differentiation for 24 hr, and 5 mmol/L valeric acid was added to some of the cultures. The myoblasts were cultured in fresh differentiation medium for 5 days and the myotubes obtained were immunostained using anti-MyHC antibody (MyHC, A4.1025, Sigma), and Alexa Fluor 488-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The nuclei were counterstained using 10 μg/μL DAPI (D-9106, Beijing Bioss Biotechnology). The diameters and numbers of nuclei in the differentiated myotubes were measured using Image J (1.51q, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For each treatment, five pictures were obtained from each well of the six-well plates. The diameters of three different parts of each myotube were measured, and the mean values were calculated. To determine the C2C12 fusion index, the numbers of nuclei in the myotubes were counted, divided by the total numbers of nuclei, and multiplied by 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Skeletal muscle and intestinal morphology were examined following hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining.

to changes in skeletal muscle growth and function. By transplanting the remodeled gut microbiota from MSTN-deleted pigs to mice, the authors demonstrate the selective hypertrophy of fast-twitch glycolytic muscles. Additionally, valeric acid, a microbial metabolite produced in the gut, promotes skeletal muscle growth by activating the Akt/mTOR pathway via the SCFA receptor GPR43 and has potential therapeutic implications for muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81858.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kostic</surname><given-names>Aleksandar D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0280a3n32</institution-id><institution>Joslin Diabetes Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.24.501334">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.24.501334v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Though there was unanimous interest in this study, reviewers cite concerns with the level of novelty and mechanistic understanding of the phenotypes reported. Additional experiments are requested. Suggestions to improve the manuscript include demonstrating a causal mechanism between MSTN KO and alterations to the microbiome, or mechanistically determining why the effect of valerate is distinct from acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Additional recommendations for revisions are noted below. Importantly, the manuscript should be thoroughly reviewed for English grammar and syntax.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several issues with the study:</p><p>Is the concentration of valerate in the daily oral gavage consistent with the concentration of valerate naturally in the FMT mice?</p><p>Is there evidence of increased valeric acid in the MSTN KO pigs?</p><p>The significance of the functional metagenomic analysis in the mice (Fig3E) is unclear. First, please display values across all individual mice; as-is, it appears that the values are somehow averaged across individuals. Second, it is strange that the enrichment values appear binary (i.e. either -0.6 or +0.6, but no values in-between). Third, the plot only displays K0 numbers, which are not human-readable. If including this plot in the main text, please include the description of each K0 number and some kind of hierarchical groupings of K0 numbers so that the trend is more apparent, if there is a trend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A better title is needed. Maybe, &quot;Fecal transplant from myostatin KO animals positively impacts the gut-muscle axis&quot;?</p><p>Extensive editing for English syntax and grammar is needed.</p><p>Body weight (Supp Figure 2a) was higher in KO-M starting at week 5 but isn't mentioned in the manuscript.

Additional experiments are requested. Suggestions to improve the manuscript include demonstrating a causal mechanism between MSTN KO and alterations to the microbiome, or mechanistically determining why the effect of valerate is distinct from acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Additional recommendations for revisions are noted below. Importantly, the manuscript should be thoroughly reviewed for English grammar and syntax.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewers for this exciting suggestion. The causal mechanism between MSTN KO and alterations to the microbiota is indeed a valuable study. For this point, we conducted additional experiments in the revised manuscript. Considering that intestinal structure and barrier function affect intestinal microbiota (Gallo et al., 2012; Seganfredo et al., 2017), and MLCK/MLC is an important pathway regulating intestinal barrier function, therefore, we detected the expression of MLCK and the phosphorylation of MLC in the intestine of MSTNKO pigs by western blot, and observed low levels of MLCK and phosphorylation of MLC. Furthermore, inhibition of MSTN in IPEC-J2 cells increased the expression of intestinal tight junction factors ZO-1 and occludin. With the changes in the intestinal muscularis and plicae, and the improvement of intestinal tight junction by MLCK/MLC in MSTN KO pigs, these findings provide strong evidence that the structure and barrier function of intestine is implicated in the alterations of the microbiota by MSTN deletion. These results showed in Figure 2.</p><p>In addition, we thank the reviewer for drawing attention to the difference between valeric acid and other SCFAs. To address this comment, we added new data that both of valeric acid and butyric acid can activate Akt/mTOR pathway through GPR43, but not acetic acid and propionic. Importantly, our data indicated that only valeric acid can promote the expression of myogenic differentiation factors, MyoD and MyoG. We further demonstrated the mechanism by which valeric acid promotes skeletal muscle mass through GPR43 in in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of GPR43 in mice and the knock down of GPR43 in myoblasts were found to prevent valeric acid-induced Akt/mTOR pathway activation. These results showed in Figure 8.</p><p>And, we corrected the grammatical errors throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Gallo RL, Hooper LV.

To clarify the association between MSTN and intestinal barrier function, we conducted a rescue experiment by adding recombinant MSTN (Rc-MSTN) protein to IPEC-J2 cells after MSTN knockout (MSTN-KD). The Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of MLCK and p-MLC, which were decreased by MSTN-KD, were restored upon the addition of Rc-MSTN. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of <italic>TJP1</italic> and <italic>OCLN</italic> were up-regulated in MSTN-KD, whereas their expression decreased following the addition of Rc-MSTN. We found that the MSTN KO in pig altered intestinal barrier function. Therefore, we utilized the commonly used IPEC-J2 cell line, which is associated with intestinal (smooth muscle) barrier function and tight junction, to conduct our experiments (PMID: 22074860; PMID: 36366564; PMID: 35384371).</p><p>The TALEN plasmid we used was consistent with these used for producing the MSTN<sup>-/-</sup> pigs.

Actually, MSTN-KO pigs exhibit stronger muscle hypertrophy and fiber enlargement, displaying a clear &quot;double muscle&quot; phenotype involving a series of muscles such as the longissimus dorsi, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus (the average myofiber sizes of longissimus dorsi were 2177.7 μm<sup>2</sup>, significantly larger than WT in 1564.3 μm<sup>2</sup>, 39.2% increased). However, the degree of increased muscle mass and fiber enlargement observed in mice after fecal microbiota transplantation was limited, only gastrocnemius muscle mass was significantly increased (the average myofiber sizes of GA were 1634.5 μm<sup>2</sup>, significantly larger than WT-M in 1453.7 μm<sup>2</sup>, 12.4% increased), and the phenotype of increased skeletal muscle mass in mice was not as significant as that observed in MSTN-KO pigs. In our study, although the mice did not fully exhibit the same degree of skeletal muscle hypertrophy as the MSTN-KO pigs, the microbiota transplantation did increase skeletal muscle mass and promoted muscle fiber type IIb consistent with the MSTN-KO pigs. This suggests that the gut microbiota does play a role in this process. We have made some changes in the Discussion section. Line 278 to 285.</p><p>We concur with the reviewer's perspective that MSTN KO leads to autonomous alterations in muscle cells. Several studies have shown that MSTN inhibition directly stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of myoblast (PMID: 32156541; PMID: 28955860). As such, we posit that the cell-autonomous changes induced by the MSTN gene in muscle cells may be its primary pathway. Furthermore, the effect of gene-mediated changes in gut microbiota on skeletal muscle is also a novel pathway worth considering. Indeed, our study results undeniably indicate that the altered gut microbiota due to MSTN gene deficiency also partially contributes to the impact on skeletal muscle.</p><p>Although there have been relevant reports proving that gut specific gene knockout affects intestinal microbiota composition, there is no study on global MSTN gene knockout changes intestinal microbiota through the gut. Therefore, this study determined the pathway by which the MSTN gene affects skeletal muscle development through changing intestinal microflora under the condition that adult MSTN KO pigs have a &quot;double muscle&quot; phenotype. The experimental plan proposed by the reviewer for gut-specific MSTN KO in pigs is valuable. In future studies, we will consider and refer to this method to investigate the effects of gut-specific MSTN on microbiota and skeletal muscle.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the intestinal microflora partially participates in the skeletal muscle increase caused by MSTN deficiency, and the results of the mouse fecal microbiota transplantation confirm that gut microbiota is one of the links between the MSTN gene and skeletal muscle.</p><p>We hope that these revisions have addressed your concerns and improved the quality of our manuscript.</p><p>Brosnahan AJ, Brown DR. 2012.
