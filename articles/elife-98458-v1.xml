signaling. At excitatory synapses, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter and upon release from presynaptic vesicles, is detected by postsynaptic glutamate receptors, which include ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors. Here, we have developed methods to identify glutamatergic synapses in brain tissue slices, label AMPA receptors with small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and prepare lamella for cryo-electron tomography studies. The targeted imaging of glutamatergic synapses in the lamella is facilitated by fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic signatures, and the subsequent tomograms allow for the identification of key features of chemical synapses, including synaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and AuNP-labeled AMPA receptors. These methods pave the way for imaging brain regions at high resolution, using unstained, unfixed samples preserved under near-native conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-ET</kwd><kwd>hippocampus synapse</kwd><kwd>AMPA receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA253730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spangler</surname><given-names>Cathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jennifer and Bernard LaCroute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp; Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS038631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By harnessing antibody fragments conjugated to small gold nanoparticles together with high pressure freezing, FIB/SEM milling and cryo-electron tomography, AMPA receptors were identified from mouse brain tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical synapses underpin the majority of communication sites between neurons and are comprised of a presynaptic terminal, a synaptic cleft, and a postsynaptic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Südhof and Malenka, 2008</xref>). Signal transduction at synapses involves voltage-dependent and calcium-stimulated release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles, typically raising the concentration of neurotransmitters in the cleft as much as 10<sup>5</sup>-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clements et al., 1992</xref>). The bolus of neurotransmitter in turn promotes activation of synaptic and perisynaptic receptors, which are primarily located on postsynaptic specializations, thereby inducing depolarization, calcium entry into dendrites, and propagation of the neuronal impulse. At glutamatergic synapses, the neurotransmitter signal is quenched by clearance from synaptic and extracellular spaces by binding to and subsequent uptake via sodium-coupled transporters. Despite the central roles that chemical synapses play in the development and function of the nervous system, and their association with neurological disease and dysfunction, the molecular structure of the synapse has remained elusive, largely due to challenges associated with imaging at high resolution.</p><p>The first images of chemical synapses were derived from electron microscopy studies of fixed and stained neuronal and neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palade and Palay, 1954</xref>). Chemical fixation, dehydration, and heavy metal staining during the sample preparation process, in combination with early electron microscopes and recording methods, severely constrained the resolution of the images and likely distorted molecular features. Nevertheless, it was possible to make out presynaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic density. Subsequent electron microscopy studies, using both cultured neurons and brain tissue-derived samples, together with imaging studies of biochemically isolated synaptosomes, have provided progressively higher-resolution visualizations of synapses and their surrounding structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris and Stevens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>). More recently, electron microscopy experiments, together with light microscopy studies, suggest that in excitatory, glutamatergic synapses, there is a transsynaptic organization of presynaptic and postsynaptic components that aligns sites of transmitter release and detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cole and Reese, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report approaches for imaging glutamatergic synapses from the CA1 region of the hippocampus, a well-studied region of the brain that plays crucial roles in memory and learning and that includes the pyramidal cell, CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral synapses. To enable the identification and visualization of glutamatergic synapses, we developed several key methods. First, we generated an engineered mouse line to pinpoint excitatory synapses via fluorescence methods. Second, we developed a GluA2-specific antibody fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>) AuNP conjugate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azubel and Kornberg, 2016</xref>) to localize AMPA subtype glutamate receptors. Third, we optimized sample preparation from unfixed hippocampal brain tissue, together with the application of cryo-protectants and high-pressure freezing (HPF). With the frozen slices in hand, we next employed cryo-focused ion beam, scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FIB/SEM) milling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rigort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelley et al., 2022</xref>) to produce thin lamella, in turn using pre- and postsynaptic fluorescence signals to guide imaging by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). By combining all of these approaches, we created an experimental workflow that allows us to image excitatory synapses from unfixed, chemically unstained brain tissue by cryo-ET at near nanometer resolution, thereby opening the door to the direct localization of molecules involved in synapse structure, organization, and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab conjugated to a single gold nanoparticle</title><p>To provide an electron-dense marker for labeling individual, GluA2-containing AMPARs at glutamatergic synapses in cryo-electron tomograms, we developed a strategy to label the anti-GluA2, 15F1 Fab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rigort et al., 2012</xref>) with a single AuNP based on previously determined methods to label antibody fragments with AuNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azubel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elferich et al., 2021</xref>).

Taking advantage of an affinity tag included at the C-terminus of the Fab, the anti-GluA2 Fab-AuNP conjugate was used to affinity purify native GluA2-containing AMPARs from mouse hippocampal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The isolated receptors were then visualized by single particle cryo-EM to investigate the stoichiometry of the 15F1 Fab-AuNPs bound to native AMPARs and to also determine the spatial positioning of the AuNPs relative to the receptor. Previous work from our group employing a similar anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab-directed purification of native hippocampal AMPARs revealed that the majority of GluA2-containing AMPARs in the mouse hippocampus contain two GluA2 subunits, occupying the B and D positions of the AMPAR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). In agreement with the studies of Yu and colleagues, imaging of the 15F1 Fab-AuNP-purified AMPARs revealed that the majority of particles harbor two clear AuNP densities present at positions consistent with the 15F1 Fab binding epitope on the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the GluA2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We do note that a minority of particles, less than about 20%, bear only a single AuNP, which may be due to either incomplete labeling, to labeling with a Fab devoid of an AuNP, to receptors with only a single GluA2 subunit, or to the unbinding of the Fab-AuNP and perhaps, separately, the loss of the AuNP itself. Nevertheless, we speculate that the majority of singly labeled receptors are simply those with one GluA2 subunit for several reasons. Not only was the Fab-AuNP conjugate purified by gel electrophoresis, but we also employed an excess of the Fab-AuNP conjugate, and the Fab-AuNP receptor complex was additionally purified by size exclusion chromatography.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fluorescence-guided localization of glutamatergic synapses</title><p>To enable the reliable, targeted imaging of AMPARs at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the context of the relatively large area of the lamella, a transgenic mouse line expressing mScarlet fused to the presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) and EGFP fused to the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The vGlut1-mScarlet mouse line was designed in an identical manner to a previously established vGlut1-mVenus knock-in line in which the C-terminus of vGlut1 is fused to mVenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herzog et al., 2011</xref>). vGlut1 is abundantly expressed in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles, allowing for clear fluorescent visualization of excitatory presynaptic sites within tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herzog et al., 2011</xref>). At postsynaptic sites, PSD95 is the m ost abundant scaffolding protein within the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>) and thus we generated a mouse line in which PSD95 is tagged at the C-terminus with EGFP. To enable simultaneous visualization of pre-and postsynaptic sites by fluorescent imaging, the homozygous vGlut1-mScarlet and PSD95-EGFP mouse lines were bred to make a double transgenic mouse line expressing both vGlut1-mScarlet and PSD95-EGFP.

Brain slices of this size are thin enough to minimize ice formation and make cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling less challenging, while thick enough to handle during immunolabeling and high-pressure freezing. From each horizontal brain slice, the hippocampal region was excised carefully with a scalpel knife (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These hippocampal slices were incubated with the anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugate for 1 hr at room temperature on an orbital shaker.

Immediately before high-pressure freezing, gold fiducials prepared in media containing dextran and sucrose cryoprotectants were applied to the sample on the planchettes. During high-pressure freezing, the tissue was pressed in between the grid bars and frozen. Because the sample thickness is approximately equivalent to the height of the grid bars, the portion of the sample that is between the grid bars is minimally compressed during freezing.

After washout, the tissue was subsequently soaked with the 15F1 Fab labeled with Janelia Fluor 646 (40 nM) for another 30 min. We reasoned that if the 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugate saturated all available binding sites on GluA2-containing AMPARs, further labeling of GluA2-containing AMPARs with the 15F1 Fab-Janelia Fluor 646 conjugate should be low. In tissue samples without 15F1 Fab-AuNP pretreatment, we observe clear 15F1 Fab-Janelia Fluor 646 signal that slightly overlaps with the PSD95-EGFP and vGlut1-mScarlet fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in slices previously soaked with 15F1 Fab-AuNP, the 15F1 Fab-Janelia Fluor 646 signal was substantially reduced. Based on this experiment and the established propensity of the 15F1 antibody and its fragments to label GluA2-containing AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>), we expect that the ‘staining’ with the 15F1 Fab-AuNP used in our tissue preparation pipeline labels the majority of accessible GluA2-containing AMPARs within the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cryo-FIB milling of mouse hippocampus tissue</title><p>High-pressure frozen mouse hippocampus tissue slices on EM grids were loaded into an Aquilos 2 cryo-FIB/SEM microscope and milled using the ‘waffle’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelley et al., 2022</xref>). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were aligned with fluorescent light microscope images of the entire sample grid and regions with maximal green and red fluorescence were identified for targeting. In the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons, there are abundant excitatory synapses, especially from CA3 axons to CA1 dendrites. Before freezing, we intentionally oriented the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons toward the center of the grid. By carrying out the FIB milling near the center of the grid, we increase the likelihood of targeting excitatory synapses instead of soma or distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>).</p><p>Waffle milling was most successful on grids where the grid bars were clearly visible in the FIB/SEM images, indicating sufficiently thin ice, and on grid regions where the surface was relatively smooth, as judged by FIB/SEM imaging. For each lamella, initial trench cuts were made to mill through the entire depth of the sample at the front and back edges of a lamella target site. After making trench cuts for each lamella target, typically amounting to about 10 per grid, the grids were tilted to a 20° milling angle and milled with progressively lower FIB current to a final thickness of approximately 150–250 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification of synapses within lamellae by cryo-confocal imaging</title><p>To confirm the presence of intact synapses within lamellae and to guide synaptic targeting during cryo-ET data collection, lamellae were imaged by cryo-fluorescence confocal microscopy. Grids with milled lamellae were loaded onto a confocal microscope equipped with a cryo-correlative microscopy stage, thus maintaining the sample at cryogenic temperatures during imaging. Clear signals for both presynaptic vGlut1-mScarlet and postsynaptic PSD95-EGFP were visible on the majority of lamellae. Ideal synaptic targets on lamellae are indicated by colocalization of red presynaptic vGlut1-mScarlet and green postsynaptic PSD95-EGFP puncta, visualized as yellow overlapping spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). At each lamella site, confocal fluorescence images were taken from the lamella area, typically about 20×13 µm in size. Because the lamellae were milled at a 20 degree angle, approximately eight 1 µm increment Z-stack images were taken and compiled to visualize an entire single lamella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). On an average single lamella, we typically detect at least a dozen spots with colocalized fluorescent puncta, highlighting ideal regions for synaptic targeting during subsequent cryo-ET data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cryo-electron tomography of hippocampal synapses</title><p>Cryo-FIB milled lamellae were imaged using a 300 keV Krios cryo-transmission electron microscope. Initially, medium magnification montage maps of each lamella were taken to guide the picking of synaptic targets. Often, clear cellular compartments containing synaptic vesicles can be identified by eye from the medium magnification EM maps. Additionally, cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) further guided the selection of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Registration of the fluorescence and electron microscopy maps was performed by alignment of manually identified lamella structural features, often based on the edge shape of the lamella visible in both the confocal reflection and EM images. Once aligned, the presynaptic vGlut1-mScarlet signal often overlaps with cellular compartments containing synaptic vesicles in the EM map, substantiating alignment of the light and EM images. Synaptic targets were picked both by manually scanning the EM map for presynaptic vesicle-looking features as well as the overlaying fluorescence signal. Typically, we selected synaptic targets oriented such that the pre-and postsynaptic terminals are side by side with a visible synaptic cleft in between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We picked as many as 10–30 tomography targets within a single 20 µm × 13 µm lamella depending upon the presence of synaptic features and the quality of lamella ice. The tilt series of the targets were acquired using a grouped dose-symmetric scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2017</xref>) starting normal to the lamella surface at –20° and ranging from –68° to 28° with a 3° increment. The magnification was set to give a pixel size around 2 Å and data were collected at a defocus of –2.5 µm. For images collected normally to the lamella surface, the contrast transfer function (CTF) could be fit up to 5.6–7.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By preparing cryo-EM grids at a low particle density that clearly allowed for the separation of individual receptor complexes, we ensured that nearest neighbor AuNP positions were attributable to AuNPs within, rather than between, receptor complexes. In turn, this allowed us to measure the nearest neighbor projection distance observed between AuNPs bound to an individual AMPAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugate, the AuNP is covalently bound to a cysteine on the heavy chain located 11 residues after K216, allowing the AuNP as much as 35 Å of displacement from this point. As a result, inter-AuNP distances from Fabs bound to a single receptor can conceivably range from 30 to 150 Å, where an inter-AuNP distance of 30 Å would correspond to two ~30 Å diameter AuNPs immediately adjacent to one another.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Anti-GluA2 Fab-gold nanoparticle (AuNP) labeling defines AMPAR position in single particle cryo-electron and cryo-electron tomography data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshot from low defocus single particle cryo-electron microscopy dataset showing four pairs of Fab-AuNPs bound to native mouse hippocampus AMPAR.

Additionally, this analysis is subject to the effects of preferred orientation bias and aggregation of AMPARs on single-particle cryo-EM grids. Despite these challenges, the histogram of observed inter-AuNP distances has a major peak at 85 Å, which is in overall agreement with the expected 2:1 Fab-AuNP:AMPAR stoichiometry and geometry.

By harnessing genetically engineered mouse lines, together with cutting of thin brain slices and their subsequent HPF and FIB milling, we have produced substrates for cryo-ET that allow us to target glutamatergic synapses by cryo-fluorescence microscopy at micrometer resolution. Because we have, in parallel, labeled the predominate GluA2 subunit of AMPARs with a highly specific Fab-AuNP conjugate, we can identify glutamatergic synapses and AMPARs at nanometer resolution. This labeling enables clearer identification of synapses and receptor positioning compared to prior studies using cultured neurons or synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>). These methods will not only facilitate the specific visualization of the molecular machinery of excitatory synapses, but also because they are generalizable, we imagine that similar strategies will be useful for identifying and localizing other key molecules at glutamatergic synapses, such as <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, calcium channels, and vesicle fusion machinery. The approaches outlined here may also be helpful in revealing the macromolecular organization of a wide range of different synapses and cellular structures.</p><p>Despite the advances enabled by the approaches described here, there are nevertheless several limitations of the present work. First, while we endeavored to target CA3-CA1 synapses, our ability to accurately and reproducibly identify pyramidal cell-pyramidal cell synapses remains limited, in part because of the resolution limitations of the cryo-fluorescence microscopy and the much smaller field of view in the transmission electron microscopy. Further efforts will be required to optimize correlative targeting and faithful identification of specific synapses, which may include the development and use of additional fluorescence or electron-dense labels. We also are aiming to better understand the extent to which the labeling of the GluA2-containing receptors is complete and if not, how to ‘push’ the labeling to completion. The extent to which labeling of GluA2-containing receptors with the Fab AuNP conjugate alters the interactions of the receptors with synaptic proteins, and thus synaptic architecture and function, also warrants further investigation. In addition, the step toward subtomogram averaging of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, using the AuNP labels, may ultimately be hindered by the flexible linker between the Fab and the AuNP, thus requiring the development of new reagents in which the AuNP is rigidly bound to the Fab, or subtomogram averaging approaches that do not rely upon the AuNP positions. Lastly, a crucial process in the preparation of brain slices for HPF presently involves the inclusion of cryoprotectants in the media, in order to minimize ice formation. At the present time, we do not know how the cryoprotectants alter the functional state of the tissue and the synapses. Further experiments will be required to determine if we can utilize alternative cryoprotectants or reduce their use. If they remain essential, then we aim to better understand their effects on the functional states of the synapses.</p><p>Upon resolving the limitations of the methods described here, and working further toward optimization of sample preparation, cryoprotection, targeting, and milling, in combination with the ideal collection of tilt series and image processing, we hope to carry out subtomogram averaging of synaptic receptor complexes. We further aim to identify additional components of the synaptic machinery and pursue their reconstructions, ultimately positioning ourselves to compare the structures of synapses from different brain regions, at selected times during development or in states of disease, thus furthering our understanding of the interrelationships between synapse structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Dissection and preparation of hippocampal slices</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Oregon Health &amp; Science University and the Animal Care and Use Committees approved all of the experimental procedures.</p><p>We prepared a mouse line in which we appended mScarlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>), a red fluorescent protein, at the C-terminus of vGlut1 in a C57BL/6 background mouse based on a previously created vGlut1-mVenus mouse line. vGlut1-mScarlet knock-in mouse was generated using CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene targeted strategy in <italic>Slc17a7</italic>.

After adding 200 µL of HEPES base solution, the centrifugation step was repeated and the supernatant was again removed. Next, 50 µL of HEPES base solution containing cryoprotectants (20% dextran and 5% sucrose) was added. This mixture was stored at room temperature until use. Right before freezing samples, 200 mesh gold extra thick carbon grids (CF200-Au-ET; EMS) were glow discharged with a PELCO easiGlow unit (Ted Pella) for 30 s at 15 mA current with the grid bar sides up.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>HPF of brain slice sample</title><p>The sample and 6 mm flat specimen planchettes were prepared for HPF at the loading station of a Leica EM ICE. First, a bottom planchette was placed on a lower half cylinder. Two CA1 tissue slices were placed on the grid bar side of a grid with apical dendrites facing toward the center of the grid, and a sample grid was placed on the bottom planchette sample side up. Right before HPF, a small volume (1.5–3 µL) of 10 nm diameter PEGylated gold fiducials (Nanoparts) in HEPES base solution supplemented with 20% dextran and 5% sucrose was applied on top of the sample grid. A second planchette was then placed on top of the sample, flat side down, making sure to not introduce an air bubble. The assembled cartridge was then subjected to the automated HPF cycle that involves pressurization to approximately 2050 bar (210 kPa) and cooling to –196 °C within 10 ms. After HPF, samples were transferred into the auto grid clipping station to disassemble the grid from the planchettes. Sample grids were then clipped using a cryo-FIB autogrid ring and C-clip, with the carbon layer facing the autogrid ring and the sample side facing the C-clip.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cryogenic focused ion beam (Cryo-FIB) milling</title><p>The HPF hippocampal brain slice grids were milled on an Aquilos 2 cryo-FIB/SEM microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the whole grid were taken using a nominal magnification of 350 x and an acceleration voltage of 2 kV with a beam current of 13 pA and a dwell time of 1 µs. Sputter coating with a platinum layer (30 mA current for 15 s at 10 Pa pressure) and a gas injection system (GIS) deposition of a trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl) platinum layer (2 min) were applied before FIB milling. The brain slices were placed on the grid such that the Schaffer collaterals, where CA3 axons synapse onto CA1 apical dendrites, were located near the center of the grids. We picked lamella positions in the middle of the grids to increase the likelihood of imaging these CA3 – CA1 synapses. The HPF brain tissue lamellae were milled using the ‘waffle’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klykov et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, two rectangular trench cuts were milled at 15 nA ion beam current to clear the front and back of the target lamella site. After making trench cuts at each site, a preemptive ‘pre clean’ step was utilized to further remove the bottom portion of the sample. The precleans were completed by using incremental angles; starting at 40°, then 30°, followed by 20°. Following precleans, the notch patterns were milled at the side of the final lamella sites. Automated milling was performed at the milling angle of 20° by progressively reducing the ion beam current from 1 nA to 30 pA to produce a final lamella thickness of approximately 150–250 nm. After automated milling, the grids were tilted and manually polished at both +0.5° (20.5°) and –0.2°(19.8°) with an ion beam current of 50 or 30 pA. The milled grids were retrieved from the Aquilos 2 and stored in liquid nitrogen until they were imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cryo-confocal imaging of milled sample grids</title><p>The milled grids were loaded onto a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM980) fitted with a CMS196 cryo-stage (Linkam). The chamber and the grid stages were maintained below –185°C throughout imaging. First, the whole grid was imaged via widefield fluorescent light using 5 x and 10 x objectives. Fluorescence excitation was elicited using an X-Cite Xylis LED light (Excelitas technologies) and emission was detected using an Axiocam 506 camera (Zeiss). For higher resolution, confocal laser scanning microscope images were taken using a 100 x (0.75 NA) objective with and without an Airyscan module. Imaging settings, such as pixel resolution and pinhole diameter, were set according to the Zen 3.7 software for optimal Nyquist-based resolution. Laser power settings and dwell times were set slightly higher and longer than those used for room temperature experiments, as the photobleaching is reduced at cryogenic temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaufmann et al., 2014</xref>). At this sample thickness, the laser exposure did not cause significant heating and thus the sample was not devitrified. At each lamella, a cropped imaging area was designated to include only the lamella area and a Z-stack range was set from the milling edge to the end of the lamella with a 1 µm interval Z-spacing. Approximately eight Z-stack images were captured and compiled into a maximum intensity projection to visualize an entire single lamella at –20° tilt.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TEM tilt series acquisition</title><p>Tilt series were acquired using a 300 keV FEI Titan Krios cryo transmission electron microscope, equipped with a spherical aberration corrector, a Gatan BioContinuum energy filter (6 eV energy slit width), and a K3 direct detector (Gatan, CA). Medium montage map images from each lamella were collected with a nominal magnification of 2,250 x with a calibrated pixel size of 60.3 Å. Tilt series were collected using a dose-symmetric scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2017</xref>) starting at –20° and ranging from –68° to 28°, with a 3° increment using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>).

Initially, tomograms were reconstructed using the fiducial-free alignment software AreTomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). The initial tomograms were inspected individually to determine which tomograms warranted further image processing. Tilt series with low-quality ice, large ice contamination, or with no discernable Fab AuNP particles, were discarded. Several good-quality tilt series were chosen to go through tomogram reconstruction in Etomo using patch tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mastronarde and Held, 2017</xref>). Tilt series were binned by 4 for patch tracking alignment and CTF corrected with Ctfplotter within Etomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mastronarde, 2024</xref>).

Briefly, 1 mL of 84 mM 3-MBA was mixed with 0.4 mL of 28 mM HAuCl<sub>4</sub> in a 15 mL plastic (Falcon) tube, and 3.5 mL of water was added, producing a white precipitate. NaOH was added dropwise to 100 mM (49.5 µL of 10 M NaOH), resolubilizing the precipitate. The reaction was mixed by rotation at room temperature for at least 16 hr, after which the solution was moved to a 50 mL plastic tube and 28.7 mL of 27% methanol was added. NaBH<sub>4</sub> was added to a final concentration of 2 mM, using approximately 450 µL of a 150 mM stock solution of NaBH<sub>4</sub>, and the reaction was continued by rotation at room temperature for 4.5 hr. AuNPs were precipitated by adding NaCl to 100 mM (694 µL of 5 M NaCl added to a 34 mL reaction), followed by the addition of 80 mL of methanol. The reaction solution was distributed into three 50 mL plastic tubes and centrifuged at 4100 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. Pellets were gently washed with 75% aqueous methanol, combined into a single plastic tube, and centrifuged at 4100 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The remaining methanol was removed and the pellet was dried overnight in a desiccator. The dried pellet was resuspended in water to ~10 mg/mL, resulting in a black homogeneous solution. An aliquot of AuNPs was diluted 1:1 with 10% aqueous glycerol in 0.2 X TBE (20 mM Tris base, 20 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA) and run on a 10% glycerol, 12% PAGE gel in 0.2 X TBE running buffer to assess AuNP size and homogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugation</title><p>An anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>) construct was designed with an extended heavy chain fragment containing a single hinge cysteine for AuNP conjugation (C-terminal sequence: KVDKKIVPRDAGAKPC) followed by a C-terminal Twin Strep-tag. This construct, deemed 15F1FabxC-2xStr, was expressed in Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) and purified over Strep-Tactin Superflow resin in T150 buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). Approximately 400 µg of 15F1FabxC-2xStr was diluted to 20 µM in TBE (100 mM Tris base, 100 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA) with 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reduced Fab was purified by size exclusion chromatography and concentrated at 1 mg/mL. To determine optimal AuNP conjugation conditions, a range of Fab:AuNP ratios were tested in small-scale conjugation reactions. Fab (1 mg/mL; 1–8 µL) and AuNP (10 mg/mL; 1–8 µL) were mixed in TBE at a total volume of 10 µL (Fab:AuNP volumes of 8:1, 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or 1:8 µL) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before diluting 1:1 with 10% glycerol and loading 15 µL onto a 10% glycerol, 12% PAGE gel. A 2:1 Fab:AuNP ratio was determined to be the optimal condition for conjugation, and the reaction was scaled up by incubating 300 µL of 1 mg/mL 15F1FabxC-2xStr with 150 µL of 10 mg/mL AuNP and 50 µL 10 X TBE at 37 °C for 30 min.

Bands corresponding to the 1:1 Fab:AuNP species were cut out, chopped into small pieces, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBE buffer to extract the 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugate. The supernatant containing the 15F1 Fab-AuNP conjugate was concentrated to 400 µL and incubated with 0.5 mM of PEG550-SH (3.3 µL of 60 mM PEG550-SH) for 60 min at 37 °C. An optimal PEG550-SH concentration of 0.5 mM was determined to PEGylate the AuNPs without displacing the Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Excess PEG was removed by serial concentration and the final PEGylated Fab-AuNP was stored at 4 °C.

Anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab-AuNP was added to the sample to a final concentration of approximately 40 nM and the sample was ‘nutated’ at 4 °C for 15 min. The solution was then passed over 5 mL of StrepTactin Superflow resin equilibrated in purification buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 µM ZK-200775, 2 µM JNJ-55511118, 1 µM RR2b, 0.075% w/v digitonin) by gravity flow and eluted with purification buffer +5 mM desthiobiotin.

It binds at the distal end, which is likely to impact its interactions with other synaptic proteins, which may affect the synaptic organization and function.</p></disp-quote><p>Concern addressed in the ‘Discussion’ section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The hippocampal slices were treated with the anti-GluA2 15F1 Fab-148 AuNP conjugate for 1 hour at room temperature. It might be helpful to discuss the potential affects of Fab-AuNp on synaptic function. It has been demonstrated previously that introducing binders of the receptors ectodomains can affect synaptic function.</p></disp-quote><p>Concern also addressed in the ‘Discussion’ section.</p><p>Kunimichi Suzuki et al.
