offer a novel paradigm for addressing patterning mechanisms during regeneration. Here we show that an interplay between mechanical forces, cell migration and proliferation allows jellyfish fragments to regain shape and functionality rapidly, notably by efficient restoration of the central feeding organ (manubrium). Fragmentation first triggers actomyosin-powered remodeling that restores body umbrella shape, causing radial smooth muscle fibers to converge around ‘hubs’ which serve as positional landmarks. Stabilization of these hubs, and associated expression of <italic>Wnt6</italic>, depends on the configuration of the adjoining muscle fiber ‘spokes’. Stabilized hubs presage the site of the manubrium blastema, whose growth is Wnt/β-catenin dependent and fueled by both cell proliferation and long-range cell recruitment. Manubrium morphogenesis is modulated by its connections with the gastrovascular canal system. We conclude that body patterning in regenerating jellyfish emerges mainly from local interactions, triggered and directed by the remodeling process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Clytia hemisphaerica</kwd><kwd>Cnidaria</kwd><kwd>jellyfish</kwd><kwd>Hydrozoa</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>medusa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-PDOC-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leclère</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE13-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leclère</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT201805005536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peron</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004792</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peron</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Clytia</italic> jellyfish regenerate body shape and organs through a mechanically driven process that coordinates tissue remodeling, localized proliferation, and precursor migration and promotes Wnt signaling at a muscle-based landmark.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regrowth of new structures and their integration into existing body parts during animal regeneration require varying contributions from cell proliferation and tissue remodeling, an issue already highlighted by early studies on planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgan, 1901</xref>). The (re)specification of positional information has been largely attributed to organizer-like centers and gradients of diffusible morphogens, modeled to pattern the surrounding cells in a concentration-dependent manner (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">French et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lander, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>]). In planarians, <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps or vertebrate limbs, the site of injury transforms into a signaling center resetting positional information and triggering the regrowth of missing elements through proliferation and/or tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). Alongside morphogen-based systems, structural and mechanical cues can also contribute to patterning. Supra-cellular actin fibers, for instance, were proposed to contribute mechanically to directing the orientation of body axis during regeneration of <italic>Hydra</italic> polyp fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Livshits et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cnidarians, the sister group to the major animal clade Bilateria, display remarkable regenerative abilities. <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps, which are a classic regeneration model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galliot, 2012</xref>), the colonial hydrozoan <italic>Hydractinia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradshaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DuBuc et al., 2020</xref>) and the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DuBuc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schaffer et al., 2016</xref>) have become valuable systems for studying wound healing and whole-body regeneration. In contrast the jellyfish (medusa), a dispersive and sexually reproductive form, generated asexually from the polyp stage of numerous species belonging to the Medusozoa clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leclère et al., 2016</xref>), has received relatively little attention.</p><p>Compared to the polyp stage, medusae display complex tissue architectures, including striated muscles and well-defined organs. Jellyfish from the clade Hydrozoa show remarkable regenerative plasticity and thus offer an attractive system for studying both whole organism re-patterning and organ restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hargitt, 1899</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hargitt, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgan, 1899</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neppi, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmid, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmid and Alder, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid and Tardent, 1971</xref>). Studies using wild-collected hydrozoan jellyfish, notably of the genus <italic>Clytia,</italic> concluded that a high proportion of individuals had undergone regeneration following damages caused by predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills, 1993</xref>). Jellyfish from the clades Scyphozoa and Cubozoa also display some regenerative capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamero-Mora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stamatis et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study showed that lost parts are not replaced in <italic>Aurelia</italic> juveniles following amputation, although rotational symmetry is restored by a muscle-powered process termed ‘symmetrization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The pioneering work of V. Schmid and P. Tardent provided an initial characterization of the regenerative capacity of hydrozoan medusae. Among other species, they documented the ability of wild-caught <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> to reconstitute organs and restore umbrella shape after diverse types of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid and Tardent, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmid, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 1976</xref>). <italic>Clytia</italic> is now a reliable laboratory model with extensive genomic and transcriptomic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Houliston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leclère et al., 2019</xref>), amenable to gene function analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Momose et al., 2018</xref>). The complex life cycle, comprising two adult phases - the polyp and the medusa - can be completed reliably in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Houliston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lechable et al., 2019</xref>): the developing embryo becomes a ciliated larva, which settles and metamorphoses into a benthic polyp. The polyp propagates asexually, generating a colony. Specialized polyps generate swimming medusae, which develop gonads and ensure gamete dispersal. Polyp colonies can be kept for years, without reduction of reproductive potential, while medusae grow to adult size in two to three weeks and have a total lifespan of about two months. <italic>Clytia</italic> medusae show 4-fold rotational symmetry around the central feeding organ, termed the manubrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). The distribution of elements within the medusa can thus be defined by positional values along a radial axis (i.e. from the umbrella center to the rim), and by their angular spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Clytia</italic> jellyfish are made up of four identical morphological units, called quadrants. Each umbrellar quadrant harbors one radial gastrovascular canal, a gonad, one lobe of the tetraradially-organized manubrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and a segment of the circular peripheral canal connecting the tentacle bulbs (up to four per quadrant). The manubrium, tentacle bulbs and gonads harbor populations of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiel and Houliston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère et al., 2012</xref>), have autonomous functions and can be regarded as true organs. The main component of the umbrella is an acellular connective layer, the mesoglea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), covered on its external surface, the ‘exumbrella’, by a simple monolayer of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamran et al., 2017</xref>). The concave face of the umbrella, termed ‘subumbrella’, is composed of three overlapping tissues layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): (i) an inner epithelium associated with the mesoglea, (ii) an overlying cnidarian-specific tissue type comprising radially aligned smooth epitheliomuscular cells (‘radial smooth muscles’), (iii) a ring of striated epitheliomuscular cells at the umbrella periphery which power swimming contractions, and are sandwiched between the other two layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leclère and Röttinger, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regenerative potential of <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> jellyfish.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Anatomy of <italic>Clytia</italic> jellyfish.

Distinguishable phases of wound healing, tissue remodeling and cell proliferation contribute, in a predictable manner, to the restoration of shape and missing organs. Actomyosin-driven wound constriction triggers the remodeling of umbrella tissues, causing the formation of a transient landmark, a ‘hub’ of radial smooth muscle fibers. Depending on surrounding tissue topology, the hubs will stabilize, predicting the site where a new manubrium will regenerate. <italic>CheWnt6</italic> provides a likely molecular link between the hub and manubrium formation, since contraction-dependent expression at the wound site is maintained only in stabilized hubs. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for blastema onset and manubrium regeneration. We also show that cells mobilized from other organs (proliferating stem cells and digestive cells) fuel the manubrium anlage, and that connections to radial canals locally dictate the growing manubrium geometry. Pattern in regenerating <italic>Clytia</italic> medusae emerges thus from the integration of local interactions between structural elements. Based on our findings, we propose an actomyosin-based ‘spoke and hub’ patterning system to account for manubrium positioning, which translates the wound-induced remodeling process into a precisely located blastema, likely through an interplay with Wnt signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Restoration of medusa form involves both body remodeling and regrowth of organs</title><p>In order to gain insight into the self-organizing properties of the jellyfish <italic>Clytia</italic>, we explored its responses to a diverse array of dissections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, targeted ablations demonstrated that all organs (the feeding manubrium, gonads and tentacle bulbs) and radial canals can fully regenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). Functional manubria regenerated in 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; n: 43/44), while gonads (bearing gametes) and tentacle bulbs reformed in about a week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; gonads: 48/48, bulbs: 45/52; after 8 days in fed jellyfish). Removed segments of radial canals rapidly reformed, re-growing from the stumps in both centripetal and centrifugal directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; notice the growing tip). The recovery efficiency of gonads and tentacle bulbs varied, both within and between medusae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), while the manubrium recovered rapidly and stereotypically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The efficiency of gonad and tentacle bulb regeneration was affected by the feeding regime of the animals, with recovery blocked at an initial stage of cell accumulation in starved animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, a series of diverse cuts to the jellyfish umbrella allowed us to define the parameters of shape restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Fragments began remodeling rapidly, reducing the wounded surface, and usually restoring the circular jellyfish shape within 24 hr, irrespective of the starting topology and of the number of remaining organs or canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is well illustrated by half (‘bisected’) jellyfish or quarter fragments, which morph rapidly into a circular, smaller, umbrella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Together, the responses to our array of cut topologies indicated that: (i) existing organs and canals are largely conserved, (ii) the length of the residual circular canal determines the final perimeter of the restored umbrella, (iii) the final umbrella size correlates with the amount of tissue in the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A rare failure in shape restoration concerned medusae from which the entire umbrella margin had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2T</xref>): these fragments sealed into a spherical shape and died shortly after. It is worth noticing that in the earlier study using larger, wild-caught <italic>Clytia</italic> jellyfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid and Tardent, 1971</xref>) reported one case of an interradial fragment, devoid of gastrovascular system, which regained a circular shape and an irregular manubrium. In cases where the manubrium was injured, we found that the organ rapidly healed before regaining its feeding function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In manubrium-free fragments, cells accumulated at the injured ending of the remaining radial canal(s) within 24 hr post-dissection (hpd), and this mass regenerated into a new functional manubrium within 4 days post-dissection (dpd) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). After remodeling and feeding, the umbrella of regenerated jellyfish continued to grow and new tentacle bulbs were added to the circular canal; however, if the original four-quadrant body plan had been lost, it never recovered. A minority of remodeled manubria sprouted additional radial canals (6/16 of bisected jellyfish showed a third radial canal after 6 weeks).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Manubrium regeneration, but not umbrella remodeling, requires cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: schematics of the different stages of manubrium regeneration following manubrium ablation.

Cells start accumulating at the junction of the radial canals, the first sign of organ regeneration; by 24 hpd the cell mass forms a roughly square, flat primordium (stage 2, <italic>regeneration primordium</italic>). The primordium thickens, and by 48 hpd it fissures centrally, revealing the now distinguishable gastric cavity (stage 3, <italic>opening</italic>). A thicker rim emerges, which develops into a short tubular outgrowth (stage 4, <italic>outgrowth</italic>). The protuberance elongates, and within 4 dpd, it develops the characteristic lip folds, tetraradially arranged; the manubrium is now fully functional, albeit smaller than the original one (stage 5, <italic>folding</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of cell proliferation to manubrium regrowth was assessed using one-hour incubations in the thymidine analogue EdU, which incorporates into newly-synthesized DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In undamaged jellyfish, these cells were detected in the gastroderm of manubrium, gonads and tentacle bulbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These previously undescribed cells, which we term Mobilizing Gastro-Digestive (MGD) cells circulated rapidly within the lumen of the radial canal following manubrium ablation, likely transported by the flagellar beating of canal gastrodermal cells that govern nutrient flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We could label them specifically by feeding the medusa with fluorescent beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see Methods), supporting the idea that they function in nutrient uptake, and that the brown pigmentation derives from the crustacean diet (<italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii). We noted that the MGD cells also mobilized in the radial canals in starvation conditions, albeit less markedly than in regenerating jellyfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting a role in adjusting nutritional balance between organs. Analysis of bead-labeled jellyfish following manubrium dissection revealed that some of the gastrodermal cells of the regenerating manubrium did indeed originate from other organs of the jellyfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Transplantation of a gonad from a medusa fed with fluorescent beads to an unlabeled host prior to manubrium ablation confirmed that MGD cells from the gonad gastroderm are recruited to the primordium of the regenerating manubrium, as well as to other non-regenerating bulbs and non-dissected manubria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In medusae from which all gonads had been removed, fluorescent bead-labelled MGD cells were detected in the manubrium primordium once the radial canals had regrown, showing that these cells can be recruited not only from gonads but also from more peripheral regions, likely from the gastroderm of the tentacle bulbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). On the other hand, no fluorescent bead-labelled MGD cells were found in the manubrium primordium if both gonads and radial canals were completely ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Furthermore, irrespective of the dissection topology, the number of lobes of the regenerating manubrium always reflected the number of remaining radial canals, such that three radial canals generated a three-lobed manubrium, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). This pattern might depend either on an underlying system of circular positional information retained within the medusa fragments, or by signals coming from the canals themselves. To distinguish these possibilities, we systematically removed radial canals from manubrium-ablated (but otherwise undamaged) medusae. The presence of four canals led in most cases to a tetraradial manubrium, three canals to a three-lobed one, two canals to a two-lobed manubrium, and one canal to a tubular one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). We conclude that the topology of the regenerating manubrium is determined by the number of connecting canals, which might provide a mechanical or biochemical signal, and/or might materially contribute to the primordium composition by providing migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Arguing against the latter option, canal fragments connected to the primordium but not to any other organ were found to be sufficient to direct the geometry of the regenerated manubrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as long as at least one canal remained connected to other organs (gonads and/or bulbs).

In regenerates, the initial position of the manubrium anlage does not necessarily coincide with the geometrical center of the remodeled medusa (e.g. in quarter jellyfish fragments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Consistently, interradial fragments lacking a radial canal showed no signs of primordium formation at 4 dpd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). After two weeks, however, a simple tube-like manubrium (unable to feed) was observed in a few cases (n: 13/65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This observation indicates that the canals are not strictly required to position the new manubrium and that umbrella tissues also contribute to the new structure. Canals rather play a facilitating role to manubrium regeneration by contributing with specific cell types to the blastema. We can further conclude that the meeting of multiple canal ends (often seen during remodeling, see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) is not responsible for specifying the position of manubrium regeneration, as evidenced by quarter jellyfish fragments in which a manubrium regenerated on the sole surviving radial canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, F-actin staining showed that primordia and regenerated manubria were systematically associated with the aggregate (hub) of smooth muscle fibers that formed during the remodeling process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; n: 22/22).

Hub formation did not require radial canals, since it was unaffected by removal of the MG-segment of radial canals after manubrium excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In those canal-ablated medusae, manubrium regeneration commenced when at least one of the excised canals regrew to the hub of smooth muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; primordium on hub at 4 dpd: 8/9; manubrium at the center of umbrella at 5 dpd: 18/18).

In about a third of cases these regenerated two independent manubria, sometimes linked by a radial canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In other cases, the two manubria anlagens fused into a single oral structure, correctly patterned or twinned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>; fused manubria, 5 dpd: 24/159).

This implies that the entire radial axis of the umbrella possesses the potential to form a manubrium, and that a control mechanism exists to prevent multiple manubria from forming.

We tested this hypothesis by grafting supernumerary manubria at different subumbrellar positions. Grafted manubria could co-exist stably with the original one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with each manubrium behaving independently and participating in feeding. The grafted manubria rapidly sprouted new canals, which reconnected to the existing gastrovascular system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Grafting a fragment of a manubrium base onto the umbrella tissues, either on a radial canal or directly adjacent to the endogenous manubrium, systematically led to its regeneration into a functional extra manubrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; tubular/bi-lobed shape: 12/12). Furthermore, manubria grafted either on the radial canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) or the umbrella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) did not prevent the regeneration of an excised manubrium, resulting in the formation of a two-manubria medusa (n: 10/10 and 17/20, respectively).

The asymmetric bisection of the jellyfish umbrella, which leaves a smaller (S) fragment devoid of manubrium and a larger (L), manubrium-bearing, one, provides an informative case study in which the S-fragment regenerates a manubrium, while the L-fragment does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These opposite outcomes cannot be attributed to the length of the wound nor, as previously shown, to a long-range inhibitory signal from the existing manubrium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In hydrozoan polyps, the mouth (hypostome) acts as a signaling center and the source of a morphogen gradient organizing the body axis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bode, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayorova et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, morphogen gradients are not responsible for the positioning and regeneration of manubria in <italic>Clytia</italic> jellyfish, as shown by our grafting experiments and the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 1976</xref>. Similarly to our findings, they observed an inhibitory effect when a manubrium (or fragment of it) was grafted close to the regeneration site, but they explained it as a competition for the cells contributing to regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 1976</xref>). Their model for regeneration relied on mechanical forces rather than on a morphogen gradient, and more precisely postulated that the tensions exerted by the mesoglea and the smooth/striated muscle fibers would either concentrate, or favor the dispersion of the subumbrellar cells contributing to manubrium regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmid et al., 1976</xref>). Indeed, we found that the regeneration of a manubrium is related to the organization of the smooth muscle fibers: regeneration is promoted when the muscle topology - and thus presumably the balance of resultant forces - allows the stabilization of a ‘hub’ conformation. As for the cellular components, we found a body-wide contribution from the jellyfish, with the highly plastic canal system providing a conduit for the diverse cell types fueling manubrium regeneration. The mesoglea, the elastic layer constituting a large part of the jellyfish body, undoubtedly contributes to the mechanical properties of the system, likely by opposing the muscle forces. Consistently, in vitro experiments using another jellyfish species, <italic>Podocoryna</italic>, showed that mechanical deformation of the mesoglea affects the spreading of striated muscle cells and the initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>We found that the rapid re-circularization of jellyfish fragments relies on the assembly of an actomyosin cable at the wounded edge, leading to the contraction of the cut segments and re-establishing tissue integrity.

The local alignment of myofibrils might follow cell polarity cues, likely under the control of PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seifert and Mlodzik, 2007</xref>), previously shown to orient epithelial cells during <italic>Clytia</italic> larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Momose et al., 2012</xref>). While the initial gathering of spokes is a consequence of the wound-healing process, the reorganization of smooth muscles into a ‘spokes and hub’ configuration is likely also guided by mechanical tensions generated by the intact muscles anchored to the umbrella margin. Post-wound topology of muscle fibers is a reliable predictor of the ‘hub’ fate, strongly suggesting a role for mechanical stresses in its stabilization.</p><p>‘Spoke and hub’ muscle configurations equivalent to the one we describe here in <italic>Clytia</italic> can also be recognized during wound healing/regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Livshits et al., 2017</xref>) and planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scimone et al., 2017</xref>), even though they have not been pointed out explicitly. In planarians, the position of the anterior pole in intact and regenerating animal correlates with the meeting point of the longitudinal muscle fibers, preceding the appearance of a new mouth or blastema. ‘Spoke and hub’ patterning systems might thus represent a general but overlooked feature of regenerating animals, playing an early role in the stabilization of remodeling tissues and acting as ‘organizers’, accurately positioning structures in broadly perturbed systems.</p><p>During regeneration in <italic>Clytia</italic>, the configuration of the muscle hub and its associated spokes represents a good readout for the regenerate pattern, as it reliably predicts the position of the pro-blastema Wnt/β-catenin signaling center. The mechanisms linking muscles to the newly developing tissue polarity of the regenerate remain however unclear. The assembling spokes could carry/generate polarity information which is transmitted to the tissues, or their positioning may be directed by another patterning cue in the tissue. The question whether muscle fibers contribute to the polarity of a tissue – by exercising contractile forces – or they align according to another morphogenetic signal – for example responding to Wnt-pathway signaling – is not restricted to <italic>Clytia</italic>, but is relevant also for other systems, such as <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Since whole-body morphogen gradients do not appear to contribute to manubrium positioning in the medusa of <italic>Clytia</italic>, this study system could be advantageous to disentangle the relative contributions of muscle fibers and biochemical signaling to body patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Emergence of global pattern from local interactions</title><p>How positional information is restored in animals undergoing regeneration remains a central question. In <italic>Clytia</italic>, morphological ‘quadrants’ (each containing a radial canal, a quarter manubrium, a gonad and a segment of the bell rim with tentacle bulbs) repeat around the primary oral-aboral body axis. Our findings demonstrate that, in regenerating animals, the angular position of elements around this body axis is not encoded by a system of rotational coordinates, but depends rather on cues from existing structures. The characteristic tetraradial symmetry of the adult jellyfish thus does not depend on an actively maintained global patterning system. We cannot nevertheless exclude that a system of morphogen might be secondarily patterning the centro-peripheral axis: missing gonads, for instance, reform at their original location along the radial canal. Manubrium regeneration, instead, is essentially directed by the reorganization of radial muscles and the local influences of the canal system. The integration at the jellyfish level of local cues, emerging from the interaction of structural elements, is thus sufficient to explain body shape recovery and manubrium regeneration - without invoking a redefinition of positional information, encoded by a body-wide, morphogen-based, patterning system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

analysis of regeneration in the medusa of the cnidarian Clytia hemisphaerica. Using a combination of amputations, tissue grafts, gene expression analyses, and pharmacological manipulations, the authors provide a beautiful description of regeneration in this organism, and how local interactions can shape global patterning. This work fills a significant gap in the field of comparative evolutionary studies of regeneration and provides a strong foundation for future work on this organism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pattern regulation in a regenerating jellyfish&quot;; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions may require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sinigaglia and colleagues describe the processes underlying regeneration in medusae of the cnidarian <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic>. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which cnidarians regenerate is essential because they hold a key position in animal phylogeny as the sister taxa to bilaterians. Such knowledge this will help us to distinguish deeply conserved aspects of regenerative processes from taxon-specific inventions. Medusozoan cnidarians have two major life stages: polyp and medusa. Whereas <italic>Hydra</italic> and <italic>Hydractinia</italic> are well established for studying regeneration in polyps, very little is understood about medusa regeneration. This work extends the modern study of regeneration to the medusa forms of cnidarians. Using dissections, grafts, microscopy, pharmacological manipulations, and RNA-seq data, the authors (a) document events involved in wound closure, tissue remodeling, and establishment of signaling centres, and (b) demonstrate essential roles for mechanical forces, existing cells/tissues, and <italic>wnt</italic>/β-catenin signaling in these processes. This work fills a significant gap in the field of comparative/evolutionary studies of regenerative potential and builds a solid foundation for further research on this tractable model species. Overall, the experiments are well designed, and the findings are clearly reported. With some adjustments to clarify or revise conclusions about the interplay of mechanical factors and Wnt signaling as well as to appropriately acknowledge previous work, the paper will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major conclusions of the paper is that mechanical forces activate the expression of Wnts and initiate Wnt signaling. (e.g. Introduction, last paragraph; Results subsection “Wnt signaling links muscle hub stabilization to manubrium regeneration”, last paragraph; the Discussion subsection “Mechanical control of regeneration in Clytia”). Perhaps, but the actual evidence to support this conclusion in the paper is not entirely convincing. The key observation is that expression of <italic>wnt6</italic> in dissected fragments was blocked by treatment with blebbistatin &quot;in both S and L fragments (Figure 10E).&quot; While this observation may hold for S fragments, Figure 10E shows no obvious expression of <italic>wnt6</italic> in control L fragments at 24 hpd, which is the only time-point shown for blebbistatin-treated fragments. Are there images that indicate lack of <italic>wnt6</italic> in L fragments at 8 hpd – a time when it would normally be expressed? If so, they would provide much stronger support for the causal link between mechanical forces and <italic>wnt</italic> expression. Perhaps more importantly, the observation that inhibition of Wnt signaling with PKF118-310 delays wound closure suggests that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may be upstream of mechanical forces, or at least interdependent of them. If stronger evidence to support induction of <italic>wnts</italic> by mechanical forces is not available, then the assertions mentioned above should be toned down.</p><p>2) The experiments described in the section &quot;Why does only one manubrium usually regenerate?&quot; overlap significantly with those previously conducted by Schmid et al., 1976 (note that the name of the journal in which this article appeared was not Development, Genes and Evolution, at the time of publication). However, only a general reference is made to this article in the Introduction of the current manuscript. This cursory mention, though respectfully made, is insufficient.</p><p>As in the current study, Schmid and co-workers found that an implanted manubrium could inhibit the regeneration of a new manubrium in bisected specimens, but only when the implant was close to the site at which the new manubrium would regenerate (Figure 3, Table 2). They likewise demonstrated that inhibition could not be caused by a diffusible factor or morphogen gradient (Figures 2 and 3, Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, Schmid et al. contrasted this (physically mediated) inhibition with the (chemically induced) effect of the hypostome on regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps (see p. 51, esp. second paragraph). The principle inhibitory mechanism proposed in the earlier study was competition for underlying tissues: a different model than the current study (402-427; Figure 11). However, Schmid et al. did discuss the role of tensile forces in regulating manubrium regeneration.</p><p>It is not acceptable for the authors of the current work to leave such earlier studies un-discussed. To demonstrate that their work offers new fundamental biological insight, they simply must do more to acknowledge the specific contributions of prior workers, and to discuss how their observations and models confirm, contradict, and/or extend the theoretical framework already available in the literature. We have not closely examined other historical papers for areas of overlap, but we presume that the authors will do so, and discuss relevant matters as appropriate in their revised manuscript.</p><p>3) Please clarify what defines a &quot;hub,&quot; for readers' untrained eyes (subsection “Why does only one manubrium usually regenerate?”, second paragraph). The phalloidin-stained images in Figure 7H do have a rough focal point of phalloidin staining, albeit ring-shaped rather than with a central peak of intensity. However, when a bona fide manubrium regenerates, as in Figure 7F (also Figure 6C bottom right), central phalloidin staining naturally decreases as the manubrium extends and develops its lumen. Importantly, Figure 7H shows a 4 dpd specimen rather than an earlier time point; is there evidence that there was not a hub present earlier, as in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B at 24 hpd? Please provide more rationale for the conclusion that 7H shows a &quot;non-hub,&quot; rather than slowed or arrested development after establishment of a stable hub. This is a key point to establish that the effect of a pre-existing (transplanted) manubrium is the same in manubrium-ablation experiments as in bisection experiments (e.g. L fragments in Figure 9). A time-series of staining would demonstrate whether a hub forms initially and then disaggregates, as in the bisection experiments, and the overall model proposed in Figure 11.</p><p>4) Subsection “Restoration of medusa form involves both body remodeling and regrowth of organs”, first paragraph: The data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2E showing manubrium regeneration does not appear to distinguish between fed and unfed animals, so it is unclear what supports the statement in the text that manubrium regeneration is stereotypical regardless of feeding levels.</p><p>5) The first paragraph of the subsection “Wound closure and body remodeling precede proliferation-dependent organ regeneration” presents a staging scheme to describe manubrium regeneration, which is an important framework for future studies. However, better drawings or photos are required to better illustrate this staging scheme for the reader. The text refers to Figure 1E, but not all stages are shown there (and they aren't labeled with stage numbers). Including such a figure is really critical when trying to establish a new staging scheme; it should not be left to the reader's imagination. Furthermore, it would be helpful to label images of regenerating manubria with this new stage classification throughout the manuscript.</p><p>6) Figure 2B, C: What is being compared in each statistical test? The legend needs to clarify this. The way the figure is drawn, it looks like each time point is being compared to the previous time point. It might make more sense to compare each time point to the baseline cell proliferation in an uninjured animal.</p><p>7) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B: Are the starved animals also regenerating? If yes, this is confusing since the text states that starved animals also regenerate a manubrium. If no, then it is unclear why the levels change over time. Either way, this figure needs clarification and further explanation.</p><p>8) Figure 10: How many of the presented in situ experiments were done and are the presented results representative? This information should be included. qPCR data would be nice to quantify these results, especially for the inhibitor treatments, but I understand it may not be possible to get back into the lab to do this right now.</p><p>9) Overall, this manuscript presents large amount of data and information, making it somewhat difficult for the reader to hold a coherent picture in their head. The model at the end certainly helped. Something that might help further: on the model figure one could include the figure panels that support each aspect of the model. That would help the reader to easily go back and assess to the underlying data for each aspect of the model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54868.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major conclusions of the paper is that mechanical forces activate the expression of Wnts and initiate Wnt signaling.

A time-series of staining would demonstrate whether a hub forms initially and then disaggregates, as in the bisection experiments, and the overall model proposed in Figure 11.</p></disp-quote><p>We define a “hub” as the convergence site of well-organized radial smooth muscle fibers. We added a new Figure 9—figure supplement 1 showing that indeed a hub forms in proximally-grafted animals (12 hpd) and then disorganizes, so that at later stages (48 hpd) the smooth muscle fibers do not meet at the wound site, but tend to converge towards the grafted manubrium. The principles governing hub assembly/disassembly are therefore comparable in the graft paradigm and in the S/L dissection. Given that the experimental variability between grafted specimens is much higher than between S/L fragments, it is not feasible to illustrate the time-course of events following manubrium grafting with fixed specimens reliably. We plan in the future to follow and analyze hub dynamics in individual grafted specimens by live imaging, for instance using transgenic muscle-reporter animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Restoration of medusa form involves both body remodeling and regrowth of organs”, first paragraph: The data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2E showing manubrium regeneration does not appear to distinguish between fed and unfed animals, so it is unclear what supports the statement in the text that manubrium regeneration is stereotypical regardless of feeding levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested the efficiency of manubrium regeneration in relation to the previous feeding regime of the animals. We have now clarified this aspect in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The first paragraph of the subsection “Wound closure and body remodeling precede proliferation-dependent organ regeneration” presents a staging scheme to describe manubrium regeneration, which is an important framework for future studies.

One additional time-point (12 hpd) has been added to Figure 1E. We also added drawing in Figure 2A to illustrate the different stages of manubrium regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2B, C: What is being compared in each statistical test?

It might make more sense to compare each time point to the baseline cell proliferation in an uninjured animal.</p></disp-quote><p>Each test compared a time-point and the previous one, in order to assess the evolution of EdU-positive cells numbers during the course of regeneration. We did not think that a comparison with the proliferation levels in a non-dissected manubrium would be informative, because the endogenous manubrium is much bigger and contains very different stem cell populations, for instance supporting continuous proliferation of nematocyte progenitors. The legend has now been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B: Are the starved animals also regenerating? If yes, this is confusing since the text states that starved animals also regenerate a manubrium. If no, then it is unclear why the levels change over time. Either way, this figure needs clarification and further explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiment presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, ‘’starved’’ animals were not dissected (and thus were not regenerating). Manubrium-dissected jellyfish cannot feed, hence the most appropriate comparison of proliferation levels during regeneration is to animals that have been starved for an equivalent amount of time. We have clarified the labels in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 10: How many of the presented in situ experiments were done and are the presented results representative? This information should be included. qPCR data would be nice to quantify these results, especially for the inhibitor treatments, but I understand it may not be possible to get back into the lab to do this right now.</p></disp-quote><p>The in situ hybridization experiments were performed at least twice for each condition, and gave highly reproducible results; this information was added to the Materials and methods section. Sample sizes have now been added to the figures (Figures 10 and 11). We agree that qPCR can provide a quantitative picture of gene expression changes, and so have now included these additional experiments to Figures 10, 11, and Figure 11—figure supplement 1. The qPCR results confirmed the in situ hybridization data, but also showed an unexpected effect of blebbistatin on the expression of <italic>CheWnt6</italic> across all umbrella tissues unrelated to remodelling or regeneration. We thus compared <italic>CheWnt6</italic> expression close to the remodelling site (“f”) to the expression in fragment of the surrounding umbrella tissues (“F”) of comparable size (Figures 11C and Figure 11—figure supplement 1). The ratio of expression levels (relative to housekeeping genes) showed a marked increase of <italic>CheWnt6</italic> levels at the wound site of control-treated remodelling jellyfish, increment that was not detected in blebbistatin-treated animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Overall, this manuscript presents large amount of data and information, making it somewhat difficult for the reader to hold a coherent picture in their head.
