in rare cases the development of neuroendocrine tumors. In the presence of oxygen, PHD2 hydroxylates one or both conserved prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIFα subunits, sufficiently marking HIFα for binding and ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, prolyl-hydroxylation in the C-terminal ODD appears to be the predominant and sufficient event in triggering the oxygen-dependent destruction of HIFα, rendering the biological significance of N-terminal ODD proline unclear. Here, we examined seven disease-associated <italic>EGLN1</italic> mutations scattered across the catalytic core and showed definitively that all PHD2 mutants have a structural and/or catalytic activity defect as measured by time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we identified one of the PHD2 mutants, P317R, to retain comparably wild-type capacity to hydroxylate the predominant proline in the C-terminal ODD but had uniquely compromised ability to hydroxylate the N-terminal ODD proline. These findings support the notion that deregulation of HIF ultimately underlies PHD2-driven erythrocytosis and challenge the currently held uncertainty that the N-terminal ODD prolyl-hydroxylation event is dispensable in normal hypoxic signaling pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PHD2</kwd><kwd>HIF</kwd><kwd>hypoxic response</kwd><kwd>erythrocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gavpb45</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-191811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohh</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gavpb45</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-133694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A unique pathogenic mutation on the primary prolyl hydroxylase of the oxygen-sensing pathway compromises the capacity to hydroxylate the hypoxia-inducible factor's N-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain proline while retaining activity against the otherwise catalytically predominant C-terminal proline.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>About half of blood volume is made up of erythrocytes (red blood cells) whose role is to deliver oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Percy, 2011</xref>). Low concentrations of red blood cells result in insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues, while high concentrations can induce a propensity toward thrombotic events, rendering red blood cell mass regulation crucial. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced primarily in the kidneys that stimulates erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weidemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richmond et al., 2005</xref>). Through binding to EPO receptors on erythroid progenitors, EPO can activate a signaling cascade that induces differentiation into erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhoopalan et al., 2020</xref>). EPO production is regulated in response to physiological oxygen concentrations through hypoxia response elements (HREs). HREs are enhancers that transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) bind to and subsequently upregulate the expression of numerous hypoxic response genes, including <italic>EPO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semenza and Wang, 1992</xref>). Disrupted EPO regulation can be pathogenic and lead to an autonomous overproduction of erythrocytes causing erythrocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mithoowani et al., 2020</xref>). Due to EPO’s inherent link to the oxygen response, mutations in the metazoan oxygen-sensing pathway have frequently been found to underlie erythrocytosis.</p><p>The oxygen-sensing pathway has been conserved in all animals and is essential for the maintenance of cellular activities in low oxygen settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lippl et al., 2018</xref>). Under hypoxia, oxygen-labile HIF1-3α subunits complex with its constitutively expressed HIFβ subunits to translocate to the nucleus as active heterodimeric transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dengler et al., 2014</xref>). Following translocation, HIF binds to HREs across the genome to trigger the transactivation of numerous genes, such as <italic>GLUT1</italic>, <italic>EPO,</italic> and <italic>VEGF,</italic> to promote anaerobic metabolism, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis, respectively, to induce adaptation to low oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schödel et al., 2011</xref>). In normal oxygen conditions, HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIFα subunit at one or both of the two conserved proline sites located in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), which initiates its ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL)-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase (Elongin BC/Cullin 2-Rbx1/pVHL) and subsequent destruction via the 26S proteasome. Notably, only one proline is required to be hydroxylated to trigger its rapid destruction, and whether HIFα is singly or doubly hydroxylated does not appear to change the rate of its ubiquitylation or proteasome-mediated destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the C-terminally located proline within ODD or CODD (e.g. P564 on HIF1α) has been shown to be the predominant residue that becomes hydroxylated prior to the modification of proline in the N-terminal ODD or NODD (e.g. P402 on HIF1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2024</xref>). The reason for this preferential prolyl-hydroxylation is incompletely understood, and the biological significance or the mechanistic purpose of the N-terminal proline remains unclear.</p><p>Clinically observed mutations have been identified in the major components of the oxygen-sensing pathway, including <italic>VHL</italic> (pVHL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clifford and Maher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann and Wiestler, 1991</xref>)<italic>, EPAS1</italic> (HIF2α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pacak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pacak et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>EGLN1</italic> (PHD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delamare et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardie et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>EGLN2</italic> (PHD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). These have been associated with the development of diseases with overlapping phenotypes, with erythrocytosis being the most common. Collectively, these diseases are referred to as pseudohypoxic diseases as they involve an inappropriate hypoxic response. Erythrocytosis caused by mutations in <italic>EGLN1</italic> is the most recently discovered pseudohypoxic disease. Since its first reported case in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Percy et al., 2006</xref>), 152 cases with 96 distinct mutations have been reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>EGLN1</italic> mutation-driven erythrocytosis is referred to as erythrocytosis, familial, 3 (ECYT3) by the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). However, three individuals with distinct <italic>EGLN1</italic> mutations (W51X, A228S, and H374R) developed recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Provenzano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladroue et al., 2008</xref>), which are neuroendocrine tumors that develop from chromaffin cells either within (pheochromocytoma) or outside (paraganglioma) the adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lenders et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p> Of the three isozymes of PHD, PHD2 is thought to be the most critical with high expression seen in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berra et al., 2003</xref>) and the only PHD able to effectively target both prolines in HIF1α and 2α ODDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appelhoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flashman et al., 2008</xref>). PHD2 belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2004</xref>) in which enzymes contain a double-stranded β-helix fold with a highly conserved HXE/D…H motif that coordinates Fe<sup>2+</sup> at its catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2006</xref>). In PHD2, the iron-coordinating residues are His313, Asp315, and His374 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figg et al., 2023</xref>). Erythrocytosis-causing mutations at (H374R) and near these conserved catalytic residues have been shown to be defective at regulating HIFα in a cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delamare et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Percy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladroue et al., 2008</xref>), which appears to be a common mechanism observed in the other pseudohypoxic diseases. For example, numerous studies have revealed that pVHL mutants have varied abilities to recognize and regulate HIFα, leading to the development of PPGL, erythrocytosis, and other cancers, such as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and hemangioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rechsteiner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maher and Kaelin, 1997</xref>). Recently, we showed that phenotypic severity of Pacak-Zhuang syndrome, caused by <italic>EPAS1</italic> mutations, is correlated to the ability of HIF2α mutants to escape degradation mediated by pVHL and PHD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferens et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that disproportionately high levels of HIFα are responsible for pseudohypoxic disease phenotypes, such as erythrocytosis and PPGL. In keeping with this notion, disease-causing mutants of PHD2 are likely defective in catalyzing HIFα hydroxylation to some extent, resulting in less HIFα degradation and correspondingly increased hypoxia response signaling. However, the precise mechanism(s) underlying such defect in PHD2 function is unclear. Recently, we devised a time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assay to directly measure the rate of hydroxylation on the two conserved proline residues simultaneously in HIF1α ODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we examined seven disease-associated PHD2 mutants via biophysical analyses and show that all PHD2 mutants have structural and/or catalytic activity defects. While all mutants had the anticipated defect in binding and hydroxylating the predominant CODD proline, we identified the PHD2 P317R mutant that retained comparably wild-type (WT) level of hydroxylating CODD proline (i.e. HIF1α P564) but failed to hydroxylate NODD proline (i.e. HIF1α P402) as measured by NMR. Unexpectedly, PHD2 P317R was capable of binding to both NODD and CODD peptides with similar affinity. These results provide a biophysical mechanism that, at least in part, underlies PHD2-driven erythrocytosis and serendipitously reveal direct biochemical evidence to suggest that NODD prolyl-hydroxylation is necessary for normal physiological response to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations across the PHD2 enzyme induce erythrocytosis</title><p>We compiled and analyzed all reported cases of PHD2-driven erythrocytosis as of January 2025. 96 distinct variants have been reported, including two missense variants commonly found in Tibetan populations that are hypothesized to be adaptations to high altitude conditions (D4E and C127S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiang et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with erythrocytosis in the general population, most patients with PHD2-driven erythrocytosis were male (~70%). About half of the case reports provided information on family history of PHD2-driven erythrocytosis, of which ~75% were reported to be familial while ~25% were de novo mutations; a similar rate of de novo mutations is observed with VHL disease. PHD2-driven erythrocytosis is typically classified as secondary erythrocytosis, which is defined as being caused by an EPO-inducing mechanism downstream of the primary defect, ultimately resulting in normal to high EPO levels that drive erythropoiesis. This classification is aligned with the suspected mechanism of PHD2-driven disease in which mutated PHD2 dysregulates HIF leading to increased EPO production. Curiously, however, EPO was reported to be largely normal in patients with PHD2-driven erythrocytosis, with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which is consistent with the loss of PHD2 in mice leading to EPO hypersensitivity in erythroid progenitors, enabling a ‘normal’ amount of EPO to generate a pathogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arsenault et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All cases of PHD2-driven erythrocytosis were reported as germline heterozygous mutations of PHD2, suggesting haploinsufficiency of PHD2 is enough to induce erythrocytosis. This is consistent with previous reports that HIFα regulation is dose dependent on PHD2 knockdown via siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berra et al., 2003</xref>). As stated previously, in three exceptional cases, individuals with PHD2 mutations developed PPGL (W51X, A228S, and H374R). Biopsies of each tumor revealed a loss of heterozygosity for PHD2, implying a complete loss of WT PHD2 in chromaffin cells is necessary to induce tumorigenesis.</p><p>The majority of the reported mutations were missense (~74%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, mutations that should theoretically severely disrupt PHD2 structure (nonsense, frameshift, and deletions) caused the same phenotype (erythrocytosis) as less disruptive missense mutations, suggesting an unclear or lack of correlation between mutation type and phenotypic severity. Thus, a potential phenotypic mechanism of PHD2-driven disease can be hypothesized where erythrocytosis will develop upon deleterious mutation in one PHD2 allele, while PPGL will be induced upon a loss of heterozygosity in chromaffin cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of disease-causing PHD2 mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of mutation type calculated from clinical case reports.

Accordingly, representative PHD2 mutants were selected to analyze the mechanism of disease caused by PHD2 mutations. Some mutants were chosen based on their frequency in the clinical data and their presence in potential mutational hot spots. Various mutations were noted at W334 and R371 sites, while F366L was identified in multiple individuals. 9 cases of PHD2-driven disease were reported to be caused from mutations located between residues 200–210, while 13 cases were reported between residues 369 and 379. Thus, G206C and R371H were chosen to represent these potential hot spots. To examine a potential genotype-phenotype relationship, two of the mutants, A228S and H374R, responsible for neuroendocrine tumor development were also selected. Finally, mutations located close to or on catalytic core residues (P317R, R371H, and H374R) were chosen to test for suspected defects. Ultimately, we selected seven PHD2 mutants with distinct residue changes in the catalytic core of PHD2 for study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Some PHD2 mutants are less stable and defective in regulating HRE-driven transcription</title><p>We asked whether the enzymatic activity of PHD2 mutants can be inferred from downstream HIF activity using a dual luciferase reporter assay under control of HRE.

It is presumed that the abnormal response is the reason for overlapping phenotypes caused by mutations in different proteins of the same pathway (pVHL, HIF2α, and PHD2). Specifically, we have proposed that the common phenotypes of pseudohypoxic diseases are caused by the gain-of-function ability of HIFα, in particular HIF2α, to escape degradation in the presence of the disease-causing mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohh et al., 2022</xref>). It has been shown that VHL disease-causing mutants have varying ability to target HIF1/2α for ubiquitin-mediated destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rechsteiner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knauth et al., 2009</xref>), and Pacak-Zhuang syndrome-causing HIF2α mutants are able to escape recognition to a varying degree from both pVHL and PHD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarade et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferens et al., 2024</xref>). It follows then that in the case of PHD2-driven erythrocytosis, PHD2 mutants would have a hindered ability to promote proper oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF1α and -2α.</p><p>Complete deletion of PHD2 in mice causes embryonic lethality due to venous congestion and cardiomyopathy, theorized to be directly related to high blood volume induced upon PHD2 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minamishima et al., 2008</xref>). Conditional inactivation of PHD2, whether globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>) or in renal EPO-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franke et al., 2013</xref>), has been observed to cause erythrocytosis in mice. Moreover, while inactivation of PHD2 alone was sufficient to induce erythrocytosis, inactivating PHD1 or PHD3 alone did not result in erythrocytosis. However, when PHD1 or PHD3 was inactivated in addition to PHD2, erythrocytosis phenotype worsened, suggesting a supporting role for the PHD paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined seven disease-causing PHD2 mutations across the catalytic core, the most frequently mutated region within PHD2. G206C, W334R, and H374R exhibited gross protein stability defects and were prone to severe aggregation, which precluded their purification necessary for further biophysical analyses. One of these mutants, H374R, is located at the catalytic site integral to the function of PHD2, which combined with the stability defect likely abrogated its ability to promote the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of ectopic HIF1α, leading to increased HRE-luciferase transcriptional activity in <italic>PHD2-/-</italic> HEK293A cells. Previous work has shown that mutating the analogous His iron-coordinating residues to a charged residue (Arg or Glu) in the prolyl-4-hydroxylase responsible for hydroxylating prolines of collagen abolishes enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 1997</xref>). Given the high structural conservation in the Fe/2OG-oxygenase enzyme family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2006</xref>), it can be predicted that a comparable mutation on PHD2 would also abolish activity. Structurally, G206 is located at a sharp turn in PHD2, requiring the flexibility afforded by glycine. This property may be difficult to substitute without detriment as is observed with G206C. W334 is in a loop that connects the beta strands, making up the highly conserved jelly roll structure of 2OG oxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2006</xref>). A mutation at W334 may impact the orientation of this loop and destabilize the structure of PHD2. Our data corroborates this theory by revealing W334R to be highly unstable in cells and in vitro. However, PHD2 G206C and W334R mutants showed similar capacity as the PHD2 WT to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ectopic HIF1α. This may have been due to the nature of transfected PHD2 in which mutant PHD2s that are prone to aggregation and instability are being translated throughout the luciferase assay, which may generate a small pool of monomeric PHDs that is sufficient to inhibit the transcriptional activity of HIF1α comparable to PHD2 WT.</p><p>The remaining four mutants (A228S, P317R, F366L, and R371H) not prone to aggregation displayed an overall structure similar to PHD2 WT, as determined by CD, and with the exception of PHD2 P317R (discussed later), they were able to effectively suppress the ectopic HIF1α transcriptional activity. These mutants also exhibited slight thermal instability with mildly weaker binding affinity to HIF1α CODD peptide, which may be sufficient to cause the disease phenotype in vivo. PHD2 A228S exhibited the most minute of defects among all mutants tested and concordantly showed marginal reduction in enzymatic activity as measured via time-resolved NMR. Notably, despite these defects, albeit subtle, it is evident that the HRE-luciferase reporter assay is in general not reliable to reveal the disease-causing mutations on the functional output of PHD2 mutants, including those prone to aggregation (G206C and W334R). This represents a limitation in the interpretation of the HRE-luciferase reporter assay as mutants with clear structural defects do not necessarily impact downstream hypoxic signaling.</p><p>We recently developed a time-resolved NMR approach to directly and simultaneously measure PHD2-mediated hydroxylation of P564 within CODD and P402 within NODD in the context of full-length HIF1α ODD. We showed that P564 is the predominant oxygen-dependent hydroxylation site over P402. Considering that pVHL only requires one hydroxylated proline for binding and triggering rapid ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian et al., 2011</xref>), the biological utility of P402 was thought to be inconsequential in normal hypoxic response. Here, our results revealed a previously unappreciated intricacy in the enzymatic selectivity of PHD2 P317R between CODD and NODD, challenging the current notion of NODD insignificance. NMR results showed that the disease-causing PHD2 P317R retained near-WT activity on CODD P564 but had negligible activity on NODD P402. Furthermore, despite effective activity on P564, ectopic PHD2 P317R generated abnormally high HRE-driven luciferase reporter signal, suggesting the negative impact of defective P402 hydroxylation on an otherwise rapid oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF1α. This is congruous with Schofield’s earlier work that showed, using an indirect metabolic method with individual peptides, no activity on NODD by PHD2 P317R while effectively hydroxylating CODD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>). Given the pathogenic nature of the P317R mutation, it appears likely that this selective defect on HIF1α NODD contributes to the development of erythrocytosis, and, therefore, the involvement of NODD in normal oxygen-sensing pathway is not insignificant.</p><p> The molecular basis for PHD2 P317R’s selective defect for NODD is currently unknown. Comparison of WT and P317R PHD2 crystal structures suggests that P317 makes hydrophobic contacts with the LXXLAP motif on HIFα, and R317 may interact differently with this motif, impacting HIFα binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, BLI results showed that PHD2 P317R binds to both CODD and NODD peptides comparable to PHD2 WT. Substrates of Fe/2OG-oxygenases typically bind the enzymes non-covalently with a prime separation distance of 4–5 Å between the target atom and the catalytic iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aik et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility is that the Pro to Arg substitution at position 317 may increase the distance between HIF1α P402 and the active site within the catalytic core without compromising the interaction between the substrate and enzyme. However, such mutation did not markedly impact the efficient turnover of P564, suggesting that the varied residues between NODD and CODD may influence the substrate selectivity of PHD2.</p><p> Some mutants, namely A228S and F366L, appear to be like PHD2 WT according to the tests performed. Minor binding and stability defects were observed with both mutants, yet it remains unclear if this is the pathogenetic mechanism. Upon structural review, it becomes clear that F366L would disrupt the hydrophobic core of PHD2, and this instability can be observed in the CHX assay but not in the other assays. An A228S-caused defect is less obvious. A228 is located on the surface of the catalytic core, and while it is possible a residue change to polar serine could impact how PHD2 interacts in solution, this remains to be validated. This raises the notion that these mutants may have defects interacting with previously proposed, though controversial, alternate non-HIF substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cockman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PHD2-driven erythrocytosis is a relatively newly discovered genetic disease with the first reported case in 2006.

Samples were transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube pre-purged with 99.6% oxygen for 10 min. The real-time hydroxylation experiments were conducted at 25°C using the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC pulse sequence with sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as reference. For each experiment, an <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of HIF1α ODD was acquired prior to initiating the hydroxylation reaction with the addition of purified WT or mutant PHD2 at a molar ratio of 1:20 versus HIF1α ODD with 5 mM α-ketoglutaric acid disodium salt dihydrate (Sigma), 2 mM L-ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 0.1 mM ferrous chloride tetrahydrate. Multiple <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra with acquisition time of 602 s were acquired over the course of 20.18 hr. After six consecutive acquisitions of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra, the subsequent spectra were acquired with interscan delays of 2400 s. Kinetic measurements with WT, A228S, and P317R PHD2 were performed in technical duplicates.</p><p> Real-time hydroxylation of P402 and P564 of HIF1α was measured by monitoring resonance shifting of A403 and I566 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2024</xref>), respectively, in all <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra. Both resonances shifted as reflections of changes in the local chemical environments upon prolyl-hydroxylation. Reaction progress was reported as the peak intensity of the shifted resonance over the sum of peak intensities for both shifted and unshifted resonances. All spectra were processed with the NMRPipe software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and analyzed using the CcpNmr Version-3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>). Kinetic curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.3).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw and transformed data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107121-data1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical case reports of disease-causing PHD2 mutations.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107121-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>HIFα peptide sequences.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-107121-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-107121-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The authors declare that the clinical and numerical data supporting the findings of this study are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>, respectively.

Their goal is to provide a mechanism for how these mutations cause the disease. PHD2 hydroxylates HIF1a in the presence of oxygen at two distinct proline residues (P564 and P402) in the &quot;oxygen degradation domain&quot; (ODD). This leads to the ubiquitylation of HIF1a by the VHL E3 ligase and its subsequent degradation. Multiple mutations have been reported in the EGLN1 gene (coding for PHD2), which are associated with pseudohypoxic diseases that include erythrocytosis. Furthermore, 3 mutations in PHD2 also cause pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), a neuroendocrine tumour. These mutations likely cause elevated levels of HIF1a, but their mechanisms are unclear. Here, the authors analyze mutations from 152 case reports and map them on the crystal structure. They then focus on 7 mutations, which they clone in a plasmid and transfect into PHD2-KO to monitor HIF1a transcriptional activity via a luciferase assay. All mutants show impaired activation. Some mutants also impaired stability in pulse chase turnover assays (except A228S, P317R, and F366L). In vitro purified PHD2 mutants display a minor loss in thermal stability and some propensity to aggregate. Using MST technology, they show that P317R is strongly impaired in binding to HIF1a and HIF2a, whereas other mutants are only slightly affected. Using NMR, they show that the PHD2 P317R mutation greatly reduces hydroxylation of P402 (HIF1a NODD), as well as P562 (HIF1a CODD), but to a lesser extent. Finally, BLI shows that the P317R mutation reduces affinity for CODD by 3-fold, but not NODD.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Simple, easy-to-follow manuscript. Generally well-written.</p><p>(2) Disease-relevant mutations are studied in PHD2 that provide insights into its mechanism of action.</p><p>(3) Good, well-researched background section.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Poor use of existing structural data on the complexes of PHD2 with HIF1a peptides and various metals and substrates. A quick survey of the impact of these mutations (as well as analysis by Chowdhury et al, 2016) on the structure and interactions between PHD2 peptides of HIF1a shows that the P317R mutation interferes with peptide binding. By contrast, F366L will affect the hydrophobic core, and A228S is on the surface, and it's not obvious how it would interfere with the stability of the protein.</p><p>(2) To determine aggregation and monodispersity of the PHD2 mutants using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equal quantities of the protein must be loaded on the column. This is not what was done. As an aside, the colors used for the SEC are very similar and nearly indistinguishable.</p><p>(3) The interpretation of some mutants remains incomplete. For A228S, what is the explanation for its reduced activity? It is not substantially less stable than WT and does not seem to affect peptide hydroxylation.</p><p>(4) The interpretation of the NMR prolyl hydroxylation is tainted by the high concentrations used here. First of all, there is a likely a typo in the method section; the final concentration of ODD is likely 0.18 mM, and not 0.18 uM (PNAS paper by the same group in 2024 reports using a final concentration of 230 uM). Here, I will assume the concentration is 180 uM. Flashman et al (JBC 2008) showed that the affinity of the NODD site (P402; around 10 uM) for PHD2 is 10-fold weaker than CODD (P564, around 1 uM). This likely explains the much faster kinetics of hydroxylation towards the latter. Now, using the MST data, let's say the P317R mutation reduces the affinity by 40-fold; the affinity becomes 400 uM for NODD (above the protein concentration) and 40 uM for CODD (below the protein concentration). Thus, CODD would still be hydroxylated by the P317R mutant, but not NODD.</p><p>(5) The discrepancy between the MST and BLI results does not make sense, especially regarding the P317R mutant. Based on the crystal structures of PHD2 in complex with the ODD peptides, the P317R mutation should have a major impact on the affinity, which is what is reported by MST. This suggests that the MST is more likely to be valid than BLI, and the latter is subject to some kind of artefact. Furthermore, the BLI results are inconsistent with previous results showing that PHD2 has a 10-fold lower affinity for NODD compared to CODD.</p><p>(6) Overall, the study provides some insights into mutants inducing erythrocytosis, but the impact is limited. Most insights are provided on the P317R mutant, but this mutant had already been characterized by Chowdhury et al (2016). Some mutants affect the stability of the protein in cells, but then no mechanism is provided for A228S or F366L, which have stabilities similar to WT, yet have impaired HIF1a activation.</p><p>Comments on revision:</p><p>While the authors have addressed my concerns regarding the SEC experiments and the structural interpretation of most mutants, I remain unconvinced by their interpretation of the P317R mutant and affinity measurements. The BLI and MST data remain inconsistent for P317R binding to CODD, and the authors' response is essentially that the fluorescent labeling of P317R (but not other mutants) uniquely interferes with binding to the NODD/CODD peptides, which does not make a lot of sense. The fluorescent labeling target lysine residues; while there are lysine in PHD2 in proximity to the peptide binding site, labeling these sites would affect binding to all mutants, not only P317R (which does not introduce any new labeling site). Furthermore, the authors did not really address the discrepancy with the observations by Flashman et al (2008) that NODD binds more weakly than CODD, which is inconsistent with their BLI results. Another point that makes me doubt the validity of the BLI results is the poor fit of the sensorgrams and the slow dissociation kinetics, which is inconsistent with the relatively low affinity in the 2-6 uM range.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107121.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Mutations in the prolyl hydroxylase, PHD2, cause erythrocytosis and, in some cases, can result in tumorigenesis. Taber and colleagues test the structural and functional consequences of seven patient-derived missense mutations in PHD2 using cell-based reporter and stability assays, and multiple biophysical assays, and find that most mutations are destabilizing. Interestingly, they discover a PHD2 mutant that can hydroxylate the C-terminal ODD, but not the N-terminal ODD, which suggests the importance of N-terminal ODD for biology. A major strength of the manuscript is the multidisciplinary approach used by the authors to characterize the functional and structural consequences of the mutations. However, the manuscript had several major weaknesses, such as an incomplete description of how the NMR was performed, a justification for using neighboring residues as a surrogate for looking at prolyl hydroxylation directly, or a reference to the clinical case studies describing the phenotypes of patient mutations. Additionally, the experimental descriptions for several experiments are missing descriptions of controls or validation, which limits their strength in supporting the claims of the authors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This manuscript is well-written and clear.</p><p>(2) The authors use multiple assays to look at the effects of several disease-associated mutations, which support the claims.</p><p>(3) The identification of P317R as a mutant that loses activity specifically against NODD, which could be a useful tool for further studies in cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Major:</p><p>(1) The source data for the patient mutations (Figure 1) in PHD2 is not referenced, and it's not clear where this data came from or if it's publicly available. There is no section describing this in the methods.</p><p>(2) The NMR hydroxylation assay.</p><p>A. The description of these experiments is really confusing. The authors have published a recent paper describing a method using 13C-NMR to directly detect proly-hydroxylation over time, and they refer to this manuscript multiple times as the method used for the studies under review. However, it appears the current study is using 15N-HSQC-based experiments to track the CSP of neighboring residues to the target prolines, so not the target prolines themselves. The authors should make this clear in the text, especially on page 9, 5th line, where they describe proline cross-peaks and refer to the 15N-HSQC data in Figure 5B.</p><p>B. The authors are using neighboring residues as reporters for proline hydroxylation, without validating this approach. How well do CSPs of A403 and I566 track with proline hydroxylation? Have the authors confirmed this using their 13C-NMR data or mass spec?</p><p>C. Peak intensities. In some cases, the peak intensities of the end point residue look weaker than the peak intensities of the starting residue (5B, PHD2 WT I566, 6 ct lines vs. 4 ct lines). Is this because of sample dilution (i.e., should happen globally)? Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>(3) Data validating the CRISPR KO HEK293A cells is missing.</p><p>(4) The interpretation of the SEC data for the PHD2 mutants is a little problematic. Subtle alterations in the elution profiles may hint at different hydrodynamic radii, but as the samples were not loaded at equal concentrations or volumes, these data seem more anecdotal, rather than definitive. Repeating this multiple times, using matched samples, followed by comparison with standards loaded under identical buffer conditions, would significantly strengthen the conclusions one could make from the data.</p><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Justification for picking the seven residues is not clearly articulated. The authors say they picked 7 mutants with &quot;distinct residue changes&quot;, but no further rationale is provided.</p><p>(2) A major finding of the paper is that a disease-associated mutation, P317R, can differentially affect HIF1 prolyhydroxylation, however, additional follow-up studies have not been performed to test this in cells or to validate the mutant in another method. Is it the position of the proline within the catalytic core, or the identity of the mutation that accounts for the selectivity?</p><p>Comments on revision:</p><p>The revised manuscript addresses most of my concerns, i.e performing SEC experiments under matched sample concentrations, and incorporating additional data to justify the use of surrogate residues to monitor proline hydroxylation. I appreciate the improvements in the text to clarify the NMR experiments, but I still find their description confusing. Although the authors are using neighboring residues to monitor proline hydroxylation (which they justify convincingly using supplementary data), the language in the text suggests they are (and can?) monitor them directly (i.e. referring to proline cross-peaks in an 15N-HSQC spectrum). The axis labels in Figure 5B also seem to have become mislabeled in this revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107121.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and clinically relevant in vitro study by Taber et al., exploring how mutations in PHD2 contribute to erythrocytosis and/or neuroendocrine tumors.

Their goal is to provide a mechanism for how these mutations cause the disease. PHD2 hydroxylates HIF1a in the presence of oxygen at two distinct proline residues (P564 and P402) in the &quot;oxygen degradation domain&quot; (ODD). This leads to the ubiquitylation of HIF1a by the VHL E3 ligase and its subsequent degradation. Multiple mutations have been reported in the EGLN1 gene (coding for PHD2), which are associated with pseudohypoxic diseases that include erythrocytosis. Furthermore, 3 mutations in PHD2 also cause pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), a neuroendocrine tumour. These mutations likely cause elevated levels of HIF1a, but their mechanisms are unclear. Here, the authors analyze mutations from 152 case reports and map them on the crystal structure. They then focus on 7 mutations, which they clone in a plasmid and transfect into PHD2-KO to monitor HIF1a transcriptional activity via a luciferase assay. All mutants show impaired activation. Some mutants also impaired stability in pulse chase turnover assays (except A228S, P317R, and F366L). In vitro purified PHD2 mutants display a minor loss in thermal stability and some propensity to aggregate. Using MST technology, they show that P317R is strongly impaired in binding to HIF1a and HIF2a, whereas other mutants are only slightly affected. Using NMR, they show that the PHD2 P317R mutation greatly reduces hydroxylation of P402 (HIF1a NODD), as well as P562 (HIF1a CODD), but to a lesser extent. Finally, BLI shows that the P317R mutation reduces affinity for CODD by 3-fold, but not NODD.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Simple, easy-to-follow manuscript. Generally well-written.</p><p>(2) Disease-relevant mutations are studied in PHD2 that provide insights into its mechanism of action.</p><p>(3) Good, well-researched background section.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Poor use of existing structural data on the complexes of PHD2 with HIF1a peptides and various metals and substrates. A quick survey of the impact of these mutations (as well as analysis by Chowdhury et al, 2016) on the structure and interactions between PHD2 peptides of HIF1a shows that the P317R mutation interferes with peptide binding. By contrast, F366L will affect the hydrophobic core, and A228S is on the surface, and it's not obvious how it would interfere with the stability of the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have further analyzed the mutations on the available PHD2 crystal structures in complex with HIFα to discern how these substitution mutations may impact PHD2 structure and function. This analysis has been added into the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To determine aggregation and monodispersity of the PHD2 mutants using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equal quantities of the protein must be loaded on the column. This is not what was done. As an aside, the colors used for the SEC are very similar and nearly indistinguishable.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have performed an additional experiment as suggested by the reviewer to further assess aggregation and hydrodynamic size. The colors used in the graph were changed for clearer differentiation between samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The interpretation of some mutants remains incomplete. For A228S, what is the explanation for its reduced activity? It is not substantially less stable than WT and does not seem to affect peptide hydroxylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the causal mechanism for some of the tested disease-causing mutants remain unclear. The negative findings also raise the notion, perhaps considered controversial, that there may be other substrates of PHD2 that are impacted by certain mutations, which contribute to disease pathogenesis. A brief paragraph discussing this has been included in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The interpretation of the NMR prolyl hydroxylation is tainted by the high concentrations used here. First of all, there is a likely a typo in the method section; the final concentration of ODD is likely 0.18 mM, and not 0.18 uM (PNAS paper by the same group in 2024 reports using a final concentration of 230 uM). Here, I will assume the concentration is 180 uM. Flashman et al (JBC 2008) showed that the affinity of the NODD site (P402; around 10 uM) for PHD2 is 10-fold weaker than CODD (P564, around 1 uM). This likely explains the much faster kinetics of hydroxylation towards the latter. Now, using the MST data, let's say the P317R mutation reduces the affinity by 40-fold; the affinity becomes 400 uM for NODD (above the protein concentration) and 40 uM for CODD (below the protein concentration). Thus, CODD would still be hydroxylated by the P317R mutant, but not NODD.</p></disp-quote><p>The HIF1α concentration was indeed an oversight, which will be corrected to 0.18 mM. The study by Flashman et al.[1] showing PHD2 having a lower affinity to the NODD than CODD likely contributes to the differential hydroxylation rates via PHD2 WT. We showed here via MST that PHD2 P317R had K[d] of 320 ± 20 uM for HIF1αCODD, which should have led to a severe enzymatic defect, even at the high concentrations used for NMR (180 uM). However, we observed only a subtle reduction in hydroxylation efficiency in comparison to PHD2 WT. Thus, we performed another binding method using BLI that showed a mild binding defect on CODD by PHD2 P317R, consistent with NMR data. The perplexing result is the WT-like binding to the NODD by PHD2 P317R, which appears inconsistent with the severe defect in NODD hydroxylation via PHD2 P317R as measured via NMR. These results suggest that there are supporting residues within the PHD2/NODD interface that help maintain binding to NODD but compromise the efficiency of NODD hydroxylation upon PHD2 P317R mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The discrepancy between the MST and BLI results does not make sense, especially regarding the P317R mutant. Based on the crystal structures of PHD2 in complex with the ODD peptides, the P317R mutation should have a major impact on the affinity, which is what is reported by MST. This suggests that the MST is more likely to be valid than BLI, and the latter is subject to some kind of artefact. Furthermore, the BLI results are inconsistent with previous results showing that PHD2 has a 10-fold lower affinity for NODD compared to CODD.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s structural prediction that P317R mutation should cause a major binding defect, while agreeable with our MST data, is incongruent with our NMR and the data from Chowdhury et al.[2] that showed efficient hydroxylation of CODD via PHD2 P317R. Moreover, we have attempted to model NODD and CODD on apo PHD2 P317R structure and found that the mutation had no major impact on CODD while the mutated residue could clash with NODD, causing a shifting of peptide positioning on the protein. However, these modeling predictions, like any in silico projections, would need experimental validation. As mentioned in our preceding response, we also performed BLI, which showed that PHD2 P317R had a minor binding defect for CODD, consistent with the NMR results and findings by Chowdhury et al[2]. NODD binding was also measured with BLI as purified NODD peptides were not amenable for soluble-based MST assay, which showed similar K[d]’s for PHD2 WT and P317R. Considering the absence of NODD hydroxylation via PHD2 P317R as measured by NMR and modeling on apo PHD2 P317R, we posit that P317R causes deviation of NODD from its original orientation that may not affect binding due to the other interactions from the surrounding elements but unfortunately disallows NODD from turnover. Further study would be required to validate such notion, which we feel is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Overall, the study provides some insights into mutants inducing erythrocytosis, but the impact is limited. Most insights are provided on the P317R mutant, but this mutant had already been characterized by Chowdhury et al (2016). Some mutants affect the stability of the protein in cells, but then no mechanism is provided for A228S or F366L, which have stabilities similar to WT, yet have impaired HIF1a activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these and other limitations. We have expanded on the shortcomings of the present study but would like to underscore that the current work using the recently described NMR assay along with other biophysical analyses suggests a previously under-appreciated role of NODD hydroxylation in the normal oxygen-sensing pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mutations in the prolyl hydroxylase, PHD2, cause erythrocytosis and, in some cases, can result in tumorigenesis. Taber and colleagues test the structural and functional consequences of seven patientderived missense mutations in PHD2 using cell-based reporter and stability assays, and multiple biophysical assays, and find that most mutations are destabilizing. Interestingly, they discover a PHD2 mutant that can hydroxylate the C-terminal ODD, but not the N-terminal ODD, which suggests the importance of N-terminal ODD for biology. A major strength of the manuscript is the multidisciplinary approach used by the authors to characterize the functional and structural consequences of the mutations. However, the manuscript had several major weaknesses, such as an incomplete description of how the NMR was performed, a justification for using neighboring residues as a surrogate for looking at prolyl hydroxylation directly, or a reference to the clinical case studies describing the phenotypes of patient mutations. Additionally, the experimental descriptions for several experiments are missing descriptions of controls or validation, which limits their strength in supporting the claims of the authors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This manuscript is well-written and clear.</p><p>(2) The authors use multiple assays to look at the effects of several disease-associated mutations, which support the claims.</p><p>(3) The identification of P317R as a mutant that loses activity specifically against NODD, which could be a useful tool for further studies in cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Major:</p><p>(1) The source data for the patient mutations (Figure 1) in PHD2 is not referenced, and it's not clear where this data came from or if it's publicly available. There is no section describing this in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Clinical and patient information on disease-causing PHD2 mutants was compiled from various case reports and summarized in an excel sheet found in the Supplementary Information. The case reports are cited in this excel file. A reference to the supplementary data has been added to the Figure 1 legend and in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The NMR hydroxylation assay.</p><p>A. The description of these experiments is really confusing. The authors have published a recent paper describing a method using 13C-NMR to directly detect proly-hydroxylation over time, and they refer to this manuscript multiple times as the method used for the studies under review. However, it appears the current study is using 15N-HSQC-based experiments to track the CSP of neighboring residues to the target prolines, so not the target prolines themselves. The authors should make this clear in the text, especially on page 9, 5th line, where they describe proline cross-peaks and refer to the 15N-HSQC data in Figure 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentioned, the assay that we developed directly measures the target proline residues. This assay is ideal when mutations near the prolines are studied, such as A403, Y565 (He et al[3]). In this previous work, we observed that the shifting of the target proline cross-peaks due to change in electronegativity on the pyrrolidine ring of proline in turn impacted the neighboring residues[3], which meant that the neighboring residues can be used as reporter residues for certain purposes. In this study, we focused on investigating the mutations on PHD2 while leaving the sequence of the HIF-1α unchanged by using solely 15N-HSQC-based experiments without the need for double-labeled samples. Nonetheless, we thank the reviewer for pointing out the confusion in the text and we have corrected and clarified our description of this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. The authors are using neighboring residues as reporters for proline hydroxylation, without validating this approach. How well do CSPs of A403 and I566 track with proline hydroxylation? Have the authors confirmed this using their 13C-NMR data or mass spec?</p></disp-quote><p>For previous studies, we performed intercalated 15N-HSQC and 13C-CON experiments for the kinetic measurements of wild-type HIF-1α and mutants. We observed that the shifting pattern of A403 and I566 in the 15N-HSQC spectra aligned well with the ones of P402 and P564, respectively, in the 13C-CON spectra. Representative data has been added to Supplemental Data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. Peak intensities. In some cases, the peak intensities of the end point residue look weaker than the peak intensities of the starting residue (5B, PHD2 WT I566, 6 ct lines vs. 4 ct lines). Is this because of sample dilution (i.e., should happen globally)? Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute observation by the reviewer. We checked and confirmed that for all kinetic datasets, the peak intensities of the end point residue are always slightly lower than the ones of the starting. This includes the cases for PHD2 A228S and P317R in 5B, although not as obvious as the one of PHD2 WT. We agree with the reviewer that the sample dilution is a factor as a total volume of 16 microliters of reaction components was added to the solution to trigger the reaction after the first spectrum was acquired. It is also likely that rate of prolyl hydroxylation becomes extremely slow with only a low amount of substrate available in the system. Therefore, the reaction would not be 100% complete which was detected by the sensitive NMR experimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Data validating the CRISPR KO HEK293A cells is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this oversight. Western blots validating PHD2 KO in HEK293A cells have been added to the Supplementary Data file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The interpretation of the SEC data for the PHD2 mutants is a little problematic. Subtle alterations in the elution profiles may hint at different hydrodynamic radii, but as the samples were not loaded at equal concentrations or volumes, these data seem more anecdotal, rather than definitive. Repeating this multiple times, using matched samples, followed by comparison with standards loaded under identical buffer conditions, would significantly strengthen the conclusions one could make from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have performed an additional experiment as suggested with equal volume and concentration of each PHD2 construct loaded onto the SEC column for better assessment of aggregation. Notably, our conclusion remained unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Justification for picking the seven residues is not clearly articulated. The authors say they picked 7 mutants with &quot;distinct residue changes&quot;, but no further rationale is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional justification for the selection of the mutants has been added to the ‘Mutations across the PHD2 enzyme induce erythrocytosis’ section. Briefly, some mutants were chosen based on their frequency in the clinical data and their presence in potential mutational hot spots. Various mutations were noted at W334 and R371, while F366L was identified in multiple individuals. Additionally, 9 cases of PHD2-driven disease were reported to be caused from mutations located between residues 200 to 210 while 13 cases were reported between residues 369-379, so G206C and R371H were chosen to represent potential hot spots. To examine a potential genotype-phenotype relationship, two of the mutants responsible for neuroendocrine tumor development, A228S and H374R, were also selected. Finally, mutations located close or on catalytic core residues (P317R, R371H, and H374R) were chosen to test for suspected defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A major finding of the paper is that a disease-associated mutation, P317R, can differentially affect HIF1 prolyhydroxylation, however, additional follow-up studies have not been performed to test this in cells or to validate the mutant in another method. Is it the position of the proline within the catalytic core, or the identity of the mutation that accounts for the selectivity?</p></disp-quote><p>This is the very question that we are currently addressing but as a part of a follow-up study. Indeed, one thought is that the preferential defect observed could be the result of the loss of proline, an exceptionally rigid amino acid that makes contact with the backbone twice, or the addition of a specific amino acid, namely arginine, a flexible amino acid with an added charge at this site. Although beyond the scope of this manuscript, we will investigate whether such and other characteristics in this region of PHD2/HIF1α interface contribute to the differential hydroxylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and clinically relevant in vitro study by Taber et al., exploring how mutations in PHD2 contribute to erythrocytosis and/or neuroendocrine tumors.

The subsequent study would be to validate whether the identified defects, in particular the selective NODD impairment, would lead to erythrocytosis in vivo. However, we feel that such study would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The reliance on HRE-luciferase reporter assays may not reliably reflect the PHD2 function and highlights a limitation in the assessment of downstream hypoxic signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. All experimental assays and systems have limitations. The HRE-luciferase assay used in the present manuscript also has limitations such as the continuous expression of exogenous PHD2 mutants driven via CMV promoter. Thus, we performed several additional biophysical methodologies to interrogate the disease-causing PHD2 mutants. The limitations of the luciferase assay have been expanded in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The study clearly documents the selective defect of the P317R mutant, but the structural basis for this selectivity is not addressed through high-resolution structural analysis (e.g., cryo-EM).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. While solving the structure of PHD2 P317R in complex with HIFα substrate is beyond the scope for this study, a structure of PHD2 P317R in complex with a clinically used inhibitor has been solved (PDB:5LAT). In analyzing this structure and that of PHD2 WT in complex with NODD, Chowdhury et al[2] stated that P317 makes hydrophobic contacts with LXXLAP motif on HIFα and R317 is predicted to interact differently with this motif. While this analysis does not directly elucidate the reason for the preferential NODD defect, it supports the possibility that P317R substitution may be more detrimental for enzymatic activity on NODD than CODD. We have discussed this notion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given the proposed central role of HIF2α in erythrocytosis, direct assessment of HIF2α hydroxylation by the mutants would have strengthened the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, but we feel that such study would be beyond the scope of the present study. We observed that the PHD2 binding patterns to HIF1α and HIF2α were similar, and we have previously assigned &gt;95% of the amino acids in HIF1α ODD for NMR study[3]. Thus, we first focused on the elucidation of possible defects on disease-associated PHD2 mutants using HIF1α as the substrate with the supposition that an identified deregulation on HIF1α could be extended to HIF2α paralog. However, we agree with the reviewer that future studies should examine the impact of PHD2 mutants directly on HIF2α.</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) Flashman, E. et al.

Are these mutations affecting interactions with proteins other than HIF1a? Furthermore, does the F366L mutation affect the hydroxylation rate? This should be measured. The authors should also perform a more in-depth structural analysis of these mutations and perhaps use AlphaFold to identify how these sites may be involved in other interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendations. A paragraph discussing the quandary of A228S and F366L has been added to the discussion as well as an in-depth structural analysis of each selected mutant. While AlphaFold is excellent at predicting protein structures overall, its capability to predict the effect of single point mutation, such as those in this study, is limited.

An additional experiment was performed in which similar concentrations of each mutant protein was loaded onto the SEC column and chromatograms was normalized according to the molecular concentration. Results from this experiment have been added to replace the previously performed aggregation assay.

As discussed in depth in response to Public Reviewer 1’s fourth comment, we observed only a subtle reduction in hydroxylation efficiency of HIF1aCODD by PHD2 P317R in comparison to PHD2 WT. Upon performing BLI, we found PHD2 P317R displays only a mild binding defect on the CODD and NODD. The WT-like binding to the NODD by PHD2 P317R appears to be inconsistent with the severe defect in NODD hydroxylation via PHD2 P317R as measured via NMR. These results suggest that there are supporting residues within the PHD2/NODD interface that help maintain binding to NODD but compromise the efficiency of NODD hydroxylation upon PHD2 P317R mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>It is unclear where the source data came from describing the patient mutations, or if it is publicly available.

As we had previously assigned &gt;95% of residues for HIF1α ODD for NMR assay, we analyzed HIF1 with the supposition that any defects observed would likely apply to HIF2. However, we agree that future studies on the impact of PHD2 mutants directly on HIF2 would be beneficial to supplement our understanding of pseudohypoxic disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Additionally, although perhaps more suitable for future work or discussion, structural modeling or highresolution structural studies of the P317R variant could offer valuable insight into the observed NODD selectivity defect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. While solving the structure of PHD2 P317R in complex with NODD is beyond the scope of this manuscript, a crystal structure of PHD2 P317R in complex with an inhibitor has been solved and insights from this structure have been added to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, a brief clarification or discussion of the limitations of the luciferase reporter assay-especially in the context of aggregation-prone mutants-would help readers better interpret the functional data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.
