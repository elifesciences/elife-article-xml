Most GWAS hits are located in cis-regulatory regions, but the underlying causal variants and their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To better understand human <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation, we mapped quantitative trait loci for chromatin accessibility (caQTLs)—a key step in cis-regulation—in 1000 individuals from 10 diverse populations. Most caQTLs were shared across populations, allowing us to leverage the genetic diversity to fine-map candidate causal regulatory variants, several thousand of which have been previously implicated in GWAS. In addition, many caQTLs that affect the expression of distal genes also alter the landscape of long-range chromosomal interactions, suggesting a mechanism for long-range expression QTLs. In sum, our results show that molecular QTL mapping integrated across diverse populations provides a high-resolution view of how worldwide human genetic variation affects chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and phenotype.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Indeed, these studies have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with hundreds of human diseases and other traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eicher et al., 2015</xref>). However, the vast majority of causal variants that drive the associations remain unknown, since GWAS resolution is limited by the correlations between nearby variants known as linkage disequilibrium (LD). Pinpointing causal variants is essential not only for accurately predicting disease risk, but also for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Increasing GWAS sample size or genotyping density can improve resolution, but even the largest studies have yielded only a few dozen causal variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To achieve high mapping resolution, an alternative to increasing sample size within a single population is trans-ethnic fine-mapping, in which a GWAS is performed across multiple populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van de Bunt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asimit et al., 2016</xref>). Shared causal variants should be consistently associated with a trait across populations, while tag SNPs—those associated only because of their LD with a causal variant—may only be associated in a subset of populations, due to differing LD structures. This approach is especially effective when combining populations with disparate LD patterns, such as Europeans and Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asimit et al., 2016</xref>). However, most GWAS have been restricted to European cohorts, limiting not only their mapping resolution, but also their ability to predict disease risk in non-European individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hindorff et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another approach to understanding molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits has been to intersect GWAS hits with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits, which provide an effective ‘stepping stone’ on the path from genotype to disease. QTLs involved in cis-regulation are especially informative, since the vast majority of GWAS hits are in noncoding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hindorff et al., 2009</xref>). For example, QTLs for mRNA levels (eQTLs) are enriched for SNPs implicated by GWAS in a wide range of diseases, suggesting specific genes as likely mediators of the associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lappalainen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). Similar enrichments have been reported for QTLs affecting mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser and Xie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>), transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waszak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>), and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumasaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gate et al., 2018</xref>). However, nearly all of these molecular-level QTL studies have been limited to a single population (most often either Europeans or Yorubans), thus limiting their utility for understanding worldwide human diversity—similar to the bias of GWAS for Europeans. Yet there is a great deal we could learn about the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity from performing trans-ethnic fine-mapping on molecular-level QTLs.</p><p>We recently developed an efficient approach for mapping molecular QTLs in which samples are pooled prior to sequencing. This pooling minimizes experimental variability between samples (both within and between experimental ‘batches’), reducing the cost and effort of QTL mapping by over 25-fold compared to standard unpooled approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>). However, our initial study suffered from the same limitations as most other molecular QTL studies: it involved a small cohort (60 individuals) from a single population. We reasoned that the efficiency of pooling could enable us to map <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory QTLs with far greater numbers of individuals and populations than would otherwise be possible, allowing us to perform trans-ethnic fine-mapping to pinpoint thousands of likely causal variants affecting <italic>cis</italic>-regulation and, in many cases, complex disease risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pooled QTL mapping of variants affecting chromatin accessibility</title><p>We applied pooled QTL mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>) to chromatin accessibility (CA), a reliable indicator of local <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity, as measured by the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). In this approach, many samples are combined into a single pool, in which ATAC-seq (or another assay of interest) is performed only once. Genetic variants that affect CA in cis will cause the more accessible allele to increase in frequency after ATAC compared to before, whereas variants with no effect on accessibility will have no significant change in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each SNP, we estimated the post-ATAC allele frequency from read counts of each allele present in the ATAC-seq reads and used a regression-based approach to estimate pre-ATAC allele frequency; the significance of the difference between these two frequencies is our caQTL p-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39595.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline and results of pooled ATAC-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Performing ATAC-seq in a pool of individuals selects DNA molecules with higher CA, thus enriching for more accessible alleles.

We combined 66–112 unrelated individuals from each population into one pool per population, and performed ATAC-seq with two biological replicates per population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in a total of ~808 million informative autosomal reads from 20 pools. All populations showed a high correlation between pre-ATAC and post-ATAC allele frequencies (average Pearson r = 0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected if most SNPs do not affect CA and thus have similar pre- and post-ATAC frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>). At a nominal p&lt;5×10<sup>−4</sup>—corresponding to an irreproducible discovery rate (IDR, analogous to a false discovery rate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) of ~1%—we mapped 13,657 to 26,182 independent caQTLs per population. This comprised 1.5–3.0% of all testable SNPs, defined as those with &gt;2% minor allele frequency (MAF) and covered by at least 20 reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). A total of 126,773 caQTLs were significant in at least one population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Accuracy and efficiency of pooled QTL mapping</title><p>To gauge the accuracy of our caQTLs, we compared them with previously mapped QTLs. DNase-seq is another method used to assay chromatin accessibility, and SNPs affecting DNase read density—known as dsQTLs—have been mapped using 70 individual (non-pooled) Yoruban LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degner et al., 2012</xref>). We compared our caQTLs to dsQTLs in three ways. First, testing the overlap between these two sets, we found a 33- to 76-fold enrichment of dsQTLs among caQTLs, with highest enrichment in the five African/African-American populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; enrichments for other QTLs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Second, we compared the quantitative effect sizes of caQTLs and dsQTLs, and found excellent agreement (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Third, we tested how the directionality agreement (whether caQTLs and dsQTLs call the same allele as more accessible) changes with the caQTL p-value, and found that agreement increased with more stringent cutoffs, reaching 96.7–98.1% agreement at caQTL p&lt;5×10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These three tests show that our caQTLs are consistent with dsQTLs mapped with unpooled samples.</p><p>Because accessible chromatin is more often bound by TFs, we also tested the directionality agreement between overlapping caQTLs and TF binding QTLs (bQTLs) aggregated for five TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>), since we expect increased TF binding to be associated with increased CA. Once again, we found that the agreement increases with more stringent p-value cutoffs, reaching 97.3–98.9% agreement at caQTL p&lt;5×10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This high level of agreement suggests a low rate of false positive caQTLs, consistent with our estimated 1% IDR.</p><p>To assess the efficiency of our pooling approach, we compared our results with caQTLs mapped with RASQUAL—a computational QTL mapping approach that accounts for many possible confounding variables—in non-pooled European LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumasaka et al., 2016</xref>). At a matched cutoff in our CEU population, we mapped 2.8-fold more caQTLs with 15-fold fewer reads and 12-fold fewer ATAC-seq libraries—a ~ 40 fold improvement in cost per caQTL (see Supplemental Note). Overall, our comparisons with previously mapped QTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) suggest that pooling is an efficient strategy that agrees well with unpooled QTL mapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>caQTLs shared across populations</title><p>We next assessed the extent of caQTL sharing across populations. A caQTL might not be shared due to biological causes, such as dependence of a variant’s effect on the genetic background (epistasis), or due to trivial causes such as not meeting our 20 read cutoff in one population. To exclude trivial cases we focused on 142,049 variants that were testable in all ten populations. Among these, we observed a clear trend for increased sharing within continents: the mean fraction of shared caQTLs was 59.9% within Africans and 59.8% within Europeans, compared to 48.4% between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The Han Chinese (CHB) caQTLs were shared moderately with Europeans (52.4%) and less well with Africans (47.7%), reflecting their closer relatedness to Europeans. In addition, African-American (ASW) caQTLs showed greater sharing with all five European/Han populations than any of the four African populations did, consistent with their admixed ancestry. Restricting the analysis to caQTLs with similar allele frequencies across populations led to a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The concordance between caQTL sharing and known phylogenetic relationships suggests that some caQTLs may have population-specific effects, as has also been observed for other types of molecular QTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stranger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>), though the biological mechanisms underlying this divergence will require further study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39595.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fine-mapping shared caQTLs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing the overlap in caQTLs for every pair of populations (only for variants that were testable in all ten).

We hypothesize that mutations affecting accessibility near TSSs are more likely to be deleterious, and thus selected against, resulting in the observed depletion. This 8.7-fold depletion near TSSs is greater than the analogous depletion of nonsynonymous changes in exons; in fact, we estimated that that these caQTLs are ~81% more likely to be deleterious, and removed by selection, than nonsynonymous mutations (see Supplemental Note).

Although most GWAS loci include dozens of potential causal variants in LD, there are only ~2.2 caQTLs per GWAS locus, providing a far smaller credible set for targeted follow-up studies.

The resulting collection of over 100,000 caQTLs allowed us to refine our understanding of the sequence-level causes, as well as the phenotypic consequences, of natural variation in chromatin accessibility.</p><p>More generally, our results show that molecular QTL mapping and trans-ethnic fine-mapping are complementary in several respects. Molecular QTL mapping provides information about molecular mechanisms and allelic effect direction, while including multiple populations allows for fine-mapping of causal variants; combined, these can provide unprecedented insights into the genetic basis of human variation. Moreover, since variation in molecular-level traits such as CA can be mapped to over 10<sup>5</sup> QTLs, they provide tremendous opportunities for fine-mapping regulatory variants throughout the genome, which can then inform follow-up studies for diseases or other traits where trans-ethnic fine-mapping may not be feasible (e.g. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We expect that future studies will greatly benefit from this combination, and that the ease of pooled QTL mapping will facilitate the adoption of this integrated approach.</p><p>As a first step towards understanding how caQTLs impact phenotypes, we have explored their effects on local and distal transcriptional regulation. This strategy is conceptually similar to experiments involving genome editing of specific regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>), except that we are utilizing natural genetic variation as our source of perturbations; this allows us to examine many more variants, though we are restricted to those that are not strongly deleterious (since these are too rare for us to observe). Our results suggest that TF binding affects long-range chromosomal interactions via its effect on CA, and that CA affects transcription of distal genes via its effect on long-range chromosomal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This latter inference is especially intriguing, since it suggests a molecular mechanism underlying distal eQTLs: variants alter enhancer activities, which in turn alter the physical interactions of enhancers with distal genes. To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence that variation in the landscape of chromosomal interactions underlies long-range genetic effects on transcription.</p><p>There are several important limitations to our study. First, we have yet to map the majority of human caQTL variants—for example those specific to other cell types, those that affect CA of distal loci (in trans or long-range <italic>cis</italic>), or those involving rare variants or small effect sizes. Second, our shared caQTLs should be regarded only as candidate causal variants to guide future experiments, similar to other statistically fine-mapped associations. Third, our fine-mapping approach is distinct from typical GWAS fine-mapping where many variants in a locus are genotyped in a large cohort; our pooled approach can only map caQTLs that are covered by ATAC-seq reads. Within these regions of open chromatin, our approach genotypes essentially all common variants, but variants outside these regions are not covered. Despite this limitation, our increased efficiency resulted in over 10-fold more caQTLs than previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumasaka et al., 2016</xref>). Fourth, like all forms of trans-ethnic fine-mapping, our method will only work when a variant is present at an appreciable frequency, and affects the same trait, across multiple populations. And finally, much work remains to understand how the caQTLs we have mapped affect human phenotypes.</p><p>Looking ahead, we expect that combining GWAS with pooled QTLs mapped in diverse populations and cell types will be an efficient and highly effective strategy for identifying causal variants and their molecular mechanisms of action, two major bottlenecks in bridging the gap between GWAS and disease etiologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture conditions</title><p>Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from unrelated individuals were obtained from the Coriell Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coriell.org">http://www.coriell.org</ext-link>).

This uses post-ATAC allele frequencies together with individual sample genotypes to infer pre-ATAC allele frequencies.</p><p>To estimate pre-ATAC allele frequencies, the pre-ATAC pool could be sequenced; however this suffers from two major drawbacks. First, although sequencing the pre-ATAC pool could yield accurate pre-ATAC allele frequencies, it cannot account for genome-wide differences between samples such as the total amount of open chromatin. If one sample has more open chromatin than another, its alleles will be over-represented in the post-ATAC fraction. This will constitute a source of noise in our analysis, since our goal is to map <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation affecting individual sites. Second, sequencing the pre-ATAC pool would require very deep sequencing to achieve accurate allele frequency estimates at each potential caQTL SNP, since the sequencing would not be restricted to SNPs in open chromatin regions (as they are for the ATAC fraction).</p><p>Therefore, we previously developed an alternative which does not require any additional sequencing, and does account for genome-wide differences between samples. Our regression-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>) uses the post-ATAC frequencies together with genotypes of each sample to infer the proportion of each sample in the pool. These proportions will be weighted by any genome-wide differences, since these will be naturally incorporated into the post-ATAC frequencies used as input to the regression. In this way, our pre-ATAC allele frequencies already account for some types of <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation, increasing our power for mapping <italic>cis</italic>-acting differences.</p><p>In the regression, our goal is to estimate the pooling weights (i.e. fraction of each individual in the pool, accounting for global <italic>trans</italic>-acting differences between samples).

Here we expect to see 5 reads with the minor allele. Since the alternative hypothesis is two-sided (we do not know which allele will increase post-ATAC), being less likely means being further away from 5.

Because most GWAS hits are in strong LD with other variants, many of the caQTLs that overlap GWAS hits may not be causal SNPs for the GWAS trait; we cannot apply published co-localization methods to quantify this, since these require association data across an entire locus or LD block for comparison, and our pooled approach is limited to SNPs covered by the ATAC-seq reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>IDR analysis</title><p>For IDR calculation, we used parameters similar to the ENCODE project (mu = 0.1, sigma = 1.0, rho = 0.2, p=0.5, eps = 10<sup>−6</sup>, max.ite = 3000). Since IDR does not allow tied p-values, we broke ties by adding a small random number (normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation 10<sup>−17</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Controlling for ATAC-seq read density</title><p>In Figure 3A we present the chromatin states of caQTLs compared to the genome as a whole. Much of the difference is driven by ATAC-seq read density; that is we would see strong enrichments for TSS and enhancers in any ATAC-seq experiment. To ask the more specific question of where caQTLs are enriched or depleted after controlling for read density, we selected non-caQTL variants matched for the number of reads to each shared caQTL, and then quantified the difference in chromatin state enrichments for shared caQTLs vs read-matched non-caQTLs. Details of read-matching are given in the 'Effects of caQTLs on DNA shape' section below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Effects of caQTLs on DNA shape</title><p>Since the shape of the DNA double helix is sequence-dependent, and can affect interactions with TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>), we tested whether shared caQTL variants tend to cause larger changes in DNA shape than non-caQTLs. To compare caQTLs vs non-caQTLs, we defined a non-caQTL as a variant with caQTL p=1 and at least 20 ATAC-seq reads. We first computed the total read depth for each shared caQTL and non-caQTL across all populations. We then created a read-matched set of shared caQTLs and non-caQTLs in the following way: For each shared caQTL, we identified a unique non-caQTL where | log<sub>2</sub>(shared caQTL reads) - log<sub>2</sub>(non-caQTL reads) |&lt;0.5. If no such non-caQTL existed, we eliminated the shared caQTL. We were able to find unique read-matched non-caQTLs for 11,416 of the shared caQTLs.</p><p>After identifying read-matched shared caQTLs and non-caQTLs, we used BEDTools version 2.26.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) to extract the genome sequence at each variant ±5 bp. For each shared caQTL, we created four sequences – one with the open allele ±5 bp, one with the closed allele ±5 bp, one with the read-matched non-caQTL reference allele ±5 bp, and one with the read-matched non-caQTL alternate allele ±5 bp. We then used DNAshapeR version 1.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>) to estimate the minor groove width (MGW), propeller twist (ProT), Roll, and helix twist (HelT) for each of the sequences for each shared caQTL. We computed the difference in each shape parameter between the sequences for the open and closed caQTL alleles as well as between alleles for the read-matched non-caQTLs, where the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ alleles were randomly selected. To compute whether the shared caQTLs have a stronger association with DNA shape than the read-matched non-caQTLs, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the two difference distributions at the position of the variant. Since Roll and HelT shapes are computed in groups of two nucleotides, we concatenated the difference distributions for the two windows of 2 bp that overlap the variant. We multiplied each p-value by four as a Bonferroni correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Supplementary Text</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Assessing caQTL reproducibility with IDR</title><p>A standard approach for estimating an FDR in association studies is to randomize the data, for example randomly pairing one sample’s genotypes with another sample’s ATAC-seq data, and then recalculate the associations to gauge the extent of false positives. Since our approach does not have separate data for each individual, such randomization is not possible, and thus we cannot estimate an FDR for our caQTLs using standard approaches. However, we can apply a related method known as the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR), developed as part of the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) to assess the statistical reproducibility of our caQTL p-values. To measure this, we calculated caQTL p-values separately for each biological replicate of two populations, ASW and CEU. The IDR estimates the fraction of data points that are not reproducible at any given p-value cutoff. For a range of potential cutoffs, we observed a similar trend in both populations: at p=5×10<sup>−3</sup> we observed IDR ≈ 0.03, and p=5×10<sup>−4</sup> corresponds to IDR ≈ 0.01 (dashed red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These numbers are consistent with other results suggesting a low FDR among our caQTLs, such as their ~ 97–99% agreement with dsQTL and bQTL directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Comparison to non-pooled chromatin accessibility studies</title><p>In our comparison with RASQUAL caQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumasaka et al., 2016</xref>), we first sought to identify a matched significance cutoff. Among their 2707 caQTLs (FDR = 10%), 3.5% were previously identified as dsQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degner et al., 2012</xref>) (the most closely matched type of QTL available for comparison). This 3.5% overlap between two previous studies of chromatin accessibility QTLs may seem low, but likely results from differences in experimental methods (ATAC-seq vs DNase-seq), analysis methods, and populations, as well as incomplete power. In CEU, our population most closely matched to the British (GBR) population used for RASQUAL, we found that our top 7587 caQTLs (p&lt;3×10<sup>−6</sup>) yielded the same overlap of 3.5% dsQTLs. Our approach does not involve calling CA peaks, but in a separate analysis we estimated that &lt;20% of our caQTLs fall into the same peak as another caQTL, so removing these would not have a major effect on the results.</p><p>In addition to the RASQUAL comparison, we also compared our caQTLs to variants associated with allelic imbalance of chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, 493 samples from 166 individuals were profiled with a total of 2.6 × 10<sup>10</sup> DNase-seq reads. At the most stringent cutoff (FDR = 0), they called 2420 imbalanced SNPs, 2.1% of which were also dsQTLs. Comparing this to our study, our top 16,990 CEU caQTLs (p&lt;3.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) had the same 2.1% enrichment. Therefore we mapped 7-fold more caQTLs from 246-fold fewer libraries and 443-fold fewer reads, though their inclusion of diverse tissues likely decreased the overlap with dsQTLs from LCLs.</p><p>We note that dsQTLs are not the only possible benchmark we could use to select caQTL lists of equal quality across studies. When using CTCF bQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2014</xref>) instead, our estimated improvement in cost per QTL was even greater than when using dsQTLs, due to the high enrichment of CTCF bQTLs in our data (~190 fold in our CEU caQTLs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>], compared to ~7 fold in RASQUAL caQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumasaka et al., 2016</xref>) and 4.5-fold in the imbalanced DNase-seq SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-3"><title>Comparing selection against caQTLs and nonsynonymous variants</title><p>If this depletion of caQTLs near TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is due to selection against deleterious effects of these caQTLs, then we can compare this with human Ka/Ks ratios, which reflect the depletion of nonsynonymous changes in protein-coding regions. Across all human genes, Ka/Ks since divergence with chimpanzee was estimated as 0.208 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005</xref>), implying ~4.8 fold depletion for nonsynonymous changes. Therefore we observed 8.7/4.8 = 1.81 fold (i.e. 81%) greater depletion for the caQTLs. This comparison is only an approximation, since it ignores effects of positive selection, as well as the possibility that caQTLs are depleted near TSSs for reasons other than selection (e.g. CA having greater robustness to mutations near TSSs). We also note that if there is any negative selection against TSS-proximal SNPs that are not caQTLs then the 1.81-fold difference will be an underestimate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-4"><title>Causality of joint bQTLs/caQTLs affecting long-range chromosomal interactions</title><p>In addition to CTCF, we previously reported an association between long-range chromosomal interactions and binding of five additional TFs in LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehranchi et al., 2016</xref>). However, in that work we did not explore the mechanism by which this occurs or the direction of causality: it could be that TF binding impacts long-range interactions, though other causal scenarios are also possible. For example, joint bQTLs/caQTLs could be cases where a variant first affects TF binding and then CA as a result; or the variant’s direct effect could be on CA, which then changes the local landscape of TF binding; or there may be independent effects on TF binding and CA that are not causally linked (either via two distinct causal variants in linkage disequilibrium, or one variant with independent effects on TF binding and CA). In general, the strong enrichment for overlap between caQTLs and bQTLs suggests that causal independence is rare at these joint QTLs, since under such a model one would not expect to see either strong enrichment for overlap, or the nearly perfect concordance in directionality that we observed (~98–99%). In most cases we cannot distinguish between the first two scenarios, that is whether the TF binding or CA effect ‘comes first’; however in cases where a joint bQTL/caQTL disrupts a known TF binding motif, then we can infer that its primary effect is likely to be on TF binding to DNA, and thus any other effects—on CA or other traits—are likely to be downstream consequences of this.</p><p>We used this logic to ask whether TF binding affects long-range chromosomal interactions, by restricting our test for long-range interactions only to those caQTLs that disrupt a known TF binding motif and are present within a DNase hypersensitive footprint indicative of TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurano et al., 2015</xref>); these caQTLs are most likely caused by the SNP’s direct effect on TF binding having a subsequent effect on CA. For these caQTLs, we observed a statistically indistinguishable enrichment for the more accessible allele having more interactions (63/24 = 2.6 fold), indicating that disruptions of TF binding lead to changes in both CA and long-range chromosomal interactions. We therefore show TF binding upstream of CA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, though the reverse causality could also occur in some cases.</p><p>We could not test the possibility that some other variants may have a primary effect on CA and secondary effects on TF binding, since we cannot determine which caQTLs are not bQTLs for any TF, given the limited amount of bQTL information available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-5"><title>Regulatory effects of caQTLs across tissues</title><p>To explore the effects of caQTLs on gene expression across tissues, we intersected our caQTLs with eQTLs mapped in a meta-analysis across 44 tissues/cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). Each eQTL was assigned a posterior probability of being active in each tissue, and following the GTEx authors, we required p&gt;0.9 (i.e. 90% probability) to call an eQTL as likely active in a given tissue. Overall, the median number of tissues per eQTL was 19 out of 44. In contrast, among 2833 caQTLs that were also eQTLs, the median number of active tissues was 25/44 (Wilcoxon p=4×10<sup>−21</sup>). This implies that the underlying caQTL effects are probably shared across most tissues as well, with 25/44 being a likely underestimate of the extent of tissue sharing, since caQTLs present in a tissue do not necessarily act as eQTLs (as we have seen for LCLs).</p><p>We then asked in what tissues/cell types were our caQTLs most likely to affect gene expression. To measure this, we calculated the ratio of [fraction of joint eQTL and caQTL with posterior p&gt;0.9 in tissue X] / [fraction of all eQTLs with posterior p&gt;0.9 in tissue X]; values greater than one indicate that the joint eQTL and caQTLs are more likely to affect expression in tissue X than are eQTLs overall (this accounts for differences in numbers of eQTLs per tissue, which is largely driven by sample sizes). All 44 tissues had values &gt; 1.06, with two clear outliers, LCLs and whole blood, having the highest chance of caQTLs affecting expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>); this is not surprising because LCLs were used in our study and whole blood is the most similar tissue to LCLs in this dataset. At the other extreme, the ten sampled brain regions and testes had the 11 lowest ratios, indicating that caQTLs active in LCLs are slightly less likely to affect gene expression in these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-6"><title>caQTLs in one cell type can underlie eQTLs specific to other cell types/conditions</title><p>Our multi-tissue analysis above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) suggested that caQTLs from LCLs can be informative about transcriptional regulation in other cell types. We hypothesized that even in cases where a caQTL is not an eQTL in LCLs, if the effect on CA is preserved across other cell types or conditions, then a change in the expression of a trans-acting factor could cause a constitutive caQTL to be a condition-specific eQTL. Indeed, in our multi-tissue analysis, we observed 200 caQTLs that had a posterior p&lt;0.1 of being an eQTL in LCLs, but nevertheless were called as likely eQTLs (p&gt;0.9) in an average of 11.4 other tissues. We have also come across several examples of this outside of the GTEx data, and highlight two of these below.</p><p>A previous study identified a SNP, rs9806699, that acts as an eQTL for <italic>GATM</italic> in LCLs only after exposure to the statin drug simvastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangravite et al., 2013</xref>). This SNP was also associated with statin-induced myopathy in two cohorts, though the molecular mechanism underlying this condition-specific eQTL was not investigated. We found that this same SNP is also a caQTL in the GWD population (p=6.3×10<sup>−5</sup>), which may underlie its statin-dependent transcriptional response.</p><p>Another example is a caQTL that is one of five linked variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis, all in strong LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.95) and with similar GWAS p-values (1.3 × 10<sup>−7</sup> &lt; p&lt;3.1×10<sup>−7</sup>) that preclude fine-mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farh et al., 2015</xref>).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a novel approach for the identification of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) on the basis of ATAC-seq data obtained from pooled sequencing in LCLs from thousands of individuals across 10 population groups. The results of these analyses are used to assess allelic effects on chromatin across populations, and demonstrate that chromatin accessibility is associated with transcription factor binding, long-range chromatin interactions and gene expression. The authors then propose the use of variants with shared allelic effects on chromatin across populations as an approach to prioritise causal variants for complex traits at loci identified through GWAS. Both reviewers highlighted the novelty and importance of the study in understanding how genetic variation impacts on complex traits via chromatin accessibility across population groups.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The reviewers expressed concerns over the interpretation of the results of the fine-mapping analyses. To comprehensively fine-map a GWAS locus, the effect of all (or most) variants on a trait are assessed, but the approach can only consider variants with sufficient ATAC-seq read depth. It is also assumed that causal variants will have shared allelic effects on chromatin across populations. This does not allow for potential allele frequency differences between populations which might impact on power to detect allelic imbalance in each population. Whilst the approach can be used to prioritise potential causal variants, it is not &quot;fine-mapping&quot; in the traditional sense, and the authors should consider these limitations in the interpretation of their results.</p><p>The reviewers also felt that some further discussion of the potential limitations of the approach, and the impact on the interpretation of their findings, would be warranted, including the ability to only detect caQTLs that affect their own read counts, the reliability of estimation of pre-ATAC/ChIP allele frequencies and potential mapping bias of Hi-C reads.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Tehranchi et al. describes the generation of ATAC-seq data in LCLs from a thousand individuals across 10 populations using a pooled approach and then mapping allelic effects in pooled data from each population. The authors then use these results to describe relationships in allelic effects on chromatin across populations, identify variants with shared effects across populations, compare allelic effects to other molecular trait data, and use these variants to prioritize fine-mapped GWAS variants. In total this study and findings are both an important resource and provide a conceptual advance in our understanding of how population genetic variation affects chromatin accessibility and role in complex traits and disease.</p><p>The authors describe their approach of prioritizing variants with significant allelic effects across populations as fine-mapping causal variants, which I think is not entirely accurate. The premise of fine-mapping is that most/all variants on in a region are evaluated for their effects on a trait; given that the authors are only able to map the subset of variants with sufficient ATAC-seq read depth there may be causal variants that, for example, map in a different site and affect chromatin accessibility across an entire region, map in the same site but on the edge and have low read depth, or map outside of a site entirely. While presumably the majority of variants with shared allelic effects are likely directly responsible for their imbalance, there are likely also variants where this isn't the case.</p><p>Furthermore, assuming that only variants with shared effects across populations are causal for a trait also does not consider that (a) some trait/disease signals have population-specific effects and (b) allele frequency differences across populations might prohibit mapping allelic imbalance in all populations and lead to the assumption that the effects are population-specific. In terms of mapping causal variants at disease signals then, this approach would work well if the signal is shared across populations with consistent frequency, but if it is population-specific or has allelic heterogeneity then this approach might not be as applicable.</p><p>It would help the study for the authors to be more explicit about these limitations, and re-frame the description of the results to clarify that they aren't fine-mapping causal variants in a classic sense but rather identifying a specific set of variants with shared effects across populations that are extremely useful in interpreting fine-mapped disease signals which are shared across populations.</p><p>For the GWAS examples it would be extremely useful to readers I think to see plots of the regions including the data described for each example, which I couldn't find (maybe I missed them). For the second example, it would be useful to further see the LD patterns across populations to demonstrate that rs479844 is associated with Europeans but not in other populations presumably due to differences in LD with rs10791824.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) When comparing the percentage of variants with allelic effects shared across populations, presumably they considered a variant shared across two populations if it had significant effects in both? If so it would be informative to estimate how many variants were also likely shared but didn't reach significance for example by estimating concordance in effects.</p><p>2) It would be interesting to determine whether variants with shared allelic effects tended to have higher causal probabilities from genetic fine-mapping than other classes of variants to provide further support for their causality.</p><p>3) The statement &quot;An alternative to increasing sample size within a single population is trans-ethnic fine-mapping, in which a GWAS is performed across multiple populations&quot; is confusing and could be clarified.</p><p>4) I think purists might quibble with the use of QTL to describe allelic imbalance mapping, and could also potentially cause confusion to readers not overly familiar with this field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In Tehranchi et al., 2018, the authors present a novel use of pooled sequencing applied to the identification of QTLs altering chromatin accesibility (caQTLs) by ATAC-seq.

We have added the following to clarify this in the Discussion: “our fine-mapping approach is distinct from typical GWAS fine-mapping where every variant in a locus is genotyped in a large cohort, and like all forms of trans-ethnic fine-mapping, our method will only work when a variant is present at an appreciable frequency, and affects the same trait, across multiple populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the GWAS examples it would be extremely useful to readers I think to see plots of the regions including the data described for each example, which I couldn't find (maybe I missed them).

We were not able to plot the third example, since only SNPs with &gt;2.75% causal probability were reported, and 58 of the 62 SNPs in this LD block were below this cutoff.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) When comparing the percentage of variants with allelic effects shared across populations, presumably they considered a variant shared across two populations if it had significant effects in both? If so it would be informative to estimate how many variants were also likely shared but didn't reach significance for example by estimating concordance in effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Our method for combining signal across populations was based on Fisher’s combined p-values, which does not actually require significance in each individual population. Instead, the test estimates a single p-value representing the chance of observing all of the given p-values (in this case representing distinct populations) under the null of uniformly distributed p-values. For example, in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, we show a shared caQTL (rs79979970) that is individually significant in only one population (CHB) out of eight tested, but reaches a shared caQTL p =5.6x10-7 because it has p &lt; 0.1 in an additional four populations. We have provided further details and an equation for this method in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be interesting to determine whether variants with shared allelic effects tended to have higher causal probabilities from genetic fine-mapping than other classes of variants to provide further support for their causality.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, and have conducted this analysis. We added the following paragraph to our Results section: “In addition to revealing insights into transcriptional regulation, caQTLs also provide a means to explore genotype/phenotype associations by identifying likely causal variants and their molecular mechanisms of action. To compare our fine-mapping approach with standard GWAS fine-mapping, we asked whether our shared caQTLs were more likely to be assigned a high probability of being causal for disease risk (Farh et al., 2015). We found that for several autoimmune diseases—the class of disease most directly relevant to LCLs—shared caQTLs were highly enriched for likely causal variants (e.g. for Crohn’s disease, mean causal probability for shared caQTLs was 2.4-fold higher than for non-caQTLs, p = 0.002; for ankylosing spondylitis, mean causal probability for shared caQTLs was 2.6-fold higher, p = 0.001). However for most diseases, the number of overlaps between these two data sets was too small to conduct a meaningful test. Together with other evidence of the efficacy of our finemapping approach (Figure 2C), this suggests that our shared caQTLs are an effective means of resolving likely causal cis-regulatory variants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The statement &quot;An alternative to increasing sample size within a single population is trans-ethnic fine-mapping, in which a GWAS is performed across multiple populations&quot; is confusing and could be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this: “To achieve high mapping resolution, an alternative to increasing sample size within a single population is trans-ethnic fine-mapping, in which a GWAS is performed across multiple populations”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think purists might quibble with the use of QTL to describe allelic imbalance mapping, and could also potentially cause confusion to readers not overly familiar with this field.</p></disp-quote><p>The term “QTL” is used in many different ways, which we agree can be confusing. We chose to use the definition of QTL given by the Complex Trait Consortium (Nat Rev Gen 2003): A genetic locus whose alleles affect variation in a quantitative trait. By this definition, our caQTLs are indeed QTLs for chromatin accessibility.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Tehranchi et al., 2018, the authors present a novel use of pooled sequencing applied to the identification of QTLs altering chromatin accesibility (caQTLs) by ATAC-seq.

However, there are several concerns:</p><p>1) caQTLs can only be detected if they affect their own read counts. Is this a major limitation of the method given the findings of previous studies? This should be addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the Discussion: “There are several important limitations to our study. First, we have yet to map the majority of human caQTL variants—e.g. those specific to other cell types, those that affect CA of distal loci (in <italic>trans</italic> or long-range <italic>cis</italic>), or those involving rare variants or small effect sizes. In particular, our pooled approach can only map caQTLs that are covered by ATAC-seq reads; despite this limitation, our increased efficiency resulted in over 10- fold more caQTLs than previous studies (Degner et al., 2012, Kumasaka et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do caQTLs show different allele frequencies across genomic annotations (e.g. active TSS vs enhancers vs repressed regions, etc)? Does this contradict or support hypotheses of negative selection on caQTLs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this idea, and found that caQTLs near TSSs do indeed have lower minor allele frequencies than other caQTLs, as expected if they are under stronger purifying selection. We have added this to the Results: “…we also found that caQTLs near active TSSs have lower minor allele frequencies than elsewhere in the genome (median MAF = 0.17 for active TSS regions and 0.18 for flanking active TSS regions, compared to 0.21 for caQTLs elsewhere; Wilcoxon p = 1.5x10-28 and 8x10-6 respectively).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Have the authors validated, in this or previous work, that they are able to reliably estimate the pre-ATAC/ChIP allele frequencies using their regression approach?</p></disp-quote><p>When originally developing the method (Tehranchi et al., Cell 2016), we performed simulations of a wide range of pool sizes and variant allele frquencies, and verified that the pre-ATAC/ChIP allele frequencies are accurately estimated by our method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the &quot;Long-range interaction analysis,&quot; is potential mapping-bias of Hi-C reads taken into account by the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that for many applications of Hi-C data, mapping bias can be an important confounder. However, because we are using allele-specific read counts for this analysis, any bias that affects the mapping of both alleles will decrease the signal and make our results conservative. In order for a bias to cause a false positive signal, the more open alleles (with higher ATAC-seq read depth) would have to have a systematic bias towards having read pairs that falsely map at a greater distance than the closed alleles. We cannot imagine a plausible scenario where this could be the case. Nevertheless, we have used allele-specific inter-chromosomal read pairs from the same Hi-C data set as a control to test for any bias in our method, and did not observe any (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Introduction section: while most GWAS variants are not in LD with coding variants or may be in LD with variants in regulatory regions, most genome-wide significant variants from GWAS aren't actually in regulatory regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this from “regulatory” to “noncoding”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In &quot;Characterizing fine-mapped eQTLs,&quot; the source data of the chromatin states (Ernst and Kellis, 2012) is present in the figure legend but is absent in the text and methods; adding a citation to one of these would be helpful</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As a minor stylistic concern, chromHMM tracks have a standard color palette (e.g. red corresponds to promoter/TSS, orange/yellow to enhancer, green to transcribed regions, etc.) and this reviewer would prefer its use for Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose an alternative color scheme for two reasons: we merged several annotations to simplify the figure, so there is no standard color for these merged annotations; and we chose colors to be discernable by readers who a red-green colorblind (for this reason we used green but not red in the figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear how read density was controlled for in subsection “Characterizing fine-mapped caQTLs”.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this omission. We have added this paragraph to the Materials and methods section: “In Figure 3A we present the chromatin states of caQTLs compared to the genome as a whole. Much of the difference is driven by ATAC-seq read density; i.e. we would see strong enrichments for TSS and enhancers in any ATAC-seq experiment. To ask the more specific question of where caQTLs are enriched or depleted after controlling for read density, we selected non-caQTL variants matched for the number of reads to each shared caQTL, and then quantified the difference in chromatin state enrichments for shared caQTLs vs read-matched non-caQTLs. Details of read-matching are given in the “Effects of caQTLs on DNA shape” section below.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The final paragraph of subsection “Characterizing fine-mapped caQTLs” references &quot;trinucleotide&quot; dependencies of CA variants but these are not mentioned in the text or Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted this sentence (which referred to an analysis that was removed from the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The figure legend for Figure 4 mentions using &quot;allele-specific 3D chromosomal interaction&quot; data; does this mean only heterozygous sites were considered?

We have added this to the Materials and methods section: “To obtain Figure 4A-B, we restricted the analysis to shared caQTLs (Fisher’s combined p &lt; 5x10-6) with consistent directionality in a majority of the populations tested, and counted the number of Hi-C reads connecting each caQTL allele with any distal locus (&gt;20 kb or &gt;100 kb away). In order to use only allele-specific Hi-C reads, we restricted the analysis to read pairs where at least one read overlaps a heterozygous variant in the GM12878 cell line (as described in Rao et al., 2014). We then determined the number of caQTLs where the more accessible allele had significantly more Hi-C contacts (using a binomial test of allele-specific read counts), compared to the number where the less accessible allele was more interactive.

Since our approach is based on deep sequencing, the genotyping density in our study is actually higher within our regions of interest (specifically, the ATAC-seq peaks) than the genotyping density of fine-mapping microarrays in their regions of interest.</p><p>In addition, the definition of fine-mapping was recently given as “To refine the genomic localization of causal variants by the use of statistical, bioinformatic or functional methods.” [Schaid et al., Nature Reviews Genetics 19:491–504 (2018)] Our approach certainly fits this definition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Remove the term &quot;fine-mapping&quot; from the title of the manuscript – this could be replaced by &quot;determining&quot; or &quot;localising&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the reasons described above, we have elected to retain the term “fine-mapping”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide further discussion of the limitation of the approach to localising causal variants. In particular, please include discussion to address the following comment from the initial review of your manuscript:</p><p>&quot;The authors describe their approach of prioritizing variants with significant allelic effects across populations as fine-mapping causal variants, which I think is not entirely accurate. The premise of fine-mapping is that most/all variants on in a region are evaluated for their effects on a trait; given that the authors are only able to map the subset of variants with sufficient ATAC-seq read depth there may be causal variants that, for example, map in a different site and affect chromatin accessibility across an entire region, map in the same site but on the edge and have low read depth, or map outside of a site entirely. While presumably the majority of variants with shared allelic effects are likely directly responsible for their imbalance, there are likely also variants where this isn't the case.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this caveat in the Discussion: “Third, our fine-mapping approach is distinct from typical GWAS fine-mapping where many variants in a locus are genotyped in a large cohort; our pooled approach can only map caQTLs that are covered by ATAC-seq reads. Within these regions of open chromatin, our approach genotypes essentially all common variants, but variants outside these regions are not covered.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
