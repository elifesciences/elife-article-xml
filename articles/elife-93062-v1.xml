Through the history of evolutionary developmental biology, researchers have proposed that changes in the timing of traits during development can produce most morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">deBeer, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gould, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobreva et al., 2022</xref>). Though this theory has been further refined in the field since Haeckel first coined the term ‘heterochrony’ in development (1875), the timing of developmental changes remains a prominent mechanism of diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wray and McClay, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray and Raff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith, 2003</xref>). At the molecular level, changes in gene expression timing (<bold>heterochronic</bold> genes) or expression amount (<bold>heteromorphic</bold> genes) can underlie major morphological differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erwin and Davidson, 2002</xref>). However, these heterochronic shifts are usually investigated on a per-gene basis to reveal the extent that morphological change is achieved through gene expression perturbation (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobreva et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, the extent that heterochronic gene expression contributes to developmental differences at the molecular level has not been quantified. Therefore, the underlying regulatory changes that result in gene expression changes also remain elusive. In this study we quantify total gene expression over sequential developmental time to determine the extent that gene expression differences occur between divergent developmental and life-history modes. Furthermore, we use genetic crosses between the developmental morphs to quantify the mode of regulatory change that is responsible for these differences.</p><p>Changes in gene expression (heterochrony and heteromorphy) are now well established drivers of both interspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carroll, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fay and Wittkopp, 2008</xref>) and intraspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">López-Maury et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamann et al., 2021</xref>) differentiation. Knowing the extent that these biological processes are at play is fundamental to understanding developmental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gould, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raff and Wray, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaglia and Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carleton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Willink et al., 2020</xref>). While somewhat subtle differences in gene expression timing and amount can drive morphological changes, <italic>morph-specific</italic> genes – where genes are simply turned on or off, and possibly gained or lost in one lineage – are also possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilgers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luna and Chain, 2021</xref>). Despite the importance of these mechanisms for developmental and evolutionary change, long-standing questions in the field remain: What are the extents to which modifications of gene expression change developmental programs and morphological outcomes? What are the molecular factors that regulate these changes and how do they act?</p><p>One difficulty in determining the genetic basis of gene expression shifts is that it typically involves parsing developmental programs across divergent taxa, and therefore requires querying numerous genetic differences that could have arisen by either selection or drift over millions of years. Creating hybrids across divergent species presents its own difficulties. Here, we determine the extent that gene expression differences contribute to developmental divergence over small evolutionary timescales using a model with two developmental modes within a single species. We examine the prevailing prediction that heterochrony is the primary driver of morphological change and developmental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raff and Wray, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McNamara, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobreva et al., 2022</xref>). While numerous interspecific gene expression studies have assessed the occurrence of both heterochronic genes and morph-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmitz et al., 2020</xref>), no study has assessed the contributions of these mechanisms to producing differences in developmental processes. By using an intraspecific model of developmental divergence where genetic crosses are possible, we determine the architecture of regulatory differences that drive gene expression and ultimately life-history differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study system and embryology</title><p>We compare the gene expression over developmental time for two morphs of a marine annelid, <italic>Streblospio benedicti</italic>, which has an intraspecific developmental dimorphism. There are two distinct developmental morphs which differ in their egg size, embryological development time, larval ecology, and morphology. These are either obligately feeding <italic>planktotrophic</italic> (PP) larvae or non-feeding <italic>lecithotrophic</italic> (LL) larvae. Despite these developmental differences, as adults they are morphologically indistinguishable outside of some reproductive traits and occupy the same environmental niches. The larval traits are heritable, meaning the differences in development are genetic and not plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levin and Creed, 1986</xref>). The two morphs have been characterized extensively in terms of life-history and genetic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levin and Creed, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zakas and Rockman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zakas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, crosses between the morphs are viable with no obvious fitness effects, and these F<sub>1</sub> offspring can have intermediate larval traits compared to the parentals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levin and Creed, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>). Embryological differences between the two types (and thus egg sizes) have been briefly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCAIN, 2008</xref>) but here we detail the full time course of embryogenesis from the one-cell embryo through the larval phase in detail for both morphs, and present data from reciprocal F<sub>1</sub> crosses (PL or LP) between the morphs in both directions across the same developmental period.</p><p>Spiralian animals have a famously conserved pattern of embryological cleavage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>), so unsurprisingly we find the two morphs proceed through the same developmental stages despite starting from eggs of different sizes (8× volume difference). Despite the similarity in embryo morphology, there are some notable differences between the two morphs: the absolute time between each stage is shifted such that the LL embryos take longer to reach an equivalent larval stage, which is expected as larger, more yolky cells can take longer to divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCAIN, 2008</xref>). At the swimming larval stage there are some notable morphological and behavioral differences (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), notably the PP larvae are obligately feeding and have feeding structures, while the LL are not. While the embryological stages may not be morphologically different other than size, it is reasonable to expect that they could be expressing different genes or changing the relative timing of expression to produce the morphological and behavioral differences seen in the larvae.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Embryology and development of <italic>S. benedicti</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of early development of the two morphs.

Using the full dataset, the first two principal component analysis (PCA) show most of the variance in total gene expression is due to developmental stage and morph (PC1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected the LL individuals appear to transcriptionally fall behind the PP offspring at each morphologically defined, equivalent developmental stage. We expect this pattern as LL offspring develop more slowly to reach these first developmental stages but reach the juvenile stage more quickly in absolute time than PP offspring, which develop in the water column for a longer period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Only 36.2% of all expressed genes are significantly differentially expressed (DE) between PP and LL at any stage in this dataset. We find that early in development over a third of these DE genes are significantly different between the morphs, but these differences tend to be quite small in magnitude. At gastrulation the number of significant genes decreases to less than 5% of the total DE genes, however these remaining expression differences are much larger in magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It appears that the two morphs are more functionally distinct during early development, likely because of the different metabolic requirements imposed on them by the differences in maternal egg provisioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moran and McAlister, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harry and Zakas, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>We use our RNAseq time course dataset to quantify the extent that modifications to gene expression timing and amount contribute to developmental differences.

(These are heteromorphic genes and are significantly DE in at least one developmental stage, but do not have different profiles of expression between PP and LL.) Approximately half of these are assigned to clusters 2 and 5. Cluster 2, which shows a pattern of maternal transcript degradation with no subsequent zygotic expression, is likely to contain genes associated with embryogenesis that are shared by both morphs. Cluster 5 shows a pattern of largely post-gastrulation zygotic gene expression. Based on this pattern, these genes are likely to be associated with shared larval features. Although there are some late-appearing heteromorphic genes that are associated with discrete larval differences: ‘chitin catabolic processes’, for example, are overexpressed in PP at the swimming stage (when they grow swimming chaetae) and are lowly expressed in LL which do not make swimming chaetae (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we identified heterochronies, which we define as a gene that switches clusters – and therefore expression profiles – between PP and LL. There are 224 heterochronic genes, which is 29% of DE genes. As we reduced the complexity of the entire gene expression dataset into six clusters, some genes with similar profiles in both PP and LL were ultimately assigned to different clusters, generating a false positive. To ensure against these false positives, we filtered genes by Pearson correlation between sample means in PP and LL. Genes with a correlation r&gt;0.85 were not counted as heterochronic.</p><p>Heterochronies are a change in the gene expression profile depending on developmental morph, but how different are the patterns of heterochronic changes? Parsimoniously, we would expect most heterochronies to have a similar overall shape that is simply shifted by a stage or two (like a switch from cluster 1 to cluster 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Examining the six clusters above, it is obvious that some expression profiles have similar trajectories (clusters 5 and 6, for example, both show increasing expression post blastula), while others are essentially inverted expression patterns (clusters 1 and 4 for example). Clusters are ordered in a correlation heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) from early gene expression to late gene expression. We find that most genes that switch expression profiles between PP and LL do so between the most similar clusters, and thus are near the diagonal. But where we see opposite profiles, the trend is early expression in PP genes compared to LL (top left corner). This is expected given the delay in embryogenesis for LL compared to PP. That said, many genes are expressed earlier in LL compared to PP (bottom right orange triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) but most of these are relatively small shifts.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Magnitude of expression profile changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of switches between each cluster.

Notably, heterochronic genes which are shifted earlier in LL are enriched for many metabolic functions. The shift in expression of metabolic genes is consistent with the life-history and feeding differences between the larvae, and it may be that most of what is differentiating a PP and LL larvae is the onset of feeding and gut-related developmental programs.</p><p>Morph-specific genes, by definition, have no expression in one morph and cannot be assigned to a cluster. To quantify morph-specific genes we use a data-adaptive flag method (DAFS) to calculate expression thresholds for each sample, below which genes are not considered as expressed. Using this approach, we identify 195 genes (25.3% of DE genes) which are only expressed in one morph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We find considerably more P-specific genes (150 genes in PP vs 45 genes in LL), which tend to be expressed in later developmental stages. These include genes which code for proteins such as Fibropellin, Forkhead-box, Crumbs-like, Notch-2, and many zinc-finger proteins. While the function of these genes during development remains to be determined, it is possible that they maintain PP-specific larval traits.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Morph-specific gene expression by stage.</title><p>These genes are never expressed in the opposite morph, but may be expressed at one to six stages within a morph.

Morph-specific genes may be involved in very different functional processes than heterochronic genes in this system. GO enrichment tests for morph-specific genes expressed in PP found a few functions related to cell fate specification and signaling pathways (GO enrichment tests for biological process, p&lt;0.05; no significant functional enrichments for LL-specific genes), but a distinct lack of genes involved in metabolic processes. This is because metabolic pathways genes shifted earlier in the development of LL offspring are still required in both offspring morphs. But the morph-specific genes are not required for development and may be modified by different evolutionary mechanisms. These findings also imply that PP embryos require a few specific cell types to produce a PP larval form that are reduced or lost in LL.</p><p>Overall, we find that heteromorphic changes in expression accounts for most gene expression differences, which is expected as this is the smallest change in gene expression of the three categories. Gene expression need only be significantly different at one stage to fit this category, and such differences may not necessarily translate into biological differences in development. Morph-specific and heterochronic changes make up very similar proportions of the remaining differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This demonstrates that while true heterochronies are common, they are not the main driver of gene expression differences in development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Distribution of the 772 genes with differentiated expression between morphs.</title><p>Heteromorphy makes up nearly half of all differentiated genes, while heterochrony and morph-specific genes split the remainder nearly equally.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93062-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Gene expression of genetic crosses</title><p>Because we are using an intraspecific comparison, we can extend our analysis to understand the regulatory architecture behind these expression differences.

This is particularly useful to disentangle maternal effects, as both F<sub>1</sub>s (PL and LP; mother’s genotype is listed first) are heterozygotes, but they originate from different egg sizes and mothers with different genetic backgrounds. F<sub>1</sub>s allow us to identify the regulatory architecture underlying DE, and to assess the impact of maternal background on gene expression.</p><p>F<sub>1</sub>s have a general pattern of intermediate expression values but have more variability within replicates and clear cases of outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As a result, almost no genes can be identified as having a dominant or additive inheritance pattern, while 150 genes are identified as overdominant over the course of development.

As this is an intraspecific comparison with little fixed genomic differences between the morphs, not all genes have alleles that can be assigned parentage; however, a set of ~2000 DE genes have morph-differentiating SNPs enabling the parental assignment of F<sub>1</sub> transcript reads. The regulatory modes of these DE genes are assigned as ‘<italic>cis’</italic>, ‘<italic>trans’</italic>, ‘cis+trans’, ‘cis × trans’, or ‘compensatory’ (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for formal criteria). Of this set, misexpression in F<sub>1</sub> offspring causes many genes to receive ambiguous assignments. As a result, only 143 genes have informative regulatory mode assignments. While this is a small number, we expect that the genes we can classify are proportionally representative of the remaining regulatory architecture.</p><p>The primary mode of regulatory change throughout development is <italic>trans</italic>-acting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). No differences are caused by purely <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory modifications, though we did find some cis+trans and cis-×-trans interactions. We found that the number of genes with compensatory regulatory modifications increases sharply after gastrulation, indicating that gene expression may be more tightly controlled past that point. Studies across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, for example, have indicated that maternal effects are regulated differently than zygotic effects, but in this case there are larger <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in early (maternally controlled) developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cartwright and Lott, 2020</xref>). We do not see such a clear effect; <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors make up most of the regulatory architecture throughout development. Interestingly, this result is different from previous studies of egg mRNA expression of this species, where <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory modifications were found at similar rates for maternal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harry and Zakas, 2023</xref>). Comparison across the egg (maternal) and embryo (maternal and zygotic) regulatory landscape shows greater <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulation in the maternally expressed genes. These results demonstrate the possibility that maternal and zygotic gene regulatory architecture evolve through distinct mechanisms and on separate timescales.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Distribution of regulatory mode over time.</title><p>The majority of regulatory changes act in trans, and compensatory changes emerge after gastrulation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93062-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We tested the possibility that the reciprocal F<sub>1</sub>s generated in the study (for the three stages that have both LP and PL samples) might have different regulatory mode changes due to parental effects. Splitting our analyses into separate PL and LP parental arrangements did not yield significantly different results, but treating them separately meant fewer genes could be assigned a mode.</p><p>We also investigated parent-of-origin effects on gene expression using F<sub>1</sub>s. These occur when an allele’s expression is at least partially dependent on which parent contributed that allele. For instance, maternal effects may involve polymorphisms that affect the development of an offspring only when contributed as part of the maternal genome (and which impose no developmental variation when contributed by the paternal genome). These effects are a form of epigenetic inheritance which can allow for complex, adaptive maternal-zygote interactions such as certain metabolic genes being specifically activated in the offspring to match the nutrient content of its mother’s egg. Due to animal constraints where LL mothers produce far fewer offspring per clutch (10–40 on average), we were only able to collect samples for F<sub>1</sub> offspring with L mothers (LP) for three developmental stages (16-cell, gastrula, and swimming). All six time points were sampled for F<sub>1</sub>s with PP mothers (PL). To find parental effects (maternal or paternal), we conducted a differential expression analysis contrasting the PL samples to the LP samples. Tests for differential expression show that many significant differences in gene expression between the F<sub>1</sub> morphs arise at early stages (ostensibly due to the presence of maternal transcripts inherited through the egg) and then drop sharply after gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that while a few parental effects on gene expression may persist throughout development, most parental effects are limited to early embryogenesis, which is consistent with expectations for maternal transcription degradation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Genes with parental effects.</title><p>Early developmental stages have significantly more genes, likely due to maternal transcript differences.

LL offspring take longer to reach the same embryonic developmental stages as PP in absolute time, although the stages are similar, and morphological differences are not observed until later development. Numerous morphological and life-history differences occur between the morphs at the swimming larval stage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>), but here we detail differences in the embryology as well. Evolutionarily, we expect that LL is the more derived developmental mode, which likely arose from a maternal increase in egg size followed by adaptive changes in the genome that increased LL fitness (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zakas, 2022</xref>). This generates predictions about the types of genes that we expect to change in patterns and magnitude. For example, we may expect that genes associated with feeding processes, growth, and cell cycle and specification initiate faster in the smaller, PP embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wray and Lowe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strathmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lowe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Segers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>). The non-obligatory-feeding LL larvae have a delay in mesoderm formation and through-gut development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pernet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>) so we would expect a delay in LL for mesoderm and gut specification, which we do see in the GO terms for the genes expressed earlier in PP.</p><p>The pattern of differential expression we observe over development – where numerous but small expression differences occur early followed by a few genes with large expression differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) – is consistent with the importance of gastrulation to canalize development. Gastrulation is the ‘phylotypic stage’ at which different phyla are the most morphologically and molecularly similar to each other during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Slack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duboule, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richardson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irie and Kuratani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irie and Kuratani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macchietto et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, adults of both types are extremely similar, so we would not expect persistent, large-scale gene expression differences at these late stages. The few genes that remain significantly DE post gastrulation are candidates for maintaining morphological and life-history differences between the morphs. (Chitin biosynthesis genes, for example, remain significantly different at later stages, and upregulated in PP.) However, these genes’ expression levels might converge much later in development as both morphs reach adulthood.</p><p>We see similar amounts of heterochronic and morph-specific genes. Heterochronic genes, and their pathways, are ideal candidates for modifying larval and life-history traits. Morph-specific genes are of particular interest in <italic>S. benedicti</italic> as previous genetic and transcriptomic work suggests there is very little differentiation of the two morphs at the genomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zakas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zakas et al., 2022</xref>). While it is possible that genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janssen et al., 2001</xref>), gene duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2003</xref>), or co-options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linksvayer and Wade, 2005</xref>) underlie the expression of morph-specific genes, given previous findings of limited total sequence differentiation between morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zakas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zakas et al., 2022</xref>), we find these possibilities unlikely. The morph-specific genes are more likely driven by regulatory differences in enhancing or silencing elements (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matlosz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We expect that incipient species that are early in their divergence have more genetic regulatory changes due to <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors; this is because <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors may be more pleiotropic and initiate numerous developmental changes parsimoniously.

However, no studies to date have examined this regulatory architecture in the context of the short evolutionary window of divergent morphs within the same species.

Clusters were plotted using the function ‘<italic>mfuzz.plot2</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Expression classification</title><p>To identify genes as heterochronic we first identify genes that have different expression patterns between the morphs and then filter those genes based on their Pearson correlation coefficients. Genes for which the PP and LL expression are on different clusters are categorized as heterochronic. Some of these genes fall onto different clusters but still have relatively similar expression profiles. Therefore, we also filter by a measure of the Pearson correlation coefficient. The threshold is based on the distribution of correlation coefficients of all PP to LL genes’ expression in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on the distribution, a threshold of r&lt;0.85 was selected to filter genes which would be classified as switching clusters but are similar enough in their expression between the two morphs to be removed. This filter disqualified 38 genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Morph-specific expression</title><p>To categorize morph-specific expression we use a gene expression thresholding approach. Spurious gene expression resulting in low levels of estimated expression (few RNAseq reads) is categorically and functionally distinct from robust gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hebenstreit et al., 2011</xref>). We establish meaningful expression thresholds based on the assumption that genes with robust expression will have values which are normally distributed. Individual sample thresholds were calculated using a DAFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Chang, 2014</xref>). Thresholds were used to identify genes which are expressed at significant levels in only PP or only LL offspring. For example, if a gene is expressed above its threshold in three or more (out of five) P samples at one or more developmental stages and in no more than one LL sample at any developmental stage, then that gene was categorized as morph-specific (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Logical table showing criterion for morph-specific expression classification of genes based on number of samples in each group that have gene expression greater than their expression level threshold as assessed by data-adaptive flag method (DAFS).</title><p>An allowance for a single mismatched replicate is made in this criterion.

We generated F<sub>1</sub> offspring from reciprocal crosses P×L and L×P (both mother-father directions) using the same sample collection method as stated above. However, we only sequenced samples from three of the developmental stages for the F<sub>1</sub>s in the LP direction. All analyses were performed as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mode of inheritance and F<sub>1</sub> misexpression</title><p>Using F<sub>1</sub> data, we classified the mode of inheritance for each gene according to established criteria and differential expression tests from DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harry and Zakas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Genes which were significantly DE between reciprocal F<sub>1</sub> offspring (PL vs LP) at any developmental stage were not considered for this analysis. The remaining genes were classified as either (1) conserved, (2) additive, (3) dominant for one genotype, or (4) misexpressed (over/under-dominant).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Parent of origin effects</title><p>DE genes between PL and LP offspring are different due to parental effects. DE was detected with DESeq2 with the contrasts ‘c(“multiFactor”, “PL_sixteencell”, “LP_sixteencell”)’, ‘c(“multiFactor”, “PL_gastrula”, “LP_gastrula”)’, and ‘c(“multiFactor”, “PL_swimming”, “LP_swimming”)’ similar to PP and LL samples. We evaluate these at three of the six developmental stages. The direction of the parental effect was determined by matching the expression change with the direction of each identified gene’s expression in PP and LL samples (where those genes were DE in PP and LL samples).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mode of regulatory change</title><p>To measure allele-specific expression, we assigned sequencing reads from F<sub>1</sub> samples to either P or L parentage by identifying fixed SNPs within the transcript sequences of the parental types. We used HyLiTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duchemin et al., 2015</xref>) to identify SNPs and assign reads as a P or L allele. We then categorized genes’ regulatory mode according to established empirical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wittkopp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graze et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harry and Zakas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) for each developmental stage independently. This required three comparisons of each gene’s expression which we performed using DESeq2: (1) the contrast of PP to LL samples, (2) the contrast of P alleles to L alleles within F<sub>1</sub> samples, and (3) a ratio of the differential expression of PP:LL to the differential expression of P:L alleles. For (3) we use a special contrast in DESeq2, applying the design (~Geno × Ori) where Geno identifies reads as either a P or L allele and Ori identifies the reads as originating from the parentals or F<sub>1</sub> samples. DE genes were categorized as either in ‘cis’, ‘trans’, ‘cis+trans’, or ‘cis × trans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wittkopp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graze et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harry and Zakas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment results spreadsheet.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-93062-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Mode of regulatory change classifications.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-93062-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-93062-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All reads are submitted to NCBI under BioProject: PRJNA1008044.

Different lineages of S. benedicti maintain one of two genetically programmed alternative life histories, the ancestral planktotrophic or derived lecithotrophic forms of development. This contrast is also seen at the inter-species level in many marine invertebrate taxa, such as echinoderms and molluscs. The authors report relatively (surprisingly?) modest differences in transcriptomes overall, but also find some genes whose expression is essentially morph-specific (which they term &quot;exclusive&quot;).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is based on dense and appropriately replicated sampling of early development. The tight clustering of each stage/morph combination in PCA space suggests the specimens were accurately categorized. The similar overall trajectories of the two morphs was surprising to me for two stage: (1) the earliest stage (16-cell), at which we might expect maternal differences due to the several-fold difference in zygote size, and (2) the latest stage (1-week), where there appears to be the most obvious morphological difference. This is why we need to do experiments!</p><p>The examination of F1 hybrids was another major strength of the study. It also produced one of the most surprising results: though intermediate in phenotype, F1 embryos have the most distinct transcriptomes, and reveal a range of fixed, compensatory differences in the parental lines. Further, the F1 lack expression of nearly all transcripts identified as morph-specific in the pure parental lines. Since the F1 larvae present intermediate traits combining the features of both morphs, this implies that morph-specific transcripts are not actually necessary for morph-specific traits. This is interesting and somewhat counter to what one might naively expect.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed this paper, and in its revised form it addresses some concerns I had in the first version. I still see a few places where it can be tightened and made more insightful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93062.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript by Harry and Zakas determined the extent to which gene expression differences contribute to developmental divergence by using a model that has two distinct developmental morphs within a single species. Although the authors did collect a valuable dataset and trends in differential expression between the two morphs of S. benedicti were presented, we found limitations about the methods, system, and resources that the authors should address.</p><p>We have two major points:</p><p>(1) Background information about the biological system needs to be clarified in the introduction of this manuscript. The authors stated that F1 offspring can have intermediate larval traits compared to the parents (Line 81). However, the authors collected F1 offspring at the same time as the mother in the cross. If offspring have intermediate larval traits, their developmental timeline might be different than both parents and necessitate the collection of offspring at different times to obtain the same stages as the parents.

Different lineages of S. benedicti maintain one of two genetically programmed alternative life histories, the ancestral planktotrophic or derived lecithotrophic forms of development. This contrast is also seen at the inter-species level in many marine invertebrate taxa, such as echinoderms and molluscs. The authors report relatively (surprisingly?) modest differences in transcriptomes overall but also find some genes whose expression is essentially morph-specific (which they term &quot;exclusive&quot;).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is based on a dense and appropriately replicated sampling of early development. The tight clustering of each stage/morph combination in PCA space suggests the specimens were accurately categorized. The similar overall trajectories of the two morphs were surprising to me for two stages: (1) the earliest stage (16-cell), at which we might expect maternal differences due to the several-fold difference in zygote size, and (2) the latest stage (1-week), where there appears to be the most obvious morphological difference. This is why we need to do experiments!</p><p>The examination of F1 hybrids was another major strength of the study. It also produced one of the most surprising results: though intermediate in phenotype, F1 embryos have the most distinct transcriptomes, and reveal a range of fixed, compensatory differences in the parental lines.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed this paper, but I see a few places where it can be tightened and made more insightful. These relate to better defining the basis for &quot;exclusive&quot; expression (regulation or gene presence/absence?), providing more examples of how specific genes related to trophic mode behave, and placing the study in the context of similar work in other phyla.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we changed the term “exclusive expression” to “morph-specific” expression throughout the paper to clarify which genes are only expressed in one morph. We also added references to similar work in other phyla such as recent work on lecithotrophic and planktotrophic development in species of Heliocidaris sea urchins in the 4th paragraph of the discussion. We added additional data about the F1 hybrids in “Gene expression of Genetic Crosses” section and the new Figure 8B. We find that gene expression in F1 offspring is divided between matching the maternal and paternal gene expression patterns, with slightly more genes matching paternal expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Harry and Zakas determined the extent to which gene expression differences contribute to developmental divergence by using a model that has two distinct developmental morphs within a single species. Although the authors did collect a valuable dataset and trends in differential expression between the two morphs of S. benedicti were presented, we found limitations about the methods, system, and resources that the authors should address.</p><p>We have two major points:</p><p>(1) Background information about the biological system needs to be clarified in the introduction of this manuscript. The authors stated that F1 offspring can have intermediate larval traits compared to the parents (Line 81). However, the authors collected F1 offspring at the same time as the mother in the cross.

So the “16-cell” stage is comparable across planktotrophic, lecithotrophic and F1 offspring regardless of absolute time taken to reach that stage (which differs by ~3 hours- Figure 1).</p><p>Figure 2A details every time point collected for all crosses. As mentioned in the methods, we were unable to collect two timepoints for one set of crosses (LP) due to limited tissue. However, we still cover the full development time from “16 cell” through “swimming larvae” stages, which is the full larval development time.</p><p>(2) We appreciate the reviewer's concerns regarding the mapping to the reference genome. The S. benedicti genome is a largely complete and contiguous chromosome-length genome which we have now highlighted in the manuscript. However, the reference is only for the planktotrophic morph. So it is certainly possible that there could be mapping bias for lecithotrophic reads or F1 reads, as we point out in the discussion. While some bias is certainly possible, it is unlikely to be driving major differences in the results. We performed several tests to demonstrate this:</p><p>(1) We conducted two-sided T-tests of the mapping rates between all sample groups in our dataset (PP, LL, PL, LP) to determine if there were significant differences in mapping rates among the populations. No significant differences were found. The specific results of these statistical tests are included in the updated manuscript in supplementary figure 1 and are as follows:</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Comparison (Read Mapping Rates)</th><th valign="bottom">p-value of two sided T-test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">PP versus LL</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.1118</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">PP versus PL</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.453</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">PL versus LP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.418</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">LP versus LL</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.908</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>(2) In response to the comment about sequence level divergence affecting mapping rate, we estimated <bold>pi</bold> (nucleotide diversity within a population) and <bold>dxy</bold> (genomic divergence between two populations) based on the sampled transcriptomic data of our Planktotrophic and Lecithotrophic populations. We used PIXY (Korunes, K.L. and Samuk, K., 2021) with its standard settings to estimate these values, with variant call files in bcf format produced with bcftools - one for all planktotrophic samples and one for all lecithotrophic samples in our dataset. We found that across regions of the transcriptome, the difference in <bold>pi</bold> between Planktotrophs and Lecithotrophs was between 0.11% and 4.2%. Genomic divergence across the transcriptome is also relatively minor: estimates of <bold>dxy</bold> ranged from 0.0049 to 0.0076. Given that these estimates show relatively modest differences in nucleotide diversity and overall sequence divergence, we maintain that it is unlikely that they significantly impact the results described in this study. From what we have seen in the literature, these values are not outside of other population studies that are mapping to a species reference derived from one population.</p><p>We added the mapping rates of all samples in the Supplement (SFig. 1) as requested. We added the number of genes expressed at each stage in the Supplement (SFig. 2) as requested. We have also provided further details and figures (Fig 8B) on read mapping rates and statistics used in data processing, including those for F1 RNA-seq data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
