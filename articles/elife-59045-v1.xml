memory deficits which arise from dysfunction in hippocampal and parahippocampal circuits. For spatially sensitive neurons, such as grid cells, to faithfully represent the environment these circuits require precise encoding of direction and velocity information. Here, we have probed the firing rate coding properties of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in a mouse model of tauopathy. We find that grid cell firing patterns are largely absent in rTg4510 mice, while head-direction tuning remains largely intact. Conversely, neural representation of running speed information was significantly disturbed, with smaller proportions of MEC cells having firing rates correlated with locomotion in rTg4510 mice. Additionally, the power of local field potential oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency bands, which in wild-type mice are tightly linked to running speed, was invariant in rTg4510 mice during locomotion. These deficits in locomotor speed encoding likely severely impact path integration systems in dementia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>grid cell</kwd><kwd>running speed</kwd><kwd>Tau</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002283</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer’s Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARUK-PG2017B-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridler</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Randall</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004312</institution-id><institution>Eli Lilly and Company</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Keith G</given-names></name><name><surname>Randall</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002283</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer’s Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARUK-RF2015-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witton</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Industry Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Randall</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dementia-related tau pathology reduces speed encoding in the medial entorhinal cortex and is associated with reduced grid cell function, whilst head direction tuning remains intact.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate spatial navigation requires the integration of sensory information to generate neural representations of space. Various high-level representations of the external environment are expressed at a single-cell level within the extended hippocampal formation (hippocampus proper, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex and subiculum) and connected brain areas, regions well known to be critical for spatial memory. For example, place cells in the hippocampus fire action potentials in specific spatial locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), whereas grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) fire in a highly organised, hexagonally distributed spatial pattern across an environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fyhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). These directly spatially sensitive neurons are collocated within the MEC with other functionally defined cell types, including head-direction (HD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ranck, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>), speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hinman et al., 2016</xref>), and border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lever et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Solstad et al., 2008</xref>). Together these are thought to provide the crucial computational information required for effective path integration, the process of using idiothetic cues to continuously calculate positional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Bush, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementia-spectrum disorders exhibit profound disruption in spatial navigation and memory, even at very early stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lithfous et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laczó et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mokrisova et al., 2016</xref>). At a pathological level, misfolded tau deposition typically occurs first in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pooler et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these clinical signs strongly implicate pathology-induced circuit-level dysfunction in the hippocampal formation as a key early-stage functional deficit in AD. In this regard, there is substantial evidence from transgenic mouse models that dementia pathologies, such as β-amyloid deposition (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation and misfolding of tau, can disrupt the intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tamagnini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerrigan et al., 2014</xref>) and synaptic microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fitzjohn et al., 2001</xref>) of pyramidal cells in area CA1 of the hippocampus. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that place cells in the CA1 region of APP and tau overexpressing mice have reduced spatial-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cacucci et al., 2008</xref>), strongly suggesting a failure of some aspects of the upstream functional circuits involved in spatial cognition. Recent evidence suggests that the circuits required for generation of theta and gamma frequency oscillations in the dorsal entorhinal cortex are especially prone to dysfunction in a mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510 mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth et al., 2016b</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2017</xref> demonstrated that grid cell spatial periodicity is reduced in mice where tau overexpression is restricted to the entorhinal cortex. These data correlate with human imaging studies which suggest deficits in grid-cell-like activity in the entorhinal cortices of people at genetic risk of developing AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kunz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the effect of tau pathology on other functional components of the spatial navigation system is less well understood. In this study, we report for the first time that disruption to speed encoding in the MEC of rTg4510 mice may underlie deficits in grid cell function. Using high-density silicone probes and tetrode recording approaches in freely moving animals, we report that in both the MEC and the CA1 region of the hippocampus, encoding of speed information at both the local field potential and cellular level is substantially impaired.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tau pathology is associated with loss of oscillatory speed coding</title><p>Neural coding of spatial information is likely to require the precise representation of locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Bush, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bush and Burgess, 2014</xref>). Velocity information can be represented in the brain via the dynamic regulation of the power and frequency of neuronal network oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Mehta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McFarland et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sławińska and Kasicki, 1998</xref>). We hypothesised that the profound deficits in spatial memory that occur in response to tau pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>) arise from impaired representation of locomotor speed in the hippocampal formation, ultimately leading to deficits in the encoding of spatial information. To examine this hypothesis, we implanted multi-site silicone-based recording probes in the dorsal MEC of male wildtype (WT) and rTg4510 mice (6–7 months). Following a post-surgical recovery period, mice were encouraged to explore a familiar linear track, baited by food rewards at either end to encourage running between the two ends, whilst connected to a multi-channel electrophysiological recording apparatus via a lightweight tether cable.</p><p>As expected, in WT mice, theta oscillation properties followed changes to locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A/B</xref>). Pooled data illustrate a clear relationship between running speed and theta oscillation power (linear regression: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.71, p&lt;0.001, n = 7 mice) and frequency (linear regression: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.69, p&lt;0.001, n = 7 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci</xref>). In contrast, in rTg4510 mice, theta oscillation amplitude was poorly correlated with locomotor activity and remained at consistent levels throughout recording sessions (linear regression: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.15, p=0.02, n = 8 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci</xref>). Importantly the overall Z-transformed correlation coefficient and slope relationships for theta power-running speed relationships were significantly lower in rTg4510 mice when compared to WT controls (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

By performing post-hoc electrolytic lesions on each recording shank to identify probe location, we were able to estimate individual unit location by determining the largest average waveform along the 200 μm probe for each isolated unit. Importantly, estimated recording location was not different between genotypes (Median distance from dorsal entorhinal border (interquartile range (IQR)): WT: 350(350) μm, rTg4510: 385(275) μm, U = 9660, p=0.77, Mann-Whitney U test <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Considered across the entire cellular population, MEC single units recorded from rTg4510 mice exhibited a decrease in mean firing rate (Median (IQR): WT: 2.97 (16.7) Hz, rTg4510: 1.03 (3.0) Hz, U = 4472, p=0.01, Mann-Whitney U, n = 150; 129 units, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>).

In contrast, due to the substantial reduction in numbers of speed and grid cells, very few rTg4510 cells (~2%) expressed any conjunctive representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Continuous integration of running speed information in the MEC has been proposed to be critically important for spatial navigation and path integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). The current experiments clearly show that unlike WT animals, rTg4510 mice do not express adequate representations of locomotor activity in the MEC local field potential (LFP), since theta and gamma oscillations display blunted, or absent, relationships with running speed.</p><p>There has been some suggestion in the literature that dementia pathology affects the firing pattern of grid cells in the MEC both in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2017</xref>) and grid-like neural representations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kunz et al., 2015</xref>). To date, however, no studies have examined changes to speed-modulated firing of MEC single units in tauopathy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2017</xref> also describe no effective impact of tau pathology on HD or border cell firing rates using the rTgTauEC mouse model. However, it should be noted that in this case tau pathology was restricted to the MEC, rather than impacting the broader circuits involved in these processes. Our data suggest the hypothesis that reduced grid cell periodicity may be the result of the impaired integration of running speed information in the MEC. However, this could also originate from a number of other mechanisms, such as a decreased recruitment of fast-spiking interneurons, an impaired spatial coding in the hippocampus or changes to in the intrinsic properties of stellate cells in the MEC. Although the causality of this is not clear, it is evident that both speed and grid cell signals are perturbed in this tau model, which is likely to have profound influences on spatial information processing.</p><p>It is important to note that, as with many other animal models of dementia pathology, we should be cautious about extrapolating phenotypic changes to human pathology. In particular, some of the pathological and behavioural features observed in the rTg4510 have been associated with the specific transgene insertion sites in this mouse line, rather than tauP301L overexpression per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gamache et al., 2019</xref>). In the future, it will be important to explore the impact of tau pathology on spatial coding in alternative, more refined models. For example, a recently described humanised tau mouse line, generated using gene editing approaches, expresses wild-type tau under endogenous promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saito et al., 2019</xref>). This approach should lead to significantly reduced genetic disruption. Whilst this mouse line does not naturally develop any neuropathological features, it is capable of supporting an accelerated tau pathology when challenged by intracortical injections of human AD brain extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saito et al., 2019</xref>). Exploring hippocampal and cortical spatial coding deficits in such a model would be an important comparator to the current study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Vulnerability of grid cell firing</title><p>These results highlight the importance of an intact path integration system in maintaining grid cell periodicity. Several studies have shown a breakdown of grid cell firing patterns after the inactivation of important spatial information streams. For example, inhibition of the medial septum, which controls theta rhythmicity, but also speed-modulated inputs, produces a complete breakdown of grid cell periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, inactivation of the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) disrupts HD tuning in the MEC, also impairing the grid cell signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). Inactivation of reciprocal hippocampal inputs into the MEC is also sufficient to produce a breakdown in grid cell periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnevie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The almost complete breakdown of grid cell firing in rTg4510 mice contrasts with the effect on spatial representation in the hippocampus of these animals. While several studies have shown a reduction in the spatial information and stability of hippocampal place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng and Ji, 2013</xref>), firing fields are still consistently present in these mice. Given the pattern of degeneration across the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spires et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackmore et al., 2017</xref>), poor place representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng and Ji, 2013</xref>) may be the result of weakened entorhinal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Cauter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brun et al., 2008</xref>). Since hippocampal place cells could be thought of as conjunctive integrators of multiple spatial (and non-spatial) input streams, surviving inputs may facilitate encoding of an impoverished spatial representation in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng and Ji, 2013</xref>). However, the loss of grid/speed input prevents this from being anchored to an egocentric spatial reference frame, resulting in decreased spatial stability. Presumably, whatever representation is being encoded by place cells is anchored to an allocentric reference frame. Decreasing the availability of visual/contextual cues or implementing a pure path integration task would likely exacerbate spatial learning/memory impairments. It is also possible to consider the role of the lateral entorhinal cortex here, which recent studies have shown to predominately code for egocentric over allocentric information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Reductions in grid and place field activity may therefore mirror their appearance in neuronal development, where place cells appear before grid cells but mature fully only after grid cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muessig et al., 2015</xref>). The precise temporal nature of grid and place cell impairment in this model is as yet unknown. However, taken together, these data further suggest that hippocampal neurons can form place fields in the absence of effective grid cell firing.</p><p>Grid cells are proposed to play a key role in path integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>). For example, mice lacking GluA1-containing AMPA receptors have been shown to display reduced grid cell periodicity, correlating with impairments on a path integration-based task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2014</xref>). Path integration has also been suggested to be impaired in populations of dementia and MCI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mokrisova et al., 2016</xref>). The direct association between these two factors is still unclear; however, it is likely that grid cell deficits, as described above, directly contribute to the deficits in spatial memory in rTg4510 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Firing rate changes in rTg4510 mice</title><p>These data show large differences in firing rates between WT and rTg4510 mice, which may have the capacity to bias measurements such as the grid score. However, while most manipulations that disrupt grid firing also decrease entorhinal firing rates, it is important to note that ‘healthy’ grid scores are largely resistant to moderate to large decreases in firing rate. By down sampling the spike trains of MEC neurons we show that decreased firing alone is not sufficient to account for changes in spatial metrics seen here. It is more likely, for example, that changes to theta rhythmicity, which often accompany the breakdown of grid cell periodicity, are responsible for changes in these mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Stability of head-direction tuning</title><p>A further feature of the inactivation studies described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnevie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Winter et al., 2015</xref>) is the stability of HD tuning in the MEC. Blocking medial septum activity impairs grid cell firing, but not HD tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the breakdown of grid periodicity after hippocampal inactivation has also been shown to reveal HD tuning in grid cells that would previously not have been modulated by HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnevie et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that the small but significant population increase in HD tuning in rTg4510 mice may reflect this unmasking of HD inputs from cells that would have previously displayed grid patterns. However, this is a hypothesis that would need to be addressed directly with long-term recordings of grid cells as tau pathology incrementally increased to levels suffient to impair spatial firing patterns. This approach is unlikely to be achieved with current electrophysiological technology. In any case, the arrival of HD information into the MEC is likely the result of an anatomically distinct pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taube, 2007</xref>) that appears to be relatively preserved in the face of the tau pathology burden in rTg4510 mice at this stage. This is most likely due to a greater dependence on subcortical structures, such as the ATN, that integrate vestibular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stackman and Taube, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharp et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, while directional tuning, in general, appears to remain intact after tau deposition of this kind, the stability of HD scores was significantly decreased in rTg4510 mice. In this case, scores were on average higher during the second half of recording sessions, suggesting a subtle temporal deficit in rate coding. This may be such that, in rTg4510 mice, HD sensitivity takes a period of time to become fully evident, consistent with disorientation upon entering what should be a familiar environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Impaired running speed representations in rTg4510 mice</title><p>Theta oscillations exhibit increases in both amplitude and frequency depending on running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Spatially modulated MEC neurons are required to integrate large quantities of multimodal sensory information from their environment. At fast running speeds, the time window for this integration is smaller and it may therefore be necessary to increase the sensitivity of such neurons during locomotion to accurately retrieve spatial associations from memory. In rTg4510 mice, theta oscillation power appears to be independent of running speed meaning that these animals are unable to integrate this information effectively.</p><p>In WT mice, the gamma oscillation power relationship with running speed shows a strong predominance for fast gamma frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with the proposed information flow across the hippocampal formation, in which the MEC provides the input responsible for fast gamma frequencies in CA1 region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>). While the CA1 area has been shown to display two distinct peaks in the gamma band power spectra, MEC LFP predominantly contains faster gamma frequencies only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>). It is perhaps not surprising then, that differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are only observed at these faster frequencies. For this reason also, conclusions regarding the slow gamma oscillation frequency should be made with caution. While slow gamma frequency has previously be shown to display a negative speed relationship in the hippocampus, MEC correlations are generally thought to be positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kemere et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is also worth noting that rTg4510 mice, like several other models of dementia, exhibit a hyperactive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackmore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Przybyla et al., 2016</xref>), and hence altered patterns of locomotor activity. This may reflect dysregulation of the septohippocampal pathway, activation of which has been shown to stimulate movement or alternatively may reflect dysfunction in motor-related brain regions. Nevertheless, whilst it should be noted that rTg4510 mice are experiencing their environment at a generally higher state of arousal, at least in terms of locomotor activity, the key finding of this study is that this locomotor activity is improperly represented in the hippocampal formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, these data show a clear breakdown in grid cell periodicity in rTg4510 mice compared to WT controls. In addition, they suggest a role for the dysfunctional processing of locomotor activity in this process, since the representation of running speed information in MEC single units is severely disrupted in these mice, while HD tuning remains constant, or slightly increased. The changes to MEC single unit firing are likely to have profound implications for the impairments in spatial memory observed in these mice and suggest observable parameters to assess in dementia patient populations, for example through speed-modulated fMRI signals in virtual environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus,</italic> Male)</td><td valign="top">rTg4510, <break/>Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay Fgf14</td><td valign="top">ENVIGO</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4819951">MGI:4819951</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Gift from Eli Lilly. <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Klusta suite</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rossant et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014480">SCR_014480</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://klusta.readthedocs.io/">https://klusta.readthedocs.io/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB R2019b</td><td>Mathworks <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://uk.mathworks.com/">https://uk.mathworks.com/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link> <break/>Chronux toolbox: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005547">SCR_005547</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">OriginPro 2019b</td><td valign="top">OriginLab <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.originlab.com/">https://www.originlab.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Cresyl violet stain</td><td valign="top">Sigma aldrich</td><td valign="top">ID: C5042</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">High-density silicon probe electrode array</td><td valign="top">Cambridge NeuroTech <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/">https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">P2</td><td valign="top">two × 16 channel shanks</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Silicon Probe</td><td valign="top">Neuronexus <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuronexus.com/">https://neuronexus.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">A1 × 16–5 mm-150-703</td><td valign="top">16 channel linear array</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Digital Lynx 10S recording system</td><td valign="top">Neuralynx <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neuralynx.com/">https://neuralynx.com/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">HS-18 or HS-36</td><td valign="top">Cheetah five data acquisition software</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were approved by the Universities of Exeter and Bristol Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (PPL P29FAC36A).</p><p>The rTg(tet-o-TauP301L)4510 mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramsden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santacruz et al., 2005</xref>) was bred on a mixed FVB/NCrl + 129S6/SvEvTa background and delivered to the University of Exeter via Envigo (Loughborough, UK).

Using the average spike waveform, putative interneurons were classified as displaying a spike-width less than 0.35 ms, based on the extracellular properties of PV+ interneurons isolated optogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buetfering et al., 2014</xref>). This approach was taken alone, rather than in combination with average firing rare of neurons, since MEC interneurons have been shown to vary widely in their spike frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buetfering et al., 2014</xref>). Neurons were described by a theta modulation index (TMI), based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of spike-train autocorrelations, using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wills et al., 2010</xref>). Autocorrelations were produced with ± 500 ms lags and 2 ms bin size. The peak at 0 lag was reduced to the next maximal value and the entire function mean-normalised by subtracting the mean from all values. The autocorrelation was tapered using a Hamming window to reduce spectral leakage and FFT calculated. The power spectrum was calculated by dividing the square of the FFT by the transform length (2<sup>16</sup>, scaled to the length of the autocorrelation). TMI was defined as the mean power within 1 Hz of each side of the peak in the theta frequency range (5–12 Hz) dived by the mean power between 0 and 125 Hz. Cells were defined as ‘theta modulated’ if their TMI was greater than 5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of speed modulated firing</title><p>Speed modulation of single unit activity was calculated based on analysis described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>. Running speed and firing rate of individual clusters were calculated for 40 ms bins of data and smoothed across 500 ms using a Gaussian window function. Running speeds from 2 to 30 cm/s and containing more than 0.5% of total recording duration were used for further analysis. Speed modulation of cells was then defined by the correlation between all running speed and firing rate bins and a speed score calculated using the Fisher-z transformation of the correlation coefficient, r. Observed speed correlations were compared to a distribution of randomly sampled correlations of shuffled data. For shuffling, time stamps were forward-shifted by a pseudorandom period between 20 s and the total trial length minus 20 s, with the end of the trial wrapped to the beginning and reanalysed using the method above. Cells were defined as ‘speed modulated’ if their speed score (z) was greater than the 95th percentile, or less than the 5th percentile, of the global distribution of scores produced from at least 250 shuffled data sets for each unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of head direction properties</title><p>HD was determined by calculating the angle between two LEDs attached to the animal’s headstage. Time periods where neither, or only one, of the LEDs were observed above threshold were discarded. Firing rate was calculated for 3° bins of HD and smoothed, using a Gaussian window over 14°. A ‘HD score’ was defined as the resultant mean vector length, calculated from the smoothed firing rate histograms. Observed mean vector length was also compared to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of a distribution of shuffled data produced as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of spatial firing properties</title><p>Spike locations for each cell were obtained with a 2D histogram count, using the MATLAB function <italic>histcounts2</italic>. Firing rate was calculated for 3 × 3 cm bins across recording environments and smoothed using a 2D Gaussian function across 1.5 standard deviations. ‘Gridness’ was calculated using a 2D autocorrelation of smoothed firing rate maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>). Spatial periodicity was determined by rotating autocorrelations in steps of 30°, between the central peak and the six closest peaks, and correlating the rotated versions with the original. Grid score was expressed as the difference between rotations at 30°, 90°, and 150° with the central peak removed, where if firing maps show a hexagonal pattern give low correlations, and 60° and 120° where correlations will be high.</p><p>The spatial information content (SI) of each cell was defined using the measure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Skaggs et al., 1993</xref> and expressed in terms of bits/spike. This approach measures the extent to which a cell’s firing rate can be used to predict the animal’s location. By definition, this does not assume spatial periodicity and has been used for quantifying place cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cacucci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hussaini et al., 2011</xref>) as well as spatially selective firing in the lateral EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Cells were defined as grid cells if their grid score was greater than the 95th percentile of the global distribution of scores produced from at least 250 shuffled data sets for each unit. Cells were defined as spatially modulated if their SI score exceeded the 95th percentile of a distribution of shuffled data but did not pass the criteria for grid cell classification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Downsampled firing properties</title><p>To control for changes in neuronal firing rate effecting coding properties, spike trains for each WT cell were uniformly downsampled incrementally between 1 and 100 times. Grid scores, mean vector lengths, and speed scores were then calculated again for each case and compared to rTg4510 scores at equivalent firing rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hippocampal CA1 data</title><p>Single unit and LFP data recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cell layer from previously published datasets were additionally analysed for speed encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth et al., 2016a</xref>). These data were collected using microdrives containing independently adjustable tetrodes, while animals ran on a linear track. Running speed–firing rate relationships were determined using the processing pathway described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electrode placement</title><p>At the end of experiments, mice received a lethal overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Euthetal) and electrolytic lesions were made at several electrode locations across the recording array. Mice were then transcardially perfused with 4% v/v formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Brains were extracted from the skull and stored in 4% formaldehyde before being cut in sagittal sections (50 µm) using a vibratome (Leica VT1000) and stained with cresyl violet. The position of electrode sites was determined from digital pictures taken with a 2.5X objective on a light microscope using QCapture pro seven software (Qimaging). Probe electrode location was expressed as distance from the most dorsal electrode site in layer II/III MEC.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by an Alzheimer’s Research UK Major Project Grant awarded to JB (ARUK-PG2017B-7).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kevin Allen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Alexander Ainge (Reviewer #2); Martin Fuhrmann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below mainly address clarity and presentation. Additional analyses were also requested when judged essential.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript investigates how spatial coding is affected in the medial entorhinal cortex of a mouse model of tauopathy. High-density silicone probes and tetrodes were used in freely moving mice to characterize the activity of speed cells, grid cells, and head-direction cells. Encoding of running speed, both in the local field potentials and in the spiking activity of neurons, was significantly impaired in rTg4510 mice. Grid cell periodicity was also altered but head-direction coding appeared largely intact. This study provides a clear demonstration that speed coding is impaired in a mouse model of tauopathy and, therefore, points to potential new mechanisms for understanding navigation deficits in Alzheimer's patients.</p><p>In general, the reviewers were positive about the quality of the experiments and the novelty of the findings. Concerns were raised regarding some methodological details that were missing in the manuscript. Additional issues were raised concerning the interpretation of some of the findings, mainly related to the small population of head-direction cells with negative speed-rate correlations.</p><p>We encourage the authors to implement the essential revisions and to send us their revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that grid periodicity is lost in rTg4510 mice is based on recordings taken in only five mice per group. To judge the significance of this finding, it is critical to know how reliably grid cells could be recorded in control and rTg4510 mice. The authors should provide a table showing how many cells of the different functional classes (grid cells, head-direction cells, etc.) were recorded in each mouse. Ideally, in this type of experiment, one would use mice as statistical units when comparing groups. The same applies to speed scores. The reader should know how many cells are recorded from each animal and whether the effects were driven by specific animals or they generalized across all animals.</p><p>2) The number of speed cells detected in the MEC of rTg4510 is very close to chance lever (10% vs. 13%), and the mean speed score is close to 0. The distribution of speed scores in rTg4510 mice is very similar to the distribution obtained by chance (Figure 3Cii). The analysis in subsection “Tau pathology is associated with impaired speed coding in MEC single units” is presented as though there are more negatively correlated speed cells in rTg4510 mice than in control: &quot;speed modulated cells were split much more evenly between positive and negative associations with firing rate.&quot; However, given that the number of speed cells in rTg4510 is very close to chance levels, the more even split might not be due to similar positive and negative speed coding in rTg4510 mice, but rather to the absence of significant speed coding.</p><p>3) Towards the end of the Results section, the authors present a number of analyses based on very small numbers of cells. For example, examining the proportion of the 17 speed modulated cells in the TG mice that are negatively modulated. Or examining border cells in the two groups. Unless the authors can make a convincing case for the robustness of these findings, we would recommend either taking these out or making it clear that these findings should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>4) One limitation that should be discussed related to the use of the rTg4510 mouse line. A recent study by Gamache et al., (2019) has shown that overexpression of tauP301L in these mice is not sufficient to cause the premature and robust age-related loss of forebrain mass and gross forebrain atrophy. Indeed, mice with similar expression levels of tauP301L but different tauP301L insertion sites in the genome, atrophy, and tau histopathology are delayed, and a different behavioral profile is observed. It is, therefore, possible that the phenotype observed in the current manuscript is not only due to the expression of tauP301L but also to the dysregulation of other genes. While comparable problems are likely to affect other Tau mouse models, we think this limitation should be stated somewhere in the discussion. This could highlight the importance of replicating the current findings in a different model of tauopathy.</p><p>5) The title of the manuscript suggests that the impairment in grid cell periodicity is somehow linked to the impaired speed coding. While both are present in rTg4510, the evidence for a link between these two phenomena is rather weak. For example, there is no correlation between these two variables in this study. I think the manuscript would be stronger with less emphasis on the potential mechanistic link between impaired speed coding and grid cell periodicity before the Discussion section. For example, the title could be more neutral regarding the association between grid periodicity and speed coding. Perhaps &quot;Impaired speed encoding and grid periodicity in a mouse model of tauopathy.&quot; The sentence “We propose a model whereby such deficiencies in speed encoding networks result in loss of grid cell firing patterns in the MEC” in the Introduction could also be modified. In rTg4510 mice, the impairment in grid cell periodicity could originate from several mechanisms, including a decreased recruitment of high-firing rate interneurons, an impaired spatial coding in the hippocampus, a reduction in speed coding, a change in the intrinsic properties of stellate cells in layer II, etc. The demonstration of an impaired speed coding in rTg4510 mice is very interesting, even without a clear causal link to grid cells.</p><p>6) From which layers of MEC were recordings made – this is not clear from Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Ideally, the field of view would be more extensive. In the last picture in rTg4510 mice, the electrode lesions appear to be more medial, perhaps in the parasubiculum.</p><p>7) There are a number of details of the experiments missing. How many sessions of recording were the data collected from? Are all the data from a single session or are the data collapsed across multiple sessions? If the data are from a single session how is this session chosen? If it is from multiple sessions is there an effect of experience – i.e. is the deficit in speed coding stable across sessions or does this change?</p><p>8) Are speed/grid and HD cell recordings taken from multiple days? If so, how do the authors control for the possibility of recording from the same cells on multiple occasions which would artificially increase the sample size?</p><p>9) Is cluster quality measured? If not, how do the authors control for effects being driven by poorer cluster isolation in the rTg4510 mice?</p><p>10) The shuffling procedure for grid cell classification is standard but in the current study this results in a higher threshold for grid cells for the rTg4510 mice than the WT mice. Does this skew the results?</p><p>11) How are the examples in Figure 2 chosen? Are these the best ones? Are they representative of the data set? Are they from different mice? Examples should be representative of the main findings rather than being cherry-picked.</p><p>12) Please include the distribution of spatial information scores in Figure 2. The spatial information scores in the examples in Figure 2 are much higher for the wild types than the rTg4510. It would be good to see what the cells with high spatial scores in the rTg4510 mice look like.</p><p>13) The lack of difference in spatial information scores reported in the text and Figure 2D is puzzling. The figure shows that 92% of rTg4510 cells are non-spatial compared to only 69% of the WT cells. How do the authors reconcile these apparently contradictory findings?</p><p>14) Related to the above point, it is not stated what the threshold for classifying a cell as spatial is.</p><p>15) There are a number of reasons why grid scores may be lower in the rTg4510 mice. One of these is that grids might drift over time. If this was the case the grid pattern may be present if shorter sessions were used. This could be examined by analyzing gridness in the first and second half of the sessions independently.</p><p>16) Related to the above point – how consistent is spatial firing across sessions? Were multiple sessions recorded? If so, are the spatial patterns consistent? If not, this could be assessed by correlating the first and second half of each session.</p><p>17) The dataset (spike times, position data, LFP data) should be made freely available together with the code used for the analysis (unless there are good reasons to restrict access).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59045.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The demonstration that grid periodicity is lost in rTg4510 mice is based on recordings taken in only five mice per group.

The authors should provide a table showing how many cells of the different functional classes (grid cells, head-direction cells, etc.) were recorded in each mouse. Ideally, in this type of experiment, one would use mice as statistical units when comparing groups. The same applies to speed scores. The reader should know how many cells are recorded from each animal and whether the effects were driven by specific animals or they generalized across all animals.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added this information in the form of a table added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of speed cells detected in the MEC of rTg4510 is very close to chance lever (10% vs. 13%), and the mean speed score is close to 0. The distribution of speed scores in rTg4510 mice is very similar to the distribution obtained by chance (Figure 3Cii). The analysis in subsection “Tau pathology is associated with impaired speed coding in MEC single units” is presented as though there are more negatively correlated speed cells in rTg4510 mice than in control: &quot;speed modulated cells were split much more evenly between positive and negative associations with firing rate.&quot; However, given that the number of speed cells in rTg4510 is very close to chance levels, the more even split might not be due to similar positive and negative speed coding in rTg4510 mice, but rather to the absence of significant speed coding.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have removed the section in the Discussion speculating on negative speed modulation in rTg4510 mice. Since negative speed cells are a feature of locomotor encoding in multiple brain region we have kept the analysis of these cells in the results but have highlighted the small numbers in the text and that this outcome would be expected by chance (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Towards the end of the Results section, the authors present a number of analyses based on very small numbers of cells. For example, examining the proportion of the 17 speed modulated cells in the TG mice that are negatively modulated. Or examining border cells in the two groups. Unless the authors can make a convincing case for the robustness of these findings, we would recommend either taking these out or making it clear that these findings should be interpreted with caution.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that for the reasons stated above it is somewhat speculative to include the analysis of border cells, due to the low number of detected cells in this functional group. Therefore, we have removed the section on border cells but have kept the negative speed cell analysis (see above), if only to highlight that those that pass the threshold do so close to chance levels for positive and negative distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One limitation that should be discussed related to the use of the rTg4510 mouse line. A recent study by Gamache et al., (2019) has shown that overexpression of tauP301L in these mice is not sufficient to cause the premature and robust age-related loss of forebrain mass and gross forebrain atrophy. Indeed, mice with similar expression levels of tauP301L but different tauP301L insertion sites in the genome, atrophy, and tau histopathology are delayed, and a different behavioral profile is observed. It is, therefore, possible that the phenotype observed in the current manuscript is not only due to the expression of tauP301L but also to the dysregulation of other genes. While comparable problems are likely to affect other Tau mouse models, we think this limitation should be stated somewhere in the discussion. This could highlight the importance of replicating the current findings in a different model of tauopathy.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and agree it is worthwhile highlighting the potential problems associated with the use of transgenic mice as models human disease. The Gamache paper makes this point in rather a stark fashion, so we have added a paragraph discussing these limitations to the Discussion. In this paragraph we also highlight a possible alternative model which may be a useful comparator group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The title of the manuscript suggests that the impairment in grid cell periodicity is somehow linked to the impaired speed coding. While both are present in rTg4510, the evidence for a link between these two phenomena is rather weak. For example, there is no correlation between these two variables in this study. I think the manuscript would be stronger with less emphasis on the potential mechanistic link between impaired speed coding and grid cell periodicity before the Discussion section. For example, the title could be more neutral regarding the association between grid periodicity and speed coding. Perhaps &quot;Impaired speed encoding and grid periodicity in a mouse model of tauopathy.&quot; The sentence “We propose a model whereby such deficiencies in speed encoding networks result in loss of grid cell firing patterns in the MEC” in the Introduction could also be modified. In rTg4510 mice, the impairment in grid cell periodicity could originate from several mechanisms, including a decreased recruitment of high-firing rate interneurons, an impaired spatial coding in the hippocampus, a reduction in speed coding, a change in the intrinsic properties of stellate cells in layer II, etc. The demonstration of an impaired speed coding in rTg4510 mice is very interesting, even without a clear causal link to grid cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have changed the title to remove the causal implication between the impairments in speed and grid coding in the MEC. Furthermore, we have removed the sentence in the Introduction and added it to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) From which layers of MEC were recordings made – this is not clear from Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Ideally, the field of view would be more extensive. In the last picture in rTg4510 mice, the electrode lesions appear to be more medial, perhaps in the parasubiculum.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this omission. Recordings were made from layer II/III and we have now added this information to subsection “Analysis of single unit data”. We were not able to be more specific than this as some of the ex vivo lesions were quite large making it difficult to define layers in some cases, nevertheless, we are confident that all of our recording sites are located in the MEC. In a number of animals the electrodes were also moved after recording in order to find more cells – so lesions are in final location rather than recorded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are a number of details of the experiments missing. How many sessions of recording were the data collected from? Are all the data from a single session or are the data collapsed across multiple sessions? If the data are from a single session how is this session chosen? If it is from multiple sessions is there an effect of experience – i.e. is the deficit in speed coding stable across sessions or does this change?</p></disp-quote><p>The data from each neuron analyzed came from a single session. We used a procedure where we continued to move through the cortex between recordings in order to maximize our ability to sample from the most optimal MEC layers. Where more than one recording location was used, sessions were picked to ensure all electrodes were a suitable distance from each other (&gt;200 µm) so we were confident that the same cells were not recorded multiple times. Added to the Materials and methods to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Are speed/grid and HD cell recordings taken from multiple days? If so, how do the authors control for the possibility of recording from the same cells on multiple occasions which would artificially increase the sample size?</p></disp-quote><p>Some animals have more than one recording location, which are separated by &gt;200µm from the bottom of the first location to the top of the second. Added to Materials and methods. We have also added this information to the table in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is cluster quality measured? If not, how do the authors control for effects being driven by poorer cluster isolation in the rTg4510 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the cluster quality metric from the KlustaViewa software (Rossant et al., 2016) with a threshold of 0.95, which did not alter between groups. Clarified in subsection “Analysis of single unit data”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The shuffling procedure for grid cell classification is standard but in the current study this results in a higher threshold for grid cells for the rTg4510 mice than the WT mice. Does this skew the results?</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated thresholds separately for each genotype since changes to firing rate in particular can have impact on random score distributions. However, using the threshold for wildtype mice would result in 6/129 cells classified as grid cells. Furthermore, a combined threshold produced from all of the shuffled data would have resulted in 4/129 compared to the 3 cells identified from the individual thresholds. Added to subsection “Loss of grid rhythmicity periodicity in rTg4510 mice”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) How are the examples in Figure 2 chosen? Are these the best ones? Are they representative of the data set? Are they from different mice? Examples should be representative of the main findings rather than being cherry-picked.</p></disp-quote><p>We deliberately chose cells with the highest grid scores from each genotype to display. This was done in order to highlight the lack of periodicity in the rTg4510 cells since even those with high enough scores to pass threshold do not have visible grid patterns. This was in the legend but we have elaborated on this slightly to clarify our reasoning for selecting these cells. The cells displayed are from 3 mice for each genotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please include the distribution of spatial information scores in Figure 2. The spatial information scores in the examples in Figure 2 are much higher for the wild types than the rTg4510. It would be good to see what the cells with high spatial scores in the rTg4510 mice look like.</p></disp-quote><p>Cumulative frequency plot for spatial information score has been added to Figure 3E, showing the distribution of spatial information</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The lack of difference in spatial information scores reported in the text and Figure 2D is puzzling. The figure shows that 92% of rTg4510 cells are non-spatial compared to only 69% of the WT cells. How do the authors reconcile these apparently contradictory findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this arises from the amount of spatial information (SI) in a grid cell and the sensitivity of the grid score. Some grid cells (with large spacing) will have high SI scores, while those with smaller spacing will be conveying less spatial information and therefore will have lower scores. Therefore, not all grid cells with pass the threshold for SI and vice versa.</p><p>It is also possible for more Tg4510 cells to convey small amounts of SI. If each grid cell were to breakdown, it would almost immediately fail to pass the grid score threshold (which is very sensitive to hexagonal firing patterns). However, the cell may still include a reasonable amount of spatial information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Related to the above point, it is not stated what the threshold for classifying a cell as spatial is.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this omission. We have now added this to the Materials and methods. We used the same “tuning curve” approach as for other cell types i.e. ninety fifth centile of shuffled distribution but also not a grid cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) There are a number of reasons why grid scores may be lower in the rTg4510 mice. One of these is that grids might drift over time. If this was the case the grid pattern may be present if shorter sessions were used. This could be examined by analyzing gridness in the first and second half of the sessions independently.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this useful suggestion. We have carried out this analysis as suggested and present the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and in the text (Discussion). Our analysis suggests that for grid- and speed-cells there was no significant change in the rate coding properties between the first and second half of the sessions in either the wildtype or the rTg4510 mice. Interestingly when we carried out the same analysis in for head direction scores, we found that, whilst in WT mice there was no change in HD score between the two halves of the session, in the rTg4510 mice there was an overall increase in HD score. So despite the fact that head direction tuning overall appears to be intact, these analysis uncover a subtle temporal deficit, such that in rTg4510 mice the head-direction sensitivity takes a few minutes to become evident.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Related to the above point – how consistent is spatial firing across sessions? Were multiple sessions recorded? If so, are the spatial patterns consistent? If not, this could be assessed by correlating the first and second half of each session.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analyses on individual units came single recording session so it is not possible to carry out these analyses suggested here. However, based on the above result, in the future it would be interesting to examine stability of head direction tuning across sessions in the rTg4510 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The dataset (spike times, position data, LFP data) should be made freely available together with the code used for the analysis (unless there are good reasons to restrict access).</p></disp-quote><p>Processed and source data will be available on the Center for Open Science framework repository at: https://osf.io/83yfd/.</p></body></sub-article></article>
