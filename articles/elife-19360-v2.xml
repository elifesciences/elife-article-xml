However, the mechanism by which lysosomal calcium regulates mTORC1 has remained undefined. Herein we report that proper lysosomal calcium release through the calcium channel TRPML1 is required for mTORC1 activation. TRPML1 depletion inhibits mTORC1 activity, while overexpression or pharmacologic activation of TRPML1 has the opposite effect. Lysosomal calcium activates mTORC1 by inducing association of calmodulin (CaM) with mTOR. Blocking the interaction between mTOR and CaM by antagonists of CaM significantly inhibits mTORC1 activity. Moreover, CaM is capable of stimulating the kinase activity of mTORC1 in a calcium-dependent manner <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results reveal that mTOR is a new type of CaM-dependent kinase, and TRPML1, lysosomal calcium and CaM play essential regulatory roles in the mTORC1 signaling pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19360.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19360.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA184103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ruo-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Chenglai</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yujun George</given-names></name><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005640</institution-id><institution>Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ruo-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Chenglai</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yujun George</given-names></name><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The multipronged chemical biology approach unraveled a novel mechanism by which mTOR is regulated by the second messenger calcium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an essential role in sensing a myriad of environmental cues including nutrients and growth factor stimulation to regulate cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). mTOR independently associates with raptor or rictor to form two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. The two complexes share several common subunits, including the catalytic mTOR subunit, mLST8, DEPTOR, and the Tti1/Tel2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Among the remaining components, PRAS40 are specific to mTORC1, whereas rictor, mSin1 protor1/2 are unique to mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). These two complexes differ in their sensitivity to rapamycin, upstream signals and downstream outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). The mTORC1 complex integrates different extracellular and intracellular signal inputs, such as growth factors, amino acids, stress and energy status, to regulate cellular processes such as protein and lipid synthesis and autophagy, by phosphorylating and activating p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Price et al., 1992</xref>) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Manteuffel et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, mTORC2 is involved in Akt phosphorylation and regulation of the cellular cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhaskar and Hay, 2007</xref>). Activation of mTORC1 by amino acids requires the translocation of mTORC1 from the cytosol to the surface of lysosomes, which is dependent on the Rag GTPase heterodimers RagA/B and RagC/D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The second messenger calcium has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of mTOR signaling. Earlier hints that calcium might be involved in mTOR signaling came from observations that calcium was required for the activation of p70S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graves et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hannan et al., 2003</xref>). But the underlying mechanism was attributed to upstream regulators such as PI3K or isoforms of PKC. More definitive roles of calcium and its signaling mediator calmodulin (CaM) in mTORC1 signaling were demonstrated in the context of amino acid activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>). It was shown that the phosphorylation of S6K1 in response to amino acids was inhibited by the cell permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM while thapsigargin, which releases intracellular calcium, activated mTORC1 activity. Moreover, it was shown that the activation of mTORC1 by amino acids was inhibited by antagonists of CaM or its knockdown using siRNA, suggesting that CaM is required for mTORC1 activity. The underlying mechanism by which calcium and CaM regulate mTORC1 was attributed to the binding of calcium-activated CaM to the hVps34, leading to the activation of its kinase activity. While the sensitivity of mTORC1 to BAPTA-AM and CaM antagonists have been reproducibly observed, ensuing studies have cast some doubt on the notion that hVps34 is a key mediator of calcium and CaM in the regulation of mTORC1 in similar and other cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mercan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, we found that small molecules that are known to induce Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) phenotype inhibited mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Independently, it has also been reported that NPC cells showed significant defects in lysosomal calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). Cells that have mutations in or deficient mucolipin transient receptor potential (TRP) channel 1 (TRPML1) display altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis similar to that seen in NPC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). Cells treated with chemical NPC inducers exhibited reduced TRPML1-mediated lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to a TRPML1 agonist, indicating dysfunction of this calcium channel. Furthermore, it has been shown that TRPML1 homolog in fly is required for TORC1 activation and fusion of amphisomes with lysosomes, and the inhibition of TORC1 can be rescued by feeding fly larvae with a high-protein diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venkatachalam et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, TORC1 also exerts reciprocal control on TRPML function, establishing the connection between TRPML and TORC1 signaling pathway in fly cells. Whether TRPML1 regulates mTORC1 signaling pathway in mammalian cells remains unknown. Putting these findings together, we hypothesized that a defect in lysosomal calcium homeostasis in NPC cells might be responsible for the observed inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway.</p><p>We validated our hypothesis by demonstrating that depletion of TRPML1 inhibits mTORC1 while overexpression or pharmacologic activation of TRPML1 activates mTORC1. We traced the likely site of regulation of mTORC1 pathway by calcium and CaM by determining the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity to BAPTA-AM and CaM antagonists in response to various upstream activators of the kinase complex and narrowed it to mTORC1 itself. We found that CaM interacted with mTORC1 and activated its kinase activity. Together, these findings shed significant new light on mTORC1 signaling pathway and offer a unifying mechanism that accounts for most, if not all, earlier observations implicating calcium and CaM in the regulation of mTORC1 by different upstream activators in distinct cellular context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRPML1 is required for the activation of mTORC1</title><p>To determine whether TRPML1 is required for mTORC1 signaling, HEK293T cells were transduced with lentiviral shRNA targeting human TRPML1 (Sh1 and Sh2) or a scrambled shRNA (Scr). Due to lack of reliable hTRPML1 antibodies, the knockdown efficiency was assessed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, bottom panel) as well as indirectly by the expression level of ectopically expressed EGFP-TRPML1. The activity of mTORC1, as judged by the phosphorylation of S6K, was significantly inhibited upon TRPML1 knockdown, while the phosphorylation of Akt (T308) was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To determine whether the mTOR inhibition caused by TRPML1 knockdown was due to blockade of lysososmal calcium release, we performed a rescue experiment in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) using thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor that increases cytosolic calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lytton et al., 1991</xref>). Indeed, the inhibition of mTORC1 activity by TRPML1 knockdown was rescued by thapsigargin, suggesting that mTORC1 inhibition was due, in large part, to the lack of lysosomal calcium release. Moreover, knocking down TRPML1 also attenuated the activation of mTORC1 by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) as well as overexpression of constitutively active RagA or RagC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Furthermore, we determined the phosphorylation of S6K in normal human fibroblasts (TRPML1 +/+) and fibroblasts from a mucolipidosis IV patient (TRPML1 -/-). Compared with TRPML1 +/+ human fibroblasts, TRPML1 -/- cells showed decreased phosphorylation of S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Interestingly, this inhibition was partially reversed by leucine compared with that in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). However, the treatment of thapsigargin fully restored the phosphorylation of S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that in mammalian cells, the decrease in mTORC1 activity in TRPML1 mutant cells is not only due to the incomplete autophagy that has been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, knockdown of other lysosomal channels, such as TPC2 and P2X4, did not significantly inhibit mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), indicating that the decreased mTOR activity upon TRPML1 knockdown was not due to the dysregulation of the structure of the endolysosmal system, and as one of the lysosomal calcium channels, TRPML1 may play a more dominant role in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19360.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRPML1 is required for the full activation of mTORC1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) HEK293T cells were transduced with lentiviral scrambled shRNA (Scr) and shRNA targeting human TRPML1 (Sh1 and Sh2), respectively.

Thus, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for EGFP-TRPML1 and its non-conducting pore mutant (D471K/D472K) EGFP-TRPML1 (KK), respectively. The phosphorylation of S6K was slightly but significantly increased by overexpression of wild type TRPML1 but not the non-conducting pore mutant TRPML1 (KK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, we treated HEK293T cells with TRPML1 agonist MLSA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). The phosphorylation of S6K was increased by MLSA1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast, MLSA1 failed to increase the phosphorylation of S6K in the cells transduced with lentiviral TRPML1 shRNA, or pretreated with bafilomycin A1 or Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN), suggesting that the increase in S6K phosphorylation induced by MLSA1 was mediated by calcium released through TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Upon amino acids stimulation, mTOR translocated from the cytosol to the lysosome, colocalizing with EGFP-TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the activation of TRPML1 acted independently of the translocation of mTORC1 induced by amino acids.

We thus treated HEK293T cells with the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM (BAPTA) or the CaM antagonists W-7 and calmidazolium (CMDZ). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graves et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), we observed that BAPTA , W-7 and CMDZ inhibited phosphorylation of S6K in a dose-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.96 ± 1.30 μM, 21.59 ± 1.81 μM and 10.36 ± 0.59 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In comparison to S6K, phosphorylation of Akt (S473), the substrate of mTORC2, was also inhibited by CMDZ and W-7, but at much higher concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> values of 27.21 ± 9.82 μM and 45.91 ± 9.61 μM, respectively) compared with that of p-S6K, while BAPTA did not show appreciable inhibition to p-Akt (S473) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In addition, CMDZ and BAPTA also showed potent inhibitory effect on mTORC1 signaling pathway in HUVEC and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>), suggesting that mTORC1 is also regulated by Ca<sup><underline>2+</underline></sup>/CaM in primary and other cancer cells.</p><p>Next, we investigated how fast mTORC1 and mTORC2 responded to BAPTA or CMDZ. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, both CMDZ and BAPTA caused appreciable inhibition of mTORC1 activity within 0.5–1 hr as judged by the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Akt (T308) and its substrate, mTOR (S2448), was not significantly affected by CMDZ until 6 hr post treatment. In addition, CMDZ did not cause significant inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt (S473) until 3 hr after treatment, indicating that the response of mTORC2 to the CaM antagonist has a much slower onset than that of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, left panel). Although the onset of the effect of BAPTA on 4EBP1 phosphorylation was slightly slower than that of CMDZ, BAPTA did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of either Akt (S473, T308) or mTOR even after 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel). These results suggest that CaM regulates both mTORC1 and mTORC2, but the two complexes differ in their sensitivity to CaM and calcium. Interestingly, after a 6-hr treatment with BAPTA, the inhibition of phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1 was partially reversed, which is consistent with a previous report that over time upon treatment with BAPTA, a gradual increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 1998</xref>). The relatively short time required for CMDZ and BAPTA to exert their effects on mTORC1 and their faster onset than those on mTORC2 suggested that the inhibition of mTORC1 likely occurred independently of its upstream signaling events, such as phosphorylation of Akt (T308).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19360.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Regulation of mTORC1 by cytosolic calcium and CaM occurs proximal to mTORC1 itself.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Effects of 10 μM CaM antagonist calmidazolium (CMDZ) or 25 μM cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM (BAPTA) on the phosphorylation of different proteins of the mTOR signaling pathway at different time points.

Similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>), we found that leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation was inhibited by BAPTA and CMDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, Lanes 4 vs. 2 and 6 vs. 2). The activation of mTORC1 by leucine has been shown to be mediated by the small GTPases RagA/B and RagC/D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), and overexpression of constitutively active RagA<sup>Q66L</sup>/RagC<sup>S75N</sup> can bypass leucine to activate mTORC1. We found that activation of mTORC1 by either RagA<sup>Q66L</sup> or RagC<sup>S75N</sup> remained sensitive to CMDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Next, we determined whether activation of mTORC1 by insulin was also sensitive to CaM blockade. Although insulin strongly increased the phosphorylation of Akt (T308) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, Lanes 2), the mTORC1 activity remained sensitive to CMDZ as well as BAPTA-AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, Lanes 4 and 6). It has been reported that mTOR is directly bound to and activated by Rheb-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Long et al., 2005</xref>).

To our surprise, when hVps34 was knocked down in HEK293T cells, binding of CaM to mTOR was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), neither was the sensitivity of mTORC1 to CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), ruling out hVps34 as a mediator of CaM-mTOR interaction in HEK293T cells. These results raised the possibility that CaM may directly interact with a subunit of the mTORC1 complex, thereby regulating its kinase activity. Indeed, CaM sepharose could pull down mTOR and raptor, but not PRAS40, in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The interaction between mTOR and CaM was sensitive to detergents and the CaM antagonist W-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect the assembly of mTORC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that one of the interactions of CaM sepharose with mTOR and raptor could be indirect. To identify the subunit in mTORC1 that interacts with CaM, we knocked down raptor and mTOR, respectively, and determined the remaining interaction between each subunit and CaM sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Knockdown of raptor had no effect on the pulldown of mTOR by CaM sepharose. In contrast, knockdown of mTOR significantly reduced the binding of raptor as well as mTOR to CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between mTOR and CaM is independent of raptor.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19360.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CaM interacts with mTORC1 and regulates mTORC1 kinase activity in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CaM interacts with mTOR independent of hVps34 or raptor.

In the current model of mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buerger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Efeyan and Sabatini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saito et al., 2005</xref>), growth factors, energy, and other inputs signal to mTORC1 primarily through the TSC-Rheb axis; amino acids act by regulating the nucleotide state of the heterodimeric Rag GTPases and promoting the translocation of mTORC1 onto lysosomes, where it interacts with and becomes activated by lysosomally-localized, GTP-bound Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). Our results have uncovered another role of lysosomal localization of mTORC1, i.e., to receive localized lysosomal calcium stimulation. Integrating our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and the results from the present study, we propose an addition to the current model of mTOR signaling pathway: upon the translocation of mTORC1 onto the lysosome, properly released lysosomal calcium enriches local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, prompting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to a local population of CaM, which in turn binds mTORC1 and stimulates the kinase activity of the mTORC1 complex.</p><p>The depletion of the homolog of TRPML1, TRPML in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, results in decreased TORC1 signaling, which was attributed to incomplete autophagy, and was completely reversed by feeding fly larvae with a high-protein diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Venkatachalam et al., 2013</xref>). However, we showed that in TRPML1-knockdown mammalian cells or mucolipidosis IV human fibroblasts, the inhibited mTORC1 signaling was only partially reversed by leucine or overexpression of constitutively active Rag GTPase, suggesting that there is a difference in the mechanisms of regulation of mTOR by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM between mammalian and fly cells. Interestingly, thapsigargin, which increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, could completely restore phosphorylation of S6K in TRPML1 deficient cells to the control level. Given that increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> also positively regulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion of late-endosomes and autophagosomes to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grotemeier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), the rescue effect of thapsigargin might be due to the combined effects of autophagy as well as the direct stimulation of mTORC1 by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in mammalian cells. On the other hand, TRPML1 is significantly upregulated under amino acids starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), when mTORC1 dissociates from the lysosomal surface and becomes inactive, indicating that mTORC1 and TRPML1 may form reciprocal regulation loop. In addition, it has been recently reported that under starvation, lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TRPML1 activates local calcineurin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, which dephosphorylates TFEB and promotes its nuclear translocation as well as regulates lysosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Medina et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting another local function of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Our model of regulation of mTORC1 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM differs from that proposed in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>), even though some of the experimental observations are in agreement. Similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graves et al., 1997</xref>), we found that mTORC1 activity is sensitive to inhibition by BAPTA-AM and CaM antagonist CMDZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that both intracellular calcium and CaM are required for mTORC1 activation. However, the precise mechanism of regulation of mTORC1 by calcium and CaM is distinct in our new model. First, we demonstrated that the lysosomal pool of calcium plays a unique and critical role in mTORC1 activation in mammalian cells. In earlier studies, however, the sources of calcium have been only suggested to be extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>) or conventional intracellular calcium stores such as the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graves et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Second, a previous study showed the CaM associates with mTORC1 complex through hVps34, and calcium and CaM activate mTORC1 via hVps34 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>). In an independent study, it was shown that hVps15, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, activates hVps34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, we also found that knockdown of hVps34 had no effect on the interaction between CaM and mTORC1 in HEK293T cells, ruling out involvement of hVps34 in the regulation of mTORC1 via Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, at least in this cell type. We surmise that most of the previous results implicating calcium or CaM in the regulation of mTORC1 may be explained by our current model.</p><p>In previous studies, <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay of mTORC1 used EDTA in immunoprecipitation buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2003</xref>), which precluded the detection of any regulatory effect of calcium and CaM. By performing the mTOR kinase assay in the absence or presence of calcium and CaM <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were able to observe a dramatic activation of mTORC1 by calcium and CaM, revealing the functional consequence of the binding of CaM to mTOR--activation of its intrinsic kinase activity. As such, mTOR is a new type of atypical CaM-dependent kinase. The newly uncovered roles of lysosomal calcium and CaM in the regulation of mTOR signaling not only fill a gap in our understanding of this fundamental signaling pathway, but also offer new molecular targets for discovering and developing novel mTOR inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and tissue culture</title><p>HEK293T (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link>, purchased from ATCC, the identity has been authenticated using STR profiling) and A549 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0023">CVCL_0023</ext-link>, purchased from ATCC, the identity has been authenticated using STR profiling) cells were cultured in low glucose DMEM (Life Technology) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technology).

Are similar effects seen e.g. with state locked rab constructs?</italic> </p><p>We conducted experiments to address the specificity of the effects of TRPML1. As TPC2 and P2X4 receptors are mainly localized on lysosomes, we knocked down TPC2 and P2X4 using two different shRNA sequences for each. We also used scramble shRNA, shRNA targeting TRPML1 or BAPTA-AM treatment as controls. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> (left panel), the knockdown efficiency of the two shRNA sequences targeting human TPC2 was about 60% – 70% as judged by q-PCR, consistent with the validation data provided by Sigma-Aldrich from which we purchased the shRNA constructs. The knockdown of TPC2 or P2X4 (right panel) did not significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K, while the knockdown of TRPML1 and treatment with BAPTA-AM did, which is consistent with our previous results. In addition, we previously showed that thapsigargin reversed the inhibition of phosphorylation of S6K by TRPML1 knockdown. These pieces of evidence suggest that the effect we observed from TRPML1 knockdown was not due to the dysregulation of the endolysosomal structure. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that TPC2 or P2X4, as lysosomal calcium channels, may play a role in regulating mTORC1, given that the knockdown was not complete.</p><p>As per reviewers’ suggestion, we also overexpressed constitutively active Rab7A (Q67L) and dominant negative Rab7A (T22N) in HEK293T cells, given that Rab7A plays an important role in positively regulating autophagy (Jäger S et al., Journal of cell science 2004, 117, 4837-4848; Hyttinen JM et al., Biochimica et biophysica acta 2013, 1833, 503-510). As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, neither of overexpression of constitutively nor dominant negative Rab7A affected mTORC1 signaling, while overexpression of TRPML1 plus MLSA1 treatment stimulated the phosphorylation of S6K, indicating that the activation of mTORC1 by TRPML1 stimulation was not due to the upregulation of autophagy. We have included these results in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling autonomous to the lysosome: To substantiate the model for a localized acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, effect compounds that more selectively target acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores – e.g. bafilomycin, GPN, NAADP-AM – need to be used in experiments. Also, there is little supporting evidence from immunolocalization/imaging to address conditions of mTORC recruitment to TRPML1 positive vesicles versus TRPML1 activity?</italic> </p><p>Bafilomycin A1 is an inhibitor of vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, and it prevents the re-acidification of lysosomes, therefore depletes lysosomal calcium. We pretreated HEK293T cells with bafilomycin for 1 hour, and continuously treated the cells with or without MLSA1 for another hour. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bafilomycin pretreatment largely abolished the stimulation of mTOR by MLSA1, indicating that the stimulative effect by MLSA1 depends on lysosomal calcium storage. Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) is a Cathepsin C substrate that induces osmotic lysis of lysosomes and depletes lysosomal calcium. We saw similar effect after GPN pretreatment. These results are consistent with previous report that treatment of cells with bafilomycin A1 or GPN abolished the response of TRPML1 to MLSA1 stimulation (Shen D et al., Nat Commun. 2012, 3:731).</p><p>NAADP-AM is reported to bind to TPC2 and induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TPC2 in TPC2 overexpressed HEK293 cells. However, wild-type cells showed only small and short-lived lysosomal calcium release from native TPC2, and lacked both the ramp-like phase and the secondary transient (Calcraft PJ et al., Nature 2009, 459, 596-600). We did not observe stimulative effect by NAADP treatment in wild type HEK293T cells, likely due to the smaller and shorter calcium release.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19360.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HEK293T cells were treated with NAADP (5 μM) for 1 hr, and were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19360.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19360.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19360-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>To test if mTOR is recruited onto TRPML1 positive vesicles, we performed immunofluorescence assay. Because there is no reliable anti-TRPML1 antibody for immunostaining available, we visualized TRPML1 by transfecting HEK293T cells with EGFP-TRPML1 expression plasmid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, when cells were deprived with amino acids, mTOR failed to cluster and was not colocalized with EGFP-TRPML1. However, when the cells were restimulated with amino acids, mTOR clustered and EGFP-TRPML1 largely colocalized with mTOR, indicating that mTOR was recruited to lysosomes and colocalized with TRPML1. These observations are consistent with previous report that TRPML1 colocalized with lysosomes (Cheng X, et al., FEBS Lett. 2010, 584: 2013–2021; Li X et al., Nat Cell Biol. 2016, 18:404-17), and amino acids stimulate the translocation of mTORC1 onto lysosomes with the help of Rag GTPase (Zoncu R et al., Science 2011, 334: 678–683; Sancak Y et al., Cell 2010,141:290-303). This result supports our model in that mTOR is recruited to the lysosome and colocalize with TRPML1 that releases lysosomal calcium locally to activate lysosomally localized mTOR upon stimulation with animo acids.</p><p><italic>3) Signaling effects of VPS34: The effect on S6-P, 4EBP-P, and Akt-473-P after knockdown of VPS34 +/- the CMDZ should be tested. Also, the role of mTOR Complex 2 is not probed directly throughout, because Akt 308-P rather than Akt-473-P is probed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The Akt-473-P blot should be included wherever possible.</italic> </p><p>To address the first part of this question, we knocked down hVps34 and treated the wild type or knockdown cells with CMDZ or vehicle control. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, the depletion of hVps34 did not affect the sensitivity of mTOR to CMDZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the regulation of mTOR by hVps34 is not dependent on CaM. Another study by an independent group also suggested that the activity of hVps34 was independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (Yan Y et al., Biochem J 2009, 417:747-55). However, consistent with previous reports (Byfield MP et al., J Biol Chem. 2005, 280:33076-82; Yoon MS et al., Cell Rep. 2016, 16:1510-7; Nobukuni T et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005, 102:14238-43.), knockdown of hVps34 largely abolished mTORC1 activation by amino acids stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>For the second part of the question, we agree with the reviewers on the need to assess p-Akt (473) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. We have added the blot of p-Akt (473) to our revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, and we also included p-Akt (473) as much as possible in other experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
