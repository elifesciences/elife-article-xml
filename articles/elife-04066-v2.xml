immunoglobulin superfamily lectin receptors (Siglecs) provide negative regulation. Here we report extensive and direct interactions between these pattern recognition receptors. The promiscuous TLR binders were human SIGLEC-5/9 and mouse Siglec-3/E/F. Mouse Siglec-G did not show appreciable binding to any TLRs tested. Correspondingly, <italic>Siglece</italic> deletion enhanced dendritic cell responses to all microbial TLR ligands tested, while <italic>Siglecg</italic> deletion did not affect the responses to these ligands. TLR4 activation triggers Neu1 translocation to cell surface to disrupt TLR4:Siglec-E interaction. Conversely, sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en prevented TLR4 ligand-induced disruption of TLR4:Siglec E/F interactions. Absence of <italic>Neu1</italic> in hematopoietic cells or systematic treatment with sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en protected mice against endotoxemia. Our data raised an intriguing possibility of a broad repression of TLR function by Siglecs and a sialidase-mediated de-repression that allows positive feedback of TLR activation during infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04066.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04066.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04066.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many living things have an immune system that is able to detect invading bacteria, viruses and other pathogens and trigger a response targeted against the threat before it causes lasting damage. Cells employ a number of different receptors that can detect these pathogens or the molecules that they produce.</p><p>In animals, toll-like receptors (or TLRs) are a type of protein that recognizes patterns or structures that are found in many different types of pathogen, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (or PAMPs). Injured cells release proteins that are also recognized by toll-like receptors and are called danger associated molecular patterns (or DAMPs). An immune response is triggered when PAMPs and DAMPs are recognized, but the response must be properly controlled. If it goes awry, it can result in an over-activation of the immune cells that can lead to life-threatening conditions, one of which is called sepsis.</p><p>Siglecs are proteins that bind to a sugar molecule, which is found attached to many other proteins, and are known to inhibit the immune response. However, it remained unclear how Siglecs do this and if they can interact directly with toll-like receptors. Chen et al. now show that most (although not all) Siglecs bind to TLRs, and that deleting the gene for a Siglec protein that can bind to multiple TLRs boosted the response of the immune cells to a range of microbial PAMPs. Deleting the gene for another Siglec that did not bind to any TLRs had no effect on the immune response.</p><p>Chen et al. suggest that the Siglec proteins that interact with toll-like receptors act a bit like a brake that slows down the activation of the receptors. However, when an immune cell detects a foreign molecule through a TLR, an enzyme called Neu1 is relocated from the inside of the cell to the cell's surface, where it removes the sugar molecules from the TLRs. This disrupts the interaction between the TLRs and the Siglecs, thus activating the receptors and triggering an immune response against the invading pathogen or damaged cells. This represents a newly discovered mechanism that can regulate the signaling of TLRs.</p><p>Chen et al. also show that a chemical compound that stops the function of the Neu1 enzyme prevents the toll-like receptors—and hence the immune cells—from becoming overly activated. Mice treated with this compound are protected against sepsis triggered by the presence of a bacterial PAMP. These results suggest that the Neu1 enzyme may be a promising new target for treating sepsis; further work will now be required to assess the potential side effects caused by inhibiting this enzyme.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04066.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04066.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Siglec</kwd><kwd>toll-like receptor</kwd><kwd>sialidase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI64350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG036690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Pan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI105727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Guo-Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI108115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sialoside-based pattern recognition by Siglecs directly regulates toll-like receptor signaling and a sialidase inhibitor protects against endotoxemia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly 25 years ago, Janeway proposed that the innate immune system discriminates infectious nonself from non-infectious self through non-clonally distributed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janeway, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">1992</xref>). This concept was supported by the observations of microbial induction of costimulatory activity on antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Janeway, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu and Liu, 1994</xref>) and bolstered as a major pillar in immunology by the identification of TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medzhitov et al., 1997</xref>) and its ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poltorak et al., 1998</xref>). Over the following decades, TLRs have emerged as a family of PRRs that sense a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), ranging from microbial glycan, bacterial glycolipids, flagellin, and viral and bacterial nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, accumulating data demonstrated that TLRs also sense cellular components released after cellular injuries, such as heat-shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millar et al., 2003</xref>), HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apetoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian et al., 2007</xref>) and S100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiratsuka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). These components were collectively called DAMPs for danger-associated molecular patterns, based on Matzinger's ‘danger theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matzinger, 1994</xref>). In addition to TLRs, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have also been shown to respond to both microbial components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>) and cellular injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</xref>). Since these PRRs respond to both infectious and noninfectious inflammatory stimuli, additional regulatory mechanism was deemed needed if pattern recognition receptors were to be the key components to discriminate the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have reported that CD24-Siglec-G/10 interactions selectively inhibit host responses to DAMPs without affecting responses to PAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). These data suggest a new mechanism for limiting inflammation to autologous molecules, and a framework for integrating the self-nonself and danger theories of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Siglecs are membrane-bound lectins that constitute the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin super family with distinct cellular distribution and glycan specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>). Most Siglecs have intracellular domains capable of inhibitory signaling. With a few notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stamenkovic et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandala-Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McMillan et al., 2013</xref>), the natural ligands for most Siglecs remain to be determined. The selective effect of Siglec-G in regulating host response to DAMPs raised two interesting questions: First, do all Siglecs perform similar functions in discriminating self from non-self in innate immunity? Second, do Siglec family members directly interact with other families of pattern recognition receptors and play a broad function in regulating innate immunity? Here we addressed these two issues by revealing a broad and direct interaction between TLRs and many Siglecs, and by highlighting Siglec-G for its lack of direct interactions with TLR.</p><p>A standard test to validate Siglec-mediated interactions is to measure their susceptibility to sialidase treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>). The implication of this cardinal feature in immune recognition has not been widely explored. Our previous studies have demonstrated that CD24-Siglec-G interactions are disrupted by bacterial sialidase and that such disruptions exacerbates sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Since most pathogens do not express sialidases, the implication of this observation on immune regulation during infection and autoimmune diseases is less clear. On the other hand, mammals express at least four sialidases, Neu1-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyagi and Yamaguchi, 2012</xref>). Several studies have suggested that activation of TLR can be attenuated by sialidase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkhalek et al., 2011</xref>). Both Neu1 and Neu3 have been suggested as targets of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkhalek et al., 2011</xref>). Neu1 has been shown to cause TLR4 dimerization, which was suggested to be important for its regulation of TLR4 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amith et al., 2010</xref>). Here we report a critical role for Neu1 in regulating Siglec-TLR interaction and endotoxemia. Together, our data reveal an overlooked network of interactions among Siglecs, host sialidases and TLRs and, with more potent Neu1 inhibitors, propose host sialidases as therapeutic targets for lethal endotoxemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extensive Siglec-TLR interactions negative regulate the function of multiple TLRs</title><p>To test whether TLRs directly interact with Siglecs, we first tested a panel of recombinant human SIGLEC fusion proteins for their interaction with human TLRs synthesized by the THP1 cell line using a sandwich capture assay. Plates were coated with recombinant SIGLEC-Fc fusion proteins or control human Fc. Lysates from the human myeloid cell line THP1 was used as the source of cellular TLRs, as this line expresses transcripts of all TLRs at significant levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SIGLEC-Fc-bound TLRs were detected with anti-TLR antibodies. This assay revealed extensive interaction between the two families of pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Among them, Siglec 5 and 9 cross-reacted with virtually all TLR tested. In contrast, very little interaction was observed between TLRs and SIGLECS-1, 2, 7, 10 and 11.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04066.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Extensive direct interactions between Siglecs and TLRs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evaluation of TLR expression using TLR-primer set.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Siglec-3, E, F and H were broadly cross-reactive, while Siglec-G displayed no interaction with any murine Tlr. We validated the interaction between Siglec-E and Tlr4 using both pull down and bi-directional immunoprecipitation assays. Siglec-E-Fc, but not control IgG, pulled down Tlr4 in the spleen cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Anti-Siglec-E monoclonal antibodies co-precipitated Tlr4, while anti-Tlr4 co-precipitated Siglec-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine whether Siglecs directly interact with TLR, we coated the 96-well plates with recombinant Siglecs or control IgG. After blocking with bovine serum albumin, recombinant TLR4 extracellular domain was added, and the bound TLR4 were determined using biotinylated anti-TLR4 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The data revealed that TLR4 directly interact strongly with SIGLEC-5, 6, 9, 11 and modestly with SIGLEC-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, no interaction was observed between SIGLEC-1, 2, 3, 10 and TLR4. Likewise, mouse Siglec-E and F bound strongly to TLR4, with Siglec-3 and H showing modest binding to TLR4, and no binding to TLR4 and Siglec-1, 2 and G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Comparisons between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,E</xref>, and between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G</xref>, show that, with the modest exception of Siglec-7, recombinant TLR4 recapitulated the specificity of endogenous TLR4. Taken together, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrate broad and direct interaction between TLR and Siglec families of PRRs.</p><p>Since Siglec-E contains intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and ITIM-like domains and associates with molecules known to negatively regulate production of inflammatory cytokines, we compared bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) from WT and <italic>Siglece</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice for their responses to prototypic TLR ligands. After overnight stimulation with TLR ligands, we analyzed the production of IL-6 and TNFα by DC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>Siglece</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> DC were 1000-fold more responsive to LPS stimulation than <italic>Siglece</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> DC. Likewise, <italic>Siglece</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> DC produced at least 10-fold more cytokines in response to CpG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Given the multiple interactions of Siglec-E with other TLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we tested if endogenous Siglec-E negatively regulates production of inflammatory cytokines to other TLR ligands. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, in addition to an enhanced response to TLR4 and TLR9 ligands, <italic>Siglece</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> DC also produced significantly more IL-6 in response to synthetic triacylated lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), heat-killed <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (HKLM, Tlr2 agonist), poly(I:C), (TLR3 agonist), <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin (ST-FLA, TLR5 agonist), synthetic lipoprotein derived from <italic>Mycoplasma salivarium</italic> (FSL-1, TLR2/6 agonist) and ssRNA40, a 20-mer phosphorothioate-protected single-stranded RNA oligonucleotide containing a GU-rich sequence (TLR8 agonist). Since Siglec-E negatively regulates responses to all TLR ligands tested, we suggest that the physical interactions between Siglec-E and TLRs are biologically significant.

Consistent with its intracellular ITIM- or ITIM-like motifs, engagement of Siglec-G with its natural ligands has been shown to inhibit both innate immune responses and adaptive T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandala-Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toubai et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The function of Siglec 2 (CD22) and Siglec-G in immune tolerance has also been demonstrated using both synthetic ligands and mice with deletions of the Cd22 and <italic>Siglecg</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jellusova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfrengle et al., 2013</xref>). Targeted mutation of <italic>Siglecg</italic> revealed its critical role for inflammatory cytokine production to tissue injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) and type I interferon response to RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, mutation of <italic>Siglece</italic> has been shown to enhance inflammatory cytokine production to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2014</xref>) and neutrophil recruitment to lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McMillan et al., 2013</xref>). A fusion protein consisting of extracellular domain of Siglec-E and IgG-Fc (Siglec-E-Fc) is a potent inhibitor of TLR4 response in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyd et al., 2009</xref>). However, the target of Siglec-E-Fc was not identified. Despite these interesting observations, it is unclear how pattern recognition by Siglec family members may relate to other prototypic innate pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs.</p><p>By showing a broad physical interaction between Siglecs and TLRs, our data provides a missing link between these two PRR families. The biological significance of the interactions is confirmed by the broad impact of <italic>Siglece</italic> mutation on response of DCs to all TLR ligands tested. Although a number of intracellular negative regulators have been described to regulate TLR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>), to our knowledge, Siglecs constitute the first class of cell surface pattern recognition receptors that are directly involved in regulation of TLR function.</p><p>By virtue of the broad and direct interaction between TLRs and Siglecs, one may envision that under steady-state conditions, TLR-induced inflammation may be relatively moderate as TLR functions are either directly (in case of Siglec-E) or indirectly (in case of Siglec-G) restrained by sialoside-based pattern recognition. In case of tissue injury, a moderate inflammation may be beneficial for tissue remodeling and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>). Infection can boost inflammation through microbial sialidase, as we have recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), or as shown herein, by inducing translocation of host Neu1 to the cell surface to disarm the Siglec-mediated negative regulation of TLR function.</p><p>Since the Neu1 translocation is induced by microbial TLR ligand, a positive feedback is created to release the Siglec brake for TLR activation. The molecular mechanism for TLR4-induced Neu1 translocation is largely unclear, although Neu1 translocation during differentiation from monocytes to macrophage occurs by a route used by MHC class II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). Engagement of TLR4 also activates cell surface Neu1 activity, perhaps by G protein-coupled receptor and matrix metalloproteinase-9-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkhalek et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to regulating Siglec-TLR interaction, Neu1 has also been shown to induce TLR4 dimerization and thus potentially stimulate TLR4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amith et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is also of interest to note that TLR-mediated trans-regulation of cellular glycosylation was described through genetic screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seppo et al., 2003</xref>), although the functional significance was not clear. The positive feedback described herein suggests a physiological function of TLR-induced glycosylation switch.</p><p>Our data showed that Siglec-E mutation affects the function of both cell surface and endosomal TLRs. It is unclear how Siglec-E may affect endosomal TLRs. However, As a member of CD33-like Siglecs that are known to be readily endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter et al., 2008</xref>), Siglec-E may form physical complexes with endosomal TLRs.</p><p>The Siglec family of PRR may help the innate immune system to discriminate between infection and tissue injury by two distinct mechanisms. First, as represented by Siglec-G/10, which does not directly associate with TLR, Siglecs may selective repress inflammation by binding to a DAMPs-associated natural ligand, such as CD24, to inhibit host response to DAMPs. Second, as represented by Siglec-E which directly associates with TLR, Siglecs may regulate inflammation to endogenous TLR ligands by default. By either inducing translocation of intracellular sialidase or by producing microbial sialidases, infection can exacerbate inflammatory cytokine production to disrupt direct Siglec-TLR interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04066.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Sialoside-based pattern recognition and self-nonself discrimination by the innate immune system.</title><p>TLR signaling is restrained by Siglecs that are either directly (such as Siglec-E) or indirectly through Cd24 (such Siglec-G) in the case of tissue injuries.

Both host and cellular to desialylate TLR and/or CD24. The Siglecs are dissociated from TLR to allow a more robust inflammation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04066.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04066.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04066-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The broad impact of Siglecs in the inflammatory response suggests that the interaction with TLR may be preserved to reduce inflammation in cases of detrimental inflammation, such as sepsis. However, since one Siglec can interact with multiple TLRs, and each TLR with multiple Siglecs, it is unlikely that blocking specific Siglecs may significantly impact the susceptibility to endotoxemia. In contrast, as sialidases may regulate multiple Siglec-TLR interactions, targeting host sialidase may be more effective. Indeed, we showed that inhibition of Neu1 by either gene deletion or sialidase inhibitor administration confers a strong protection against endotoxemia. Therefore, Neu1 may serve as a new therapeutic target for endotoxic shock.</p><p>Sepsis remains a major challenge despite advances in antibiotics, and many sepsis cases are caused by gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seyrantepe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dombrovskiy et al., 2007</xref>). We have recently shown bacterial sialidase as a valuable target for polybacterial sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). However, most pathogens do not encode sialidase. With the identification of a critical function of endogenous sialidase, we can now extend the potential of this strategy to more sepsis-causing pathogens. Unlike bacterial and viral sialidases, endogenous sialidases may be easier to target as they are both limited in diversity and unlikely to acquire drug resistance through mutation. However, since mutation of Neu1 cause sialidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seyrantepe et al., 2003</xref>), it is of interest to consider how potential side-effects associated with Neu1 inactivation may be avoided. Fortunately, our data demonstrate that an effective sialidase inhibitor can confer protection by selectively targeting cell surface Neu1, perhaps by virtue of poor drug accessibility to the intracellular compartment. Therefore, it is feasible to target Neu1 therapeutically without side effects associated with disruption of the intracellular sialidase activity, the known cause of sialidosis.</p><p>Taken together, our data establish a missing link between the TLR and Siglec families of pattern recognition receptors. The specificity of individual Siglecs allow them to play distinct roles in innate immunity, while regulation of the interaction by host sialidase suggest a novel approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant proteins consisting of human IgG Fc and extracellular domains of human SIGLEC1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and mouse Siglec1, 2, E, F were purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

The findings are of great importance, with broad interest in the research of innate immune regulation. The experiments are well designed and the data are well presented. However, further revision seems to be necessary, especially including the confocal microscopy overlay data of these translocated molecules to elucidate their movement and interaction directly, and discussing the working model of Siglec-E appropriately in terms of its broad application.</p><p>While the authors' model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) does not reveal whether a direct interaction between Siglecs and TLRs is mediated through sialic acid on the TLR itself, the combined data suggest that it may be. The authors should repeat in vitro binding experiments with recombinant TLR4 digested with neuraminidase to determine if this abrogates a Siglec-TLR4 interaction in vitro. Alternatively, cells that were used a source of TLR's could be treated with a commercially available sialyltransferase inhibitor to provide a source of TLRs with minimal sialic acid. Another strategy would be to use a Siglec-Fc (ex. Siglec-E or Siglec-9) bearing an arginine mutant that disrupts sialic acid recognition. It would be useful to know, one way or another, whether the interaction in question is sialic acid dependent.</p><p>The authors’ conclusion that their mechanism is broadly applicable to the siglec family is overstated. Data supporting their model was acquired primarily for Siglec-E. As such, it would be more appropriate to focus the title and Abstract on this specific case rather than make a broad claim about the entire family.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It's better to include more details and describe more clearly that why Neu1 or Neu family members are introduced and studied in the effects and mechanisms of Siglec-E-TLR4 interaction and Siglec-E-mediated negative regulation of TLR signaling.</p><p>2) As TLR signaling induces Neu1 translocation and then inhibits Siglec-E-TLR4 association, it's better to include the confocal microscopy overlay data of these translocated molecules to elucidate their movement and interaction directly.</p><p>3) The translocation of Neu1 from lysosome to membrane is very important for the mechanism of TLR4 signal regulation. The authors should cite, describe, or discuss the underlying mechanism responsible for Neu1 translocation induced by TLR4 activation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04066.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The experiments are well designed and the data are well presented.

Our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> showed that of all 4 sialidases known in mammals, only Neu1 and Neu3 are detectable in the D2SC cells. Gene silencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and drug inhibition profiles implicated Neu1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The involvement of Neu1 is validated definitively using bone marrow cells from Neu1-deficient mice.</p><p><italic>2) As TLR signaling induces Neu1 translocation and then inhibits Siglec-E-TLR4 association, it's better to include the confocal microscopy overlay data of these translocated molecules to elucidate their movement and interaction directly</italic>.</p><p>These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The translocation of Neu1 from lysosome to membrane is very important for the mechanism of TLR4 signal regulation. The authors should cite, describe, or discuss the underlying mechanism responsible for Neu1 translocation induced by TLR4 activation</italic>.</p><p>We have now expanded the Discussion to address this concern.</p></body></sub-article></article>
