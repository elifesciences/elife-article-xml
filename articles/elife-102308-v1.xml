The PPN has been implicated in locomotor control and valence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryczko, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastos-GonÃ§alves et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mena-Segovia and Bolam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">French and Muthusamy, 2018</xref>). However, understanding PPN circuitry is complicated by its anatomical and molecular heterogeneity. It has three molecularly defined cell types, distinguished by their major neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>) and distinct rostral and caudal topography. While cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons are more densely packed in the caudal PPN, GABAergic neurons are more densely packed in the rostral PPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mena-Segovia et al., 2009</xref>). These molecularly defined populations display very minimal overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steinkellner et al., 2019</xref>). This unique topography has been conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MarÃ­n et al., 1998</xref>), but it is unknown how the basal ganglia connects to each of the distinct cell types in the rostral and caudal PPN regions to modulate locomotor and valence outputs.</p><p>While the PPN interacts with all basal ganglia nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mena-Segovia and Bolam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>), the inhibitory inputs from the substantia nigra <italic>pars reticulata</italic> (SNr) and the globus pallidus <italic>externus</italic> (GPe) to the PPN are of particular interest because of their roles in the canonical motor output pathways for âstopâ and âgoâ, respectively. Both the SNr and GPe are known to send axonal projections to the PPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElvain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dautan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caggiano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henrich et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have identified SNr and GPe monosynaptic connections to the PPN cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons using rabies tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dautan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caggiano et al., 2018</xref>). However, inputs to the GABAergic neurons have only been described in terms of the entire mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which extends beyond the PPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>). While SNr projections to MLR GABAergic neurons were identified but cannot be isolated to the PPN, GPe projections to the MLR GABAergic neurons were not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, these previous studies consider the PPN as a whole rather than separating its rostral and caudal subregions. While viral tracing can provide insight into neuroanatomical connections, limitations of these techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ugolini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Linders et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glasgow et al., 2019</xref>) and evidence that the rostral and caudal PPN may have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GoÃ±i-Erro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masini and Kiehn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2024</xref>) prompt a need for electrophysiological studies to determine whether the SNr and GPe inputs differentially innervate regionally defined PPN neurons.</p><p>Optogenetic manipulations of the molecularly defined PPN cell types have resulted in variable, and sometimes contradictory, locomotor and valence behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dautan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caggiano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GoÃ±i-Erro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masini and Kiehn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Josset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tello et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira-Pinto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hormigo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hormigo et al., 2021</xref>). More recent studies have refined our understanding of these opposing behavioral effects by selectively stimulating the rostral or caudal GABAergic and glutamatergic PPN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GoÃ±i-Erro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masini and Kiehn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). In the basal ganglia, direct stimulation of molecularly defined SNr and GPe subpopulations can also have distinct effects on locomotion and valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzi and Tan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galaj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mastro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pamukcu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aristieta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isett et al., 2023</xref>). Despite the potential for the basal ganglia to modify behavior through the motor brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>), it is not clear how the SNr and GPe influence the rostral and caudal PPN to modify locomotion and valence.</p><p>Here, we use ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology paired with optogenetics to selectively stimulate the SNr or GPe axons while recording inhibitory inputs to the cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic PPN neurons to comprehensively characterize the strength and pattern of inhibition across the rostrocaudal PPN axis. We find that the GPe preferentially inhibits caudal GABAergic and glutamatergic PPN neurons, whereas the SNr most strongly inhibits a caudal âhotspotâ of PPN glutamatergic neurons. Stimulating SNr or GPe axons over the PPN in vivo evokes opposing valence processing outcomes with place aversion during SNr stimulation and place preference during GPe stimulation. Surprisingly, and counter to the predictions of the canonical basal ganglia model, the GPe decreases locomotion through its projections to the PPN. While both the SNr and GPe inhibit the PPN, our results show that each nucleus differentially modulates the activity of specific cell types in the rostral and caudal PPN and is implicated in non-canonical basal ganglia circuits for modulating locomotion and valence processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNr and GPe axons display distinct distribution patterns across the rostral and caudal PPN</title><p>To characterize the axon distribution pattern from the SNr and GPe throughout the rostral and caudal extent of the PPN, we stereotaxically injected a channelrhodopsin virus with a fluorescent marker (AAV1-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP) into either the SNr or GPe of ChAT-Cre/Ai9-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). We sliced 200 Î¼m sagittal slices from mouse brains three weeks after viral injection and cleared the brain slices using the CUBIC clearing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Susaki et al., 2015</xref>). Using the red fluorescent ChAT-positive neurons to define the borders of the PPN, we found that SNr axons appear in both the rostral and caudal PPN. The SNr axons fill the rostral PPN evenly but appear more distinctly clustered in specific areas of the caudal PPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas GPe axonal projections more densely fill the caudal region and strikingly avoid the rostral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These anatomical findings predict that the SNr will inhibit both rostral and caudal PPN neurons, while the GPe will selectively inhibit the caudal PPN. However, this axon imaging method does not reveal whether these axons form functional synapses with the neurons in the PPN and does not provide information on the strength of inhibition from each structure onto specific PPN cell types. Therefore, to evaluate the functional connectivity and synaptic characteristics from these inhibitory basal ganglia output structures to regionally- and molecularly-defined PPN neural subpopulations, we used ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology to systematically record the inhibitory input to the rostral and caudal PPN from the SNr and GPe in three genetic mouse lines (ChAT-cre, Vgat-cre, and Vglut2-cre) which label cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic PPN subpopulations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SNr and GPe axons display distinct distribution patterns across the rostral and caudal PPN.</title><p> (<bold>A,C</bold>) Stereotaxic injection of AAV1 delivering <italic>hSyn-ChR2-eYFP</italic> to the SNr or GPe of ChAT-Cre/Ai9-tdTomato mice, respectively.

Neurons were targeted for whole-cell patch clamp in both the rostral and caudal PPN across three sagittal slices to evaluate the medial to lateral extent of the PPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To measure optically evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents (oIPSCs), cholinergic PPN neurons were held at â50 mV in whole-cell voltage clamp and blue (470 nm) light was applied (2ms pulse duration, 13 mW) to activate the ChR2-infected SNr axons. In connected neurons, inhibitory currents were recorded in the presence of glutamatergic receptor blockers (AP5, NBQX, CNQX) during stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In a subset of neurons, a GABA-A receptor blocker, GABAzine, was applied to confirm the oIPSCs were GABA-mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Interestingly, we again found opposite effects when stimulating the two basal ganglia inputs to the PPN. Mice avoided the stimulated chamber when the SNr axons were stimulated, but preferred the stimulated chamber when the GPe axons were stimulated (mean Â± SEM; N=16 (6M, 10 F) Ctrl: 40.76 Â± 2.0%, N=9 (5M, 4 F) SNr: 23.99 Â± 5.2%, N=10 (5M, 5 F) GPe: 76.11 Â± 3.7%; Welch ANOVA<sub>W(4.00,16.95)=26.73</sub>, p&lt;0.0001; Dunnettâs test, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs SNr<sub>4.25mW</sub> p=0.0437, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs GPe<sub>4.25mW</sub> p&lt;0.0001, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs SNr<sub>0.25mW</sub> p=0.0695, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs GPe<sub>0.25mW</sub> p=0.0467; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). To further control for potential motion confounds, we recorded the location preference of the mice in the absence of optical stimulation the day after the stimulated RTPP assay (regardless of whether they received low or high power on day 1). The mice were placed in the central, neutral chamber and their location was tracked for 10 min. During the first minute of this assay, 8 out of 9 mice who had SNr optical stimulation on the first day continued avoiding the stimulated chamber while 9 out of 10 mice who had GPe optical stimulation continued to prefer the previously stimulated chamber compared to the median percent time spent in the stimulated chamber for mice in the control condition median (IQR); N=16 (6M, 10 F) Ctrl: 47% (14.79â69.24 %), N=9 (5 M, 4 F) SNr: 1.833% (0â41.75 %), N=10 (5M, 5 F) GPe: 92.83% (58â99.21 %); Kruskal-Wallis<sub>H=14.32</sub>, p=0.0008; Dunnâs test, Ctrl vs SNr p=0.1433, Ctrl vs GPe 0.0312; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-102308-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Mouse behavior during high power constitutive substantia nigra axon stimulation in the PPN during real-time place preference task (striped side is stimulated side).</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-102308-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Mouse behavior during high power GPe axon stimulation in the PPN during real-time place preference task (striped side is stimulated side).</title></caption></media><p>In addition to sending projections to the PPN, the GPe and SNr send axon collaterals to multiple other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElvain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mastro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lilascharoen et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that stimulating these axons in the PPN could cause antidromic stimulation of the GPe and SNr cell bodies, resulting in the inhibition of non-PPN brain regions. However, it has recently been shown that 0.25 mW laser power stimulation of axons can prevent antidromic activation of cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isett et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we repeated these optogenetic behavioral experiments using 0.25 mW laser power. We found that the locomotion effect of SNr stimulation over the PPN was no longer present during low power stimulation, but GPe stimulation still significantly decreased locomotion (mean Â± SEM; distance traveled N=9 (3M, 6 F) Ctrl: 2.22Â±0.24 m, N=6 (3M, 3 F) SNr: 2.24Â±0.50 m, N=8 (4M, 4 F) GPe: 1.09Â±0.22 m; Welch ANOVA<sub>W(4.00, 15.86)=14.81</sub>; p&lt;0.0001; Dunnettâs test, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs SNr<sub>0.25mW</sub> p&gt;0.999, Ctrl<sub>4.25mW</sub> vs GPe<sub>0.25mW</sub> p=0.0131; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Because injecting constitutive AAVs into the SNr can infect both GABAergic neurons and adjacent dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), we wanted to determine whether stimulating dopaminergic axons in the PPN enhanced locomotion and evoked aversion. To test this, we injected a cre-dependent ChR2 into the substantia nigra of DAT-cre mice (3 M heterozygotes and 3 F homozygotes) and ran open field and RTPP behavioral assays. We found that selective stimulation of dopaminergic axons in the PPN increased locomotion at high laser power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and had no effect on locomotion at low power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). This finding suggests that dopaminergic neurons in the SNc send collateral projections to both the PPN and other locomotor-related structures (e.g. the striatum) such that stimulation of PPN-projecting SNc neurons increases locomotion. The effect of dopaminergic axon stimulation did not differ from whole substantia nigra stimulation in either high (mean Â± SEM; N=8 (5M, 3 F) SNr<sub>4.25mW</sub>: 4.107Â±0.51 m, N=6 (3M, 3 F) DAT-Cre<sub>4.25mW</sub>: 3.778Â±0.28 m; unpaired t-test, t=0.5159, df = 12, CI = â1.715â1.059, p=0.6153; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) or low laser power (mean Â± SEM; N=6 (3M, 3 F) SNr<sub>0.25mW</sub>: 2.238Â±0.58 m, N=9 (3M, 3 F) DAT-Cre<sub>0.25mW</sub>: 1.984Â±0.30 m; unpaired t-test, t=0.4350, df = 10, CI = â1.556â1.047, p=0.6728; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).

Several studies have used slice electrophysiology to show that the SNr inhibits PPN neurons generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hormigo et al., 2019</xref>) or to compare SNr input to cholinergic and non-cholinergic PPN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takakusaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Granata and Kitai, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang and Kitai, 1990</xref>). However, a full characterization of the SNr input to regionally and molecularly defined PPN neurons in adult animals has been lacking. Using ex vivo whole-cell patch recordings, we were able to measure inhibitory currents in each of the PPN cell types during SNr stimulation, showing that the SNr functionally inhibits each cell type within the rostral PPN to a similar extent while most strongly inhibiting a medial-caudal âhotspotâ of glutamatergic neurons.</p><p>While the GPe has been shown to project to the cholinergic and glutamatergic PPN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dautan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caggiano et al., 2018</xref>), our electrophysiological results show that GPe inhibition of the cholinergic neurons is weak to non-existent and its inhibition of the glutamatergic PPN neurons is caudally biased. In contrast to a previous study showing that the GPe does not project to GABAergic MLR neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>), we find that the GPe also preferentially inhibits a caudal subgroup of GABAergic PPN neurons. While the GPe selectively inhibits a caudal subpopulation of GABAergic and glutamatergic PPN neurons, its inhibition is much weaker than SNr inhibition of the PPN in terms of the proportion of connected PPN neurons, the inhibitory current amplitudes, and the inhibition of neuronal firing. Overall, our findings utilize a systematic approach to characterize the synaptic strength between these inhibitory basal ganglia nuclei and the PPN across its rostrocaudal axis for each cell type, allowing us to compare SNr and GPe to PPN circuitry with regional-level granularity. These results also encourage future work involving the PPN to consider the individual influence of its rostral and caudal regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Noncanonical GPe motor circuits</title><p>We found that stimulation of GPe axons over the PPN decreased locomotion in both low (putatively local) and high (putatively generating antidromic activity) laser power stimulations. This behavioral outcome appears counter to the canonical model of basal ganglia movement pathways, in which GPe activation increases movement. Although there is strong support for this canonical model, recent in vivo recordings have found subpopulations of GPe neurons that show activity patterns counter to this model (neurons that increase activity during immobility) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turner and Anderson, 1997</xref>).

Future studies are needed to determine if GPe inhibition of both cell types is necessary for mediating decreased locomotion.

Indeed, low laser power stimulation of nigral axons in the most rostral implant location resulted in increased locomotion, while the most caudal implant location resulted in decreased locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, the enhanced locomotion observed during high laser power stimulation suggests that a subset of nigral neurons projecting to the PPN promote movement. However, the SNr canonically suppresses movement and the direct somatic stimulation of PV +and GAD2 +SNr neurons that send axon collaterals to the PPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElvain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) decreases gross locomotor movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzi and Tan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Since injecting constitutive AAVs into the substantia nigra can infect both GABAergic neurons of the SNr and adjacent dopaminergic neurons of the SNc, it is possible that stimulation of dopaminergic activity may mask the impact of stimulating the GABAergic SNr alone. Both the increased locomotion with high laser power and the lack of change with low laser power was recapitulated when we ran these experiments while selectively stimulating dopaminergic projections from the SNc to the PPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, our findings suggest that activation of the PPN-projecting dopaminergic SNc neurons promotes locomotion, but not through direct actions at the PPN. This is consistent with previous literature showing that SNc dopaminergic neurons send axons to both the PPN and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryczko et al., 2016</xref>) and that direct stimulation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons can increase movement initiation and vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, antidromic stimulation of the SNc may evoke dopamine release into the striatum to increase movement in our high laser power experiments. Future studies are needed to evaluate the motor behavioral impact of the different SNr cell types when inhibiting the entire PPN versus the rostral or caudal PPN subregions.</p><p>By contrast, we find that both high and low power non-selective SNr axon stimulation in the PPN is aversive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7EâG</xref>), while both high and low power selective stimulation of dopaminergic SNc axons in the PPN is rewarding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These findings are particularly interesting because they indicate that the dopaminergic vs GABAergic inputs from the substantia nigra to the PPN serve opposite functions regarding valence signaling. Importantly, these findings indicate that GABAergic input from the SNr is highly aversive and that this aversive signaling occurs through the PPN. Interestingly, these findings also show that dopaminergic SNc neurons do not require antidromic stimulation to signal reward. This means that dopaminergic signaling within the PPN may serve to reinforce behavior.

We find that the GPe only inhibits a subset of caudal GABAergic and glutamatergic PPN neurons. It is possible that the subset of GABAergic PPN neurons targeted by the GPe disinhibits local cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons to increase excitation of the rewarding dopaminergic neuron pathways. Another possibility is that the specific GPe-inhibited PPN population may have particularly aversive properties. For example, PPN neurons that excite amygdala nuclei evoke place avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-aho et al., 2018</xref>). In this case, GPe inhibition of these neurons could be rewarding by removing excitation of amygdala nuclei involved in negative valence processing. To understand the PPN circuitry involved in GPe-mediated place preference, future experimental work must determine whether inhibiting GPe-targeted GABAergic or glutamatergic PPN subpopulations alone is sufficient to evoke place preference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have systematically characterized SNr and GPe inputs across the rostrocaudal axis of the PPN for each cell type â cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic.

In contrast, the GPe strikingly avoids the cholinergic PPN neurons and weakly, but selectively, inhibits a subpopulation of caudal GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. We proposed that the differential inhibition of regionally biased, mixed-cell type PPN subpopulations can alter behavioral outputs. By stimulating these inhibitory basal ganglia axons over the PPN, we show that the SNr evokes place aversion while the GPe evokes place preference and decreases locomotion. Together, our findings show that the SNr and GPe mediate opposing valence processing outcomes through the PPN and support a non-canonical basal ganglia motor pathway in which the GPe decreases locomotion through its projections to the PPN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The skull was stabilized with evenly positioned ear bars and nose cone properly positioned to deliver continuous 1â3% isoflurane and oxygen at a steady flow of 1 L/min throughout the surgery duration. Bupivacaine (5 mg/kg) and carprofen (5 mg/kg) were administered as local anesthetic and analgesic, respectively. A small incision was made on the scalp to visualize bregma and lambda, which were used as references to level the skull. Bilateral holes were drilled at either the coordinates of the SNr (AP â3.1 mm, ML Â±1.4 mm, DV â4.7 mm relative to bregma) or GPe (AP â0.3 mm, ML Â±1.9 mm, DV â3.9 mm relative to bregma). The 5 ÂµL Hamilton microsyringe was positioned and 250 nL virus was injected at a rate of 0.2 ÂµL/min. The syringe was raised and rested 0.5 mm above the injection site for 10 min. For ex vivo optogenetic experiments, AAV1-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP (2.3x10^13 particles per milliliter, Addgene, Cat# 26973) was injected into either the SNr or GPe. For in vivo optogenetic experiments, AAV1-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP 2.0x10^13 particles per milliliter, Addgene, Cat #26973, AAV1-hSyn-EGFP (1.1x10^13 particles per milliliter, Addgene, Cat# 50465), or AAV1-Ef1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA (2.3x10<sup>13</sup> particles per milliliter, Addgene, Cat#20298) was injected into either the SNr or GPe for experimental and control mice, respectively. For mice used in the in vivo optogenetic experiments, an optical fiber (200 Âµm core, 0.22 NA, 3.7 mm length) was implanted over the middle-to-rostral PPN (AP â4.5, ML Â±1.1 mm, DV â3.5 relative to bregma). The skin on either side of the incision site was joined, glued together using VetBond tissue adhesive, and fastened with two wound clips or the optical fiber was fixed in position with dental cement. (C&amp;B-Metabond Quick! Adhesive Luting Cement by Parkell Products Inc, Patterson# 553â3484/CAT# S380; Jet Denture Repair Package by LANG, CAT# 1223F2). Post-surgery, buprenorphine SR (1.5 mg/kg) was administered for long-acting analgesia. Mice were allowed to recover on a heating pad until fully awake and were monitored daily for signs of distress or infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Electrophysiological solutions</title><p>Acute brain slices were prepared in modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solutions with final osmolarities ~300â310 mOsm and ~7.4 pH.

Mice were decapitated and brains were quickly extracted from the skull, keeping the cerebellum intact. For sagittal slices, the brain hemispheres were separated and the medial side was glued onto a 3% agar block fixed to the stage of a semi-automatic Leica VT1200 microtome. 200 Âµm-thick slices were obtained and incubated at 34 Â°C in holding solution for 30 min then kept at room temperature. In all steps, the modified aCSF solutions are bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices in the recording chamber during whole-cell patch clamp experiments were continuously perfused with oxygenated recording aCSF kept at 28â34Â°C using a water bath and in-line Warner heater. Cells were visualized using an Olympus OpenStand upright microscope and 565 nm ThorLabs LED light. Recording pipettes with resistance between 1.5 and 4 MÎ© were prepared using borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc 1B150F-4, 4-inch length, 1.5 mm OD, 0.84 mm ID) with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Model P-97). Recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and Axon Digidata 1550B controlled by Clampex 11.2. Voltage-clamp signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Current-clamp signals were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. At the end of recording, the cell was sealed by moving the recording pipette slightly above the soma and an image was taken of the PPN and pipette tip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Ex vivo optogenetic activation</title><p>Whole-field optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-infected axons in brain slice was achieved with a blue (470 nm) ThorLabs LED light sent to the tissue via a silver mirror. Light intensity measured at the objective back aperture was 13 mW. Light activation was applied at 20 Hz with 2ms pulse intervals for 2 s. All recordings were conducted in the presence of glutamatergic receptor blockers â 50 ÂµM D-AP5 (Tocris Cat#0106 and HelloBio Cat#H0225), and 5 ÂµM NBQX (Tocris Cat#1044 and HelloBio Cat#HB0443) alone or in combination with 20 ÂµM CNQX (HelloBio Cat#HB0205).</p><p>In voltage-clamp, cells were determined to be connected if observable optically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) were measured while holding the cell at â50 mV. In a subset of neurons, 10 ÂµM GABAzine (Tocris Cat#1262 and HelloBio Cat#HB0901) was applied to ensure the oIPSCs were GABA-A receptor mediated. In a few cells (17/54), small inhibitory currents remained with amplitudes averaging about 24% of the first oIPSC measured. Any cells that required greater than 200 pA to be held at â50 mV or that had access resistance that exceeded 30 MÎ© at the start of recording were excluded from oIPSC quantitative analyses as they were likely unhealthy and too leaky; however, the first oIPSC amplitude was used as an approximate measure of input strength in the cell maps (SNr: 21/46; GPe: 11/40). oIPSC amplitudes were measured from the baseline to the peak of each current. The paired pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated from the amplitudes of the first two currents evoked in the 20 Hz train.</p><p>For current-clamp recordings, most patched PPN neurons spontaneously fired, but a few required a small amount of hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current to fire (R)ostral, (C)audal; SNr-PPN<sub>ChAT</sub> R: 3/14, C: 4/23; SNr-PPN<sub>Vgat</sub> R: 2/7, C: 9/19; SNr-PPN<sub>Vglut2</sub> R: 2/13, C: 1/17; GPe-PPN<sub>ChAT</sub> R: 2/7, C: 9/25; GPe-PPN<sub>Vgat</sub> R: 2/7, C: 8/18; GPe-PPN<sub>Vglut2</sub> R: 6/12, C: 7/29 required current. Neurons injected with more than 60 pA were excluded. In this manuscript, we use âpre-stimulation firing frequencyâ to refer to the time period right before optical stimulation. The pre-stimulation firing frequency was measured using the number of action potentials in the 1-s epoch before the start of stimulation. The firing frequency during stimulation was measured using the middle one-second of the 2 s stimulation. The post-stimulation firing frequency was measured in the 1-s epoch immediately following the end of the stimulation. The absolute frequency change is the difference between the pre-simulation and during stimulation frequencies. The rebound frequency change is the difference between the post-stimulation and pre-stimulation frequencies. These values include cells with and without holding current applied. By contrast, the spontaneous firing rate of the cell includes only cells with no holding current applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>In vivo optogenetic activation</title><p>Two behavioral tests, the open field (OF) test and RTPP, were conducted sequentially to assess gross locomotion and place preference in animals of at least 11 weeks old (mean age Â± SEM; SNr-injected mice: 132Â±23.4 days old; GPe-injected mice: 110Â±7.4 days old). Optical stimulation was achieved by the application of blue light (473 nm) at 20 Hz with 2ms pulses (4% duty cycle). Behavioral testing was conducted under both high laser power (4.0â4.5 mW) and low laser power (0.2â0.25 mW) conditions. Low power testing was employed to control for potential behavioral effects related to antidromic stimulation. On day 1, mice underwent OF testing and were randomly assigned to high or low power stimulation conditions. On day 2, mice were tested in the open field arena for a second time under opposite power conditions. On day 3, mice were tested in the RTPP arena for 10 min and were again randomly assigned to high or low power conditions. On day 4, mice were tested in the RTPP arena for 10 min without any stimulation to assess retention of place memory. Finally, on day 5, mice underwent RTPP under opposite power conditions (low vs high) and opposite chamber as stimulation zone (stripes vs spots) to those on Day 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Open field test</title><p>OF test was conducted in an opaque arena measuring 40.64x40.64 x 40.64 cm. Animals were placed in the center of the arena and allowed to explore freely for 10 min. This was followed by 5 min of discontinuous bilateral photostimulation at either high or low power, 5 min of recovery, another 5 min of discontinuous photostimulation at 20 Hz (at either high or low power), and a final 5 min of recovery. The discontinuous photostimulation consisted of three 1 min photostimulation periods interspersed with 1 min intervals of no photostimulation. Movement during the OF test was recorded and analyzed using ANY-maze software (Stoelting Company, Wood Dale, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Real-time place preference</title><p>The real-time place preference (RTPP) apparatus consisted of a rectangular behavioral arena with three chambers, each measuring 24.60x27.94 x 27.94 cm, with a non-reflective gray background. The adjacent chambers had distinct visual cues: one chamber featured stripes and the other spots. These striped and spotted zones were randomly assigned as stimulation zones between animals. The center chamber and one of the adjacent chambers served as neutral zones, while the other adjacent chamber served as a stimulation zone. Animals received unilateral optical stimulation when in the assigned stimulation zone. The laser-on side was randomly chosen and counter-balanced between mice. Mice were also randomly assigned to have low laser power RTPP first or high laser power RTPP first. In each case, mice were given an unstimulated 10 min trial on the day between the first and second RTPP experiment to âunlearnâ which side was stimulated, and the second RTPP experiment stimulated the opposite chamber compared to the first RTPP experiment. For example, one mouse would have high power stimulation on the striped side on day 1, no stimulation on day 2, and low power stimulation on the spotted side on day 3. To mitigate locomotor effects with bilateral stimulation, unilateral optical stimulation was used in RTPP. Individual subjects were placed in the RTPP apparatus and allowed 10 min to explore both compartments. The time spent in each compartment was recorded in real-time using ANY-maze software (Stoelting Company, Wood Dale, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging</title><p>After electrophysiological experiments, brain slices were fixed overnight in a 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in phosphate buffer (PB) solution, pH 7.6 at 4 Â°C. The fixed brain slices were then stored in phosphate buffer (PB) solution until immunostaining.</p><p>Brain slices were also collected at the conclusion of behavioral experiments. Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with phosphate buffer (PB), followed by a fixative solution containing 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PB, pH 7.6, at 4 Â°C. Whole brains were extracted and fixed overnight in the same PFA solution. After fixation, brains were stored in PB solution until further processing. For cubic processing, 200 Âµm-thick sagittal slices were obtained from post-behavioral whole mouse brains using the PELCO easiSlicer Vibratory Tissue Slicer.</p><p>A CUBIC tissue clearing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Susaki et al., 2015</xref>) was combined with immunofluorescence staining as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2020</xref> for all fixed brain slices from both electrophysiological and behavioral experiments. All steps are performed at room temperature on a shaker. Slices were placed in CUBIC reagent 1 for 1â2 days; then washed in PB 3 x for 1 hr each; placed in blocking solution (0.5% fish gelatin in PB) for 3 hr; placed in primary antibodies for 2â3 days; washed in PB 3 x for 2 hr each; placed in secondary antibodies for 2â3 days; washed in PB 3 x for 2 hr each; and placed in CUBIC reagent 2 for 2 hr before mounting onto slides (Fisherbrand 12-550-403) in reagent 2 and sealed with frame-seal incubation chambers (Thermo Scientific AB-0577) and a coverslip (Corning 2845â18).</p><p>Neurobiotin-filled patched neurons were stained with streptavidin antibody (Cy5, Invitrogen Cat#SA1011, 1:1000 or DyLight 405, Invitrogen Cat#21831, 1:1000). Goat anti-ChAT primary antibody (Sigma Cat#AB144P, 1:200) and donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (Invitrogen Cat#A-21447, 1:333) was used to identify the borders of the PPN. On an example slice to show the SNr injection site, sheep anti-TH primary antibody (Novus Biologicals Cat#NB300-110, 1:1000) and donkey anti-sheep (1:100) were used to delineate the GABAergic SNr from the dopamine-rich TH +SNc neurons. To identify the approximate location of patched cells for cell mapping, slices were imaged as tiled z-stacks using a Leica SP8AOBS ++at the Microscopy and Imaging Shared Resource core facility at Georgetown University. Additionally, to verify the injection site and optical implant placement in the brain slices from mice that underwent behavioral testing, tiled z-stacks were obtained using either the aforementioned Leica SP8AOBS ++or a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 at the Georgetown Department of Neuroscience core imaging facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Approximate cell location</title><p>An image of the PPN with the pipette tip still in position was taken at the end of each cell recording and confocal images of the slices after CUBIC clearing were obtained as described above. Confocal images were overlapped with the pipette images using the streptavidin-stained patched cells (which aligned with the pipette tip images) and autofluorescence of the superior cerebellar peduncle (scp) white fibers as landmarks. The perimeter of the PPN was determined by the presence of ChAT +neurons and generally extended from the edge of the SNr to approximately 2/3 up the scp fibers. ChAT +neurons were identified by tdTomato expression in the ChAT-Cre mouse line and anti-ChAT staining in the Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-Cre mouse lines. Since there is variability introduced during the slicing process, we matched slices to three sagittal templates representing 1.00, 1.25, and 1.50 mm lateral to the midline in the Paxinos and Franklinâs Mouse Brain Atlas 4th edition. The most medial slice (1.00 mm lateral to the midline) characteristically had few to no fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle at the edge of the slice where the cerebellum would tether. All neurons on this slice were considered âcaudalâ following the typical shape of the PPN. Slices matching 1.25 and 1.50 mm from the midline had a region of densely clustered cholinergic neurons and a region of loosely dispersed cholinergic neurons. An oval ROI was created following the length and orientation of ChAT +neuron spread. The midline of the oval demarcated the rostral and caudal regions. Overlapping the midlines allowed us to evaluate rostral-caudal differences across mice with a small margin of error, particularly along the midline. For this reason, we also mapped the location of patched cells, which shows the distance from the midline and can reveal medial-lateral differences. The XY coordinates were determined using Fiji software and plotted in Igor. The color scale applied to the points represented the amplitude of the first oIPSC and ranged from 0 to 250 pA so that amplitudes greater than 250 pA were shown in the same maximal bright color.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Approximate implant location</title><p>To verify the location of the optical implant, anatomical landmarks for locating the PPN were identified by immunofluorescent labeled PPN cholinergic neurons. Sections containing visible optical fiber scarring were stained with anti-ChAT immunofluorescent labeling. These histological images were then visually matched to the corresponding sagittal planes of the stereotaxic atlas, based on the identified anatomical landmarks. The approximate position of the optical cannula was localized in the histological images and was in the middle-to-rostral part of the PPN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological traces were processed in Igor Pro 9 (Wavemetrics), and all statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.5. All parametric data in text is reported as mean Â± SEM. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used to compare between two groups and one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnettâs post hoc test was used to compare three or more groups. If the equality of variances was violated (i.e. the ratio of the largest and smallest standard deviations was greater than 2 and Bartlett test was statistically significant), Welchâs ANOVA test was alternatively used. Two-way ANOVA followed by Fisherâs LSD post hoc test was performed for percent of pre-optical stimulation frequency as each comparison group was predetermined. Non-parametric data in text is reported as median [interquartile range (IQR)]. Boxplots show medians, 25th and 75th percentiles as first and third quartile box edges, and 9th and 91st percentiles as whiskers. We used the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test for comparing two groups and the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons. As each comparison group within the Kruskal-Wallis tests was planned and stand-alone, uncorrected Dunnâs post hoc test was performed to determine significance between groups. To determine if caudal GPe connectivity is significantly greater than rostral GPe connectivity, as expected from axon projection patterns, a one-tailed Fisherâs exact test and odds ratio effect size was performed. For correlation matrix analyses, non-parametric Spearman r was computed. Statistical details of experiments can be found in the text, figure legends, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Biological replicates are individual cells (n) from 6 separate mice (N=3 males and 3 females) in the electrophysiological experiments and are individual mice of both sexes in the behavioral experiments (numbers described in results text). Same-sex littermates were randomly allocated to control or experimental groups, and experimenters were not blinded during experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Georgetown University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Evans 2020-052).

Using a combination of optogenetics-assisted electrophysiology and behavioral assays in genetically defined mouse lines, the authors show that SNr projections broadly inhibit all PPN subtypes along the rostrocaudal axis, whereas GPe projections are mostly restricted to the caudal PPN and predominantly target glutamatergic neurons, with a lesser effect on GABAergic neurons. Activation of these inputs in vivo revealed opposing behavioral effects: SNr stimulation increased locomotion and caused avoidance in the real-time place preference (RTPP) task, while GPe stimulation reduced locomotion and increased time spent in the stimulation zone.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The evidence for functional connectivity between SNr and GPe inputs and specific PPN cell types is solid and highlights a prominent influence of SNr across the PPN. The identification of a GPe projection that selectively targets caudal glutamatergic PPN neurons is unexpected and highly relevant to understanding basal ganglia-brainstem interactions. The study stands out for its systematic cell-type-specific approach and the combination of electrophysiological and behavioral data. Importantly, the authors addressed key concerns from the initial review by performing new analyses and adding important controls:</p><p>Motor activity was re-analyzed at higher temporal resolution, revealing more nuanced effects of stimulation (Fig. S2).</p><p>The concern that motor effects might confound RTPP performance was mitigated by analyzing unstimulated test sessions, which showed that place preference or aversion persisted in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 7G).</p><p>The potential recruitment of SNc dopaminergic projections was directly tested using DAT-Cre mice, confirming that dopaminergic axon stimulation drives locomotion and reward but does not explain the aversive effect seen with broader SNr activation (Fig. S3).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the revised analyses and added data strengthen the conclusions, the interpretation of the behavioral effects remains somewhat limited by the use of RTPP, which can be influenced by motor changes, even with unilateral stimulation. Nonetheless, the additional controls and thorough discussion now acknowledge and address these caveats appropriately.</p><p>Some minor clarifying edits would enhance the manuscript's precision and readability, including improvements to terminology, data presentation, figure referencing, and the organization of behavioral and statistical reporting.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>This is a strong and compelling study that provides a detailed and novel characterization of basal ganglia inputs to the PPN and their behavioral relevance. The authors were responsive to reviewer feedback, and the revised manuscript is significantly improved. The findings advance our understanding of how basal ganglia output pathways engage brainstem circuits to modulate locomotion and valence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102308.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fallah</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgetown University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Udobi</surname><given-names>Kenea C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgetown University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Swiatek</surname><given-names>Aleksandra E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgetown University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Chelsea B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgetown University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Rebekah C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Georgetown University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Fallah and colleagues characterize the connectivity between two basal ganglia output nuclei, the SNr and GPe, and the pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem nucleus that is part of the mesencephalic locomotor region.

Others have found that there is minimal overlap between the three cell types within the PPN discussed in this manuscript (Wang and Morales 2009; Yoo et al. 2017; Steinkellner, Yoo, and Hnasko 2019). One important line of future investigations is to look at the specific inputs onto recently identified subsets of the glutamatergic PPN neurons such as Chx10- and Rbp4-expressing neurons (GoÃ±i-Erro et al. 2023; Ferreira-Pinto et al. 2021).

While the best experiment would be to stimulate the axons projecting to each specific cell type of the PPN, this is not currently possible due to methodological limitations and lack of studies dissecting which SNr and GPe subpopulations project to each cell type of the PPN. However, in future studies, we plan to leverage the ability of AAV1 to jump a synapse along with Cre/Flp viruses and mouse lines to selectively inhibit cholinergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic PPN neurons that receive GPe or SNr input to elucidate the contribution of each cell type in mediating behavioral changes in movement and valence processing.</p><p>To address these important future directions, we have added additional text in the discussion in lines 771-772 and 782-785.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fallah et al carefully dissect projections from SNr and GPe - two key basal ganglia nuclei - to the PPN, an important brainstem nucleus for motor control.

For behavior, the youngest mice used were 11 weeks old at time of behavior (8 weeks old at injection). Mice in the GPe-stimulated condition were 110 Â± 7.4 SEM days old and mice in the SNr-stimulated condition 132 Â± 23.4 SEM days old.

The authors first found that SNr projections spread over the entire PPN, whereas GPe projections are mostly concentrated in the caudal portion of the nucleus. Then the authors characterized the postsynaptic effects of optogenetically activating these basal ganglia inputs and identified the PPN's cell subtypes using genetically encoded fluorescent reporters. Activation of inputs from the SNr inhibited virtually all PPN neurons. Activation of inputs from the GPe predominantly inhibited glutamatergic neurons in the caudal PPN, and to a lesser extent GABAergic neurons. Finally, the authors tested the effects of activating these inputs on locomotor activity and place preference.

The effect of SNr on locomotion might be showing a rebound of activity in cholinergic neurons, which innervate dopamine neurons and induce locomotion. Furthermore, the variability between animals should be reported, Figure 7C doesn't show a standard deviation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and could reveal different early and late effects of basal ganglia axon stimulation. We have added a time course graph of the trial averages for the distance traveled in the open field with higher temporal resolution (10s vs 1min). This is included in supplemental Figure S2A&amp;B.</p><p>The variability between animals was shown as shaded area, but was too light and transparent so it was difficult to see in Figure 7C. We have changed this shading to error bars for better visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) SNc projects to the PPN. It has recently been shown that PPN neurons respond robustly to dopaminergic activation, including effects on motor activity (Juarez Tello et al., 2024). The transductions shown in Figure S1 clearly cover to entirety of the SNc. Dopamine blockers should be used in the ex vivo experiments to rule out dopaminergic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and one we were particularly interested in as far as the behavioral experiments. We thank the reviewer for bringing this up because it led us to a really interesting result. We have now run an additional experiment using DAT-cre mice and a cre-dependent ChR2 using the same injection site at our constitutive ChR2 experiments. We found that selectively stimulating the SNc dopaminergic axons replicates the increased locomotion at high laser power and replicates the no change in locomotion at low laser power as seen with our constitutive ChR2 experiment. However, the selective dopaminergic axon activation in the PPN is rewarding at both high and low power, while the constitutive ChR2 activation is aversive. We have added these data to supplemental figure S3, and have added text in the results (lines 595624) and discussion (lines 695-734) about this new exciting finding.</p><p>While we canât exclude the possibility of dopamine influence on the electrophysiology experiments (via changes in input resistance or channel properties), the fast synaptic currents measured are uncharacteristic of inhibitory D2 receptor currents (which would be slow), and are inhibited by the GABAa receptor blocker, GABAzine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Activation of glutamatergic neurons in the caudal PPN elicits locomotion while the same stimulation in the rostral PPN terminates locomotion. In line with this, the authors report important differences in glutamatergic neurons in the rostral vs caudal PPN (Fig. 5). For the behavioral experiments, the location of the optic fiber is not reported. This is essential for the interpretation of the behavioral experiments. Based on the recent literature, inhibiting glutamatergic neurons in the rostral and in the caudal PPN will produce opposing effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree the rostral and caudal PPN differences are functionally important. In Figure 7B, we have mapped the location of the optical fiber tip for each experiment. Our implant location was generally in the rostral-middle part of the PPN and we have added this to the methods section of the revised manuscript in lines 887 and 1048. While we did not have many implant locations that were specifically rostral or specifically caudal, we did evaluate the behavioral response for our most rostrally-located implant and our most-caudally located implant in the SN axon stimulation experiment. We found that low-power laser activation of nigral axons in the most rostral implant resulted in increased locomotion but in the most caudal implant resulted in decreased locomotion. This increased locomotion exactly what we would expect when rostral PPN neurons (that normally inhibit movement) are preferentially inhibited, and decreased locomotion is what we would expect when caudal PPN neurons (that normally promote movement) are inhibited. Future experiments using more precise rostral and caudal implant locations will be needed to fully parse out the functional role of rostral vs caudal PPN. See Figure S4 (two green implant sites are circled for one mouse because the implants were bilateral).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Even though the authors made an effort to dissect out the motor component during the RTPP task, this was not entirely achieved. Low laser power was still able to decrease activity following GPe stimulation, causing the animal to spend more time in the stimulated compartment. It is not clear the reason for using RTPP as opposed to CPP, which will not have the confound of the effects on motor activity. The interpretation of these data is problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important consideration, and the reviewer is correct that we canât completely eliminate a motor contribution to our RTPP experiment. We attempted to minimize potential motor confounds by utilizing unilateral stimulation and our supplemental videos show that the mice can escape the stimulated chamber.</p><p>However, to address this comment, we analyzed the second day of RTPP, where no stimulation was applied in either chamber. Specifically, we evaluated the time spent in the stimulated chamber during the first minute of the unstimulated RTPP task. We found that the mice that had SN stimulation still avoided the previously stimulated chamber and the mice that had GPe axon stimulation still preferred the previously stimulated chamber. These data have been added as Figure 7G and in the results section lines 564-575.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The resting membrane potential for cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurons is not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Since a majority of PPN neurons are spontaneously active, we have reported the average membrane voltage during the pre-optical stimulation period in supplementary table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) During the RTPP, the animals were stimulated unilaterally with the purpose of reducing the optogenetic effects on locomotion, but no data support this claim. Please report the locomotor measurements during unilateral stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we have analyzed the speed of the mouse in each compartment (stimulated vs non-stimulated) during the RTPP task. We found that the mean speed does differ, in the direction expected (i.e., mice are on average slower in the GPe stimulated zone where they spend more time, and mice are on average faster in the SNr stimulated zone where they spend less time). This is expected because when the mouse spends more time in a zone, it is more likely to spend time grooming or staying still, but it could still be evidence of motor response to the stimulation. To evaluate how fast the mouse is able to move with and without unilateral stimulation, we measured maximum speed in the stimulated and unstimulated zone. We found that maximum speed does not differ between stimulated and unstimulated zones in either the SNr or GPe group.

This contrasts with the high density of GABAergic neurons in the rostral PPN reported in the literature, and therefore, the probability of recording GABAergic neurons will be much higher in the rostral PPN. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that there are more GABA neurons in the rostral region, but on a sagittal slice, the rostral region occupies a smaller area compared to caudal and there is a notable cluster of GABAergic neurons in the caudal region (Mena-Segovia et al. 2009). The number of visible and healthy cells with obvious fluorescence against background fluorescence in the heavily myelinated tissue of the PPN is unpredictable and it is possible that the dense number of GABA neurons in the rostral region conglomerates the fluorescence of individual cell somas, making it difficult to detect as many rostral neurons. While we did our best to equally patch rostral and caudal neurons based on our best judgment during the experiment, neurons were ultimately designated as ârostralâ or âcaudalâ after post-hoc staining for the cholinergic neurons, as described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Describe how the rostral and caudal PPN regions were defined and how the authors ensured consistency across recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details about the definition of rostral vs caudal PPN in to the methods in lines 1042-1053.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Please report the proportion of GABAergic neurons showing STD vs STP for rostral and caudal PPN.

We have defined STD as PPR&lt;0.95 and STP as PPR&gt;1.05 and added the proportions of caudal and rostral GABAergic PPN neurons with each type of short-term synaptic plasticity to lines 253-257.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Please report whether the miceâs compartment preferences during the habituation were taken into account for the selection of the laser-on compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>Mice were not habituated to the chamber in the unstimulated condition prior to the RTPP experiment. Laser-on side was randomly chosen and counter-balanced between mice. Mice were also randomly assigned to have low laser power RTPP first or high laser power RTPP first. In each case, mice were given an unstimulated 10-minute trial on the day between the first and second RTPP experiment to âunlearnâ which side was stimulated and the second RTPP experiment stimulated the opposite chamber compared to the first RTPP experiment. For example, one mouse would have high power stimulation on the striped side on day 1, no stimulation on day 2, and low power stimulation on the spotted side on day 3.
