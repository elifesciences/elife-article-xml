information to guide decision-making. Such goal-directed behaviour relies on circuits involving cortical and subcortical structures. Notably, a functional heterogeneity exists within the medial prefrontal, insular, and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) in rodents. The role of the latter in goal-directed behaviour has been debated, but recent data indicate that the ventral and lateral subregions of the OFC are needed to integrate changes in the relationships between actions and their outcomes. Neuromodulatory agents are also crucial components of prefrontal functions and behavioural flexibility might depend upon the noradrenergic modulation of the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, we assessed whether noradrenergic innervation of the OFC plays a role in updating action-outcome relationships in male rats. We used an identity-based reversal task and found that depletion or chemogenetic silencing of noradrenergic inputs within the OFC rendered rats unable to associate new outcomes with previously acquired actions. Silencing of noradrenergic inputs in the prelimbic cortex or depletion of dopaminergic inputs in the OFC did not reproduce this deficit. Together, our results suggest that noradrenergic projections to the OFC are required to update goal-directed actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>reversal</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>decision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE37-0019 NORAD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kremer</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name><name><surname>Coutureau</surname><given-names>Etienne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECO20160736024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerpa</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Silencing noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the ventral and lateral regions of the orbitofrontal cortex prevents the updating of previously established goal-directed actions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals use their knowledge of an environment to engage in behaviours that meet their basic needs and desires. In a dynamic environment, an animal must also be able to update its understanding of the setting, particularly when the outcomes or consequences of its actions change. Numerous studies indicate that goal-directed behaviours are supported by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and current research suggests a parcellation of functions within prefrontal regions in rodents (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Doherty et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coutureau and Parkes, 2018</xref>). Specifically, the prelimbic region or Area 32 (A32) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paxinos and Watson, 2014</xref>, of the medial PFC is needed to initially acquire goal-directed actions and learn the relationship between distinct actions and their outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Killcross and Coutureau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tran-Tu-Yen et al., 2009</xref>), whereas the gustatory region of the insular cortex is required to recall the current value of these outcomes to guide choice between competing actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balleine and Dickinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parkes and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parkes et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the ventral (VO) and lateral (LO) subregions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are required for goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhodes and Murray, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiuzat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wassum, 2022</xref>), specifically to update previously established instrumental associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Behavioural flexibility also requires activity in noradrenergic (NA) neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), which are thought to track uncertainty in the current situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cope et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGaughy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tait et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Most notably, compelling theoretical models hypothesize that the LC interacts with the PFC to support behavioural flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sara and Bouret, 2012</xref>). Taken together, these data raise the intriguing possibility that LC NA innervation of the OFC might be needed to update previously established goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadacca et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerpa et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we examined whether LC NA inputs to the OFC are required to learn that a specific outcome associated with a given action has changed, and to recall this information to guide choice.</p><p>Specifically, after learning initial action-outcome (A-O) associations, rats were required to flexibly encode and use new associations during an instrumental reversal task. First, we depleted NA fibres using anti-DβH saporin (SAP) and observed a profound deficit in the ability to use the reversed A-O associations to guide choice. We then found that this deficit is not present when we depleted dopaminergic (DA) signalling in the OFC. Finally, we investigated the temporal and anatomical specificity of this effect using viral vector-mediated expression of inhibitory DREADDs. We found that silencing LC:<sup>vlOFC</sup>, but not LC:<sup>A32</sup>, projections impaired the ability to acquire and express the reversed instrumental contingencies. Collectively, these data suggest that LC NA projections to the OFC are likely required for both encoding and recalling the identity of an expected instrumental outcome, specifically when that identity has changed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Initial goal-directed learning does not require NA signalling in the OFC</title><p>We first assessed if the initial acquisition and expression of goal-directed actions requires NA signalling in the OFC using the behavioural design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

In addition, when given concurrent access to both outcomes, all groups consumed more of the non-devalued outcome, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the satiety-induced outcome devaluation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, NA depletion in PFC regions does not appear to affect the initial learning or expression of goal-directed actions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NA signalling in the OFC is required to adapt to changes in outcome identity</title><p>Next, we tested whether NA depletion affected the ability to encode and express new A-O associations using an instrumental outcome-identity reversal paradigm. We found that performance increased across reversal training days (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 22.73, p&lt;0.001), but there was no effect of group (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 0.81, p=0.37), treatment (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 0.08, p=0.78), or any significant interactions between these factors (all F<sub>(1,53)</sub> values &lt; 1.86, p-values &gt; 0.17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We then evaluated if the rats were able to use these reversed associations in the outcome devaluation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). While the CTL groups reduced their responding on the action associated with the devalued outcome, NA-depleted animals did not. Statistical analyses confirmed this observation revealing no main effects of group, treatment, or devaluation (all F<sub>(1,53)</sub> values &lt;2.89, p-values &gt;0.10), and no significant devaluation × group interaction (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 0.007, p=0.93). However, there was a significant devaluation × treatment interaction (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 5.00, p&lt;0.05) and simple effect analyses confirmed that the CTL groups biased their responding toward the lever associated with the non-devalued outcome (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 7.35, p&lt;0.01), while rats in the depleted groups did not (F<sub>(1,53)</sub> = 0.15, p=0.70). Importantly, all groups rejected the devalued food during the consumption test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results show that depletion of NA innervation to the OFC and other prefrontal regions renders rats unable to associate new outcomes to acquired actions.

We first assessed the impact of full catecholaminergic (CA) depletion on outcome-identity reversal by infusing the CA-targeting toxin 6-OHDA in the OFC (6-OHDA n=12; CTL n=8). We then depleted DA afferents by combining the 6-OHDA infusion with a systemic injection of desipramine (Desi) to protect NA fibres (6-OHDA+Desi, n=9; CTL n=8).

However, injection of anti-DHβ SAP or 6-OHDA in the OFC also caused a significant reduction of fibres in other regions of the PFC, most likely because of NA fibres crossing the OFC before entering these other prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandler and Waterhouse, 2012</xref>). Most notably, in both of the previous experiments, we observed depletion of NA fibres in A32 (or prelimbic cortex), a region that has been heavily implicated in goal-directed behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbit and Balleine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Killcross and Coutureau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tran-Tu-Yen et al., 2009</xref>).

These associations are however flexible, being amenable to updating when the identity of the outcome changes. Our data demonstrate that NA inputs to the OFC might be an essential component of this updating process. This conclusion is based on a body of complementary evidence. First, we demonstrated that animals with a loss of NA inputs in the OFC can initially learn and express A-O contingencies, but are impaired when the identity of the outcome has been modified. Importantly, such deficits were also observed when NA depletion occurred immediately before the encoding of the new A-O contingencies. We then showed that this impairment was selective to NA inputs, because combined depletions of DA and NA, but not of DA alone, induced a profound deficit in outcome reversal. Finally, we investigated the temporal and anatomical specificity of this effect using an NA-specific retrograde virus carrying inhibitory DREADDs to selectively target either LC:<sup>vlOFC</sup> or LC:<sup>A32</sup> pathways. We found that silencing LC:<sup>vlOFC</sup>, but not LC:<sup>A32</sup>, projections impaired the rats’ ability to acquire and express the reversed instrumental contingencies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NA inputs into the OFC, but not the A32, are required for A-O updating</title><p>The use of the SAP toxin led to a dramatic decrease of NA fibres density in all analysed cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This may be due to diffusion of the toxin from the injection site or to the existence of collateral LC neurons and/or fibres passing through the ventral portion of the OFC, but targeting other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>). However, injection of 6-OHDA led to less offsite NA depletion suggesting that a large part of the previous observation is toxin-specific. Indeed, no significant loss of NA fibres was visible in the insula cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which has been previously implicated in goal-directed behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balleine and Dickinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parkes and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parkes et al., 2015</xref>). We did nevertheless observe an offsite depletion in more proximal prefrontal areas (prelimbic/A32 and MO), albeit a more modest depletion that what was observed using the SAP toxin. Several studies have described the projection pattern of LC cells. These studies, using various techniques, indicate that LC cells mainly target a single region, and that only a small proportion of LC neurons collateralize to minor targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plummer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, even if the OFC NA innervation is presumably specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>), we cannot rule out a possible collateralization of some neurons toward neighbouring prefrontal areas (including A32 and MO). We have previously discussed that the posterior ventral portion of the OFC is an entry point for LC fibres en passant, which ultimately target other prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We then used a CAV2 vector carrying the NA-specific promoter PRS to target either the LC<sup>:vlOFC</sup> or the LC:<sup>A32</sup> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>). It has been shown that the CAV2 vector can infect axons-of-passage, however the vector does not spread more than 200 µm from the injection site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, when targeting the OFC, we injected anteriorly to the level where the highest density of fibres of passage is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>) in order to minimize infection of such fibres and restrict inhibition to our pathway of interest.</p><p>Overall, the current behavioural results are in line with our previous work showing that the ability to associate new outcomes to previously acquired actions is impaired following chemogenetic inhibition of the VO and LO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>) or disconnection of the VO and LO from the submedius thalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fresno et al., 2019</xref>). These results point to a role for the ventral and lateral parts of the OFC and its NA innervation in updating A-O associations. However, it is worth mentioning that different subregions of the OFC, both along the medio-lateral and antero-posterior axes of OFC, display clear functional heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradfield and Hart, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panayi and Killcross, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barreiros et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, while we have previously focused on the anatomical heterogeneity of the NA innervation in these prefrontal subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>), a thorough characterization of its functional role in each of these subregions still needs to be addressed. We must also acknowledge that only male rats were used in the current study. The LC displays some anatomical and physiological variations between male and female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joshi and Chandler, 2020</xref>), therefore a thorough characterization would also need to integrate this sex factor.</p><p>Our key finding is that NA inputs to the OFC are required for updating the association between an action and its outcome. Indeed, a similar impairment was observed when NA depletion was performed either prior to initial training or prior to reversal training, which indicates that the reversal period is critically reliant on NA inputs. In addition, chemogenetic silencing of the LC:<sup>vlOFC</sup> pathway before the reversal training, or before testing also produced similar impairments, which further demonstrates that OFC NA inputs are required for both the encoding and the recall of new A-O associations. These results are consistent with recent views on the role of the OFC in goal-directed behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panayi and Killcross, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerpa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to NA inputs to the OFC, our results show that NA inputs to A32 (the prelimbic cortex) are not required for responding based on initial or reversed instrumental contingencies. These data add to the current literature indicating a major dissociation in the role of NA inputs to different prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>). Indeed, NA inputs to the medial wall of the PFC are required for attentional regulation. Specifically, lesioning NA inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGaughy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newman et al., 2008</xref>) or chemogenetic inhibition of NA inputs to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cope et al., 2019</xref>) alters attentional set-shifting, while NA recapture inhibition via atomoxetine improves it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newman et al., 2008</xref>). OFC NA depletion can also alter cue-outcome reversal, but not dimensional shift, in an attentional set-shifting task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mokler et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, it was also shown that reversible inactivation of the medial OFC (mOFC) decreased performance accuracy on a two-armed bandit task in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, performance accuracy was also impaired following systemic, but not intra-mOFC, administration of an NA antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson et al., 2022</xref>). This result seems consistent with our finding showing that reversal learning and expression is intact when the LC:<sup>A32</sup> pathway is silenced and may suggest a potential role for the ventral and lateral regions of OFC, rather than mOFC, in this effect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NA, but not DA, inputs to the OFC are required for A-O updating</title><p>Using a strategy which allows for a differential depletion of DA and/or NA fibres, we found that NA-dependent mechanisms are required during the encoding and recall of new A-O. The role of cortical DA-dependent mechanisms in goal-directed behaviour remains poorly understood, but we have previously shown that DA signalling in the prelimbic cortex/A32 plays a critical role in the detection of contingency degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naneix et al., 2009</xref>). Such detection is likely to involve the processing of non-expected rewards which induces, at the level of A32, a DA-dependent reward prediction error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz and Dickinson, 2000</xref>). These results therefore raise the possibility that the coordination of goal-directed behaviour under environmental changes might depend on a DA-A32 system to adapt to causal contingencies and an NA-OFC system to adapt to changes in outcome identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerpa et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is not yet clear if the NA-OFC system is also involved in detecting the causal relationship between an action and its outcome (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerpa et al., 2021</xref>, for a discussion). Some have reported impaired adaptation to contingency changes following inhibition of VO and LO or BDNF knockdown in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whyte et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>), while another study showed that inhibition of VO/LO leaves sensitivity to degradation intact, at least during an initial test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a recent paper in marmosets demonstrates that inactivation of anterior OFC (Area 11) improves instrumental contingency degradation, whereas overactivation impairs degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). The potential role of the rodent ventral and lateral regions of OFC, and of NA innervation to the OFC, in adapting to degradation of instrumental contingencies requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Updating goal-directed behaviour</title><p>When trained on reversed contingencies, animals encode the new A-O associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fresno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>). Under similar experimental conditions, past research has shown that reversal learning performance is the result of updating prior existing A-O contingencies without unlearning the initial contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradfield and Balleine, 2017</xref>). In other words, the animals build a partition between a state for the new contingencies and the initial state of old contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart and Balleine, 2016</xref>). Current research has proposed that the OFC is critically involved in this partition of information when task states change without explicit notice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadacca et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wikenheiser and Schoenbaum, 2016</xref>).

Given that the deficit in goal-directed behaviour was restricted to the reversal phase, including both reversal training and the test based on reversed contingencies, it is likely that NA-OFC is involved in both creating new states and in the ‘online’ use of the information included in this new state. Such a proposal is in accordance with popular LC-NA system theories suggesting that a rise in NA activity allows for behavioural flexibility when a change in contingencies is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadacca et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results provide evidence for the involvement of NA inputs to ventral and lateral OFC in the updating and use of new A-O associations.

months, were obtained from the Centre d’Elevage Janvier (France). Rats were housed in pairs with ad libitum access to water and standard lab chow prior to behavioural experiments. Rats were handled daily for 3 days prior to the beginning of the experiments and were put on food restriction 2 days before behaviour to maintain them at approximately 90% of their ad libitum feeding weight. The facility was maintained at 21 ± 1°C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 8:00 am). Environmental enrichment was provided by tinted polycarbonate tubes and nesting material, in accordance with current French (Council directive 2013-118, February 1, 2013) and European (directive 2010-63, September 22, 2010, European Community) laws and policies regarding animal experimentation. The experiments received approval from the local Bordeaux Ethics Committee (CE50).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p>For all experiments, rats were anaesthetized with 5% inhalant isoflurane gas with oxygen and placed in a stereotaxic frame with atraumatic ear bars (Kopf Instruments) in a flat skull position. Anaesthesia was maintained with 1.5% isoflurane and complemented with a subcutaneous injection of ropivacaïne (a bolus of 0.1 mL at 2 mg/mL) at the incision site. After each injection, the injector was kept in place for an additional 10 min before being removed. Rats were given 4 weeks to recover following surgery. Injection sites were confirmed histologically after the completion of behavioural experiments.</p><p>In the first experiment (n=57), we used a toxin selective for NA neurons (SAP) to target and deplete NA terminals in the VO and LO. For half of the rats (‘Pre’ groups, n=29), surgery was performed before the initial instrumental training and testing phase, for the other half surgery was performed after the initial training and testing (‘Post’ groups, n=28). Intracerebral injections were made using repeated pressure pulses delivered via a glass micropipette connected to a pressure injector (Picospritzer III, Parker). For SAP groups (Pre n=15; Post n=15), 0.1 µL of anti-DβH SAP (0.1 µg/µL) was bilaterally injected at one site targeting both VO and LO, while CTL rats (Pre n=14; Post n=13) received 0.1 µL of inactive IgG SAP (0.1 µg/µL). Injection coordinates (in mm from Bregma) were determined from the atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paxinos and Watson, 2014</xref>: +3.5 antero-posterior (AP), ±2.2 medio-lateral (ML), and –5.4 dorso-ventral (DV).</p><p>We then used a toxin selective for CA neurons (6-OHDA hydrochloride) and a noradrenaline uptake-blocker (Desi) to target and deplete DA neurons in the VO and LO. All rats underwent surgery after the initial instrumental training phase. Rats were then allocated to the full CA depletion condition (group 6-OHDA n=12; CTL n=8) or the specific DA depletion condition (6-OHDA+Desi n=9; CTL n=8). 6-OHDA (4 µg/µL) was dissolved in vehicle solution containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.1% ascorbic acid. A volume of 0.2 µL of 6-OHDA was bilaterally injected in the OFC at the same coordinates as for the first experiment. Animals in the CTL group received injections of the vehicle solution. Thirty minutes before the surgical procedure, animals in the 6-OHDA+Desi group received a systemic (i.p.) injection of Desi (25 mg/mL) at a volume of 1 mL/kg.</p><p>In the chemogenetic experiments (n=42), we employed a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) vector equipped with an NA-selective synthetic promoter (PRS) and inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) to specifically target LC:<sup>vlOFC</sup> and LC:<sup>A32</sup> NA projections. This viral construct was designed and tested at the Plateforme de Vectorologie de Montpellier, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Montpellier, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plateau-igmm.pvm.cnrs.fr/?vector=cav-prs-ha-hm4di">https://plateau-igmm.pvm.cnrs.fr/?vector=cav-prs-ha-hm4di</ext-link>. All rats underwent surgery before the initial instrumental training phase. All animals received 1 μL bilateral injections of the adenovirus (titre 3.5×10<sup>12</sup> pp/mL), which were performed using a 10 μL Hamilton syringe and a stereotax-mounted injection pump (World Precision Instruments) at a flow rate of 100 nL/min. To target both VO and LO, rats (n=25) were injected at the following coordinates (mm from Bregma): +3.7 AP, ±2.0 ML, –5.0 DV, and +3.2 AP, ±2.8 ML, –5.2 DV (2 injection sites per hemisphere).

In order to obtain a high baseline of c-Fos activation, rats underwent a stress procedure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, rats were administered i.p. with either vehicle or DCZ (0.1 mg/kg) 45 min before being placed in a Plexiglas shock chamber equipped with stainless steel rods on the floor and a circuit generator connected to a scrambler and a timing unit. Rats received five shocks (0.5 s, 0.8 mA) randomly interspersed over 10 min (<italic>stress</italic> condition). As a control of c-Fos activation, we included in the experimental design animals administered with vehicle, but left untouched in their home cage (<italic>no stress</italic> condition). Rats were perfused 90 min after the procedure and coronal slices collected as described in the Histology section. For hM4Di/c-Fos colocalization analysis, sections were taken (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) from antero-posterior levels of the LC from –9.50 to –10.0 mm from Bregma (vehicle/no stress, n=2; vehicle-stress, n=4; DCZ-stress, n=4). Quantification of the percentage of LC hM4Di-positive cells (mCherry, red) that co-express c-Fos (Alexa 488, green) was performed by a trained observer blind to the experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioural apparatus</title><p>For all behavioural experiments, training and testing was conducted in eight identical operant chambers (40 cm width × 30 cm depth × 35 cm height, Imetronic, Pessac, France) individually enclosed in sound and light-resistant wooden chambers (74 × 46 × 50 cm<sup>3</sup>). Each chamber was equipped with two pellet dispensers that delivered grain (Rodent Grain-Based Diet, 45 mg, Bio-Serv) or sugar (LabTab Sucrose Tablet, 45 mg, TestDiet) pellets into a food port when activated. For instrumental conditioning, two retractable levers were located on each side of the food port. Each chamber had a ventilation fan producing a background noise of 55 dB. During the session, the chamber was illuminated by four LEDs in the ceiling. Experimental events were controlled and recorded by a computer located in the room and equipped with the POLY software (Imetronic).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioural protocol</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Initial training and test</title><p>The training procedure was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>. On days 1–3, rats were trained to retrieve food pellets from the food port. During each daily session, 40 sugar and 40 grain pellets were delivered pseudo-randomly every 60 s, on average. Following food port training, rats received 12 daily sessions of instrumental training, during which they were required to learn initial A-O associations. During these sessions, each lever, in alternation, was presented twice for a maximum of 10 min or until 20 outcomes were earned. The inter-trial interval between lever presentations was 2.5 min (i.e., the session could last up to 50 min and the rats could obtain a maximum of 80 food pellets). The A-O associations and the order of lever presentations were counterbalanced between rats and days. During the first three sessions, lever pressing was continuously reinforced with a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule. Then, the probability of receiving an outcome was reduced, first with a random ratio (RR) 5 schedule (days 4–6), then with an RR10 (days 7–9,) and an RR20 schedule (days 10–12).</p><p>Outcome devaluation tests were performed 1 day after the last instrumental training session. First, to induce sensory-specific satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rolls et al., 1986</xref>), rats received access to one of the two outcomes (20 g) for 1 hr in a set of plastic feeding cages to which they were previously habituated. Immediately after the satiety procedure, rats were returned to the operant chambers where they were given a choice test in extinction (i.e., unrewarded) with both levers available for 10 min. The devalued (sated) food was counterbalanced between rats. Following the extinction test, animals were returned to the plastic feeding cages and given a consumption test of satiety-induced devaluation, during which they received 10 min concurrent access to both types of food pellets (10 g of each). The amount consumed of each pellet type was measured to confirm that the satiety-induced devaluation was effective and that rats were able to distinguish between the sensory features of the different food pellets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Reversal training and test</title><p>Following the initial phase, rats were trained on reversed A-O associations with a procedure adapted from previous studies in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fresno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the identity of outcomes was switched so that rats had to update previously established A-O associations, always keeping a RR20 schedule of reinforcement. Following reversal training, outcome devaluation tests were conducted in the same manner as previously described.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chemogenetics</title><p>The DREADD agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final volume of 50 mg/mL, aliquoted in small tubes (50 μL) and stored at –80°C (stock solution). For behavioural experiments, our stock solution was diluted in physiological saline to a final injectable volume of 0.1 mg/kg and administered systemically (i.p.) 40–45 min prior to testing at a volume of 10 mL/kg. Fresh injectable solutions were prepared from stock aliquots on the day of the usage. DCZ was prepared and injected under low light conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of all behavioural experiments, rats were injected with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (Exagon Euthasol) and perfused transcardially with 60 mL of saline followed by 260 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same PFA 4% solution overnight and then transferred to a 0.1 M PB solution or to a 0.1 M PB with 30% saccharose solution (6-OHDA experiment). Subsequently, 40 µm coronal sections were cut using a VT1200S Vibratome (Leica Microsystems) or freezing microtome for the 6-OHDA experiment. Every fourth section was collected to form a series. DAB staining was performed for DβH (for the SAP and the 6-OHDA experiments), TH (6-OHDA experiment), HA, and mCherry (chemogenetic experiments).</p><p>Free-floating sections were first rinsed (4×5 min) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) and then incubated in PBST containing 0.5% (for mCherry) or 1% (for DβH and TH) hydrogen peroxide solution (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 30 min in the dark.

Quantification of DβH- and TH-positive fibres was performed using an automated method developed in the laboratory with the ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerpa et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, a digitized version of the photomicrograph was converted to black and white by combining blue, red, and green channels (weights 1, –0.25, and –0.25), subjected to a median filter (radius 3 pixels) in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, smoothed with a Gaussian filter (radius 8), and subtracted from the previous picture to isolate high spatial frequencies. Large stains were further eliminated by detecting them in a copy of the image. The picture was then subjected to a fixed threshold (grey level 11) to extract stained elements, and the relative volume occupied by fibres estimated by the proportion of detected pixels in the ROI. As a control for poor focus, the same images were analysed a second time while allowing lower spatial frequencies (Gaussian filter radius 20). The ratio between the proportions of pixels detected by the two methods was used as a criterion to eliminate blurry images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimental design and data analysis</title><p>Each rat was assigned a unique identification number that was used to conduct blind testing and statistical analyses.

To analyse hM4Di/c-Fos colocalization, a Student’s t-test was used to compare vehicle- and DCZ-treated animals within the stress condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Experiments were performed in accordance with current French (Council directive 2013-118, February 1, 2013) and European (directive 2010-63, September 22, 2010, European Community) laws and policies regarding animal experimentation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Laura A Bradfield as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional reporting regarding the anatomical specificity of placements within orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is necessary.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and many of our concerns addressed, but there are two areas in which the reviewers and myself felt more could have been done to allay our concerns. The remaining issues are outlined below:</p><p>1. In our original decision letter, all three reviewers requested more information regarding the anatomical specificity of the circuit manipulations and therefore the role of this noradrenergic-&gt;OFC pathway in updating goal-directed actions. Although you have added some more diagrams and images to this effect, we had been expecting some representation extent of lesion/expression across subjects and possibly some additional microscopy representations etc which were not provided. Moreover, we asked for additional work to quantify the effect of toxins in regions adjacent to OFC, which the authors have done, however, according to these figures, saporin and 6-OHDA (respectively) DO appear to have had off-target effects. As in, they appear to have reduced the volume of fibres in medial OFC, and M2, and for saporin, also in the insula. The authors have added a passage in the discussion noting that the anatomical specificity is not ideal and that collaterals in other regions could contribute to the effects, which is sufficient here, but these results do call into question the strength of the overall conclusions of the specificity of this behaviour to this particular pathway. Therefore, we think it is important to include a representation of extent of lesion/expression across subjects for each experiment, e.g., with a map representing this for each subject overlaid, or at the least minimal/maximal spread. We think this will be critical for readers to understand the extent of anatomical specificity. We also request some toning down of claims in the title and abstract, e.g. &quot;Together, our results indicate that noradrenergic…&quot; could become &quot;Together, our results suggest that noradrenergic…&quot;.</p><p>2. The authors decided not to offer any immunohistochemical, electrophysiological, or another type of validation of their chemogenetic manipulations as requested. Given that the specific manipulation used here is novel, some validation of these manipulations (other than their effects on behaviour) would have been ideal. We thought we would give the authors another opportunity to provide this, but if the authors strongly feel that it is unnecessary then please state this explicitly in the discussion (i.e. &quot;we did not feel that some independent validation of our chemogenetic manipulations was necessary because…&quot;) and provide adequate reference to prior validation of this approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81623.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional reporting regarding the anatomical specificity of placements within orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is necessary.

First, our immunohistochemical analysis clearly demonstrates that the CAV2 vector with the PRS promotor specifically targets NA neurons in the LC and that these neurons express the inhibitory DREADDs. Second, previous studies have validated the use of the CAV2-PRS construct using a range of actuators, including excitatory and inhibitory opsins, as well as potassium channels (Howorth et al., 2009b, 2009a; Hickey et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). Third, the behavioural dissociation between outcome identity reversal (this study) and Pavlovian contingency degradation (ongoing study, see Figure 1) suggests a subtle prefrontal coordination of NA dependent processes. Finally, DCZ as a ligand has now been proved to be highly efficient in a range of species, including rodents (Nagai et al., 2020; Nentwig et al., 2021; Oyama et al., 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also not hurt to be more inclusive in the VLO behavioral studies being cited.
