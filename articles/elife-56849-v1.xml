host longevity. However, because it requires direct manipulation of microbial metabolism in situ, establishing a causal link between these two processes remains challenging. We demonstrate an optogenetic method to control gene expression and metabolite production from bacteria residing in the host gut. We genetically engineer an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that secretes colanic acid (CA) under the quantitative control of light. Using this optogenetically-controlled strain to induce CA production directly in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> gut, we reveal the local effect of CA in protecting intestinal mitochondria from stress-induced hyper-fragmentation. We also demonstrate that the lifespan-extending effect of this strain is positively correlated with the intensity of green light, indicating a dose-dependent CA benefit on the host. Thus, optogenetics can be used to achieve quantitative and temporal control of gut bacterial metabolism in order to reveal its local and systemic effects on host health and aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>bacteria-host interaction</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21NS099870-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabor</surname><given-names>Jeffrey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1DK113644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Meng C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AT009050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Meng C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSTRF NNX11AN39H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartsough</surname><given-names>Lucas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006988</institution-id><institution>John S.

For example, 16S rRNA and metagenomic DNA sequencing are used to associate the presence or abundance of specific bacteria to human centenarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biagi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claesson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claesson et al., 2011</xref>). However, given the complexity and heterogeneity of the human gut environment, these approaches are unable to elucidate how a specific microbial species contributes to longevity.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has a short and easily-measured lifespan, features that have revolutionized our understanding of the molecular genetics of aging and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenyon, 2010</xref>).

Importantly, recent studies have revealed that bacterial metabolism can produce specific products to directly influence the aging process in the host <italic>C. elegans</italic> or modulate the effects of environmental cues on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pryor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Virk et al., 2016</xref>). These findings highlight the significance of bacterial metabolism in regulating host physiology during the aging process and have inspired interest in directly manipulating bacterial metabolism in situ in the host gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p><p>In several recent studies, researchers have administered antibiotic- or carbohydrate-based small molecule inducers to modulate gene expression from gut bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mimee et al., 2015</xref>). While this approach can be used to perform in situ analyses of gut bacterial-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2017</xref>), chemical effectors may have unwanted side-effects on host or microbial physiology and are subject to slow and poorly-controlled transport and degradation processes that ultimately limit their precision.</p><p>Optogenetics combines light and genetically-engineered photoreceptors to enable unrivaled control of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olson and Tabor, 2014</xref>). Previously, we and others have engineered photoreceptors that regulate bacterial gene expression in response to specific wavelengths of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levskaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohlendorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ong and Tabor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramakrishnan and Tabor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryu and Gomelsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidl et al., 2014</xref>).

Here, we hypothesized that optogenetic control of bacterial gene expression might provide a new way to fine-tune bacterial metabolism in the host GI tract with high temporal precision and no unwanted side-effects.</p><p>We address this possibility using the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> interaction model, an optically transparent system with known mechanistic links between bacterial metabolism and host longevity. In particular, CA is an exopolysaccharide synthesized and secreted by <italic>E. coli</italic> that can extend the lifespan of the host <italic>C. elegans</italic> by modulating mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). First, we engineer <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that express fluorescent reporter proteins under control of our previously engineered green light-activated, red light de-activated two-component system CcaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidl et al., 2014</xref>). We then expose worms carrying these engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> in their GI tracts to time-varying green and red light signals to demonstrate optical activation and de-activation of bacterial gene expression in worm gut. Next, we genetically engineer an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that biosynthesizes CA under control of CcaSR, and utilize green light to induce CA production from this strain in the gut of the host <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Our experiments reveal that green light-induced CA from bacteria residing in the host gut is sufficient to modulate mitochondrial dynamics and lifespan. We use this approach to investigate the local effect of CA production on intestinal cells in a time-controlled manner and its systemic effect on organisms in a tunable way, neither of which is possible using the previous methods of administering purified CA to worms or feeding worms <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants that constitutively overproduce CA. This work paves the way for future studies of bacterial-host interactions with high temporal, spatial, and quantitative control without the shortcomings of chemical inducers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To demonstrate optogenetic control over gut bacterial gene expression, we first engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain LH01, wherein CcaSR controls expression of superfolder green fluorescent protein (<italic>sfgfp</italic>), and <italic>mcherry</italic> is expressed constitutively to facilitate identification of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a, 1b</xref>).

To demonstrate that bacterial cells outside the worm gut (e.g. on the exterior of the worm) do not respond to light in these conditions, samples of pre-conditioned bacteria from the NGM plates were suspended in the M9Ce+Lev or <italic>E. coli</italic> M9 media supplemented with casamino acids and glucose (M9Ec). These samples were then exposed to either green or red light for 8 hr, then measured via flow cytometry after the fluorophore maturation protocol (Methods). As expected, the bacterial populations are only responsive to light when grown in M9Ec and when the PCB operon is intact (strain JW1935-1/pLH405/pSR43.6, aka LH03). We conclude that the responses shown in data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> are not due to bacteria outside the worm, nor to bacteria that escape the worm over the course of the experiment, as such cells do not respond to light in the experimental buffer (M9Ce).

Next, we washed away external bacteria, applied the paralyzing agent levamisole to prevent expulsion of gut contents, and transferred the worms to agar pads. Finally, we switched the applied light color from red to green (step ON), or green to red (step OFF), and used epi-fluorescence microscopy to image the resulting changes in sfGFP and mCherry fluorescence in the gut lumen over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the step ON experiment, sfGFP fluorescence in the worm gut lumen starts low, begins to increase within 2 hr, and reaches a saturated high level at 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). On the other hand, in the step OFF experiment, sfGFP fluorescence begins high, and decreases exponentially between hours 1–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This light response is abolished when the PCB biosynthetic operon is removed (ΔPCB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), demonstrating that changes in sfGFP fluorescence are due to CcaSR photoswitching in the worm gut.</p><p>Next, we used flow cytometry to analyze these bacterial light responses with single-cell resolution. Specifically, we reared worms on light sensing bacteria in red and green light as before, but then washed, paralyzed, and placed them into microtubes prior to light switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). At several time points over the course of 8 hr, we homogenized the animals, harvested the gut contents, sorted bacterial cells, and measured fluorescence via flow cytometry. We observed that our engineered bacteria remain intact in the host gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and respond to light in a unimodal fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). The temporal dynamics and PCB dependence of the gene expression responses recapitulate the microscopy results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also confirmed that residual bacteria on the exterior of worms do not contribute to the flow cytometry measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Together, these microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrate that we can use optogenetics to rapidly and reversibly induce gene expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> residing in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gut.</p><p>Next, we sought to utilize our optogenetic method to modulate the production of specific metabolites in bacteria residing in the gut of live hosts. Bacterial genes involved in the same metabolic process are often clustered into operons and co-regulated at the transcriptional level. We took advantage of this coordinated mode of regulation and chose the <italic>cps</italic> operon and its transcription activator RcsA for testing optogenetic control of bacterial metabolism. The <italic>cps</italic> operon in <italic>E. coli</italic> consists of 19 genes that encode enzymes required for the biosynthesis and secretion of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Torres-Cabassa and Gottesman, 1987</xref>), and CA-overproducing bacterial mutants Δ<italic>lon</italic> and Δ<italic>hns</italic> promote longevity in the host <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). To place CA biosynthesis under optogenetic control, we engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MVK29 which lacks genomic <italic>rcsA</italic>, and expresses a heterologous copy of <italic>rcsA</italic> under the control of CcaSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a, 1b</xref>). We first examined whether MVK29 could respond to green light and induce CA production and secretion. To this end, we grew the strain in batch culture under red or green light and quantified supernatant CA levels. In red light, MVK29 secretes CA to concentrations below the limit of detection of the assay, similar to the Δ<italic>rcsA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Green light, on the other hand, induces MVK29 to secrete high levels of CA, and removal of the PCB biosynthetic operon abolishes this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Moreover, mutation of the CcaS catalytic histidine to a non-functional alanine (H534A), or the CcaR phosphorylation site from an aspartic acid to a non-functional asparagine (D51N) abolishes detectable CA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Importantly, the level of secreted CA increases sigmoidally with the increasing intensity of green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which is consistent with the response of CcaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidl et al., 2014</xref>).

We first focused on cellular phenotypes in the worm gut that directly interact with bacteria and examined mitochondrial morphology that is known to be affected by CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Lon is an ATP-dependent protease that degrades RcsA, and its deletion mutant Δ<italic>lon</italic> shows increased CA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). When grown on Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant bacteria, worms exhibit elevated mitochondrial fragmentation in intestinal cells, similar to worms with CA supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether light-induced CA overproduction in MVK29 could affect the host as effectively as the CA overproduction caused by the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant, we reared two different transgenic worm strains, expressing either mitochondrially-localized GFP (mito-GFP) or mitochondrially-localized RFP (mito-RFP) in the intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), on the plate with MVK29 and exposed the plate to red light. For each worm strain, we continued to expose one group to red light but switched a second to green for an additional 6 hr (unparalyzed light-exposure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). After paralyzing the worms with levamisole, we immediately imaged intestinal cell mitochondrial morphology using confocal microscopy and categorized the morphology into the tubular, intermediate, or fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We found that green light increases mitochondrial fragmentation in MVK29-fed worms, but not in worms fed a MVK29 ΔPCB control strain that does not respond to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To this end, we removed worms from plates, washed away external bacteria, paralyzed them using levamisole to stop bacteria being expelled from the gut, exposed them to green or red light for 6 hr, and then imaged intestinal mitochondrial morphology using confocal microscopy (paralyzed light-exposure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In these conditions, CA production is inactivated on the plate and worms are only exposed to CA produced from bacteria residing with the host gut. Unexpectedly, we found that 6 hr of levamisole treatment does not kill worms but leads to mitochondrial hyper-fragmentation in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,e</xref>), possibly due to the inhibitory effect of levamisole on mitochondrial NADH-oxidizing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Köhler and Bachmann, 1978</xref>) and its associated mitochondrial stress. This hyper-fragmentation phenotype was not observed in worms treated with levamisole less than 1 hr. This stress-induced fragmentation resembles mitochondrial changes related to aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Exner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sebastián et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we found that green light exposure suppresses stress-induced hyperfragmentation in paralyzed worms bearing MVK29 in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found no such effects in worms bearing the ΔPCB, CcaS(H534A), CcaR(D51N) or <italic>ΔrcsA</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that this protective effect is a result of light-induced CA overproduction in the gut. As a control using transgenic worms expressing mito-GFP in the muscle, we also examined muscular mitochondrial morphology under paralyzed light-exposure conditions. We found that 6 hr levamisole treatment induces mitochondrial hyper-fragmentation in the muscle as it does in the intestine, but that light-induced CA production from the gut bacteria does not protect muscular mitochondria against hyper-fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results not only show that optogenetics can be utilized to induce CA secretion from gut-borne <italic>E. coli</italic> in vivo, but also reveal a local protective effect of CA on intestinal cells.</p><p>Finally, we examined how the extent of light-induced CA production relates to host lifespan extension. We first confirmed that green-light-exposed MVK29 can induce CA overproduction to a level comparable to the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and neither the Δ<italic>lon</italic> nor the Δ<italic>rcsA</italic> mutant responds to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Next, beginning at the day-1 adult stage, we exposed worms bearing MVK29 to red, or low and high green light intensities resulting in intermediate or saturating levels of CA secretion in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and measured their lifespans. We found that green light exposure extends worm lifespan compared to red light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Furthermore, the extent of lifespan extension at high green light intensity is 1.7-fold higher than that at low intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), suggesting a dose-dependent effect. In parallel, we measured the lifespan of worms bearing the CA-overproducing Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant and showed that the lifespan extension caused by Δ<italic>lon</italic> is independent of light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The extent of lifespan extension caused by Δ<italic>lon</italic> is comparable to that caused by MVK29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), which is consistent with the result that Δ<italic>lon</italic> and green-light-exposed MVK29 induce CA overproduction to a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In addition, the lifespan of worms bearing the Δ<italic>rcsA</italic> mutant is also light-independent and is comparable to that of MVK29 worms under red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). These results suggest that optogenetic control is sufficient to induce bacterial production of pro-longevity compounds and improve host health.

For example, we have identified about two dozen additional <italic>E. coli</italic> genes that are unrelated to CA biosynthesis and that enhance worm longevity when knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2017</xref>), though the mechanisms by which they act remain largely unclear. By using light to induce their expression in the gut and measuring acute host responses such as changes in mitochondrial dynamics, the role of these genes in gut microbe-host interactions could be further explored. In another example, the quorum-sensing peptide CSF and nitric oxide, both of which are produced by <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> during biofilm formation, have been found to extend worm lifespan through downregulation of the insulin-like signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donato et al., 2017</xref>). We have recently ported CcaSR into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and demonstrated that it enables rapid and precise control of gene expression dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castillo-Hair et al., 2019</xref>). The method we report here should enable optogenetic control of gene expression and metabolite production in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and in situ studies of how this important Gram-positive model bacterium impacts longevity as well.</p><p>Multiple photoreceptors could also be combined to study more complex microbe-host interaction pathways. Specifically, we and others have co-expressed CcaSR with independently-controllable blue/dark and red/far-red reversible light sensors to achieve simultaneous and independent control of the expression of up to three genes in the same bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tabor et al., 2011</xref>). Such optogenetic multiplexing could be performed in situ and used to study potential synergistic, antagonistic, or other higher-order effects of multiple bacterial genes or pathways. A large number of eukaryotic photoreceptors have also been developed, enabling optical control of many cell- and neurobiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deisseroth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goglia and Toettcher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leopold et al., 2018</xref>). Bacterial and eukaryotic photoreceptors could be combined to enable simultaneous optical manipulation of bacterial and host pathways to interrogate whether or how they interact. Optogenetics could also be used to manipulate bacterial and/or host pathways at specific locations within the gut to examine location- or tissue-dependent phenomena.</p><p>Finally, optogenetic approaches could be extended to other bacteria or hosts. Although <italic>E. coli</italic> is an important model of Gram-negative bacteria, it is not a natural symbiont of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Because <italic>E. coli</italic> does not stably colonize in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gut, we have to paralyze worms to facilitate longer-term experiments. It would be interesting future work to port CcaSR or other bacterial photoreceptors into native <italic>C. elegans</italic> symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) or pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couillault and Ewbank, 2002</xref>) and apply them for studying the physiological and pathological effects of bacterial symbionts in vivo in non-paralyzing hosts. Moreover, it is likely that light can also be used to control gut bacterial gene expression in other model hosts such as flies, zebrafish, or mammals. Red-shifted wavelengths and corresponding optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryu and Gomelsky, 2014</xref>) may prove superior for less optically transparent or larger animals. Overall, by enabling precision control of bacterial gene expression and metabolism in situ, we believe that optogenetics will greatly improve our understanding of a wide range of microbe-host interactions. In particular, through aiding the digestion of ingested food, intestinal bacteria alter their gene expression and metabolism and can consequently generate specific metabolites to influence other microbes and the host in close proximity. Understanding dynamic diet-microbe-host interplays demands a quantitative method to manipulate bacterial gene expression in a temporally controlled manner. For example, upon the supplementation of a specific food source, turning on or off a specific gene in bacteria and in turn examining molecular changes in the host would help reveal primary nodes in the complex diet-microbe-host network. Given their quantitative nature, rapid and reversible switching ability, and suitability for in vivo application, optogenetic approaches will provide a new toolbox for this area of research to decipher how mechanistically microbial genetic factors participate in those diet-microbe-host interplays and contribute to host health and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The plate was then placed in a 20°C incubator and illuminated with appropriate optogenetic light provided by a single LED positioned 1 cm above the Petri dish. Adult worms were transferred to a fresh plate as necessary to maintain only a single generation.</p><p>Individual worms aged 1–3 days were removed from the dish and prepared for time-lapse epifluorescence imaging. A 1.5% agar pad was prepared using M9 buffer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryu and Gomelsky, 2014</xref>), and punched into ½” circles with a hollow punch. A 4 μL droplet of 2 mM levamisole was deposited on a pad and five adult worms were transferred from the NGM plate to the droplet. An additional 4 μL of levamisole solution was added, and the worms were gently washed to remove external bacteria. Worms were then transferred to a fresh pad with a 4 μL droplet of levamisole solution, which was allowed to dry, thereby co-localizing and aligning the worms on the pad. The pad was then inverted and placed into a 13 mm disposable microscopy petri dish with a #1.5 coverslip on the bottom (Cell E and G; Houston, TX). Another coverslip was placed on the top of the pad in the dish to curtail evaporation.</p><p>The dish was then placed on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc; Melville, NY). Complete paralysis was induced by incubating the dish at room temperature (~23°C) for 30 min. Meanwhile, worms were exposed to appropriate preconditioning light supplied by a circular array of 8 LEDs (4 × 660 nm, 4 × 525 nm) mounted to the microscope condenser ring, about 2 cm above the Petri dish. Light was then switched from the preconditioning to the experimental wavelength, and worms were imaged periodically using 10x, 40x, and 60x objectives. For each time point, the LEDs were turned off and images acquired in the brightfield (DIC) and fluorescent channels. Afterwards, the LEDs were turned on again to maintain optogenetic control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Epifluorescence image analysis</title><p>All epifluorescence images were analyzed using the Nikon Elements software package (Nikon Instruments, Inc; Melville, NY).

The worms were then washed 2x in 5 μL droplets of M9 buffer containing 2 mM levamisole only. Finally, the worms were transferred to clear 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μL of M9 buffer + 2 mM levamisole, ensuring that five worms were deposited in the liquid contained in each tube. Each tube was then exposed to light by placing it within one well of a 24-well plate (AWLS-303008, ArcticWhite LLC) atop a Light Plate Apparatus (LPA) containing green and red LEDs<sup>47</sup> for 8 hr at room temperature. In separate control experiments, we demonstrated that any stray bacteria that may escape the worms over this period, or which were inadvertently added to the 50 μL of M9 buffer, are incapable of responding to optogenetic light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>At the conclusion of the experiment, tubes were removed from the plate and immediately chilled in an ice slurry for 10 min in the dark.

All experimental bacterial strains were preconditioned in red light with optogenetic light provided by a single LED positioned 1 cm above the Petri dish.</p><p>After 3–5 days (between days 1–3 of adulthood), worms allocated for the experiment were transferred to experimental strains for approximately 60–90 min and exposed to red light to thoroughly inoculate the GI tract without inducing CcaSR. In the case of the unparalyzed worms, red or green light was then applied for an additional 6 hr. For the paralyzed worm experiments, 1.5% low-melt agar pads were prepared as described above and placed on individual slides. About 15 adult worms were transferred from the experimental strain Petri dish to an agar pad containing 10 μL of <italic>C. elegans</italic> M9 buffer + 2 mM levamisole (M9Ce+Lev), where worms were gently washed before being transferred to a fresh pad also containing 10 μL of M9Ce+Lev. The majority of M9Ce+Lev on the pad was allowed to evaporate, which causes the worms to align longitudinally before a cover slip was applied. Slides were then exposed to either red or green light by placing them under a single LED positioned 1 cm above the Petri dish for 6 hr.

Intermediate samples contained regions of both types. Scores were then de-randomized and aggregated.

editors feel that the approach and techniques presented are exciting, with important future applications – especially given progress on extension the approach to e.g. <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. You convincingly demonstrate the utility and value of your novel optogenetic approach for investigating bacterial metabolism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optogenetic control of gut bacterial metabolism to promote longevity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William Mair (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We all feel that you when you resubmit the revised paper, it should be as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paper rather than an article, given the methodological nature of your study.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hartsough et al. present a method to optogenetically control the production of colanic acid (CA) from a genetically engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Using this <italic>E. coli</italic> strain as a feed for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the authors show CA production directly in the animal gut and its local effects in altering mitochondrial dynamics in the gut. The authors corroborate findings from a previous publication from Han et al., 2017, showing effects on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan and intestinal mitochondrial network.</p><p>The concept of modifying host biology via optogenetic control of gut flora is novel and would be fitting for the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers had some concerns regarding some of the claims regarding biological insights as presented. Given the current COVID-19 situation, we feel that asking for additional experiments and novel biological findings would be beyond the scope of a revision, but the reviewers suggested that additional data or edits may help clarify how this work is distinct from Han et al., 2017, why an optogenetic approach is better than the standard genetic approaches and what the strength and weaknesses of this approach are.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the key claims made by the authors is that the optogenetic approach allows for more fine scale control of metabolite production and further that they &quot;investigate how the lifespan extending effect of CA relates to CA levels&quot;. However, aside from one ex vivo assay (Results, Figure 2B/C), the amount of CA being secreted (or taken up by the host) is not reported. The authors claim, but don't actually show a relationship of lifespan with CA level, just green-light intensity. The relative CA production levels of the engineered strains under green light vs. the over-producing mutants should ideally be quantified and both compared to realistic exposure levels in vivo of conventionally grown <italic>C. elegans</italic>. If this cannot be done without additional experiments, the authors should be careful to temper their claims here.</p><p>2) A related concern is how do the authors know that the effects are not mediated by CA produced and secreted on plates. They attempt to answer this question using levamisole paralyzed worms – but the mitochondrial morphology of paralyzed worms seems very different (hyper fragmented, Figure 3D) form non-paralyzed – as the authors themselves concede. I agree that there appears to be some rescue effect in MVK29 exposed to green light – but it would be preferable to show benefits of in situ expression without the overlaying levamisole detriment.</p><p>3) The mitochondrial fragmentation results are obviously motivated by the findings in Han et al., 2017, but are not well introduced/explained. In the fifth paragraph of the Results it is stated that exposure to light-induced CA secretion increases fragmentation. But in the next paragraph that light-induced CA secretion decreases mitochondrial fragmentation caused by levamisole treatment. The interpretation of these conflicting results-and their relevance to other systems lacking stress induced mitochondrial fragmentation-is unclear and should be more clearly discussed.</p><p>4) In addition to local effects in the gut, were the authors able to see effects in distal tissues? An experiment investigating effects of light-induced CA production in the gut, affecting body wall muscle mitochondrial network similar to Han et al., 2017, could strengthen the current manuscript and show expected systemic effects of CA and not just local.</p><p>5) This work relies on a non-standard gut microbe for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and requires that the animals be paralyzed to maintain colonization through measurement. This is addressed only in passing in the Discussion, but altogether still gives pause. Yes, <italic>E. coli</italic> is &quot;this important Gram-positive model bacterium,&quot; but it isn't in fact a very important bacterium to this host. Limitations and open questions that should be made explicitly are: Whether host uptake of metabolites produced by a symbiont would differ from that of a food source, whether/how this approach could be extended to bacteria other than <italic>E. coli</italic> and how such interactions might play out in a community context and whether / how optogenetics could be used to study this question.</p><p>6) As a standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding strain, OP50 is naturally <italic>lon</italic> deficient. Can the authors comment on the levels of CA production from their light-induced methods as compared to the regular OP50? If no such data is available, this should still be discussed.</p><p>7) The authors make a claim regarding the relative magnitude of lifespan effects of purified CA vs. CA produced using their optogenetic approach. However, it appears that claim is based on comparison of lifespan effects with previously published results. Such comparisons are risky because differences in lab, feeding conditions, and strain. It would also have been preferable to have a CA &quot;fed&quot; control and it would further have been interesting to carry out a study of optogenetic induction in the presence of exogenous CA. In the absence of a CA fed control, the authors should be careful with their claims regarding effect size.</p><p>8) There were some concerns over the exclusive use of GFP with a mito targeting sequence as the reporter because this only labels mitochondria if they are functionally importing the GFP. In addition there seems to be a lot of noise from intestinal gut granules and aggregates in Figure 3B. These data could be improved if an additional label of mitochondria was used – either a membrane marker or dye, in order to ensure the changes seen are reflecting changes to mitochondrial network morphology and not GFP aggregation, or non-mitochondrial localized GFP signal. The authors should be careful to make these limitations clear.</p><p>9) Lifespan of control and treated animals in general appear shorter than would be expected. E.g. in Figure 4, the lifespan of worms fed the <italic>E. coli</italic> background strain JW1935-1 is considerably short. Can the authors comment on any previous studies with <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan on this strain and if this is expected? Are there other optogenetic background strains available?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56849.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the key claims made by the authors is that the optogenetic approach allows for more fine scale control of metabolite production and further that they &quot;investigate how the lifespan extending effect of CA relates to CA levels&quot;.

Technically, it is currently impossible to measure CA levels in bacteria grow on solid agar plates or in the worm gut, or in the host cells. Thus, our conclusion is based on the ex vivo assay using liquid culture and the positive relationship between green-light intensity and the amount of CA being secreted. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the text to explicitly state this relationship. In addition, we have included new results presenting a direct comparison of CA levels between the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant and the light inducible strain (new Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A related concern is how do the authors know that the effects are not mediated by CA produced and secreted on plates.

I agree that there appears to be some rescue effect in MVK29 exposed to green light – but it would be preferable to show benefits of in situ expression without the overlaying levamisole detriment.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern on the possible confounding effect of levamisole. We agree that levamisole is an imperfect means by which to paralyze the worms, resulting in undesired changes to host mitochondrial morphology. Unfortunately, host paralysis and cessation of host peristaltic activity is required to measure the effect of CA production in vivo; otherwise, bacteria would be expelled before sufficient amount of CA accumulated to affect mitochondrial morphology in the host. We have tried several alternative means of immobilizing the host for this experiment, and only levamisole is sufficient to stop bacteria expulsion from the gut and keeps worms alive after 6 hours of the treatment.</p><p>Regarding the concern that CA may be produced on the plate instead of in the host, in the context of Figure 3 (new Figure 3E and F), note that neither bacteria nor worms on the plate are exposed to green light (which induces CA production). Worms are only exposed to green light after they have been removed from the plate and paralyzed. Thus, we conclude that the effect on mitochondrial morphology is mediated by CA produced from bacteria inside the host gut. In the context of Figure 4, we expect that CA produced from bacteria on the plate and in the host gut both contribute to the lifespan-extending effect. Currently, we cannot experimentally separate these two processes. In the revised manuscript, we have included new diagram figure panels to illustrate the experimental design (new Figure 3A and D) and improved the language to introduce the experimental design more clearly and increase the textual clarity of the related claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mitochondrial fragmentation results are obviously motivated by the findings in Han et al., 2017, but are not well introduced/explained.

The interpretation of these conflicting results-and their relevance to other systems lacking stress induced mitochondrial fragmentation-is unclear and should be more clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for pointing out this concern. We have revised the manuscript to (1) better introduce the previously published findings, (2) explain the new results more clearly, and (3) discuss the potential difference between these two conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In addition to local effects in the gut, were the authors able to see effects in distal tissues? An experiment investigating effects of light-induced CA production in the gut, affecting body wall muscle mitochondrial network similar to Han et al., 2017, could strengthen the current manuscript and show expected systemic effects of CA and not just local.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have examined the effect of CA on mitochondrial morphology in the muscle using day-2-old young adults. We found that light-induced CA production from the gut bacteria does not affect muscular mitochondria. We conclude that (1) CA acts locally in intestinal cells, and (2) the protective effect of CA against age-associated fragmentation in muscular mitochondria that we observed previously (Han et al., 2017) is likely associated with the lifespan extending effect of CA, which may be secondary to the change in the intestine. We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion, which help us distinguish the local effect of CA in the intestine and its systemic effect on other tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) This work relies on a non-standard gut microbe for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and requires that the animals be paralyzed to maintain colonization through measurement.

In the</p><p>Discussion, we note that we have recently demonstrated optogenetic control of gene expression in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and suggest its possible application in studying Gram-positive bacterial-host interactions and longevity. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have included additional discussions on 1) the difference in metabolite uptake from a symbiont and a food source, 2) the application of the <italic>E. coli</italic> optogenetic approach in host organisms where <italic>E. coli</italic> is a natural symbiont, 3) the development of new optogenetic approaches in different bacterial systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As a standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding strain, OP50 is naturally lon deficient. Can the authors comment on the levels of CA production from their light-induced methods as compared to the regular OP50? If no such data is available, this should still be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We haven’t directly compared to the level of CA from OP50 and the light-inducible bacterial strain. In the Han et al., 2017 paper, we reported that OP50 shows a 50% higher CA level than BW25113 and Δ<italic>lon</italic> shows a 4-fold higher CA level than BW25113. In the current work, we found that the CA levels from Δ<italic>lon</italic> and the light-inducible strain are similar (new Figure 4A). Based on this comparison, we conclude that the level of CA production from OP50 is lower than that from the light-inducible strain. We have included these information (subsection “Optogenetic control of CA production”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors make a claim regarding the relative magnitude of lifespan effects of purified CA vs. CA produced using their optogenetic approach. However, it appears that claim is based on comparison of lifespan effects with previously published results. Such comparisons are risky because differences in lab, feeding conditions, and strain. It would also have been preferable to have a CA &quot;fed&quot; control and it would further have been interesting to carry out a study of optogenetic induction in the presence of exogenous CA. In the absence of a CA fed control, the authors should be careful with their claims regarding effect size.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. In our experiments (Figure 4), we have chosen the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant as a positive control and a comparative reference for the effect of CA produced using the optogenetic approach, since the lifespan-extending effect of Δ<italic>lon</italic> is stronger than CA supplementation and CA supplementation does not enhance the lifespan extension by the loss of <italic>lon</italic> (as shown in the Han et al., 2017 paper). In Figure 4 and Supplementary file 1C, all the lifespan assays were conducted in parallel for direct comparison. We found that the lifespan extension caused by the light-inducible strain is comparable to that caused by Δ<italic>lon</italic>. Based on light-inducible = Δ<italic>lon</italic> (in this work) and Δ<italic>lon</italic> &gt; CA (Han et al., 2017), we concluded that light-inducible &gt; CA. We agree with the reviewer that we should be more careful with our claims, since we did not directly include CA supplementation as a control. We have revised text in the Introduction and Results to state this claim more precisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There were some concerns over the exclusive use of GFP with a mito targeting sequence as the reporter because this only labels mitochondria if they are functionally importing the GFP.

The authors should be careful to make these limitations clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, and we have conducted this experiment using another RFP reporter that localized to the mitochondrial membrane, in which the Nterminal 55 amino acids sequence of <italic>C. elegans tomm-20</italic> is fused with RFP. Using this new reporter, we have validated the results using mito-GFP (new Figure 3C, E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Lifespan of control and treated animals in general appear shorter than would be expected. E.g. in figure 4, the lifespan of worms fed the <italic>E. coli</italic> background strain JW1935-1 is considerably short. Can the authors comment on any previous studies with <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan on this strain and if this is expected? Are there other optogenetic background strains available?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We are sorry that we did not explain this experimental design more clearly. The lifespan assay was conducted at 26 degrees using the <italic>sqt-3(e2117)</italic> temperature sensitive mutant that reproduces normal but is embryonically lethal at 26 degrees. In this way, we can perform the experiment at the restrictive temperature to avoid animal transfer that causes white light exposure, while not using floxuridine/FUDR that interrupts normal reproduction and alters bacterial metabolism. We have used this method previously in the Han et al., 2017 paper, and the mean lifespan is 8.7 ± 0.1 days. Thus, the lifespan, ~6.5 days, shown in Figure 4 is slightly shorter. We think this is not due to the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain background given that the lifespan of Δ<italic>lon</italic> is also shorter, ~ 9 days (this work) vs. ~11 days (in Han et al., 2017). The possible explanation is that light exposure may shorten the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (PMID: 29500338). In the revised manuscript, we have explained the experimental design more clearly (subsection “Lifespan experiments”) and included the temperature information in figure panels (new Figure 4B-D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
