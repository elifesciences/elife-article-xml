Cancer cell lines in culture can survive and replicate DNA replication after genetic inactivation of individual ORC subunits, ORC1, ORC2, or ORC5. In primary cells, ORC1 was dispensable in the mouse liver for endo-reduplication, but this could be explained by the ORC1 homolog, CDC6, substituting for ORC1 to restore functional ORC. Here, we have created mice with a conditional deletion of ORC2, which does not have a homolog. Although mouse embryo fibroblasts require ORC2 for proliferation, mouse hepatocytes synthesize DNA in cell culture and endo-reduplicate in vivo without ORC2. Mouse livers endo-reduplicate after simultaneous deletion of ORC1 and ORC2 both during normal development and after partial hepatectomy. Since endo-reduplication initiates DNA synthesis like normal S phase replication these results unequivocally indicate that primary cells, like cancer cell lines, can load MCM2-7 and initiate replication without ORC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary hepatocytes</kwd><kwd>mouse embryo fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>mouse liver</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA60499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutta</surname><given-names>Anindya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008457</institution-id><institution>University of Virginia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wagner fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Przanowska</surname><given-names>Róża K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99/K00CA253732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Przanowska</surname><given-names>Róża K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008980</institution-id><institution>Medical College of Wisconsin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leone</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Takayuki-Okano</given-names></name><name><surname>Trimboli</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008980</institution-id><institution>Medical College of Wisconsin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the Dr. Glenn R. and Nancy A.

In cooperation with another ATPase, CDC6, and with CDT1, ORC helps load MCM2-7 double hexamers at or near the origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stillman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>). To initiate replication (or endo-reduplication), the MCM2-7 hexamer associates with additional proteins to form the functional CMG helicase that is essential for unwinding the double-stranded chromosomal DNA, so that the resulting single-stranded DNAs can serve as templates for copying by DNA polymerases. In the lower eukaryotes, various ORC subunits have been consistently found to be essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foss et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Micklem et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Semple et al., 2006</xref>). In mammalian cells, knockdown of individual ORC subunits has also been reported to stop cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). In humans, mutations in <italic>ORC1</italic>, <italic>ORC4</italic>, <italic>ORC6</italic>, <italic>CDT1</italic>, and <italic>CDC6</italic> cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism resembling Meier-Gorlin syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bicknell et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guernsey et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>There have, however, been isolated reports that suggest that under unusual circumstances, DNA replication can initiate in eukaryotes in the absence of the full ORC. First hypomorphic mutation made in the <italic>ORC2</italic> gene in HCT116 colon cancer cells decreased ORC2 protein levels by 90% and cells were still viable and could proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar et al., 2001b</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>Orc1</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> permitted several rounds of replication in the resulting larvae and pupae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park and Asano, 2008</xref>). A few human cancer cell lines have been created by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering where ORC1, ORC2, and ORC5 cannot be detected by regular immunoblots and yet the cell lines survive, proliferate and replicate DNA with the normal complement of origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata and Dutta, 2020</xref>). However, the <italic>Orc2</italic> gene is essential for viability and in the <italic>Orc2Δ</italic> cell line a very minimal level (&lt;0.1% of wild-type levels) of a truncated protein can be detected that reacts with anti-ORC2 antibody and co-immunoprecipitates with ORC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 2021</xref>). Given that WT cells have about 150,000 molecules of ORC2, even if this truncated protein is functional ORC2, ~150 molecules of the protein would be expected to load MCM2-7 double hexamers on at least 50,000 origins of replication. This possibility would be consistent with current models of MCM2-7 loading only if ORC was highly catalytic and one ORC hexamer was capable of loading ~667 MCM2-7 hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stillman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>To address whether the entire ORC holocomplex is essential for DNA replication initiation in primary mammalian cells, we have reported a conditional mutation in the ORC1 gene of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okano-Uchida et al., 2018</xref>). Conditional deletion of <italic>Orc1</italic> (using tissue-specific Cre drivers) revealed that the gene was essential for normal mitotic cell division in intestinal epithelial cells, but that endoreduplication in tissues that are known to become polyploid, like placental trophoblasts and the liver hepatocytes, was unaffected. Because the ORC1 protein is a functional ATPase with sequence homology with CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saha et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 1997</xref>), one possibility that remained was that the mouse CDC6 protein substituted for ORC1 in the ORC holocomplex, producing enough functional ORC. Therefore, we decided to make a conditional mutation in another subunit of ORC, <italic>Orc2</italic>, that does not have the Walker A or B motifs that would make it a functional ATPase and that is not homologous to <italic>Cdc6</italic>. We designed the mutation such that even if an N terminally truncated protein is expressed from a downstream methionine from an alternately spliced mRNA the AAA + like domain will suffer a significant deletion.</p><p>This will allow us to test whether the mouse liver survival and endoreduplication after loss of ORC1 is seen even after loss of ORC2. It will also test whether combining the conditional mutations of ORC1 and ORC2 will allow the liver cells to survive and endoreduplicate. If hepatocyte survival and endoreduplication is seen in these mice, then it would be hard to explain this by the substitution of two ORC subunits by the CDC6 protein, and we would gain support for the hypothesis that in rare circumstances even untransformed mammalian cells are capable of loading enough MCM2-7 in the absence of ORC to permit extensive DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ORC2 is essential for embryonic development and proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts</title><p>Mice with LoxP sites inserted flanking exons 6 and 7 of mouse <italic>Orc2</italic> were purchased from Cyagen Biosciences Inc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Recombination between the loxP sites would delete the coding exons 6 and 7 of <italic>Orc2</italic>, which removes amino acids L111-V150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). If a transcript is expressed that skips exons 6 and 7, then the resulting protein mutates A110 to V110 and then throws the protein-coding sequence out of frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, ΔORC2), so that the bulk of the 576 amino acid ORC2 protein, including the AAA + like and WH domains (K230-A576) are not expressed. The AAA + like domain and the WH domain are key elements for ORC2 assembly into ORC and for ORC function. Even in the remote possibility that a truncated protein is expressed due to alternative splicing and translation initiation from an internal methionine, the next methionine is at M301, so that half of the protein including 70 amino acids of the 239 amino acid AAA+-like domain (K230-G469) would be deleted.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of <italic>Orc2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and ORC2 knockout (KO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of introduced loxP sites in <italic>Orc</italic>2 locus.

Three days after infection with an Adenovirus expressing Cre, effective recombination between the loxP sites is seen, resulting in a genotype showing that exons 6 and 7 have been deleted in most of the MEF (<italic>Orc2<sup>Δ</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with this, at 5 d after adeno-Cre infection, the ORC2 protein is not detected in the MEF population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The dilution of the undeleted MEF lysate on the same blot suggests, that if any ORC2 protein is expressed in the MEF after adeno-Cre infection, it is &lt;10% of that in the undeleted MEF. The proliferation rate of the MEF were measured by MTT assays. Even in the <italic>Orc</italic>2<sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> MEF, the infection with adeno-Cre decreased proliferation a little (the orange line compared to the blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

In mammalian cells only ORC1 and ORC4 have the intact Walker A and B motifs that are necessary for the molecules to act as AAA + ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</xref>). Though this has never been demonstrated experimentally, it is theoretically possible that in the absence of ORC1 in flies or in mouse livers, another related AAA + ATPase, intimately involved in MCM2-7 loading, CDC6, can substitute for ORC1 to reconstitute a functional 5 subunit ring-shaped ORC-like structure that executes its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takeda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell, 2017</xref>). We therefore wished to test whether removal of a second subunit of ORC, ORC2, that does not have obvious ATPase activity and not much homology to CDC6, would still permit endoreduplication in mouse livers.

Thus, in this case, we took the additional precaution to design a mutation such that even if a truncated protein was expressed from an internal methionine downstream from the mutation site, such a protein will be missing a significant part of its AAA + ATPase domain. Anyhow, in Western blots we do not see any evidence of such a truncated protein being expressed in the genetically altered MEFs or hepatocytes.

Once a gene is deleted, each cell division decreases the corresponding protein at least by half, so that six cell divisions would dilute the targeted protein to &lt;1.5% of the wild-type levels. Thus even after the ORC2 (or ORC1 and ORC2 in the DKO mice) decreased to &lt;1.5% the WT level, the <italic>Orc2</italic> knockout livers (male or female) and the male DKO livers could execute at least 9 more rounds of replication and cell division. Note the amount of the relevant ORC subunit would continue to decrease by half with each further division. Also, that the levels of ORC are likely to decrease faster if the protein is actively degraded or if more cell divisions are necessary to counter any development-related apoptosis.</p><p>This suggests that mitotic DNA replication of diploid cells is not completely eliminated at least in the <italic>Orc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or male DKO livers after loss of the targeted ORC proteins. Consistent with this, we see EdU incorporation in EYFP + hepatocytes, in vitro, which, however, could be from a terminal endo-reduplication event. More tantalizing is the presence of <italic>paired</italic> EYFP positive EdU-positive nuclei during the regeneration after partial hepatectomy in 8–14-wk-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Such paired nuclei are usually seen with daughter nuclei that have just been born from mitosis, suggesting that there were at least a few cells that underwent complete DNA replication and mitosis even though the hepatocytes had undergone 15 rounds of cell division after deletion of the targeted ORC gene(s).</p><p>Could the ORC deletion lead to the immediate loss of hepatoblasts (despite having inherited ORC protein from the endodermal cells) causing undifferentiated endodermal cells to persist and proliferate much longer (without activating Cre) than in normal development? We consider this unlikely, but if true it will be very unexpected, both by suggesting that deletion of ORC immediately leads to the death of the hepatoblasts (despite a healthy reserve of inherited ORC protein) and by suggesting that there is a novel feedback mechanism from the death/ORC depletion of hepatoblasts leading to the persistence and proliferation of undifferentiated endodermal cells.</p><p>The female DKO (but not the <italic>Orc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) livers seem more sensitive to the depletion of both ORC1 and ORC2 since ~12 cell divisions in the female DKO livers occur after allowing three cell division for the targeted genes to be definitively deleted. Thus, after the cells have reached &lt;1.5% of WT levels of ORC2 or ORC1 protein, they can still execute at least 6 more cell divisions. Consistent with this sex-specific difference, the male mice appear to be more tolerant of deletion of <italic>Orc2</italic> gene or both <italic>Orc1</italic> and <italic>Orc2</italic> genes, with the livers reaching larger sizes than in the female mice. Plasma testosterone levels reach 50% of adult levels in the first day after birth before declining (to rise again at puberty at 4–5 wk of age), suggesting that enough androgens are present during the proliferative phase of liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell, 2018</xref>). Sex-specific changes in gene expression have been noted to begin in the liver by 3 wk postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conforto and Waxman, 2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that androgens directly or indirectly stimulate the division or hypertrophy of hepatocytes to ameliorate the negative effects on liver mass due to the loss of ORC. We have also shown that loss of ORC subunits in cancer cell lines causes significant changes in gene expression due to the role of ORC subunits in epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2025</xref>), so another explanation of the more severe phenotype in females could be that the epigenetic effects of ORC subunits are more important in female compared to male livers.</p><p>In contrast to diploid DNA replication in hepatocytes, we have shown that the livers with a genetic deletion of <italic>Orc2</italic> (or <italic>Orc1</italic> and <italic>Orc2</italic>) undergo endo-reduplication more easily during normal development. Such DNA synthesis is also clearly seen during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in the <italic>Orc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Orc1<sup>-/-</sup>, Orc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers. Endoreduplication differs from normal replication in that although the cycles of DNA replication (S phase) are separated by a G1 like phase (G phase) they are not separated by an intervening mitosis and cytokinesis, and is commonly seen during normal development in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shu et al., 2018</xref>). However, all evidence suggests that the biochemical mechanism of initiating DNA replication is the same in normal mitotic replication and endoreduplication. For example, cyclin E/cdk kinase activity and MCM2-7 protein association with the chromatin oscillate between G phase and S phase during <italic>Drosophila</italic> endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lilly and Duronio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su and O’Farrell, 1998</xref>). Similarly, in the mouse, cyclin E and CDC6 promote, while geminin inhibits endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermejo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Renty et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the persistence, and in fact acceleration, of endoreduplication in the mouse livers in the absence of ORC2 and/or ORC1 suggests that there must be an alternate way to recruit sufficient MCM2-7 to the chromatin to support at least the three cycles of endoreduplication required to produce a 16 N nucleus from a 2 N embryonic nucleus during normal development, and to support about two cycles of endoreduplication during liver regeneration.</p><p>The acceleration and persistence of endoreduplication even when both <italic>Orc1</italic> and <italic>Orc2</italic> are genetically inactivated, makes it unlikely that a make-shift ORC-like complex is being assembled for loading the MCM2-7 proteins when two out of the five subunits in the ring are missing. Our results are virtually identical to what was observed when we conditionally deleted <italic>Orc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okano-Uchida et al., 2018</xref>). There too, endoreduplication in the liver cells not only persisted but was induced prematurely during development. One possible explanation of the greater endoreduplication in both our papers is that mitosis may be arrested earlier in development by G2 DNA damage checkpoints activated by incomplete licensing and replication of the genome in the absence of ORC. As a result, endoreduplication cycles could begin earlier in development resulting in greater endoreduplication.</p><p>Is it possible that incomplete deletion of <italic>Orc2</italic> or <italic>Orc1</italic> genes in the hepatocytes allows enough liver cells to still carry an <italic>Orc2</italic> or <italic>Orc1</italic> gene to support DNA replication? This is very unlikely, because the in vitro DNA replication experiment with hepatocytes shows that although the ORC2 protein is virtually undetectable in immunoblots and there is evidence of Cre activity in 100% of the hepatocytes, the number of nuclei incorporating EdU in culture are decreased to only 30% the wild-type level. Furthermore, in the partial hepatectomy experiments, nearly 100% of the hepatocytes are positive for EYFP and no ORC2 (or ORC1 protein in the DKO) is detectable in immunoblots of isolated hepatocytes, suggesting high penetrance in the expression of the Cre recombinase in the hepatocytes. Yet the liver succeeds in endoreduplicating to reach nearly normal liver size and EdU incorporation is seen in 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) of hepatocytes from the <italic>Orc2</italic> KO and DKO mice, respectively.</p><p>Although the liver size in the <italic>Alb-Cre, Orc2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice is not significantly decreased relative to body weight, the liver function tests suggest some impairment of liver function. We cannot yet attribute this deficit of liver function to the decrease in number of cells, or to excess endoreduplication, because ORC subunits are also known to be important for epigenetic control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). Future experiments will determine whether the liver pathology could be secondary to epigenetic dysregulation of genes important for liver function. The double knockout female mice are sicker, and here some of the explanation may lie in the smaller liver, but here again, epigenetic dysregulation in the absence of ORC cannot be ruled out as a potential cause for the morbidity.</p><p>Interestingly, the deletion of <italic>Orc2</italic> or of <italic>Orc1 + Orc2</italic>, in the hepatocytes does not <italic>consistently</italic> increase or decrease any of the other ORC subunits or the examined proteins downstream of ORC like CDC6 or two of the subunits of MCM2-7. Thus, a change in any of these proteins is unlikely to be the explanation for how the hepatocytes license enough origins to support replication during development and regeneration in the absence of the ORC holocomplex. The hepatocyte studies say that the cancer cells are not unique in their ability to bypass the requirement of two ORC subunits. Even primary cells can sometimes load enough MCM2-7 to replicate DNA in the absence of detectable amounts of the ORC holocomplex. It is also worth noting that in cancer cells in culture, we are seeing a near normal level of loading of MCM2-7 on chromatin when <italic>Orc1</italic>, <italic>Orc2,</italic> or <italic>Orc5</italic> genes are deleted, and that 60% of the origins of replication remain at the same sites as in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shibata et al., 2024</xref>). Although it is impossible to rule out that a very small amount of ORC protein somehow persists in the hepatocytes (or the cancer cell lines) with these mutations and that this is sufficient to facilitate loading of enough MCM2-7 to support DNA synthesis in vivo or in vitro, this is becoming progressively unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Work involving mice adhered to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Virginia (protocol number 4198), the University of Alabama at Birmingham (protocol number 22335), the Ohio State University and the Medical University of South Carolina. <italic>Orc1 <sup>f/f</sup> ROSA26<sup>stop-EYFP</sup></italic> animals were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okano-Uchida et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Orc2 <sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were generated by Cyagen Biosciences Inc Exons 6–7 (amino acids L111-V150) was selected as conditional knockout region (cKO).

After inducing anesthesia with 2% isoflurane and maintaining at 0.2%, the mice were subcutaneously injected with Buprenorphine-SR (0.6 mg/kg) and Carprofen (5 mg/kg). The abdominal wall was shaved and prepared aseptically. A 3 cm long transverse incision was made to expose the xiphoid. The left and middle lobes were tied using 4–0 thread and cut. The incision site was double-checked for bleeding following washed with 0.9% sodium chloride and sutured. Mice were placed on a warm pad for recovery. To detect DNA synthesis, 0.2 mg EDU (Lumiprobe #10540) was injected via the tail vein 3–4 hr before sacrifice. At 36–48 hr post-surgery, samples from the regenerating right liver were collected and weighed. For IHC and IF staining, samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, dehydrated, cleared, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5–8 μm thickness. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and heat antigen retrieval methods were applied in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH = 6.0).

Given that there are ~200,000 cells in E9.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2019</xref>), we, therefore, estimate that there are 2000 albumin positive cells at the stage when albumin mRNA expression is readily detected. Thus, normal development of the liver requires at least 20 rounds of diploid cell division from the 2000 hepatoblasts/hepatocytes seen in E9.5 embryos to produce the ~200 million hepatocyte nuclei in the adult liver (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, bottom row).</p><p>From the relative weights of the adult livers (row 1) and the relative densities of the hepatocyte nuclei (row 2) we can estimate the number of hepatocytes in the mutant livers relative to wild-type livers (row 3). The relative deficit of hepatocytes in the mutant livers allows us to estimate how many fewer cell divisions the hepatocytes underwent in the mutant livers relative to the WT livers during development (row 4). Since WT hepatocytes undergo ~20 duplications, we thus estimate that the <italic>Orc2-/-</italic> hepatocytes and the male DKO hepatocytes undergo at least 18 divisions from the 2000 hepatoblast-stage seen in E9.5 embryo, while the female DKO hepatocyte undergo at least 15 divisions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, bottom row).

This follows previous studies that examined mice that did not express ORC1 in the liver. In this study, the authors suppressed expression of ORC2 or ORC1 plus ORC2 in the liver.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>(1) I find the conclusion of the authors somewhat hard to accept. Biochemically, ORC without the ORC1 or ORC2 subunits cannot load the MCM helicase on DNA. The question arises whether the deletion in the ORC1 and ORC2 genes by Cre is not very tight, allowing some cells to replicate their DNA and allow the liver to develop, or whether the replication of DNA proceeds via non-canonical mechanisms, such as break-induced replication. The increase in the number of polyploid cells in the mice expressing Cre supports the first mechanism, because it is consistent with few cells retaining the capacity to replicate their DNA, at least for some time during development.</p><p>(2) Fig 1H shows that 5 days post infection, there is no visible expression of ORC2 in MEFs with the ORC2 flox allele. However, at 15 days post infection, some ORC2 is visible. The authors suggest that a small number of cells that retained expression of ORC2 were selected over the cells not expressing ORC2. Could a similar scenario also happen in vivo?</p><p>(3) Figs 2E-G show decreased body weight, decreased liver weight and decreased liver to body weight in mice with recombination of the ORC2 flox allele. This means that DNA replication is compromised in the ALB-ORC2f/f mice.</p><p>(4) Figs 2I-K do not report the number of hepatocytes, but the percent of hepatocytes with different nuclear sizes. I suspect that the number of hepatocytes is lower in the ALB-ORC2f/f mice than in the ORC2f/f mice. Can the authors report the actual numbers?</p><p>(5) Figs 3B-G do not report the number of nuclei, but percentages, which are plotted separately for the ORC2-f/f and ALB-ORC2-f/f mice. Can the authors report the actual numbers?</p><p>(6) Fig 5 shows the response of ORC2f/f and ALB-ORC2f/f mice after partial hepatectomy. The percent of EdU+ nuclei in the ORC2-f/f (aka ALB-CRE-/-) mice in Fig 5H seems low. Based on other publications in the field it should be about 20-30%. Why is it so low here? The very low nuclear density in the ALB-ORC2-f/f mice (Fig 5F) and the large nuclei (Fig 5I) could indicate that cells fire too few origins, proceed through S phase very slowly and fail to divide.</p><p>(7) Fig 6F shows that ALB-ORC1f/f-ORC2f/f mice have very severe phenotypes in terms of body weight and liver weight (about on third of wild-type!!). Fig 6H and 6I, the actual numbers should be presented, not percentages. The fact that there are EYFP negative cells, implies that CRE was not expressed in all hepatocytes.</p><p>(8) Comparing the EdU+ cells in Fig 7G versus 5G shows very different number of EdU+ cells in the control animals. This means that one of these images is not representative. The higher fraction of EdU+ cells in the double-knockout could mean that the hepatocytes in the double-knockout take longer to complete DNA replication than the control hepatocytes. The control hepatocytes may have already completed DNA replication, which can explain why the fraction of EdU+ cells is so low in the controls. The authors may need to study mice at earlier time points after partial hepatectomy, i.e. sacrifice the mice at 30-32 hours, instead of 40-52 hours.</p><p>(9) Regarding the calculation of the number of cell divisions during development: the authors assume that all the hepatocytes in the adult liver are derived from hepatoblasts that express Alb. Is it possible to exclude the possibility that pre-hepatoblast cells that do not express Alb give rise to hepatocytes? For example, the cells that give rise to hepatoblasts may proliferate more times than normal giving rise to a higher number of hepatoblasts than in wild-type mice.</p><p>(10) My interpretation of the data is that not all hepatocytes have the ORC1 and ORC2 genes deleted (eg EYFP-negative cells) and that these cells allow some proliferation in the livers of these mice.</p><p>My comments regarding the previous version still stand, since the authors did not perform experiments to address them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102915.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors address the role of ORC in DNA replication and that this protein complex is not essential for DNA replication in hepatocytes. They provide evidence that ORC subunit levels are substantially reduced in cells that have been induced to delete multiple exons of the corresponding ORC gene(s) in hepatocytes. They evaluate replication both in purified isolated hepatocytes and in mice after hepatectomy. In both cases, there is clear evidence that DNA replication does not decrease at a level that corresponds with the decrease in detectable ORC subunit and that endoreduplication is the primary type of replication observed. It remains possible that small amounts of residual ORC are responsible for the replication observed, although the authors provide arguments against this possibility. The mechanisms responsible for the DNA replication observed in the absence of ORC are not examined, including why such replication would primarily be due to endoreduplication.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors clearly show that there are dramatic reductions in the amount of the targeted ORC subunits in the cells that have been targeted for deletion. They also provide clear evidence that there is replication in a subset of these cells and that it is likely due to endoreduplication. Although there is no replication in MEFs derived from cells with the deletion, there is clearly DNA replication occurring in hepatocytes (both isolated in culture and in the context of the liver). Interestingly, the cells undergoing replication exhibit enlarged cell sizes and elevated ploidy indicating endoreduplication of the genome. These findings raise the interesting possibility that endoreduplication does not require ORC while normal replication does.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There remain two significant weaknesses in this manuscript. The first is that although there is clearly robust reduction of the targeted ORC subunit, the authors cannot confirm that it is deleted in all cells. For example, the analysis in Fig. 4B would suggest that a substantial number of cells have not lost the targeted region of ORC2. In their response, the authors suggest that this is due to contaminating non-hepatocyte cells but do not provide evidence that this is the case. Although the western blots show stronger effects, this type of analysis is notorious for non-linear response curves and no standards are not provided. The second weakness is that there is no evaluation of the molecular nature of the replication observed. In response to the initial review the authors point out that a previous publication mapped Mcm2-7 loading in the absence of ORC1, ORC2 and ORC5 and saw no deficit or altered location. Unfortunately, this is not done for the mutants discussed here and this previous data supports a model that limiting residual ORC is responsible for the replication observed rather than some novel mechanism (which would be expected to alter location or amounts of loading). The manuscript provides no exploration of why &quot;ORC-independent&quot; replication would drive endoreduplicaiton (which is the strongest evidence for an alternative mechanism of initiation but is unique to this experiment and not the previously mutants analyzed for Mcm2-7 loading). Most importantly, it remains true that after numerous papers from this lab and others claiming that ORC is not required for eukaryotic DNA replication, we still have no information about an alternative pathway that could explain Mcm2-7 loading in the absence of ORC. Without some insights in this area, studies such as these will remain controversial.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102915.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Przanowska</surname><given-names>Roza K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yuechuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>Takayuki-Okano</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milwaukee</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shibata</surname><given-names>Etsuko</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Xiaoxiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rueda</surname><given-names>Isaac Segura</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Przanowski</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Trimboli</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milwaukee</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shibata</surname><given-names>Yoshiyuki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leone</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milwaukee</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dutta</surname><given-names>Anindya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Birmingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This descriptive manuscript builds on prior research showing that the elimination of Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) subunits does not halt DNA replication.

Till now we know of only one paper that mapped origins of replication in regenerating mouse liver, and that was published two months back in Cell (PMID: 39293447). We want to adopt this method, but we do not need it to answer the question asked. We have mapped origins of replication in ORC-deleted cancer cell lines and compared to wild-type cells in Shibata et al., BioRXiv (PMID: 39554186) (it is under review). We report the following: Mapping of origins in cancer cell lines that are wild type or engineered to delete three of the subunits, <italic>ORC1</italic>, <italic>ORC2</italic> or <italic>ORC5</italic> shows that specific origins are still used and are mostly at the same sites in the genome as in wild type cells. Of the 30,197 origins in wild type cells (with ORC), only 2,466 (8%) are not used in any of the three ORC deleted cells and 18,319 (60%) are common between the four cell types. Despite the lack of ORC, excess MCM2-7 is still loaded at comparable rates in G1 phase to license reserve origins and is also repeatedly loaded in the same S phase to permit re-replication.</p><p>Citation: Specific origin selection and excess functional MCM2-7 loading in ORC-deficient cells.

In females the liver and body weight are low (although in proportion to each other), which maybe is what the reviewer is talking about. However, the fact that liver weight and body weight are not as low in males, suggest that this is a gender (hormone?) specific effect and not a DNA replication defect. We had discussed this possibility. We have another paper also in BioRXiv (Su et al. doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.18.629220) that suggests that ORC subunits have significant effect on gene expression, so it is possible that that is what leads to this sexual dimorphism in phenotype. We have now added this to the discussion.</p><p>The bottom 40% of nuclei on the EYFP axis in the FACS profiles (what was labeled EYFP negative but will now be called EYFP low) contains mostly non-hepatocytes that are genuinely EYFP negative. Non-hepatocytes (bile duct cells, endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, blood cells) are a significant part of cells in the dissociated liver (as can be seen in the single cell sequencing results in PMID: 32690901). Their presence does not mean that hepatocytes are not expressing Cre. Hepatocytes are nearly 100% EYFP positive, as can be seen in the tissue sections (where the hepatocytes take up most of visual field) and in cells in culture. Also if there are EYFP negative hepatocyte nuclei in the FACS, that still does not rule out EYFP presence in the cytoplasm. The important point from the FACS is that the EYFP high nuclei (which have expressed Cre for the longest period) are polyploid relative to the EYFP low nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Comparing the EdU+ cells in Fig 7G versus 5G shows very different number of EdU+ cells in the control animals.

The higher fraction of EdU+ cells in the double-knockout could mean that the hepatocytes in the double-knockout take longer to complete DNA replication than the control hepatocytes. The control hepatocytes may have already completed DNA replication, which can explain why the fraction of EdU+ cells is so low in the controls. The authors may need to study mice at earlier time points after partial hepatectomy, i.e. sacrifice the mice at 30-32 hours, instead of 40-52 hours.</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent difference that the reviewer comments on stems from differences in nuclear density in the images in Fig. 7G and 5G (also quantitated in Fig. 7F and 5F). The quantitation in Fig. 7H and 5H show that the % of EdU plus cells are comparable (5-8%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Regarding the calculation of the number of cell divisions during development: the authors assume that all the hepatocytes in the adult liver are derived from hepatoblasts that express Alb. Is it possible to exclude the possibility that pre-hepatoblast cells that do not express Alb give rise to hepatocytes? For example the cells that give rise to hepatoblasts may proliferate more times than normal giving rise to a higher number of hepatoblasts than in wild-type mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Single cell sequencing of mouse liver at e11 shows hepatoblasts expressing hepatocyte specific markers (PMID: 32690901). All the cells annotated from the single-cell seq analysis are differentiated cells arguing against the possibility that undifferentiated endodermal cells (what the reviewer probably means by pre-hepatoblasts) exist at e11. We have added this citation to the paper.</p><p>Here is a review that says the hepatoblasts expressing Albumin are present before e13. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27068/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27068/</ext-link>) says: “The differentiation of bi-potential hepatoblasts into hepatocytes or BECs begins around e13 of mouse development. Initially hepatoblasts express genes associated with both adult hepatocytes (<italic>Hnf4α, Albumin</italic>) ...” Thus, we can be certain that hepatoblasts before e13 express albumin. Our calculation of number of cell divisions in Table 2 begins from e12.</p><p>The reviewer may be suggesting that ORC deletion leads to the immediate demise of hepatoblasts (despite having inherited ORC protein from the endodermal cells) causing undifferentiated endodermal cells to persist and proliferate much longer than in normal development. We consider it unlikely, but if true it will be very unexpected, both by suggesting that deletion of ORC immediately leads to the death of the hepatoblasts (despite a healthy reserve of inherited ORC protein) and by suggesting that there is a novel feedback mechanism from the death/depletion of hepatoblasts leading to the persistence and proliferation of undifferentiated endodermal cells. We have added the reviewer’s suggestion to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) My interpretation of the data is that not all hepatocytes have the ORC1 and ORC2 genes deleted (eg EYFP-negative cells) and that these cells allow some proliferation in the livers of these mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the reply in question #1. Particularly relevant: “Finally, the <italic>Alb-ORC2f/f</italic> mice have 25-37.5% of the number of hepatocyte nuclei compared to WT mice (Table 2).

They provide evidence that ORC subunit levels are substantially reduced in cells that have been induced to delete multiple exons of the corresponding ORC gene(s) in hepatocytes. They evaluate replication both in purified isolated hepatocytes and in mice after hepatectomy. In both cases, there is clear evidence that DNA replication does not decrease at a level that corresponds with the decrease in detectable ORC subunit and that endoreduplication is the primary type of replication observed. It remains possible that small amounts of residual ORC are responsible for the replication observed, although the authors provide arguments against this possibility. The mechanisms responsible for DNA replication in the absence of ORC are not examined.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors clearly show that there are dramatic reductions in the amount of the targeted ORC subunits in the cells that have been targeted for deletion. They also provide clear evidence that there is replication in a subset of these cells and that it is likely due to endoreduplication. Although there is no replication in MEFs derived from cells with the deletion, there is clearly DNA replication occurring in hepatocytes (both isolated in culture and in the context of the liver). Interestingly, the cells undergoing replication exhibit enlarged cell sizes and elevated ploidy indicating endoreduplication of the genome. These findings raise the interesting possibility that endoreduplication does not require ORC while normal replication does.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are two significant weaknesses in this manuscript. The first is that although there is clearly robust reduction of the targeted ORC subunit, the authors cannot confirm that it is deleted in all cells. For example, the analysis in Fig. 4B would suggest that a substantial number of cells have not lost the targeted region of ORC2. Although the western blots show stronger effects, this type of analysis is notorious for non-linear response curves and no standards are provided. The second weakness is that there is no evaluation of the molecular nature of the replication observed. Are there changes in the amount of location of Mcm2-7 loading that is usually mediated by ORC? Does an associated change in Mcm2-7 loading lead to the endoreduplication observed? After numerous papers from this lab and others claiming that ORC is not required for eukaryotic DNA replication in a subset of cells, we still have no information about an alternative pathway that could explain this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see a significant deficit in MCM2-7 loading (amount and rate) in cancer cell lines where we have deleted <italic>ORC1</italic>, <italic>ORC2</italic> or <italic>ORC5</italic> genes separately in Shibata et al. bioRxiv 2024.10.30.621095; doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.30.621095">https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.30.621095</ext-link> (PMID: 39554186).

Although likely the best visual marker for this, it is not demonstrated that the presence of eYFP ensures that ORC2 has been targeted by Cre. For example, based on the data in Fig. 4B, there seems to be a substantial percentage of ORC2 genes that have not been targeted while the authors report that 100% of the cells express eYFP.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) The PCR reactions in Fig. 4B are still contaminated by DNA from non-hepatocyte cells: bile duct cells, endothelial, Kupfer cells and blood cells.

If possible, mice should be examined 30-32 hours after partial hepatectomy.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the Literature we chose a time that is consistent with the previous paper from us (Uchida et al., Genes &amp; Dev).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It would improve the paper to use single-cell methods (e.g. FISH) to assess the deletion of ORC subunits in the targeted cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is something we will reserve for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The importance of the paper would be increased dramatically by showing that the elimination of ORC changed the location of Mcm2-7 loading. This would be highly likely if the authors hypothesis that ORC is not involved is true. On the other hand, given ORC's role in origin selection, an observation that the same sites are used but less frequently would support a hypothesis that residual intact ORC is responsible for the replication observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Shibata et al (PMID: 39554186) has answered this question. The loss of ORC does not change the locations of origins or even the ability to specify origins. We argue that this is what is to be expected from our hypothesis, that although ORC is clearly important for MCM loading in yeast and in biochemical experiments, something unexpected is going on in human cells. Either a vanishingly small amount of ORC (undetectable by commonly used methods) can load the full complement of MCM2-7 at a rate that is comparable to wild type cells, or there is an ORC-independent mechanism of MCM2-7 loading. This is now added to the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
