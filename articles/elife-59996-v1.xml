effects. In animal models, repeated exertion reduces malignant tumor progression, and clinically, exercise can improve outcome for cancer patients. The etiology of the effects of exercise on tumor progression are unclear, as are the cellular actors involved. We show here that in mice, exercise-induced reduction in tumor growth is dependent on CD8+ T cells, and that metabolites produced in skeletal muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion in both mice and humans enhance the effector profile of CD8+ T-cells. We found that activated murine CD8+ T cells alter their central carbon metabolism in response to exertion in vivo, and that immune cells from trained mice are more potent antitumor effector cells when transferred into tumor-bearing untrained animals. These data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells are metabolically altered by exercise in a manner that acts to improve their antitumoral efficacy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Exercise affects almost all tissues in the body, and scientists have found that being physically active can reduce the risk of several types of cancer as well as improving outcomes for cancer patients. However, it is still unknown how exercise exerts its protective effects. One of the hallmarks of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to evade detection by the immune system, which can in some cases stop the body from eliminating tumor cells.</p><p>Rundqvist et al. used mice to investigate how exercise helps the immune system act against tumor progression. They found that when mice exercised, tumor growth was reduced, and this decrease in growth depended on the levels of a specific type of immune cell, the CD8+ T cell, circulating in the blood. Additionally, Rundqvist et al. found that CD8+ T cells were made more effective by molecules that muscles released into the blood during exercise. Isolating immune cells after intense exercise showed that these super-effective CD8+ T cells alter how they use molecules for energy production after exertion. Next, immune cells from mice that had exercised frequently were transferred into mice that had not exercised, where they were more effective against tumor cells than the immune cells from untrained mice.</p><p>These results demonstrate that CD8+ T cells are altered by exercise to improve their effectiveness against tumors. The ability of T cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is essential to avoid tumor growth, and is one of the foundations of current immune therapy treatments. Exercise could improve the outcome of these treatments by increasing the activation of the immune system, making tumor-fighting cells more effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wallenberg Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007687</institution-id><institution>Svenska Läkaresällskapet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rundqvist</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gameiro</surname><given-names>Paulo A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ule</surname><given-names>Jernej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Principal Research Fellowship 214283/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exercise can induce metabolic changes that strikingly impact cytotoxic T cell function and in turn affect cancer progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, exercising cohorts have lower rates of cancer incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2016</xref>) and better outcomes across a range of cancer diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cormie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedenreich et al., 2016</xref>), proportionate to the degree and intensity of exercise. The mechanisms underlying these observations have remained elusive, although recent work has indicated a relationship between immune response and exercise-induced changes in malignant progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koelwyn et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The metabolic demands of strenuous physical exertion generally induce significant changes in nutrient utilization, principally via central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks, 1998</xref>). These exercise-induced alterations in metabolism change the ratios of energy substrates utilized, and can shift intramuscular metabolite profiles. These shifts are reflected in systemic metabolite availability, which in turn modifies energy production throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lezi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Hayek et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is clear that cytotoxic T cells play a crucial role in controlling tumor growth. By recognizing mutation-derived neoantigens, T cells can identify and eliminate malignant cells in a process known as immunosurveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>). Escape from immune control is a critical step toward progressive malignant growth in many cancers, and tumors achieve this in a number of ways, amongst them the dampening of antitumor T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beatty and Gladney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zappasodi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The activity of immune cells is tightly linked with their metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearce and Pearce, 2013</xref>). Many aspects of immune cell energetics are likely sensitive to the metabolic changes induced by exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henderson et al., 2004</xref>). Exercise is known to affect immune cell function, and an altered immune response has been suggested as a mechanism underlying effects of exercise on cancer risk and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigate the association between exercise, tumor growth, and CD8+ T-cell function. To address this, we undertook studies of exercise-induced changes in tumor progression, and asked what metabolites are released in response to exercise; as well as whether metabolites produced by exercise can alter cytotoxic T-cell function. We found that exercise itself can modify cytotoxic T-cell metabolism, and that exercise-induced effects on tumor growth are dependent on cytotoxic T-cell activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of CD8+ T cells abolishes the anticancer effects of exercise training</title><p>To address the role of immunity on the effects of exercise in neoplasia, we first assessed how repeated voluntary exertion influenced tumor progression in mice, using a genetic model of mammary cancer induced by the MMTV-PyMT transgene on the FVB inbred strain background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). FVB inbred mice are enthusiastic runners relative to most other inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avila et al., 2017</xref>), and the MMTV-PyMT model in many regard mimics the gradual progression of human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2003</xref>). PyMT+ mice ran on average 6 km/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Contrary to what was previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goh et al., 2013</xref>), the running mice in our experiments showed no statistically significant differences in tumor growth between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C- G</xref>). However, the infiltration of Granzyme B (GZMB)-positive cells was significantly higher in primary tumors of running mice, even though voluntary running had no effect on the frequency of CD3, F4/80, PCNA, or podocalyxin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This indicates that exercise in this tumor model modulates the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes.</p><p>Given that infiltration of cytotoxic T cells is linked to a favorable prognosis in many human neoplasms and in some animal tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Savas et al., 2016</xref>), we proceeded to explore the role of lymphoid cells, and in particular cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, on the process of exercise-induced reduction of tumor growth. As the progression of the transgenic MMTV-PyMT model is predominantly regulated by myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2003</xref>), we carried out a further set of experiments, wherein immunocompetent FVB mice were given access to an exercise wheel 14 days prior to, and then following, subcutaneous injection with a murine mammary cancer line derived from the MMTV-PyMT model, the I3TC cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Recent studies suggest that exercise reduces cancer recurrence and mortality, and the effect of exercise on tumorigenic progression has now been documented in a range of animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruiz-Casado et al., 2017</xref>). Previously proposed underlying mechanisms for the anti-neoplastic effects of exercise include effects on weight control and endocrine hormone levels, as well as altered tumor vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betof et al., 2015</xref>) and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleeson et al., 2011</xref>). Exercise has been shown to reduce systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleeson et al., 2011</xref>), cause increases in circulating numbers of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gustafson et al., 2017</xref>) and enhance vaccination response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledo et al., 2020</xref>). Systemic levels of both CD8+ T cell and NK cell levels increase transiently in response to acute exercise. There is evidence that these immune cells populations exhibit an effector phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>) and an increased peripheral tissue homing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krüger and Mooren, 2007</xref>), both important for anti-tumor activity.</p><p>Exercise is a multimodal stimulus. Systemic signaling from activated skeletal muscle to immune cell function has been attributed previously to for example skeletal muscle-derived myokines such as IL-6 and Oncostatin-M (OSM), and to catecholamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleeson et al., 2011</xref>). In a recent study, Hojman et al., showed that an increase in systemic levels of epinephrine during exercise together with skeletal muscle IL-6 could increase NK cell recruitment during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>). However, in the mouse models employed here we found limited infiltration and no effect of exercise on the CD3- NK1.1+ population, relative to our observation of an increased frequency of CD3+/CD8+ T cells. The results from depletion and adoptive transfer of the CD8+ population provide further support for the importance of cytotoxic T-cells in mediating the anti-neoplastic effects of exercise.</p><p>Immune cells patrol all corners of the body and can reside in niches with highly differential metabolic profiles. Recent findings have provided evidence that these different environments can instruct effector functions of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buck et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we show how exercise modulates metabolic parameters significantly beyond local skeletal muscle. We found that lactate and TCA metabolites accumulated in both the active skeletal muscle and in plasma and secondary lymphoid organs after acute exertion.</p><p>As trafficking immune cells circulate, they will often be exposed to high levels of accumulating metabolites, in both loci of disease and in metabolically active tissues. However, the principal shaping of immune function happens at the point of activation, primarily occurring in the lymphoid organs. In evaluating the role an altered metabolic environment plays in the process of modifying CD8+ T-cell function, we found that key metabolites, including lactate, had unexpected functions in the activation of CD8+ T cells, with multiple TCA metabolites stimulating the loss of CD62L. CD62L shedding from TCR activated CD8+ T-cells has been suggested to be mTOR and PI3K dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinclair et al., 2008</xref>) and aKG-mediated activation of mTORC1 has been reported in multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durán et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villar et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in activated CD8+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the metabolite-induced loss of CD62L may be mediated through mTOR activation. In addition, we found that lactate induces an effector profile and an overall increase in cytotoxic activity.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, within the local micro-environment, tumor-derived lactate has been shown to inhibit the antitumor functions of both T and NK cells due to intracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brand et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, lactate-associated acidity has been shown to impair CD8+ T cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haas et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, within poorly vascularized and fast-growing tumor masses, or in laboratory ex vivo cultures, lactic acid export from cells results in a significant acidosis. However, healthy tissue microenvironments are very efficiently buffered, and capable of maintaining a physiological pH range even when large amounts of lactate are produced.</p><p>Our findings that circulating levels of TCA metabolites increase by 2–8 fold after exercise suggests that at peripheral sites, substantial amounts of these metabolites have been released into the lymphatic fluid draining the muscle tissue. Additionally, a recent paper using lymphatic cannulation showed that TCA metabolites are readily available in, for example, mesenteric lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, to mimic the activation of T cells in a lymphoid organ exposed to the physiologically buffered metabolites generated by exercising muscle, we activated CD8+ T cells in the presence of TCA metabolites and lactate in media adjusted to a physiological pH.</p><p>The use of distally produced lactate as a fuel for oxidative respiration was described for inactive muscle already in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorfeldt, 1970</xref>) and has recently been reported in both malignant and non-malignant cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faubert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hui et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that lactate can be used as a primary fuel by CD8+ T cells, at least during early activation. In vivo administration of labeled glucose two and three days after vaccination, led to differential levels of labeled pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate in CD8+ T-cells of the spleen post-exercise. Dilution of 13C labeling between glycolysis and TCA cycle intermediates can imply oxidation of alternative fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hensley et al., 2016</xref>). The administered 13C-glucose was, as expected, used as a carbon source by CD8+ T cells. Although total glucose levels were similar between T-cells from exercising and non-exercising animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the availability of labeled glucose appeared lower in exercised animals, reflected by lower total 13C-glucose counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The reduced availability is most likely due to dilution of the 13C-glucose in the circulating blood glucose pool due to a contribution from hepatic glycogenolysis, stimulated by the increased metabolic demand during exercise. When normalized to the labeled glucose fraction, exercise altered the central carbon metabolism of activated CD8+T-cells in vivo at the level of m+3 labeled pyruvate and m+2 labeled aKG. This finding suggests an increased uptake of systemic metabolites by activated T-cells during exercise.</p><p>When isolating the exercise effect on the CD8+ T-cell population by transferring cells from exercised animals to tumor bearing, non-exercising recipients, we show an enhanced efficiency in reducing tumor growth by the T-cells obtained from exercising individuals. These results demonstrate that in our models, the exercise effect is exerted by and inherent to the CD8+ T cell population.</p><p>In the experimental setting where animals were given daily doses of high levels of sodium L-lactate, we found an increase in intratumoral CD8+ T-cells and a decrease in overall tumor growth. In addition, we found high levels of CD4+ cells and reduced NK-cell infiltration, supporting previous evidence that lactate can affect multiple cells of the immune system. These findings indicate that lactate infusion mimics some of the effects of exercise, but that exercise has additional, integrative, components beyond merely increased levels of lactate.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the antitumoral effects of exercise depend on CD8+ T-cells, and that intense exertion can alter the intrinsic metabolism and antitumoral effector function of cytotoxic T-cells. This indicates that, in the physiological setting, exercise-derived metabolites, whether systemically delivered or draining into an adjacent lymph node, could act to boost a nascent T cell response. This indicates that the adaptive immune system is a key component of exercise-induced suppression of tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The highest staging value of each specimen was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Organ harvest and metabolite extraction</title><p>For the metabolite analyses, blood and skeletal muscle (quadriceps) (Metabolite analysis 1) or blood together with five different tissue types (Metabolite analysis 2) were harvested from both exercising and control animals. Immediately after the exhaustion test, blood was collected from the mouse tail into a lithium heparin-covered microvette tube and kept at room temperature until further processing. Mice were subsequently euthanized by cervical dislocation prior to tissue collection. Biopsies of spleen, muscle, muscle-draining/non-draining lymph nodes and thymus were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. To assure that the right lymph nodes were collected, the muscle-draining lymph nodes had been identified in a previous experiment by injecting either the hind or the forelimb muscle of live animals with Patent Blue dye. The level of perfusion of local lymph nodes, under anesthesia, was then checked. The forelimb, muscle-draining lymph nodes showed to be the most easily accessible. Non-draining lymph nodes were harvested from the inguinal fat pad. Plasma was obtained by gradient centrifugation at 2000xg for 5 min at room temperature and stored at −80.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>GC/MS analysis</title><p>The initial metabolic profiling by GC-MS was performed at the Swedish Metabolomics Center in Umeå, Sweden. Information about reagents, solvents, standards, reference and tuning standards, and stable isotopes internal standards can be found as Supplementary information.</p><p>Sample Preparation: Extraction was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiye et al., 2005</xref>). For the plasma samples of extraction buffer (90/10 v/v methanol: water) including internal standards were added to the plasma samples. The volume of plasma varied from 25 µL to 100 µL and the volume of extraction solution was adjusted accordingly keeping the volume ratio of plasma to extraction solution constant (10/90 v/v plasma: extraction solution). The samples were shaken at 30 Hz for 2 min in a mixer mill and proteins were precipitated for 2 hr at −20°C. The samples were centrifuged at +4°C, 14,000 rpm, for 10 min. 200 µL (LC-MS) and 50 µL (GC-MS) of the supernatant was transferred to microvials and solvents were evaporated to dryness. For muscle tissue samples (all samples 20 mg + / - 2 mg with the individual weight of each sample noted), 1000 µl extraction buffer (90/10 v/v methanol: water) including internal standards was added to the tissue samples. To all tissue samples two tungsten beads were added and samples were shaken at 30 Hz for 3 min in a mixer mill. The samples were centrifuged at +4°C, 14,000 rpm, for 10 min. 50 µL (GC-MS) of the supernatant was transferred to micro vials and solvents were evaporated to dryness.</p><p>A small aliquot of the remaining supernatants were pooled and used to create quality control (QC) samples. The samples were analyzed in batches (different sample types) according to a randomized run order on GC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>UHPLC/MS analysis</title><p>Briefly, the second analysis was done on the Precision Metabolomics platform at Metabolon Inc (Morrisville, NC, US) samples were homogenized and subjected to methanol extraction then split into aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods) and negative (two methods) mode. Metabolites were then identified by automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards followed by visual inspection for quality control (as previously described, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehaven et al., 2010</xref>). For statistical analyses and data display, any missing values are assumed to be below the limits of detection; these values were imputed with the compound minimum (minimum value imputation). Statistical tests were performed in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or ‘R’ to compare data between experimental groups; p&lt;0.05 is considered significant and 0.05 &lt; p 0.10 to be trending. An estimate of the false discovery rate (Q-value) is also calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with q &lt; 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Isotopic labeling, metabolite extraction, and GC/MS analysis</title><p>Mouse CD8+ T cells, purified from spleen of vaccinated animals, directly after an exhaustion test, was washed with PBS, and metabolic activity quenched by freezing samples in dry ice and ethanol, and stored at −80 °C. Metabolites were extracted by addition of 600 μl ice-cold 1:1 (vol/vol) methanol/water (containing 1 nmol scyllo-Inositol as internal standard) to the cell pellets, samples were transferred to a chilled microcentrifuge tube containing 300 μl chloroform and 600 μl methanol (1500 μl total, in 3:1:1 vol/vol methanol/water/chloroform). Samples were sonicated in a water bath for 8 min at 4°C, and centrifuged (13,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing the extract was transferred to a new tube for evaporation in a speed-vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 3:3:1 (vol/vol/vol) methanol/water/chloroform (350 μl total) to phase separate polar metabolites (upper aqueous phase) from apolar metabolites (lower organic phase), and centrifuged. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube for evaporation in a speed-vacuum centrifuge, washed with 60 μl methanol, dried again, and derivatized by methoximation (20 μl of 20 mg/ml methoxyamine in pyridine, RT overnight) and trimethylsilylation (20 μl of N,O-bis(trimetylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 1% trimethylchlorosilane) (Sigma, 33148) for ≥1 hr. GC/MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890B-5977A system equipped with a 30 m + 10 m × 0.25 mm DB-5MS + DG column (Agilent J and W) connected to an MS operating in electron-impact ionization (EI) mode. One microliter was injected in splitless mode at 270°C, with a helium carrier gas. The GC oven temperature was held at 70°C for 2 min and subsequently increased to 295°C at 12.5°C/min, then to 320°C at 25°C/min (held for 3 min). MassHunter Workstation (B.06.00 SP01, Agilent Technologies) was used for metabolite identification by comparison of retention times, mass spectra and responses of known amounts of authentic standards. Metabolite abundance and mass isotopologue distributions (MID) with correction of natural 13C abundance were determined by integrating the appropriate ion fragments using GAVIN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 7 version 7.0 (GraphPad).

background and with the right tumor cell line exercise protects in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. Using metabolomics, the study focused on lactate as a potential mediator to increase CD8 T cell function and anti-tumor activities. This is supported by studies in which mice with tumors are injected with lactate and partially protected as tumor growth slows.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytotoxic T-cells mediate an exercise-induced reduction in tumor growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Randy Hampton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 3, the authors test the effects of a number of exercise-induced metabolites on CD8+ T cells in vitro. One major concern of this experimental approach is that the authors should show or state the physiological levels of those metabolites in vivo (e.g. serum levels), and then use proper ranges of concentrations for the in vitro experiments.</p><p>In Figure 3B, most metabolites (malate, succinate, fumarate, lactate and aKG) exert their functions at 1.56-3.13 mM concentrations. The authors should confirm whether the concentrations of those metabolites are within the ranges of their physiological levels. In addition, in Figure 3E, the authors used 40 mM lactate for the CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity assay, seemingly high relative to the known physiological concentration of lactate.</p><p>2) In addition to tumor tissues, does exercise affect CD8+ T cell populations in other lymphoid tissues? According to Figure 1E, the authors state that &quot;Here, only CD8+ T cells showed a significant increase in frequency across these three tissues in the running animals&quot;. However, statistically significant differences were observed only in &quot;Tumor&quot; group. The authors should clearly show whether the differences in &quot;Spleen&quot; and &quot;LN&quot; groups are statistically significant, which is important for clarifying whether the effects of exercise on CD8+ T cell population are global or specific to tumor tissues.</p><p>3) Other proposed mechanisms of exercise-induced regulation of tumors, such as modulation of IL6, are not really addressed. It would be helpful for the authors to measure this cytokine in response to their exercise regimens.</p><p>4) In Figure 3B-D, the lactate and sodium L-lactate display different effects on CD8+ T cells. Since lactate and sodium L-lactate are similar metabolites after pH neutralization, the authors should explain why they show different functions. In addition, what is the physiological form of lactate in vivo, lactate or sodium L-lactate? I think the authors should use the physiological one to do the mechanistic and functional study.</p><p>5) For Figure 3C and D, the authors should clarify the underlying mechanisms by which sodium L-lactate increases the expressions of iCOS and Granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Moreover, do the exercise-induced metabolites affect the expressions of other co-stimulatory molecules in CD8+ T cells such as CD28, PD-1 or CTLA-4?</p><p>6) In Figure 6, the authors show the anti-tumor function of sodium L-lactate in vivo and demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations are increased after daily sodium L-lactate treatment.

One major concern of this experimental approach is that the authors should show or state the physiological levels of those metabolites in vivo (e.g. serum levels), and then use proper ranges of concentrations for the in vitro experiments.</p><p>In Figure 3B, most metabolites (malate, succinate, fumarate, lactate and aKG) exert their functions at 1.56-3.13 mM concentrations. The authors should confirm whether the concentrations of those metabolites are within the ranges of their physiological levels. In addition, in Figure 3E, the authors used 40 mM lactate for the CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity assay, seemingly high relative to the known physiological concentration of lactate.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers request we have included a table of resting, adult, human plasma levels of relevant metabolites in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Data from the current manuscript unfortunately does not allow comparison of absolute levels between organs, and while data from the plasma represents primarily extracellular levels, metabolite concentrations from targeted organs represent a mix of intra- and extra-cellular levels. The comparison between exercised and non-exercised samples however, control for this, and allow us to detect exercise-induced differences within each organ. Box plots from the current manuscript are provided below, showing increases in plasma metabolites, and supporting a substantial local release. In addition, post-exercise increases of lactate (16-fold), pyruvate (8-fold), succinate (4-fold) and citrate (2-fold), relative to resting levels, has been described in the recent systematic review by Schranner, et al.<sup>1</sup>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59996-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the current manuscript, one of our primary findings is that systemic (plasma) levels of TCA metabolites increase significantly in response to acute exercise. Serum increases in the ranges of 28 fold suggest that at peripheral sites substantial amounts have been released. We agree with the reviewers that the in vitro responses of CD8+ T-cells shown in Figure 3 are in part at levels higher than commonly detected in plasma; however, we propose that at certain times and in some situations, e.g., when exposed to lymphatic fluid from muscle drainage post-exercise, the local extracellular concentration of TCA metabolites extends to these higher ranges.The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“To test this, we activated CD8+ T cells ex vivo for 3 days in the presence of increasing doses (25µM-50mM) of pH-neutralized lactic acid, pyruvic acid, citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, a-ketoglutaric acid, or sodium L-lactate. Reference human resting serum levels are provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A.” and</p><p><italic>“</italic>Our findings that circulating levels of TCA metabolites increase by 2-8 fold after exercise, suggests that at peripheral sites, substantial amounts of these metabolites have been released into the lymphatic fluid draining the muscle tissue. […] Thus, to mimic the activation of T cells in a lymphoid organ exposed to the physiologically buffered metabolites generated by exercising muscle, we activated CD8+ T cells in the presence of TCA metabolites and lactate in media adjusted to a physiological pH.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition to tumor tissues, does exercise affect CD8+ T cell populations in other lymphoid tissues? According to Figure 1E, the authors state that &quot;Here, only CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed a significant increase in frequency across these three tissues in the running animals&quot;. However, statistically significant differences were observed only in &quot;Tumor&quot; group. The authors should clearly show whether the differences in &quot;Spleen&quot; and &quot;LN&quot; groups are statistically significant, which is important for clarifying whether the effects of exercise on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population are global or specific to tumor tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical analysis for Figure 1E is made as a column factor two-way ANOVA that takes all tissues into account (this has now been clarified in the figure legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Other proposed mechanisms of exercise-induced regulation of tumors, such as modulation of IL6, are not really addressed. It would be helpful for the authors to measure this cytokine in response to their exercise regimens.</p></disp-quote><p>There is substantial literature about the release of IL-6 from skeletal muscle, primarily in humans and in response to longer duration exercise. The Cell Metabolism paper by the late Professor Hojman’s group, from 2016, reports higher levels of IL-6 in exercising animals. We have carried out a cytokine array analysis of the PyMT model, data included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> and 3, and the trend is an increased level of IL-6 in tumor-bearing animals, and a reduction of steady state IL-6 levels in exercising animals, both non-tumor-bearing and tumor-bearing.</p><p>To investigate the acute effects of treadmill exercise on systemic IL-6 levels, we conducted a treadmill exhaustive exercise protocol, and measured lactate from the tail vein and IL-6 in heparin plasma from heart puncture, both directly after exercise. The control group in this case consisted of non-exercising animals. In this experiment we see no difference in systemic IL-6 levels, although the variability is somewhat reduced in the exercising animals; this is similar to the findings of Hojman et al. Although we cannot rule out IL-6 (or any other cytokine-mediated effect) as a contributor to mobilization or recruitment of immune cells in response to exercise, we find this beyond the scope of the current manuscript. As expected, lactate levels increase in response to the acute exercise, and the lactate data is now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cytokine array (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA), describing the cytokine profile in serum from WT and tumor bearing (PyMT) running and non-running mice.</title><p>Chemiluminiscens detection was done on the ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59996-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Left panel, mouse IL-6 plasma (RnD ELISA, heart puncture) levels after an acute treadmill exercise and in control animals.</title><p>Right panel, blood (tail vein) lactate in the same cohort (Accutrend device).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59996-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 3B-D, the lactate and sodium L-lactate display different effects on CD8+ T cells. Since lactate and sodium L-lactate are similar metabolites after pH neutralization, the authors should explain why they show different functions. In addition, what is the physiological form of lactate in vivo, lactate or sodium L-lactate? I think the authors should use the physiological one to do the mechanistic and functional study.</p></disp-quote><p>In the physiological setting, the excess H+ seen in conjunction with lactic acid production will be buffered by a range of different in vivo buffering systems, including phosphate and bicarbonate. In an attempt to model an increased lactate availability without significantly altering pH, we used the two different strategies shown in Figure 3 (Lactic acid buffered to pH 7.35 with NaOH, and Sodium Lactate). The difference in T-cell response is indeed puzzling but may illuminate an aspect of how lactate exerts its effect on cytotoxic T-cells, a subject currently under intense investigation in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For Figure 3C and D, the authors should clarify the underlying mechanisms by which sodium L-lactate increases the expressions of iCOS and Granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Moreover, do the exercise-induced metabolites affect the expressions of other co-stimulatory molecules in CD8+ T cells such as CD28, PD-1 or CTLA-4?</p></disp-quote><p>The underlying mechanisms explaining the functional changes found in T-cells in response to metabolite exposure is the primary focus of multiple research consortia. For example, in a recent Nature Metabolism publication from Erika Pearce’s group, glucose deprivation alters the function of CD8+ T-cells and leads to an improved anti-tumor function<sup>2</sup>; there, the mechanism proposed is that re-exposure to glucose enhances the PPP, and thereby allows for increased expansion. We are currently exploring a number of models to explain the overall role of lactate in different microenvironmental settings, with a view to understanding how it feeds into T cell metabolism and differentially influences it under differing pH and oxygenation states. A more extensive explanation of this is being explored intensively by our laboratory at the moment and will certainly be the subject of future work from our lab and others.</p><p>Information about CTLA-4 expression in response to increasing doses of central carbon metabolites is now included in Figure 3—figure supplement 1G.</p><p>The manuscript has been changed accordingly:</p><p>”Furthermore, sodium L-lactate induced a dose-dependent increase in inducible T-cell costimulator (iCOS) and Granzyme B (GzmB) expression at day 3 of culture (Figure 3C-D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-F). We found no significant effect of metabolite exposure on T-cell CTLA-4 expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, the authors show the anti-tumor function of sodium L-lactate in vivo and demonstrate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations are increased after daily sodium L-lactate treatment. The authors may further characterize the functions of sodium L-lactate in vivo. For example, does sodium L-lactate affect the expression of iCOS and Granzyme B in CD8+ T cells in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended the information on the tumor infiltrating CD8+ population by analyzing GzmB expressing cell fractions and MFI of GzmB, PD1 and CTLA4. In these experiments we found no difference in effector molecule expression after daily lactate injections, despite increasing number of CD8+ T-cells. Data is provided below and included in the manuscript as Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-E.</p><p>The text has been changed accordingly:</p><p>“As shown in Figure 6B, there were significant changes in tumor infiltrating immune populations in animals treated with 2 g/kg of lactate, namely, increases in the frequency of total (CD3+) T cells, including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The frequency of tumor-infiltrating NK cells was reduced. Despite finding increased numbers of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C), daily lactate administration did not change the percentage of GzmB+ cells or the GzmB, PD1 or CTLA intensity on CD8+ infiltrating cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E)”.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Schranner, D., Kastenmuller, G., Schonfelder, M., Romisch-Margl, W. and Wackerhage, H.
