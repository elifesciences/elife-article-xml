it is inactive toward κB sites with a central A/T bp. To understand the molecular basis for this unique property of p52, we have determined the crystal structures of recombinant human p52 protein in complex with a P-selectin(PSel)-κB DNA (5′-GGGGT<underline>G</underline>ACCCC-3′) (central bp is underlined) and variants changing the central bp to A/T or swapping the flanking bp. The structures reveal a nearly two-fold widened minor groove in the central region of the DNA as compared to all other currently available NF-κB-DNA complex structures, which have a central A/T bp. Microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of free DNAs and p52 bound complexes reveal that free DNAs exhibit distinct preferred conformations, and p52:p52 homodimer induces the least amount of DNA conformational changes when bound to the more transcriptionally active natural G/C-centric PSel-κB, but adopts closed conformation when bound to the mutant A/T and swap DNAs due to their narrowed minor grooves. Our binding assays further demonstrate that the fast kinetics favored by entropy is correlated with higher transcriptional activity. Overall, our studies have revealed a novel conformation for κB DNA in complex with NF-κB and pinpoint the importance of binding kinetics, dictated by DNA conformational and dynamic states, in controlling transcriptional activation for NF-κB.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA conformation</kwd><kwd>NF-κB</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>MD

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their specific DNA response elements in the promoters/enhancers of target genes is the key event regulating gene transcription and consequent cellular processes. For proper gene expression, TFs must interact selectively at the correct place and time and assemble into high-order complexes with specific DNA sequences and cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Natoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulero et al., 2019</xref>). In eukaryotic genomes, the ability of TFs to select a small subset of relevant binding sites out of the large excess of potential binding sites within the genomes is the foundation upon which transcriptional regulation is built. Structural studies have provided valuable information on how various DNA binding domains recognize their cognate DNA binding sites at atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garvie and Wolberger, 2001</xref>). However, how TFs discriminate between closely related, but biologically distinct, DNA sequences are not well understood.</p><p>The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family of TFs regulates diverse biological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Mammalian NF-κB is assembled combinatorially from five subunits, p50/NF-κB1, p52/NF-κB2, RelA/p65, c-Rel, and RelB, into homo- and heterodimers which bind to specific DNA sequences, known as κB site or κB DNA. All five subunits share a highly conserved region at their N-termini, referred to as the Rel homology region (RHR), and the three-dimensional structures of the RHR are also highly conserved among these proteins. The RHR is roughly 300 residues in length and contains the N-terminal domain (NTD), dimerization domain (DD), and nuclear localization signal (NLS). The DD alone mediates protein homo- and heterodimerization; the NTD and DD together are responsible for DNA binding; and the NLS region is flexible in solution and together with the DD forms the binding sites for the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) proteins.</p><p>The NF-κB proteins can be further divided into two subclasses: the p50 and p52 subunits belong to class I by virtue of their lack of a transcriptional activation domain (TAD). The other three subunits, RelA, c-Rel, and RelB, constitute class II with every member containing a TAD at its C-terminus. Mature p50 and p52 subunits are generated via incomplete proteolysis of their precursor proteins p105 and p100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), respectively. Therefore, p50 and p52 possess a short glycine-rich region (GRR) at their C-termini.</p><p>The initial discovery and characterization of several physiological κB DNAs established the pseudo-symmetric consensus sequence as 5′-G<sub>−5</sub>G<sub>−4</sub>G<sub>−3</sub>R<sub>−2</sub>N<sub>−1</sub>W<sub>0</sub>Y<sub>+1</sub>Y<sub>+2</sub>C<sub>+3</sub>C<sub>+4</sub>-3′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenardo and Baltimore, 1989</xref>), where R=purines, N=any nucleotides, W=either A or T, and Y=pyrimidines. The subsequent identification of new NF-κB-DNA binding sites broadened the consensus to 5′-G<sub>−5</sub>G<sub>−4</sub>G<sub>−3</sub>N<sub>−2</sub>N<sub>−1</sub>N<sub>0</sub>N<sub>+1</sub>N<sub>+2</sub>C<sub>+3</sub>C<sub>+4</sub>-3′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Ghosh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulero et al., 2019</xref>). The critical features of the consensus κB DNA sequence are the presence of a series of G and C bases at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, while the bases at the central region can vary. X-ray structures of various NF-κB dimers in complex with different κB DNAs revealed conserved protein-DNA recognition modes for κB DNA that follows the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moorthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fusco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Escalante et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen-Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panne et al., 2007</xref>). The RHR of each monomer binds to half of a κB DNA, called half-site. A set of conserved amino acid (aa) residues mediate base-specific contacts to the 5′ and 3′ flanking G and C bases; the inner, more variable bases participate in important, but less base-specific interactions. The length of κB DNAs varies from 9 to 11 base pairs (bps). The p50 and p52 subunits bind to a 5 bp half-site (5′-GGGNN-3′), while the RelA and c-Rel subunits prefer a 4 bp half-site (5′-NNCC-3′). Following this binding pattern, both the p50:p50 and p52:p52 homodimers prefer an 11 bp κB site comprising of two 5 bp half-sites separated by a central bp (5+1+5 bps), such as the IL-6-κB site (5′-GGGAT<underline>T</underline>TTCCC-3′). On the other hand, RelA:RelA and c-Rel:c-Rel homodimers bind 9 bp κB sites containing two 4 bp half-sites (4+1+4 bps), such as the IL-8-κB site (5′-GGAA<underline>T</underline>TTCC-3′). Heterodimers containing one p50 or p52 subunit, such as p50:RelA and p52:RelB, recognize a 10 bp κB site (5+1+4 bps), that is, the HIV-κB site (5′-GGGAC<underline>T</underline>TTCC-3′) and IFN-β-κB site (5′-GGGAA<underline>A</underline>TTCC-3′), in which the central bp lies at the pseudo-dyad axis of the dimer and is not directly contacted by the protein.</p><p>Genome-wide NF-κB-DNA motif identification studies revealed that NF-κB associates not only with consensus κB DNAs, but also with sequences containing only one half-site consensus, and even some sequences with no consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In vitro binding experiments have been carried out to classify κB DNAs according to their binding specificity for different NF-κB dimers. The binding affinity displayed by various NF-κB dimers for distinct κB DNAs does not necessarily correlate with what occurs during regulation of gene expression in vivo. For example, the p50:RelA heterodimer binds tightly to most κB DNAs, whereas RelA:RelA and c-Rel:c-Rel homodimers bind many of the same sequences with relatively low affinity. However, detailed genetic experiments have shown that some genes are activated only in the presence of one or a subset of NF-κB subunits, such as mice lacking c-Rel exhibit defects in IL-2 and IL-12 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Köntgen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoffmann et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to specific gene activation, NF-κB dimers are also known to repress transcription. The RelA and p50 dimers have been shown to repress the expressions of <italic>nrp1</italic> gene, which is essential for osteoclast differentiation, and the interferon-stimulated response element, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>). Both of these sites also display only half-site similarity to the κB DNA consensus. Structural and biochemical analyses of NF-κB-DNA binding have also revealed the existence of a large number of κB DNAs that display relatively similar affinities compared with κB consensus even though they lack one consensus half-site entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siggers et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, in vitro data do not fully capture the complexity of DNA recognition and gene regulation by NF-κB in cells.</p><p>NF-κB p52 is generated from the precursor protein p100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a tightly regulated process that requires specific stimuli. Unregulated p100 processing into p52 results in multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies, which is detrimental to normal cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courtois and Gilmore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annunziata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keats et al., 2007</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the p52:p52 homodimer could sense a single bp change from G/C to A/T at the central position of a κB DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The p52:p52 homodimer binds both κB DNAs; but only in the case of the G/C-centric DNA, p52:p52 homodimer can associate with its specific cofactor Bcl3 (p52:p52:Bcl3 complex) and activate transcription by recruiting histone acetyltransferases. When bound to the A/T-centric DNA, the same p52:p52:Bcl3 complex represses gene transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylases. It is intriguing that the identity of a non-contacted nucleotide should have such a drastic effect on transcriptional selectivity. Leung et al. reported that the transcriptional activity of the RelA:RelA homodimer upon binding to the IP-10-κB DNA (5′-GGGAA<underline>A</underline>TTCC-3′) and the MCP-1-κB DNA (5′-GGGAA<underline>T</underline>TTCC-3′) are different; a single bp difference between the A-centric IP-10-κB and T-centric MCP-1-κB DNAs alters the genes’ responsiveness to RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, these reports strongly suggest that NF-κB transcriptional outcomes are coded within specific κB DNA sequences. Even small changes in the promoter-specific κB DNAs, which do not alter the overall NF-κB binding affinity, might alter the gene expression profiles. Although structural studies have revealed a stereochemical mechanism of how NF-κB dimers bind κB DNAs, the effect of DNA conformation on complex formation remains underappreciated and it requires solid understanding of both structure and dynamics of κB DNAs to elucidate such a mechanism.</p><p>In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of the p52:p52 homodimer in complex with the natural G/C-centric PSel-κB DNA (5′-GGGGT<underline>G</underline>ACCCC-3′) and two related DNAs where the central three positions were varied, named as PSel (mutant A/T-centric) (5′-GGGGT<underline>A</underline>ACCCC-3′) and PSel (−1/+1 swap) (5′-GGGGA<underline>G</underline>TCCCC-3′). PSel is a known target gene regulated by the p52:p52:Bcl3 complex in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan and McEver, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>); however, the PSel (mutant A/T-centric) and (−1/+1 swap) κB DNAs reduced the transcriptional activity significantly. All three structures revealed a widening of the DNA minor groove in the central region compared to all previously known structures of NF-κB-(A/T-centric)-DNA complexes. MD simulations showed free DNAs exist in distinct preferred conformations, and the p52:p52 homodimer induces the least amount of conformational changes on the more transcriptionally active Psel (natural G/C-centric) κB DNA which has an intrinsically widened minor groove. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that the binding kinetics, rather than the binding affinity, is correlated with their transcriptional activities. The combination of structural, MD simulations, and biochemical studies presented here provides new insights into allosteric control by closely related κB DNAs on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The central base pairs in PSel-κB DNA regulate p52:p52:Bcl3 transcriptional activity</title><p>Structures of several NF-κB dimers in complex with various κB DNAs have been reported over the past 25 years. In all these structures, the DNA sequences contain A/T-centric κB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moorthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fusco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1998b</xref>). The PSel-κB DNA (5′-GGGG<underline>TGA</underline>CCCC-3′) (the central bp is in red color, bps at ±1 positions are underlined), a natural binding site known to be specifically regulated by the p52:p52:Bcl3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan and McEver, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), is distinctive from the canonical κB sites not only at the central position but also the two flanking positions. Whereas p50 and other subunits prefer an A:T at −1 and T:A at +1 positions, such as the MHC-κB site (5′-GGGG<underline>ATT</underline>CCCC-3′), PSel-κB contains T:A and A:T at the equivalent positions, respectively. We mutated the central and flanking bps to generate PSel (mutant A/T-centric) (5′-GGGG<underline>TAA</underline>CCCC-3′) and (−1/+1 swap) (5′-GGGG<underline>AGT</underline>CCCC-3′) DNAs. Transcriptional activity of the p52:p52:Bcl3 complex was measured for these three and MHC-κB sites using a luciferase reporter-based assay. The natural PSel luciferase reporter could be activated by endogenous NF-κB with co-expression of Bcl3 followed by lipopolysaccharide stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the effects of PSel (mutant A/T-centric) and (−1/+1 swap) on transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter constructs with the variants or MHC-κB site were co-transfected with p52 and Bcl3 expression plasmids. PSel (mutant A/T-centric) showed twofold reduced reporter activity, while both PSel (−1/+1 swap) and MHC-κB showed drastically reduced transcriptional activity as compared to the natural PSel-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that the bp identity at all three positions in the central region is critical in determining transcriptional activity of the p52:p52:Bcl3 complex, which is in line with our previous study that the central bp of κB DNAs plays critical roles in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of p52:p52 homodimer in complex with PSel-κB DNA variants reveal distinct signatures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The natural G/C-centric PSel luciferase reporter was activated by endogenous NF-κB with LPS stimulation and Bcl3 co-expression.

It should be noted that all the complex structures are at ~3.0 Å resolution which places limits on the identification of some detailed interactions, including hydrogen bonds. However, compared to previously known structures of NF-κB-DNA complexes, two striking differences are observed. One is that all three PSel-κB DNAs exhibited a distinct widening of the minor groove at the two base-steps around the central position 0 (−1 to 0 and 0 to +1), with width of ~7.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G1</xref>). In comparison, the A/T-centric κB DNAs studied earlier, κB-33 (5′-GGAA<underline>ATT</underline>TCC-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) and another one that we now name κB-55 (5′-GGG<underline>AAT</underline>TCCC-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moorthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fusco et al., 2009</xref>), have significantly compressed minor groove in both their bound and free states as compared to an ideal B-form DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Compressed minor groove width is a common feature of all A/T-centric κB DNAs bound to NF-κB dimers which is remarkably different from the minor groove width of the PSel-κB DNAs seen in the present structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The widened minor groove is observed with long p52 proteins</title><p>The other difference observed for the three p52:p52 structures reported here concerns the organization of the dimer and the complex with DNA.

Superposition of the p52:p52 homodimer in the MHC-κB and natural PSel-κB complexes aligned by the DDs reveals large rigid body movement of NTDs with rotation of ~20° and translation along rotation axis of ~1.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This results in shifting of the NTD along PSel DNA toward its flanks by ~13 Å for both sides. In addition, the minor groove of the MHC-κB DNA at the central segment is compressed like all other NF-κB-DNA complexes indicated above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>p52:p52 dimer conformations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Overlay of p52:p52 (aa 1–398) in complex with the 18 bp natural G/C-centric PSel-κB DNA (PDB 7CLI, this study) (in orange and green for monomers I and II, respectively) and p52:p52 (aa 35–329) in complex with the MHC-κB DNA (PDB 1A3Q) (in gray).

In fact, all currently available structures of NF-κB-κB DNA complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain short NF-κB proteins (only NTD and DD) and A/T-centric κB DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moorthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fusco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1998b</xref>).

This short p52 protein only co-crystallized with a 13 bp PSel (mutant A/T-centric) DNA but not the (natural G/C-centric) or (−1/+1 swap) DNAs in any lengths. The conformation of this complex is nearly identical to p52-MHC-κB complex with minor groove width less than 4 Å at the central position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This crystal with short p52 is in a different crystal form compared to the three structures with the long p52, and it is also in a different crystal form compared to the MHC-κB DNA complex, suggesting that crystal packing is unlikely to be the main cause of the structural differences, and that both the DNA and protein lengths play significant roles.</p><p>Therefore, we observed an influence of the length of the p52 protein on the conformation of the κB DNA and the organization of the p52:p52 dimer in the complex. The length and sequence of DNA also influence the structures, and we believe they are correlated with the length of p52 protein. As discussed above, the short p52 protein (aa 1–327) failed to interact with Bcl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>), partly due to the lack of the GRR.

Although asymmetric DNA binding by the symmetric homodimer is a common feature in all NF-κB-DNA complexes, it is significantly more pronounced in the present structures. Moreover, the p52:52 homodimer also displays substantial asymmetry. With the DD of the two monomers in superposition, the NTDs rotate from each other by ~6° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The interdomain interaction is extensive in monomer I compared to that in monomer II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>In the PSel-κB complex, the side chains of Lys221, Arg52, Arg54, and His62 in p52 monomer I make direct base-specific contacts to four consecutive G(s) from +2 to +5 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left). In addition, Ser61 also makes direct contact with A at ±6 and ±7 positions; these contacts are not possible for the short p52 (aa 1–327) co-crystallized with 13 bp κB DNAs such as MHC and PSel (mutant A/T-centric)-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). p52 monomer II makes contact with only three G(s) from position −3 to −5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). The conformation of loop L3 in the two p52 monomers is different; consequently, only Lys221 in monomer I makes specific contacts with G at position +2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Glu58 helps to position Arg52, Arg54, and His62, and makes base-specific interaction to the opposite C at ±3 positions.</p><p>In addition to base-specific interactions, there are multiple protein contacts to the DNA phosphate backbone, mostly to the central region of the DNA.

Only in monomer II does the side chains of Lys143 make an additional H-bond to the backbone phosphate group of C at position 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, all other NF-κB-DNA complexes, including the short p52:p52 homodimer bound to both 13 bp MHC-κB and PSel (mutant A/T-centric)-κB DNAs, exhibit more backbone contacts by Gln284 and Gln254 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The presence of an additional positively charged residue in loop L2 in the other NF-κB subunits (p52: T<sup>142</sup>KKN; p50: TKKK; and RelA: KKRD) enhances backbone binding at the minor groove side including cross-strand interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, there is a unique basic segment in p52, a peptide-rich in basic residues (K<sup>179</sup>ELKK), located near the end of helix α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These basic residues possibly mediate long-range electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA backbone which might pull the DNA strands away from each other toward the p52 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In summary, aa composition in loop L2 and helix α2, might play an important role in determining DNA binding by the NF-κB dimers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MD simulations reveal free DNAs exhibit distinct preferred conformations</title><p>In order to investigate whether the minor groove width of the PSel-κB DNA variants observed in the current complexes is induced by the protein or intrinsic to DNA sequences, we first carried out microsecond MD simulations of the four κB DNAs in free form. The simulations were initiated using DNA conformations in the crystal structures of the complexes, where the three PSel-κB DNA variants had a widened minor groove and the MHC-κB DNA a narrow minor groove. Throughout our simulations PSel (natural G/C-centric) largely maintained its widened minor groove at the central 0 position, while the minor groove in PSel (mutant A/T-centric) narrowed slightly; PSel (−1/+1 swap) displayed a significantly narrowed minor groove, which became similar to that of MHC-κB DNA recorded in the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The swap of T and A at ±1 positions reverses the geometric conformation of bps at both positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, these swaps exchange pyrimidines and purines at ±1 positions, forcing the swapped bps to adopt an opposite shear and buckle direction to optimize base stacking with neighboring bps compared to those on the non-swapped DNAs.

The A:T bp at 0 position shows large shear, buckle, and opening, forcing a register toward the minor groove in the curvature of free A/T-centric DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With only two H-bonds, A/T steps can easily unwind to yield low propeller twist. The neighboring A:T at 0 and +1 position in PSel (mutant A/T-centric) (0 and −1 position in MHC) rotate the adenines likewise to optimize base stacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This conformation bends the minor groove and can further deform the local structure of PSel (mutant A/T-centric) through the occasionally formed cross-strand H-bonds between the neighboring steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). It appears that in MHC, the same narrowing effect introduced by ±1 swap fixed the twisted conformation at 0 position, thereby stabilizing its local structure instead. Collectively, we conclude that having successive A:T is likely to reduce the intrinsic minor groove width. Our finding is in line with the observations of a compressed minor groove of free κB-33 DNA or the bending into the minor groove from continuous A:T in A-tract DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of MD simulations and crystal structures suggests that upon binding to p52, the −1/+1 swap DNA experiences more disruptive conformational change than the natural G/C-centric PSel-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The binding at the central part of both DNAs is symmetrically facilitated through the H-bonds between two residues (Lys143 and Tyr55) from each monomer of p52 and the phosphate of nucleotides at −1 and +1 positions as well as the T-shaped π-stacking interactions between DNA bases and Tyr55. The aforementioned two residues in the two p52 monomers are positioned further apart in the PSel-κB DNA complex compared to the MHC-κB DNA complex. Unlike the natural G/C-centric DNA, the binding on both strands of −1/+1 swap DNA draws the bound thymine in the opposite directions of the minor groove, breaking the intra-bp H-bonds and severely distorting the central bps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It appears that p52:p52 homodimer adopts a specific conformation with a nearly fixed inter-monomer distance upon the binding to κB DNAs, such that it tears the central part of −1/+1 swap DNA into a favored binding conformation. Overall, the comparative analysis of MD simulations and crystal structures suggests that the p52:p52 homodimer induces the least amount of conformational changes on κB DNA with an intrinsically widened minor groove.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The p52 homodimer recognizes κB DNAs with different thermodynamic features</title><p>Structural analysis described above did not provide a strong correlation between the conformational states of (p52:p52)-DNA complexes and the transcriptional output.

In all cases, long p52 protein (aa 1–398) as well as long DNA were used. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) reveals that p52:p52 binds all three PSel-κB DNA variants with similar binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub>) in the range of approximately 40–90 nM whereas it binds MHC-κB DNA much tighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, transcriptional activity may have a closer link to the binding kinetics rather than the thermodynamic stability of the complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Differential minor groove geometries correlate with differential DNA binding kinetics</title><p>To better understand how binding kinetics correlates with DNA sequences, we carried out four 3-µs MD simulations for each of the three (p52:p52)-PSel-κB DNA complexes, including the natural G/C-centric, mutant A/T-centric, and −1/+1 swap DNAs. The overall conformations of p52:p52 dimers and DNAs are similar during the MD simulations, both of which are slightly more stable in the p52-natural G/C-centric DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Upon p52:p52 homodimer binding, the central minor grooves of all three DNAs narrowed, resulting in a consistent trend as seen in the free form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Adapting to the width of the DNA central minor groove, the p52:p52 subunits bound to −1/+1 swap DNA adopt a closed conformation where the two segments bound to the central minor groove appear to clamp the DNA, in contrast to their more open conformation when bound to the natural G/C-centric DNA; the p52 subunits bound to the mutant A/T-centric DNA fall in between the aforementioned two types of conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, we found that the NTD of p52:p52 subunits could make contacts across the central minor grooves when bound to mutant A/T-centric and −1/+1 swap DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Specifically, the clamping conformation enables Lys144 to form cross-strand binding that engages the phosphates at −3/+3 positions in the opposite DNA strands in the mutant A/T and −1/+1 swap DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the case of the −1/+1 swap DNA, the main chain amines of Lys144 in both monomers also retain contacts to the phosphates at −1/+1 positions in the nearby strand, likely due to the matching lysine side chain length and the narrowed minor groove width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). These cross-strand contacts, while recorded in all three protein-DNA complexes, were most frequently observed in the −1/+1 swap and mutant A/T-centric DNAs. Specifically, they were approximately five and three times more frequent than in the natural G/C-centric DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This difference suggests that the dynamism of the p52:p52 homodimer varies as it recognizes specific minor groove geometries of the three PSel-κB DNAs. The DNA binding domains remain open preventing Lys144 from reaching out to the other DNA strand in the natural G/C-centric DNA. In the case of the −1/+1 swap DNA, the two p52 NTDs adopt a closed conformation allowing Lys144 to make cross-strand contacts which are further assisted by the DNA conformational change. On the one hand, such cross-strand binding provides extra contacts between the p52:p52 homodimer and the DNA, which may hinder their dissociation. On the other hand, the induced closing of NTDs may be unfavored by the p52:p52 homodimer and slow down the protein-DNA association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>MD simulations for (p52:p52)-DNA complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Isosurface of (p52:p52)-DNA complexes (20% occupancy).

The DNA duplex is intrinsically dynamic on many levels and time scales in cells. The movement of DNA through its different conformational states is continuous and is influenced by, but not completely dependent upon, its nucleotide sequence. Structures presented in this study show that the conformations of all three PSel-κB DNA variants bound to the long p52:p52 homodimer are similar but are distinct from all previously known complexes between κB DNAs and six other NF-κB dimers (p50:p50, p50:RelA, p50:RelB, RelA:RelA, c-Rel:c-Rel, and p52:RelB). It was noted earlier a compressed minor groove in the central region of the DNA is a key feature of NF-κB-DNA complexes. The minor groove at the central three positions is significantly widened in all three complexes presented here. However, MD simulations show free DNAs exist in distinct preferred conformations, which appear to be adjusted by p52 into a unique shape for recognition. And notably, the more transcriptionally active natural PSel-κB DNA appears to maintain similar conformational and dynamic states in free and bound forms.</p><p>The current structures also demonstrate a correlation between the p52 protein length and the conformation of the κB DNA. The GRR region of the p52 protein, which was not included in any previous NF-κB structural studies, seems to play an important role. However, no electron density was observed for the GRR region in the current structures. Future studies are needed to fully understand the role of the GRR region in (p52:p52)-DNA complex conformation and the interaction with cofactor Bcl3.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Binding affinity does not fully capture the transcriptional activity</title><p>To determine if binding affinity is related to transcriptional activity, we measured the affinity of all complexes under equilibrium condition. Surprisingly, but consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mulero et al., 2018</xref>), we found no correlation between affinity and transcriptional activity. The p52:p52 homodimer binds to MHC-κB with the highest affinity but it is not a transcriptional activation competent complex. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that p52:p52 homodimer uses different paths to bind κB DNAs ranging from a more entropic favored for the natural PSel, to exclusively enthalpic for MHC, and to mixed entropic-enthalpic for mutant A/T-centric and −1/+1 swap PSel DNAs. The entropy-favored processes are linked to faster binding kinetics: p52:p52 homodimer binds to natural G/C-centric PSel DNA with both faster association and dissociation rates. The most populated conformation of the free G/C-centric PSel DNA as revealed by MD simulation is similar to the one observed in the crystal structure of the complex suggesting this DNA’s conformation does not undergo significant changes upon protein binding. Thus, in the complex between p52:p52 and natural G/C-centric DNA, both the DNA and protein most likely preserve their native states. This could account for the positive entropy and faster k<sub>on</sub>. However, possibly the protein-DNA contacts in such a complex are suboptimal resulting in their faster dissociation. In contrast, p52:p52 complexes with the mutant A/T-centric or−1/+1 swap DNAs likely involve rigidification of protein-DNA contacts, requiring some structural reorganizations in both molecules, resulting in more enthalpically stable complexes and slower association and dissociation rates. Indeed, MD simulations of the (p52:p52)-DNA complexes are consistent with this notion. The complex of p52:p52 homodimer with the natural G/C-centric PSel-κB DNA maintains very similar conformations under simulations as seen in the crystal structure. In contrast, induced by their narrowed minor groove geometries, the p52 protein closes on the DNAs in the PSel (−1/+1 swap) complex and to a lesser extent in the (mutant-A/T-centric) complex, which is likely unfavored by the p52:p52 homodimer conformation. These structural changes led to the cross-strand contacts by Lys144 in the −1/+1 swap and mutant A/T-centric DNAs but not in the natural G/C-centric PSel DNA. Combination of MD simulations and structural studies supports the model as PSel (mutant A/T-centric) and (−1/+1 swap) DNAs undergo conformational changes from free to bound states. Our observations are consistent with other studies which have shown that rapid association and dissociation are favored by entropy, whereas slow association and dissociation are guided by enthalpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baerga-Ortiz et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ideas and speculation: transcriptional regulation via kinetic discrimination</title><p>Understanding transcriptional regulation has attracted many researchers since the discovery of the <italic>lac</italic> operon. One of the most intriguing questions scientists are working to resolve is the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the specific DNA response elements. Affinity regulation by different target DNA sequences for a TF has long been thought to be the dominant mode of regulation imposed by such DNA sequences. Indeed, in many cases of eukaryotic transcription differential affinity has been shown to be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sekiya et al., 2009</xref>).

But none of these studies has established a direct correlation between binding kinetics and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Many biological systems have been studied in detail with the roles of binding kinetics in regulation evaluated. For instance, receptor-ligand interactions, T cell activation, and potency of bacterial toxins are guided by the half-life of key complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corzo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">González et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross and Lodish, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakajima et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Of all six κB DNAs tested, the natural G/C-centric PSel and Skp2 DNAs showed greater transcriptional activation. We found that a slower dissociation rate or longer residence time is linked to reduced transcriptional activation. Although the relationship between the dissociation rates and transcription activities is shown for only six tested binding sites, this relationship is preserved for (p52:p52)-DNA complexes and to a lesser extent for (p52:p52:Bcl3)-DNA complexes. The relationship between binding kinetics and conformations of the complexes is further supported by the study of a mutant. This mutant, p52<sub>K144A</sub>, binds all DNAs with a slower kinetics but the kinetics is the most prominently slowed down for the PSel (−1/+1 swap) DNA.</p><p>The rate constants obtained in our in vitro assays probably are not the same in vivo, where many other factors will have an impact on binding kinetics. However, the relative rates clearly suggest that the persistent presence of p52 on DNA gives rise to less transcription. Work presented here hints at a link between the DNA binding kinetics of a TF and its interaction with coactivators and corepressors. We previously showed that the p52:p52:Bcl3 complex preferentially recruits HDAC3 when it remains bound to an A/T-centric κB site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that the slower dissociation rate or longer residence time of p52:p52:Bcl3 on the A/T-centric κB site described in this study matches the slower on rate of the corepressor to p52:p52:Bcl3 bound to A/T DNA. That is, the A/T-centric κB DNA:p52:p52:Bcl3 complex remains stable for long enough to give the HDAC3 corepressor complex enough time to stably interact with it. In addition, the binding of other TFs to the promoters/enhancers of target genes inevitably impacts on the coactivator/corepressor regulation by the (p52:p52)-DNA complexes. Future experiments aimed at coactivator and corepressor interaction rates within the context of chromatinized DNA are needed to verify the validity of the kinetic model for DNA element sequence-specific gene regulation.</p><p>In summary, our studies have revealed a novel conformation for κB DNA in complex with NF-κB and a new organization of an NF-κB dimer. More importantly, our work provides a new insight into the mechanism of differential thermodynamics and kinetics of NF-κB-DNA binding. DNA response elements with only 1 or 2 bp variations could provoke drastically different kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Future experiments will help us fully understand how such binding processes result in transcription activation or repression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Recombinant non-tagged human p52 (aa 1–398), (aa 1–398) K144A mutant, and (aa 1–327) was expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta (DE3) cells.

The main topic is the investigation of why the central base pair(s) have a strong influence on the transcriptional activity of the homodimer. The authors correlate structural changes with measurements of kinetic on and off rates to develop a model that explains the differences in activity and supports their interpretation with MD simulations, however, some technical issues regarding differences in the ITC and BLI measurements remain unresolved.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structures of NF-κB p52 homodimer-DNA complexes rationalize binding mechanisms and transcription activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The resolution obtained for the crystal structures does not allow the identification of individual hydrogen bonds and other details. These limitations should be discussed since these details are important for the structural interpretation.</p><p>2) The data shown in Figure 1 indicate a wider minor groove for p52 homodimers with C-terminal extensions bound to long (18bp) kB sites (PSel, PSelG-&gt;A, pSelAT) and a narrower minor groove for minimal p52 homodimers bound to 13 bp kB sites (pSelAT, MHC). The authors suggest that the protein length may be important, but they do not discuss that the DNA length may also influence the structures. The same kB sequence (PSelAT) appears in both compressed and expanded minor groove forms. Analysis of the structures indicates that contacts (Ser61-A6,A7) are made outside of the 11-bp kB site in the 18-bp structures and would not be present in the 13-bp structures. So, the conclusion that p52 bound to PSel kB has a widened minor groove relative to other complexes may be correct, but it is far from solid given the data that is presented.</p><p>3) The main question of the manuscript is what is different about p52-PSel kB contacts compared to kB sites with a central A/T (like MHC)? The overall goal is to understand how a single bp can make such a large difference in the transcriptional outcome, but the answer is not clear. Loss of a cross-strand interaction is discussed, but a new Arg-Gua interaction is gained and that is not discussed. There is a lot of detail about the asymmetric nature of the complex, but most of that appears to be common to all kB sites. A better definition and discussion of the structural source of the observed selectivity is necessary.</p><p>4) It is not obvious how the raw ITC data are converted into the integrated data shown below the raw data. In principle, the dilution heat has to be subtracted followed by the integration of the peak. In the graph with the integrated data, the first 7 points in A have the same value (as is expected for such a strong binding). But the peaks in the raw data diagram vary substantially. That could be due to differences in the width of the peaks, but that should be explained as why it happens and shown. It would also help to have at least one repetition of the experiments for validation purposes.</p><p>5) Related: How was the DNA prepared for the ITC measurements? In two of the four diagrams showing the raw data substantial dilution heat of the DNA is measured. Since the DNA sequence is very similar in all cases, a similar dilution heat is expected. Is there any impurity in two of the four preparations (that would also influence the overall results)?</p><p>6) Adding an error estimate for ΔS would allow readers to evaluate whether the differences are significant. There is an amazing 3-fold variation in ΔH, from -5 kcal/mol to -15 kcal/mol. Equally amazing is that the entropic contribution TΔS also varies widely, from +5 kcal/mol to -5 kcal/mol. I found it surprising that there was no attempt to relate these findings to the known structures. Do the number of polar interactions differ? Solvent accessible surface? Amount of ordered solvent?</p><p>7) The Kd values determined from the kinetic measurements differ by &gt; 50-fold from the calorimetry results. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. Can the on and off-rates be trusted in these experiments? Even if they are relative rates, one might think that their ratios (K) would still be relevant.</p><p>8) None of the binding events are 'entropy driven'. The most favorable (PSel kB) is still 50:50 enthalpy:entropy.</p><p>9) Why would binding with native conformations for p52 and PSel kB account for favorable entropy?</p><p>10) The authors include Bcl3 in a set of binding kinetics experiments and get similar relative rates as with p52 alone. However, the idea that Bcl3 could have an influence on site-specific transcriptional activity seems to have been ruled out because Bcl3 doesn't contact the kB site. What about an indirect mechanism? The fact that unmodified Bcl3 prevents p52 from binding DNA, yet phospo-Bcl3 does not is very suggestive of some level of involvement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Meshcheryakov et al. present a compelling story showing that upon binding to DNA, an NF-κB homodimer induces distinct conformations in DNA, regardless of the DNA sequence or their level of transcriptional activity. To understand how the protein achieves transcriptional selectivity for distinct sequences, authors use simulations, binding assays, and kinetic studies. They observe a correlation between kinetics and transcriptional activation, showing that binding to active DNA sequences is driven by entropy and occurs without a large deformation of the DNA. Conversely, binding to DNA sequences with lower transcriptional activity requires more significant alteration of DNA conformation and is largely enthalpic with slower kinetics. These studies uncover an important role of binding kinetics in DNA selectivity by transcription factors that should motivate many future studies to further explore and elucidate these mechanisms.</p><p>I found this study very compelling and believe that this manuscript represents an important contribution to our understanding of DNA selectivity in TFs. To my knowledge, the role of binding kinetics has not been appreciated or investigated thoroughly and needs to be considered more, which will be inspired by this work. While I do not have any concerns that should prevent or even delay publication, I have provided a few suggestions below that I believe may enhance readability and should only improve an already strong piece of work.</p><p>Lines 76-80: authors should consider just writing out the kB consensus sequences (5'-GGGNNNNNCC-3') and explaining the numbering separately, as the current form is hard to read/parse.</p><p>Authors should include the full name of NF-κB, I don't believe I found any mention of it throughout the manuscript.</p><p>I think a few things could help to enhance the introduction section. As written, the final paragraph of this section only vaguely hints at but does not highlight the major results of the paper. Including the full sequence of psel kB, mentioning which promoters are active vs inactive, and how the MD and biochemical data help to distinguish between these where structures do not would help to strengthen this section. Basically, more specific details of the results in this section could be very nice!</p><p>Related, it could be helpful for the authors to write out the full sequences of the mutant A/T and -1/+1 swap in both introduction and again in results. Yes, readers can infer what each permutation means, but it would be nice to have it explicitly written out to avoid this step.</p><p>Line 169 is the first mention of LPS. Please define this.</p><p>This is a minor point, but could authors color figure 2D by domain? Even a lighter/darker version of the selected colors would help readers to more easily decipher the interdomain interface and make the figure clearer.</p><p>A set of interactions is described in lines 262-266 which are not shown in any figure. It would be nice to either include the figure reference (if there is one) or create a figure. E.g. I could not find Cys57 on any of the figures.</p><p>Please clarify lines 289-294. When you say swapped, which DNAs are you referring to explicitly? This part is tricky from the reader's perspective because technically, the A-T swap and control are swapped relative to the others.</p><p>Lines 128-130: referring to work by Leung et al. It is not clear what this reference means when it says 'binding of RelA homodimer to A- and T- centric DNAs are different'. Different from what? From binding to GC-centric DNA, or different from what p52 homodimer does?</p><p>Can authors specify what atoms are used in the measurement of minor groove width? This is not clear since they show ~ 2 widths per basepair in the Figure 1 table.</p><p>lines 245-251: this part got tricky to read because of the back and forth between figures 2 and 3. If there is any way the authors can move Figure 2D to be part of Figure 3, it would help to streamline the reading of this section.</p><p>The only part of this study (for me) that seems slightly disconnected from the rest is the crystallographic data from the longer protein and DNA constructs which showed a different organization of the complex. In particular, I am skeptical of the use of the phrase 'correlation between p52 protein length and conformation of kB DNA'. Correlation is a less than ideal word choice because it implies a quantifiable relationship. It is not clear how a crystal structure conformation could be correlated with anything else unless the authors were highlighting a very specific structural feature within either the protein or DNA that changes proportionally with the length. Could authors rephrase all mentions of correlation here to say something like 'observed influence of p52 length on the conformation of kB'?</p><p>Lines 418-419: authors make mention of the most populated conformation of the free DNA, but other than examining minor groove widths, the authors have not performed an actual conformational analysis. Authors could perhaps consider performing an RMSD or RMSF analysis, something that lets us see how the structure changes over the simulation or even the bases of DNA that are most flexible or stable over time. Such an analysis would lend support to even the broader claims throughout this paper that the DNA conformation is differentially influenced by protein binding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The overall conclusions of this work are: (i) p52 homodimers are able to recognize kB sites with a G at the central position by naturally fitting the wider minor groove found in those sites, (ii) binding affinity of p52 to kB sites is poorly correlated with transcriptional activity but the entropic contribution to binding is correlated, (iii) higher on and off rates for p52/kB binding are associated with more transcriptionally active kB sites. The results are very interesting and address important questions that underlie mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The authors provide data to support their conclusions, but in some cases, the data and interpretations are not entirely convincing. The structural data support a wider minor groove for the PSel kB site, but it is not clear how p52 recognizes this difference. The loss of cross-strand hydrogen bonds near the center of the site is noted, but the addition of a canonical Arg-Gua interaction is shown but not discussed. A higher level of asymmetry in the dimer-DNA interface is described, but it is not clear how this relates to the central 3 bp in question.</p><p>The colorimetric studies are fascinating. A range of binding enthalpies from -5 to -15 kcal/mol are reported for the four kB sites studied and a range of -5 to +5 kcal/mol for the enthalpic contribution to binding (TΔS). The more favorable entropic free energy of binding is associated with kB sites that are more transcriptionally active. It is unclear what the source of these wide variations might be; the authors do not attempt to explain the results in light of the structural models.</p><p>Binding kinetic studies are also revealing and interesting. The more transcriptionally active kB sites (e.g., PSel kB) have faster on-rates and faster off-rates. The least active kB sites (e.g., MHC) have lower on-rates and lower off-rates. The authors suggest that increased resident time of p52/Bcl3 on the promoter is associated with lower transcriptional activity; a possible reason is that longer times allow the recruitment of co-repressors. The binding affinities derived from BLI experiments are more than 50-fold lower than those measured by ITC. Assuming that the ITC values are correct, this raises questions about what aspects of the kinetic measurements are valid and which might not be.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an interesting and important study, but the connections between the structural studies and the binding experiments need to be strengthened and there are several questions/issues about the individual experiments and interpretations that need to be resolved.</p><p>I found the paper a little hard to read, partly due to writing errors and the omission of critical data. Below is a list of specific concerns, major things first, then small things.</p><p>Table 1. I cannot find this table in the composite pdf (text + Figures+ supplemental). I assume this table contains crystallographic data/results, making it impossible to evaluate the quality of the structures. I have no idea what the resolution even is for any of the structures.</p><p>Structural data. The data shown in Figure 1 indicate a wider minor groove for p52 homodimers with C-terminal extensions bound to long (18bp) kB sites (PSel, PSelG-&gt;A, pSelAT) and a narrower minor groove for minimal p52 homodimers bound to 13 bp kB sites (pSelAT, MHC).

The authors provide a detailed structural and biophysical characterization of several complexes of the p52 homodimer of NF kB and different DNA binding sites. The focus is on the central base pair as well as the flanking base pairs on both sides. By x-ray crystallography the authors show that the minor grove of the central base pairs is widened with the G:C base pairs compared to the A:T base pairs. Using MD simulations of the DNA the authors show that DNA molecules can adopt different conformations and the binding of the p52 homodimer induces the least conformational changes in the naturally occurring sequence. The authors go further and correlate these conformational changes with binding affinity and with kinetic k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> measurements. Overall, there is little correlation between affinity and transcriptional activity. The only correlation they observe is between fast on and off kinetics and higher transcriptional activity. This result is surprising and does not immediately provide a mechanistic interpretation of how high transcriptional activity is achieved. The authors try to provide an explanation via binding of co-repressors but the fundamental biophysical investigations for such a model are missing at the moment.</p><p>1) I have a hard time understanding how the raw ITC data are converted into the integrated data shown below the raw data. In principle, the dilution heat has to be subtracted followed by the integration of the peak. In the graph with the integrated data, the first 7 points in A have the same value (as is expected for such a strong binding).

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The resolution obtained for the crystal structures does not allow the identification of individual hydrogen bonds and other details. These limitations should be discussed since these details are important for the structural interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>The resolution issue has been clarified in lines 220-222: It should be noted that all the complex structures are at ~3.0 Å resolution, which places limits on the identification of some detailed interactions, including hydrogen bonds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data shown in Figure 1 indicate a wider minor groove for p52 homodimers with C-terminal extensions bound to long (18bp) kB sites (PSel, PSelG-&gt;A, pSelAT) and a narrower minor groove for minimal p52 homodimers bound to 13 bp kB sites (pSelAT, MHC). The authors suggest that the protein length may be important, but they do not discuss that the DNA length may also influence the structures. The same kB sequence (PSelAT) appears in both compressed and expanded minor groove forms. Analysis of the structures indicates that contacts (Ser61-A6,A7) are made outside of the 11-bp kB site in the 18-bp structures and would not be present in the 13-bp structures. So, the conclusion that p52 bound to PSel kB has a widened minor groove relative to other complexes may be correct, but it is far from solid given the data that is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Various DNA lengths ranging from 12 to 20 bp were used in the co-crystallization, and the details have been added to Supplementary File 1. The long p52 (aa 1-398) protein crystallized with 18 and 20 bp PSel-κB DNAs and diffracted better with the 18 bp DNA. The short p52 (aa 1-327) protein only crystallized with the PSel (mutant A/T-centric) DNA at 13 bp length but not any longer DNAs; it did not crystallize with the PSel (natural G/C-centric) or (-1/+1 swap) DNAs at any length. This has been added in lines 214-217 and lines 254-257. In addition, as mentioned by the reviewer, we also mentioned in the text that “Ser61 also makes direct contact with A at ±6 and ±7 positions; these contacts are not possible for the short p52 (aa 1-327) co-crystallized with 13bp κB DNAs such as MHC and PSel (mutant A/T-centric)-κB (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B)” (lines 296-299).</p><p>The length and sequence of DNA also influence the structures, and we believe they are corelated with the length of p52 protein (lines 267-268). The direct contacts between the protein and A at ±6 and ±7 base pairs are a direct example of this. We did not emphasize the discussion on the ±6 and ±7 contacts because we do not fully understand the connectivity between the protein and DNA sequence and lengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The main question of the manuscript is what is different about p52-PSel kB contacts compared to kB sites with a central A/T (like MHC)? The overall goal is to understand how a single bp can make such a large difference in the transcriptional outcome, but the answer is not clear. Loss of a cross-strand interaction is discussed, but a new Arg-Gua interaction is gained and that is not discussed. There is a lot of detail about the asymmetric nature of the complex, but most of that appears to be common to all kB sites. A better definition and discussion of the structural source of the observed selectivity is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct. We ask the same question and present here our best understanding based on the currently available information. We admit that even with all these structures, we still don’t fully understand how a single bp change makes so much difference. We believe that a fundamental difference is in the alteration of DNA dynamics. However, rather than giving a speculative answer, we would like to wait for the results of more experiments, such as longer timescale MD simulations of these protein-DNA complexes. To connect the difference between binding strategies to transcription is even more challenging. Nonetheless, we think continued careful structural and binding analyses will lead to an answer.</p><p>The p52 (aa 1-398) Arg52 in the complex with long 18 bp DNAs loses the cross-strand interaction; however, the NH1 and NH2 groups of Arg52 form H-bonds with both the O6 and N7 groups of G at ±3. The same Arg52 in the complex with the short 13 bp PSel (mutant A/T-centric) or the MHC-κB DNA only hydrogen bonds with the O6 group, but not the N7, of G at ±3. The homologous Arg54 in p50 also only contacts the O6 group of G at −3 in the p50:RelA-IFNb-κB DNA complex. We do not know if these contacts are of similar or different strengths. However, these variations in contacts suggest alterations in DNA dynamics (as discussed below in point #9) when the length or sequence changes. This has been added in lines 279-284.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not obvious how the raw ITC data are converted into the integrated data shown below the raw data. In principle, the dilution heat has to be subtracted followed by the integration of the peak. In the graph with the integrated data, the first 7 points in A have the same value (as is expected for such a strong binding). But the peaks in the raw data diagram vary substantially. That could be due to differences in the width of the peaks, but that should be explained as why it happens and shown. It would also help to have at least one repetition of the experiments for validation purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer’s suggestion. The ITC experiments in Figure 5 have been repeated using a new batch of oligos and are shown in Supplemental Figure 5—figure supplement 1. In the repeated data, the MHC DNA still shows the highest affinity with p52; and the entropy and enthalpy values follow the same trend as the original data even though the exact values vary.</p><p>For the data integration, the area under the curve (gray shadow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) corresponds with the total heat generated, from which ΔH is determined and integrated to a dot. Both the depth and width of the first 7 peaks in panel A vary in the upper raw data diagram, resulting in similar integrated peak areas for the bottom panel. The same is true for the other panels of the figure. A detailed explanation has been added to the corresponding figure legend.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86258-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related: How was the DNA prepared for the ITC measurements?

Is there any impurity in two of the four preparations (that would also influence the overall results)?</p></disp-quote><p>The DNA oligos were dissolved in freshly made ITC buffer (same as the p52 protein). An equal amount of top and bottom strands of the oligos were mixed, followed by heating at 95°C for 10 minutes and slowly cooling down to room temperature for annealing. This has been added to the Materials and methods section for ITC (lines 626-629). The mass-spec data on DNA purity (submitted separately as Related Manuscript Files) shows that all DNA strands are highly pure, suggesting impurity is possibly not the source of the observed differences in dilution heats. Moreover, in the repeat experiments, the same two DNAs (both G/C centric, panels A and C, while the other two are A/T centric) showed larger dilution heats similar to the original experiments, even though they were from a new batch. Therefore, the different dilution heats might be an inherent property of the DNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Adding an error estimate for ΔS would allow readers to evaluate whether the differences are significant. There is an amazing 3-fold variation in ΔH, from -5 kcal/mol to -15 kcal/mol. Equally amazing is that the entropic contribution TΔS also varies widely, from +5 kcal/mol to -5 kcal/mol. I found it surprising that there was no attempt to relate these findings to the known structures. Do the number of polar interactions differ? Solvent accessible surface? Amount of ordered solvent?</p></disp-quote><p>The error estimates for ΔS are not reported by the software on the ITC instrument. The ITC machine directly generates K (which is 1/Kd) and ΔH with the confidence intervals after each run. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> from the ITC machine directly as an example of the data shown in Figure 5A. From the K value (1.27x10<sup>7</sup> ± 4.75x10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) in the picture, the Kd was calculated by 1/K = [1/(1.27 x10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>)]x10<sup>9</sup> = 78.7 nM.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86258-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have calculated the surface area, the buried area in the p52 dimer and in the DNA interface, and the H-bonds, which are shown in the table below (and added as the new Supplementary File 2). There is no significant difference among the structures, although it is often not easy to relate thermodynamic or kinetic binding parameters to static structures which do not explain the dynamic path to binding. In addition, the solvent structure in the complexes is not clearly defined due to the limited resolution of the structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Kd values determined from the kinetic measurements differ by &gt; 50-fold from the calorimetry results. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. Can the on and off-rates be trusted in these experiments? Even if they are relative rates, one might think that their ratios (K) would still be relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>This is often an issue with the binding affinity of a macromolecular complex measured by different methods. We believe that tethering of the DNA to a solid surface in the BLI assays differentially affects its dynamics, an important component in the binding mechanism. However, the advantage of BLI is that it provides the ability to monitor the rates of association and dissociation in real-time through measuring the increase in the optical thickness at the biosensor tip. ITC, on the other hand, uses very high, non-physiological concentrations of the components. The gel-based EMSA is another common method for measuring protein-DNA/RNA affinity, which also shows different values. In that case, the complexes are running through the gel pores in low salt buffers which is far from the native binding conditions. In the end, we think the relative values are more significant than the absolute numbers. The Kd values from BLI assays follow the same trend as those from ITC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) None of the binding events are 'entropy driven'. The most favorable (PSel kB) is still 50:50 enthalpy:entropy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the writing in the Result section as “binding of p52 to the natural G/C-centric PSel-κB DNA is associated with a large increase in entropy (∆S) and a moderate decrease in enthalpy (∆H). On the other hand, the binding to the MHC and mutant A/T-centric PSel DNAs showed a much larger decrease in enthalpy. These results suggest that the binding of p52:p52 homodimer to the G/C-centric κB DNA is favored more by entropy, whereas the binding to the A/T-centric DNA is driven by enthalpy alone” (lines 391-398). Other places in the discussion have also been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Why would binding with native conformations for p52 and PSel kB account for favorable entropy?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the MD simulations, the most populated conformation of the free G/C-centric PSel DNA is similar to the one observed in the crystal structure of the complex, suggesting this DNA’s conformation does not undergo significant changes upon protein binding. Thus, in the complex between p52:p52 and natural G/C-centric DNA, both the DNA and protein most likely preserve their native states. This could account for the positive entropy and faster <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>. However, possibly the protein-DNA contacts in such a complex are sub-optimal, resulting in their faster dissociation. In contrast, p52:p52 complexes with the mutant A/T-centric or −1/+1 swapped DNAs likely involve rigidification of protein-DNA contacts, requiring some structural reorganizations in both molecules, resulting in more enthalpically stable complexes and slower association and dissociation rates. This is included in the Discussion section, lines 484-494.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors include Bcl3 in a set of binding kinetics experiments and get similar relative rates as with p52 alone. However, the idea that Bcl3 could have an influence on site-specific transcriptional activity seems to have been ruled out because Bcl3 doesn't contact the kB site. What about an indirect mechanism? The fact that unmodified Bcl3 prevents p52 from binding DNA, yet phospo-Bcl3 does not is very suggestive of some level of involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that phosphorylation alters Bcl3’s transcriptional activity. We are currently performing experiments to understand how phospho-Bcl3 becomes a transcriptional cofactor by inducing the formation of the ternary complex. This is counterintuitive since phosphorylation of one of the three residues (S446) in the C-terminus, which possibly lies near the negatively charged DNA, is expected to be repulsive. We believe that there is a unique structural component regulating this event where the C-terminus of phospho-Bcl3 adopts a distinct conformation and moves away from the protein-DNA interface. We hope we will be able to clarify in the future how this phosphorylation-dependent conformational variation dictates Bcl3’s transcriptional activity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We had a long discussion on your paper among the editors and reviewers involved.

Based on reviewers’ suggestions, we have now further revised the manuscript. We have carried out microsecond MD simulations of the three (p52:p52)-DNA complexes, including the natural G/C-centric, mutant A/T-centric and −1/+1 swap PSel-κB DNAs. The complex of p52:p52 homodimer with the more transcriptionally active natural G/C-centric DNA maintains very similar conformations under simulations as seen in the crystal structure. In contrast, induced by their narrowed minor groove geometries, the p52 protein closes on the DNAs in the −1/+1 swap complex and to a lesser extent in the mutant A/T-centric complex, which is likely unfavored by the p52:p52 homodimer conformation. These structural changes led to the cross-strand contacts by Lys144 in the −1/+1 swap and mutant A/T-centric DNAs but not in the natural G/C-centric PSel DNA. Combination of MD simulations and structural studies supports the model as PSel (mutant A/T-centric) and (−1/+1 swap) DNAs undergo conformational changes from free to bound states. The relationship between binding kinetics and conformations of the complexes is further supported by the mutational study of this Lys144 residue. These results have been added to a new section “Differential minor groove geometries correlate with differential DNA binding kinetics” (lines 418-473), with new Figures 7-8, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1-2, Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We believe, with the addition of the new data, our work highlights the importance of DNA sequence-dependent dynamics in protein-DNA recognitions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
