severe <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria involves cytoadhesive microvascular sequestration of infected erythrocytes, mediated by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). PfEMP1 variants are encoded by the highly polymorphic family of <italic>var</italic> genes, the sequences of which are largely unknown in clinical samples. Previously, we published new approaches for <italic>var</italic> gene profiling and classification of predicted binding phenotypes in clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates (Wichers et al., 2021), which represented a major technical advance. Building on this, we report here a novel method for <italic>var</italic> gene assembly and multidimensional quantification from RNA-sequencing that outperforms the earlier approach of Wichers et al., 2021, on both laboratory and clinical isolates across a combination of metrics. Importantly, the tool can interrogate the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome in context with the rest of the transcriptome and can be applied to enhance our understanding of the role of <italic>var</italic> genes in malaria pathogenesis. We applied this new method to investigate changes in <italic>var</italic> gene expression through early transition of parasite isolates to in vitro culture, using paired sets of ex vivo samples from our previous study, cultured for up to three generations. In parallel, changes in non-polymorphic core gene expression were investigated. Modest but unpredictable <italic>var</italic> gene switching and convergence towards <italic>var2csa</italic> were observed in culture, along with differential expression of 19% of the core transcriptome between paired ex vivo and generation 1 samples. Our results cast doubt on the validity of the common practice of using short-term cultured parasites to make inferences about in vivo phenotype and behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>de novo assembly</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Welcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/220123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andradi-Brown</surname><given-names>Clare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>323759012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachmann</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>433302244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachmann</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/104111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otto</surname><given-names>Thomas D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/100993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baum</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000761</institution-id><institution>Imperial College Research Computing Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andradi-Brown</surname><given-names>Clare</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In 2021, there were an estimated 619,000 deaths due to malaria, with children under 5 accounting for 77% of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">WHO, 2022</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> causes the greatest disease burden and most severe outcomes, but our efforts to combat the disease are challenged by its complex life cycle and its sophisticated immune evasion strategies. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has several highly polymorphic variant surface antigens encoded by multi-gene families, with the best studied high molecular weight <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of proteins known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leech et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wahlgren et al., 2017</xref>). About 60 polymorphic <italic>var</italic> genes per parasite genome encode different PfEMP1 variants, which are exported to the surface of parasite-infected erythrocytes, where they mediate cytoadherence to host endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leech et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Su et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baruch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rask et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Var</italic> genes are expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern, resulting in each parasite expressing only one <italic>var</italic> gene, and therefore one PfEMP1 protein, at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scherf et al., 1998</xref>). Due to the exposure of PfEMP1 proteins to the host immune system, switching expression between the approximately 60 <italic>var</italic> genes in the genome is an effective immune evasion strategy, which can result in selection and dominance of parasites expressing particular <italic>var</italic> genes within each host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Despite their sequence polymorphism, <italic>var</italic> genes could be classified into four categories (A, B, C, and E) according to their chromosomal location, transcriptional direction, type of 5'-upstream sequence (UPSA–E), and encoded protein domains with associated binding phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lavstsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraemer and Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rask et al., 2010</xref>). PfEMP1 proteins have up to 10 extracellular domains, with the N-terminal domains forming a semi-conserved head structure complex typically containing the N-terminal segment (NTS), a Duffy binding-like domain of class α (DBLα) coupled to a cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR). C-terminally to this head structure, PfEMP1 proteins exhibit a varying but semi-ordered composition of additional DBL and CIDR domains of different subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The PfEMP1 family divides into three main groups based on the receptor specificity of the N-terminal CIDR domain: (i) PfEMP1 proteins with CIDRα1 domains bind endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), while (ii) PfEMP1 proteins with CIDRα2–6 domains bind CD36 and (iii) the atypical VAR2CSA PfEMP1 proteins bind placental chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to these, a subset of PfEMP1 proteins have N-terminal CIDRβ/γ/δ domains of unknown function. This functional diversification correlates with the genetic organisation of the <italic>var</italic> genes. Thus, UPSA <italic>var</italic> genes encode PfEMP1 proteins with domain sub-variants NTSA-DBLα1-CIDRα1/β/γ/δ, whereas UPSB and UPSC <italic>var</italic> genes encode PfEMP1 proteins with NTSB-DBLα0-CIDRα2–6. One exception to this rule is the B/A chimeric <italic>var</italic> genes, which encode NTSB-DBLα2-CIDRα1 domains. The different receptor binding specificities are associated with different clinical outcomes of infection. Pregnancy-associated malaria is linked to parasites expressing VAR2CSA, whereas parasites expressing EPCR-binding PfEMP1 are linked to severe malaria and parasites expressing CD36-binding PfEMP1 are linked to uncomplicated malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lavstsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avril et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Claessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). The clinical relevance of PfEMP1 proteins with unknown binding phenotypes of the N-terminal head structure and C-terminal PfEMP1 domains is largely unknown, albeit specific interactions with endothelial receptors and plasma proteins have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tuikue Ndam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quintana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stevenson et al., 2015</xref>). Each parasite genome carries a similar repertoire of <italic>var</italic> genes, which in addition to the described variants include a highly conserved <italic>var1</italic> variant of either type 3D7 or IT, which in most genomes occurs with a truncated or absent exon 2. Also, most genomes carry the unusually small and highly conserved <italic>var3</italic> genes, of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of the <italic>var</italic> chromosomal location, <italic>var</italic> gene, PfEMP1 protein structure, and PfEMP1-binding phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chromosomal position and transcriptional direction (indicated by arrows) of the different <italic>var</italic> gene groups, designated by the respective type of upstream sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraemer and Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lavstsen et al., 2003</xref>).

Exon 2 is shorter with about 1.2 kb and encodes a semi-conserved intracellular region (acidic terminal segment [ATS]). The PfEMP1 protein is composed of an N-terminal segment (NTS), followed by a variable number of Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains and cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rask et al., 2010</xref>).

The extreme polymorphism of <italic>var</italic> genes precludes a reference <italic>var</italic> sequence. <italic>Var</italic> genes can be lowly expressed or not expressed at all, contain repetitive domains, and can have large duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>).

However, in vitro conditions are considerably different to those found in vivo, e.g., in terms of different nutrient availability and lack of a host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown and Guler, 2020</xref>). Previous studies found inconsistent results in terms of whether <italic>var</italic> gene expression is impacted by culture and, if so, which <italic>var</italic> groups were the most affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2007</xref>).

Consequently, direct interpretation of a short-term cultured parasite’s transcriptome remains a challenge. It is fundamental to understand <italic>var</italic> genes in context with the parasite’s core transcriptome.

Previous methods for assembling <italic>var</italic> transcripts have focussed on assembling whole transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillochon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>). However, due to the diversity within PfEMP1 domains, their associations with disease severity, and the fact different domain types are not inherited together, a method focussing on domain assembly was first developed. In addition, a novel whole transcript approach, using a different de novo assembler, was developed and their performance compared to the method of Wichers et al. (hereafter termed ‘original approach’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). The new approaches made use of the MalariaGEN <italic>P. falciparum</italic> dataset, which led to the identification of additional multi-mapping non-core reads (a median of 3955 reads per sample) prior to <italic>var</italic> transcript assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahouidi et al., 2021</xref>). We incorporated read error correction and improved large scaffold construction with fewer misassemblies (see Materials and methods). We then applied this pipeline to paired ex vivo and short-term in vitro cultured parasites to enhance our understanding of the impact of short-term culturing on the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The <italic>var</italic> transcriptome was assessed at several complementary levels: first, changes in the dominantly expressed <italic>var</italic> gene and the homogeneity of the <italic>var</italic> expression profile in paired samples were investigated; second, changes in <italic>var</italic> domain expression through culture were assessed; and third, <italic>var</italic> group and global <italic>var</italic> gene expression changes were evaluated. All these analyses on <italic>var</italic> expression were accompanied by analysis of the core transcriptome at the transition to short-term culture.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overview of novel computational pipelines for assembling <italic>var</italic> transcripts.</title><p>The original approach (green) used SoapDeNovo-Trans (k=71) to perform whole <italic>var</italic> transcript assembly.

Domains were assembled separately using three different de novo assemblers (SoapDeNovo2, Oases, and rnaSPAdes). Next, a reference of assembled domains was composed and cd-hit (at sequence identity = 99%) was used to remove redundant sequences. Cap3 was used to merge and extend domain assemblies.

analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). As a complementary approach, single-cell differential composition analysis (SCDC) with the Malaria Cell Atlas as a reference was also used to determine parasite age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howick et al., 2019</xref>). SCDC and the mixture model approaches produced concordant estimates that most parasites were at ring stage in all ex vivo and in vitro samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Whilst there was no significant difference in ring-stage proportions across the generations, we observed a slight increase in parasite age in the cultured samples. Overall, there were more rings and early trophozoites in the ex vivo samples compared to the cultured parasite samples and an increase of late trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte proportions during the culturing process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The estimates produced from the mixture model approach showed high concordance with those observed by counting Giemsa-stained blood smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Due to the potential confounding effect of differences in stage distribution on gene expression, we adjusted for developmental stage determined by the mixture model in all subsequent analyses.</p><p>Our new approach was applied to RNA-sequencing samples of ex vivo and short-term in vitro cultured parasites from German travellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> shows the assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts on a per sample basis. Interestingly, we observed SSPACE did not provide improvement in terms of extending <italic>var</italic> assembled contigs in 9/37 samples. We observed a significant increase in the number of assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts in generation 2 parasites compared to paired generation 1 parasites (p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.04, paired Wilcoxon test). We observed no significant differences in the length of the assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts across the generations. Three different filtering approaches were applied in comparison to maximise the likelihood that correct assemblies were taken forward for further analysis and to avoid the overinterpretation of lowly expressed partial <italic>var</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Filtering for <italic>var</italic> transcripts at least 1500 nt long and containing at least three significantly annotated <italic>var</italic> domains was the least restrictive, while the other approaches required the presence of a DBLα domain within the transcript. All three filtering approaches generated the same maximum length <italic>var</italic> transcript and similar N50 values. This suggests minimal differences in the three filtering approaches, whilst highlighting the importance of filtering assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts.</p><p>In the original approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>, the non-core reads of each sample used for <italic>var</italic> assembly were mapped against a pooled reference of assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts from all samples, as a preliminary step towards differential <italic>var</italic> transcript expression analysis. This approach returned a small number of <italic>var</italic> transcripts which were expressed across multiple patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). As genome sequencing was not available, it was not possible to know whether there was truly overlap in <italic>var</italic> genomic repertoires of the different patient samples, but substantial overlap was not expected. Stricter mapping approaches (e.g. excluding transcripts shorter than 1500 nt) changed the resulting <italic>var</italic> expression profiles and produced more realistic scenarios where similar <italic>var</italic> expression profiles were generated across paired samples, whilst there was decreasing overlap across different patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Given this limitation, we used the paired samples to analyse <italic>var</italic> gene expression at an individual subject level, where we confirmed the MSP1 genotypes and alleles were still present after short-term in vitro cultivation. The per patient approach showed consistent expression of <italic>var</italic> transcripts within samples from each patient but no overlap of <italic>var</italic> expression profiles across different patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2d</xref>). Taken together, the per patient approach was better suited for assessing <italic>var</italic> transcriptional changes in longitudinal samples. However, it has been hypothesised that more conserved <italic>var</italic> genes in field isolates increase parasite fitness during chronic infections, necessitating the need to correctly identify them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimonte et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, further work is needed to optimise the pooled sample approach to identify truly conserved <italic>var</italic> transcripts across different parasite isolates in cross-sectional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Longitudinal analysis of <italic>var</italic> transcriptome from ex vivo to in vitro samples</title><p>To assess the changes in the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome induced by parasite culturing, we performed a series of analyses, all of which addressed different aspects: (i) changes in individual <italic>var</italic> gene expression pattern and <italic>var</italic> expression homogeneity (VEH) (‘per patient analysis’), (ii) changes in the expression of <italic>var</italic> variants conserved between strains, (iii) changes in the expression of PfEMP1 domains, (iv) changes in expression at the <italic>var</italic> group level, and (v) at the overall <italic>var</italic> expression level. We validated our results using the DBLα-tag approach and complemented the <italic>var</italic>-specific analysis by also examining changes in the core transcriptome.</p><p>To investigate whether dominant <italic>var</italic> gene expression changes through in vitro culture, rank analysis of <italic>var</italic> transcript expression was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In most cases a single dominant <italic>var</italic> transcript was detected. The dominant <italic>var</italic> gene did not change in most patient samples and the ranking of <italic>var</italic> gene expression remained similar. However, we observed a change in the dominant <italic>var</italic> gene being expressed through culture in isolates from 3 of 13 (23%) patients (#6, #17, and #26). Changes in the dominant <italic>var</italic> gene expression were also observed in the DBLα-tag data for these patients (described below). In parasites from three additional patients, #1, #7, and #14, the top expressed <italic>var</italic> gene remained the same, however we observed a change in the ranking of other highly expressed <italic>var</italic> genes in the cultured samples compared to the ex vivo sample. Interestingly, in patient #26 we observed a switch from a dominant group A <italic>var</italic> gene to a group B and C <italic>var</italic> gene. This finding was also observed in the DBLα-tag analysis (results below). A similar finding was seen in patient #7. In the ex vivo sample, the second most expressed <italic>var</italic> transcript was a group A transcript. However, in the cultured samples expression of this transcript was reduced and we observed an increase in the expression of group B and C <italic>var</italic> transcripts. A similar pattern was observed in the DBLα-tag analysis for patient #7, whereby the expression of a group A transcript was reduced during the first cycle of cultivation.

A more recent approach, based on RNA-sequencing, overcame many of the limitations imposed by the previous primer-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). However, depending on the expression level and sequencing depth, <italic>var</italic> transcripts were found to be fragmented and only a partial reconstruction of the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillochon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamagishi et al., 2014</xref>). The present study developed a novel approach for <italic>var</italic> gene assembly and quantification that overcomes many of these limitations.</p><p>Our new approach used the most geographically diverse reference of <italic>var</italic> gene sequences to date, which improved the identification of reads derived from <italic>var</italic> transcripts. This is crucial when analysing patient samples with low parasitaemia where <italic>var</italic> transcripts are hard to assemble due to their low abundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillochon et al., 2022</xref>). Our approach has wide utility due to stable performance on both laboratory-adapted and clinical samples. Concordance in the different <italic>var</italic> expression profiling approaches (RNA-sequencing and DBLα-tag) on ex vivo samples increased using the new approach by 13%, when compared to the original approach (96% in the whole transcript approach compared to 83% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests the new approach provides a more accurate method for characterising <italic>var</italic> genes, especially in samples collected directly from patients. Ultimately, this will allow a deeper understanding of relationships between <italic>var</italic> gene expression and clinical manifestations of malaria.</p><p>Having a low number of long contigs is desirable in any de novo assembly. This reflects a continuous assembly, as opposed to a highly fragmented one where polymorphic and repeat regions could not be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lischer and Shimizu, 2017</xref>). An excessive number of contigs cannot be reasonably handled computationally and results from a high level of ambiguity in the assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). We observed a greater than 50% reduction in the number of contigs produced in our new approach, which also had a 21% increase in the maximum length of the assembled <italic>var</italic> transcripts, when compared to the original approach. It doubled the assembly continuity and assembled an average of 13% more of the <italic>var</italic> transcripts. This was particularly apparent in the N-terminal region, which has often been poorly characterised by existing approaches. The original approach failed to assemble the N-terminal region in 58% of the samples, compared to just 4% in the new approach with assembly consistently achieved with an accuracy &gt;90%. This is important because the N-terminal region is known to contribute to the adhesion phenotypes of most PfEMP1 proteins.</p><p>The new approach allows for <italic>var</italic> transcript reconstruction across a range of expression levels, which is required when characterising <italic>var</italic> transcripts from multi-clonal infections. Assembly completeness of the lowly expressed <italic>var</italic> genes increased fivefold using the new approach. Biases towards certain parasite stages have been observed in non-severe and severe malaria cases, so it is valuable to assemble the <italic>var</italic> transcripts from different life cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>). Our new approach is not limited by parasite stage. It was able to assemble the whole <italic>var</italic> transcript, in a single contig, at later stages in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 intra-erythrocytic cycle, something previously unachievable. The new approach allows for a more accurate and complete picture of the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome. It provides new perspectives for relating <italic>var</italic> expression to regulation, co-expression, epigenetics, and malaria pathogenesis. It can be applied, for example, in the analysis of patient samples with different clinical outcomes and longitudinal tracking of infections in vivo. It represents a crucial improvement for quantifying the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome. In this work, the improved approach for <italic>var</italic> gene assembly and quantification was used to characterise <italic>var</italic> gene expression during transition from in vivo to short-term culture.</p><p>This study had substantial power through the use of paired samples. However, many <italic>var</italic> gene expression studies do not have longitudinal sampling. Future work should focus on identifying the best approach for analysing the <italic>var</italic> transcripts in cross-sectional samples. Higher-level <italic>var</italic> classification systems, such as the PfEMP1 predicted binding phenotype or domain cassettes, could be applied to test for over-representation of different <italic>var</italic> gene features in different groups of interest, because the assumption of overlapping <italic>var</italic> repertoires at these levels of classification would be more realistic. This was briefly explored in our analysis through <italic>var</italic> domain differential expression analysis, which found minimal changes in <italic>var</italic> domain expression through short-term culture, supporting the per patient analysis results. This could be further improved by advancing the classifications of domain subtypes. This has recently been studied using MEME to identify short nucleotide motifs that are representative of domain subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>). Other research could investigate clustering <italic>var</italic> transcripts based on sequence identity and testing for clusters associated with specific malaria disease groups.</p><p>Studies have been performed investigating differences between long-term laboratory-adapted clones and clinical isolates, with hundreds of genes found to be differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tarr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackinnon et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, studies investigating the impact of short-term culture on parasites are extremely limited, despite it being commonly undertaken for making inferences about the in vivo transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vignali et al., 2011</xref>). Using the new <italic>var</italic> assembly approach, we found that <italic>var</italic> gene expression remains relatively stable during transition to culture. However, the conserved <italic>var2csa</italic> had increased expression from generation 1 to generation 2. It has previously been suggested that long-term cultured parasites converge to expressing <italic>var2csa</italic>, but our findings suggest this begins within two cycles of cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mok et al., 2008</xref>). Switching to <italic>var2csa</italic> has been shown to be favourable and is suggested to be the default <italic>var</italic> gene upon perturbation to <italic>var</italic>-specific heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ukaegbu et al., 2015</xref>). These studies also suggested that <italic>var2csa</italic> has a unique role in <italic>var</italic> gene switching and our results are consistent with the role of <italic>var2csa</italic> as the dominant ‘sink node’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ukaegbu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ukaegbu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mok et al., 2008</xref>). A previous study suggested that in vitro cultivation of controlled human malaria infection samples resulted in dramatic changes in <italic>var</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lavstsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2007</xref>). Almost a quarter of samples in our analysis showed more pronounced and unpredictable changes. In these individuals, the dominant <italic>var</italic> gene being expressed changed within one cycle of cultivation. This implies that short-term culture can result in unpredictable <italic>var</italic> gene expression as observed previously using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachmann et al., 2011</xref>) and that one would need to confirm in vivo expression matches in vitro expression. This can be achieved using the assembly approach described here.</p><p>We observed no generalised pattern of up- or downregulation of specific <italic>var</italic> groups following transition to culture. This implies that there is probably not a selection event occurring during culture but may represent a loss of selection that is present in vivo. A global downregulation of certain <italic>var</italic> groups might only occur as a selective process over many cycles in extended culture. Determining changes in <italic>var</italic> group expression levels are difficult using degenerate qPCR primers bias and previous studies have found conflicting results in terms of changes of expression of <italic>var</italic> groups through cultivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>, found a rapid transcriptional decline of group A and group B <italic>var</italic> genes, however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2007</xref>, found group A <italic>var</italic> genes to have a high rate of downregulation, when compared to group B <italic>var</italic> genes. These studies differed in the stage distribution of the parasites and were limited in measuring enough variants through their use of primers. Our new approach allowed for the identification of more sequences, with 26.6% of assembled DBLα domains not found via the DBLα-tag approach. This better coverage of the expressed <italic>var</italic> diversity was not possible in these previous studies and may explain discrepancies observed.</p><p>Generally, there was a high consensus between all levels of <italic>var</italic> gene analysis and changes observed during short-term in vitro cultivation. However, the impact of short-term culture was the most apparent at the <italic>var</italic> transcript level and became less clear at the <italic>var</italic> domain, <italic>var</italic> type and global <italic>var</italic> gene expression level. This highlights the need for accurate characterisation of full-length <italic>var</italic> transcripts and analysis of the <italic>var</italic> transcriptome at different levels, both of which can be achieved with the new approach developed here.</p><p>We saw striking changes in the core gene transcriptomes between ex vivo and generation 1 parasites with 19% of the core genome being differentially expressed. A previous study showed that expression of 18% of core genes were significantly altered after ~50 cycles through culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackinnon et al., 2009</xref>), but our data suggest that much of this change occurs early in the transition to culture. We observed that genes with functions unrelated to ring-stage parasites were among those most significantly expressed in the generation 1 vs ex vivo analysis, suggesting the culture conditions may temporarily dysregulate stage-specific expression patterns or result in the parasites undergoing a rapid adaptation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreadaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beeson et al., 2016</xref>). Several AP2 transcription factors (AP2-SP2, AP2-EXP2, AP2-LT, AP2-O, and AP2-HC) were upregulated in generation 1. AP2-HC has been shown to be expressed in asexual parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carrington et al., 2021</xref>). AP2-O is thought to be specific for the ookinete stage and AP2-SP2 plays a key role in sporozoite stage-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yuda et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings are consistent with another study investigating the impact of long-term culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackinnon et al., 2009</xref>) which also found genes like merozoite surface proteins differentially expressed, however they were downregulated in long-term cultured parasites, whereas we found them upregulated in generation 1. This suggests that short-term cultured parasites might be transcriptionally different from long-term cultured parasites, especially in their invasion capabilities, something previously unobserved. Several genes involved in the stress response of parasites were upregulated in generation 1, e.g., DnaJ proteins, serine proteases, and ATP-dependent CLP proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oakley et al., 2007</xref>). The similarity of the core transcriptomes of the in vitro samples compared to the heterogeneity seen in the ex vivo samples could be explained by a stress response upon entry to culture. Studies investigating whether the dysregulation of stage-specific expression and the expression of stress-associated genes persist in long-term culture are required to understand whether they are important for growth in culture. Critically, the marked differences presented here suggest that the impact of short-term culture can override differences observed in both the in vivo core and <italic>var</italic> transcriptomes of different disease manifestations.</p><p>In summary, we present an enhanced approach for <italic>var</italic> transcript assembly which allows for <italic>var</italic> gene expression to be studied in connection to <italic>P. falciparum’s</italic> core transcriptome through RNA-sequencing. This will be useful for expanding our understanding of <italic>var</italic> gene regulation and function in in vivo samples. As an example of the capabilities of the new approach, the method was used to quantify differences in gene expression upon short-term culture adaptation. This revealed that inferences from clinical isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> put into short-term culture must be made with a degree of caution. Whilst <italic>var</italic> gene expression is often maintained, unpredictable switching does occur, necessitating that the similarity of in vivo and in vitro expression should be confirmed. The more extreme changes in the core transcriptome could have much bigger implications for understanding other aspects of parasite biology such as growth rates and drug susceptibility and raise a need for additional caution. Further work is needed to examine <italic>var</italic> and core transcriptome changes during longer-term culture on a larger sample size. Understanding the ground truth of the <italic>var</italic> expression repertoire of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> field isolates still presents a unique challenge and this work expands the database of <italic>var</italic> sequences globally. The increase in long-read sequencing and the growing size of <italic>var</italic> gene databases containing isolates from across the globe will help overcome this issue in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Blood was drawn and either immediately processed (#1, #2, #3, #4, #11, #12, #14, #17, #21, #23, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32) or stored overnight at 4°C until processing (#5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #13, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #22, #24, #25, #26, #27, #33). If samples were stored overnight, the ex vivo and in vitro samples were still processed at the same time (so paired samples had similar storage). Erythrocytes were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, followed by filtration through Plasmodipur filters (EuroProxima) to remove residual granulocytes. At least 400 µl of the purified erythrocytes were quickly lysed in 5 volumes of pre-warmed TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific) and stored at –80°C until further processing (‘ex vivo samples’). When available, the remainder was then transferred to in vitro culture either without the addition of allogeneic red cells or with the addition of O+ human red cells (blood bank, UKE) for dilution according to a protocol adopted from Trager and Jensen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 94% N<sub>2</sub> using RPMI complete medium containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum (A+, Interstate Blood Bank, Inc, Memphis, TN, USA). Cultures were sampled for RNA purification at the ring stage by microscopic observation of the individual growth of parasite isolates, and harvesting was performed at the appropriate time without prior synchronisation treatment (‘in vitro samples’). 13 of these ex vivo samples underwent one cycle of in vitro cultivation, 10 of these generation 1 samples underwent a second cycle of in vitro cultivation. One of these generation 2 samples underwent a third cycle of in vitro cultivation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, an aliquot of ex vivo erythrocytes (approximately 50–100 µl) and aliquots of in vitro cell cultures collected as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> were processed for gDNA purification and MSP1 genotyping as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robert et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA purification, RNA-sequencing library preparation, and sequencing</title><p>RNA purification was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>, using TRIzol in combination with the RNeasy MinElute Kit (QIAGEN) and DNase digestion (DNase I, QIAGEN). Human globin mRNA was depleted from all samples except from samples #1 and #2 using the GLOBINclear kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The median RIN value over all ex vivo samples was 6.75 (IQR: 5.93–7.40), although this measurement has only limited significance for samples containing RNA of two species.

Previous methods either did not incorporate read error correction or focussed on gene assembly, as opposed to transcript assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zerbino and Birney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zimin et al., 2013</xref>). Read error correction is important for <italic>var</italic> transcript assembly due to the highly repetitive nature of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome. Recent methods have also focussed on whole transcript assembly, as opposed to initial separate domain assembly followed by transcript assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>). The original analysis used SoapDeNovo-Trans to assemble the <italic>var</italic> transcripts, however it is currently not possible to run all steps in the original approach, due to certain tools being improved and updated. Therefore, SoapDeNovo-Trans (k=71) was used and termed the original approach.</p><p>Here, two novel methods for whole <italic>var</italic> transcript and <italic>var</italic> domain assembly were developed and their performance was evaluated in comparison to the original approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In both methods the reads were first mapped to the human g38 genome and any mapped reads were removed. Next, the unmapped reads were mapped to a modified <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 genome with <italic>var</italic> genes removed, to identify multi-mapping reads commonly present in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> RNA-sequencing datasets. Any mapped reads were removed. In parallel, the unmapped RNA reads from the human mapping stage were mapped against a reference of field isolate <italic>var</italic> exon 1 sequences and the mapped reads identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 2019</xref>). These reads were combined with the unmapped reads from the 3D7 genome mapping stage and duplicate reads removed. All mapping was performed using subread align as in the original analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). The reads identified at the end of this process are referred to as ‘non-core reads’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole <italic>var</italic> transcript and <italic>var</italic> domain assembly methods</title><p>For whole <italic>var</italic> transcript assembly the non-core reads, for each sample separately, were assembled using rnaSPAdes (k-mer=71, read_error_correction on) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bushmanova et al., 2019</xref>). Contigs were joined into larger scaffolds using SSPACE (parameters -n 31 -x 0 -k 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boetzer et al., 2011</xref>).

First, the non-core reads were mapped (nucleotide basic local alignment tool [blastn] short read option) to the domain sequences as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rask et al., 2010</xref>. This was found to produce similar results when compared to using tblastx. An e-value threshold of 1e-30 was used for the more conserved DBLα domains and an e-value of 1e-10 for the other domains. Next, the reads mapping to the different domains were assembled separately. rnaSPAdes (read_error_correction on, k-mer=15), Oases (kmer = 15), and SoapDeNovo2 (kmer = 15) were all used to assemble the reads separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bushmanova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>). The output of the different assemblers was combined into a per sample reference of domain sequences. Redundancy was removed in the reference using cd-hit (-n 8-c 0.99) (at sequence identity = 99%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Cap3 was used to merge and extend the domain assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and Madan, 1999</xref>). SSPACE was used to join the domains together (parameters -n 31 -x 0 -k 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boetzer et al., 2011</xref>). Transcript annotation was performed as in the whole transcript approach, with transcripts &lt;500 nt removed. Significantly annotated (1e-5) transcripts were identified and selected. The most significant annotation was selected as the best annotation for each region, with multiple annotations allowed on a single transcript if the regions were not overlapping. For both methods, a <italic>var</italic> transcript was selected if it contained at least one significantly annotated domain (in exon 1). <italic>Var</italic> transcripts that encoded only the more conserved exon 2 (acidic terminal segment domain) were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Validation on RNA-sequencing dataset from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reference strain 3D7</title><p>Both new approaches and the original approach (SoapDeNovo-Trans, k=71) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>) were run on a public RNA-sequencing dataset of the intra-erythrocytic life cycle stages of cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain, sampled at 8 hr intervals up until 40 hr post infection and then at 4 hr intervals up until 48 hr post infection (ENA: PRJEB31535) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wichers et al., 2019</xref>). This provided a validation of all three approaches due to the true sequence of the <italic>var</italic> genes being known in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain. Therefore, we compared the assembled sequences from all three approaches to the true sequence. The first best hit (significance threshold = 1e-10) was chosen for each contig. The alignment score was used to evaluate the performance of each method. The alignment score represents ⎷accuracy* recovery. The accuracy is the proportion of bases that are correct in the assembled transcript and the recovery reflects what proportion of the true transcript was assembled.

This reference was chosen as it contained reference transcriptomes for the gametocyte stage. To ensure consistency with the original analysis, proportions from the mixture model approach were used for all subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). For comparison, the proportion of different stages of the parasite life cycle in the ex vivo and in vitro samples was determined by two independent readers in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. The same classification as the mixture model approach was used (8, 19, 30, and 42 hr post infection corresponding to ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, and schizont stages, respectively). Significant differences in ring-stage proportions were tested using pairwise Wilcoxon tests. For the other stages, a modified Wilcoxon rank test for zero-inflated data was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Var</italic> gene expression is highly stage dependent, so any quantitative comparison between samples needs adjustment for developmental stage.

The authors successfully tackled this issue by introducing an optimization of their original de novo assembler, which notably more than doubled the N50 metric and greatly improved the assembly of var genes.</p><p>The most intriguing aspect of this study lies in its methodologies, particularly the longitudinal analysis of assembled var transcripts within subjects. This approach allows for the construction of an unbiased var repertoire for each individual, free from the influence of a reference genome or other samples. These sample-specific var gene repertoires are then tracked over time in culture to evaluate the reliability of using cultured samples for inferences about in vivo expression patterns. The findings from this analysis are thought-provoking. While the authors conclude that culturing parasites can lead to unpredictable transcriptional changes, they also observe that the overall ranking of each var gene remains relatively robust over time. This resilience in the var gene ranking within individuals raises intriguing questions about the mechanisms behind var gene switching and adaptation during short-term culture.</p><p>In addition to the var gene-specific analysis, the study also delves into a comparison of ex vivo samples with generation 1 and generation 2 cultured parasites across the core genome. This analysis reveals substantial shifts in expression due to culture adaptation, shedding light on broader changes in the parasite transcriptome during short-term culture.</p><p>In summary, this research contributes to our understanding of var gene expression and potentially associations with disease. It emphasizes the importance of improved assembly techniques to access var genes and underscores the challenges of using short-term cultured parasites to infer in vivo characteristics. The longitudinal analysis approach offers a fresh perspective on var gene dynamics within individuals and highlights the need for further investigations into var gene switching and adaptation during culture.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87726.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

This seems somewhat overly pessimistic with regard to var gene expression profiling and does not reflect the data described in the paper. In contrast, the main text of the paper repeatedly refers to &quot;modest changes in var gene expression repertoire upon culture&quot; or &quot;relatively small changes in var expression from ex vivo to culture&quot;, and many additional similar assessments. On balance, it seems that transition to culture conditions causes relatively minor changes in var gene expression, at least in the initial generations. The authors do highlight that a few individuals in their analysis showed more pronounced and unpredictable changes, which certainly warrants caution for future studies but should not obscure the interesting observation that var gene expression remained relatively stable during transition to culture.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We were happy to modify the wording in the abstract to have consistency with the results presented by highlighting that modest but unpredictable var gene switching was observed while substantial changes were found in the core transcriptome. Moreover, any differences observed in core transcriptome between ex vivo samples from naïve and pre-exposed patients are diminished after one cycle of cultivation making inferences about parasite biology in vivo impossible.</p><p>Therefore, – to our opinion – the statement in the last sentence is well supported by the data presented.</p><p>Line 43–47: “Modest but unpredictable var gene switching and convergence towards var2csa were observed in culture, along with differential expression of 19% of the core transcriptome between paired ex vivo and generation 1 samples. Our results cast doubt on the validity of the common practice of using short-term cultured parasites to make inferences about in vivo phenotype and behaviour.”Nevertheless, we would like to note that this study was in a unique position to assess changes at the individual patient level as we had successive parasite generations. This comparison is not done in most cross-sectional studies and therefore these small, unpredictable changes in the var transcriptome are missed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors describe a pipeline to sequence expressed var genes from RNA sequencing that improves on a previous one that they had developed.

We have included the second reference in the introduction of our revised manuscript, where we refer to var assembly and quantification from RNA-sequencing data.

It is based on assembling var exon 1 from unfished whole genome assemblies of clinical samples and requires a prior step for filtering out human DNA. The authors used two different assemblers, Celera for short reads (which is no longer maintained) and Sprai for long reads (&gt;2000bp), but found that Celera performed worse than Sprai, and subsequently used Sprai assemblies. Therefore, this method does not appear to be suitable for assembling short reads from RNA-seq.</p><p>The second paper (Stucke et al. 2021) focusses more on enriching for parasite RNA, which precedes assembly. The capture method they describe would complement downstream analysis of var transcript assembly with our pipeline. Their assembly pipeline is similar to our pipeline as they also performed de novo assembly on all <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mapping and non-human mapping reads and used the same assembler (but with different parameters). They clustered sequences using the same approach but at 90% sequence identity as opposed to 99% sequence identity using our approach. Then, Stucke et al. use 500nt as a cut-off as opposed to the more stringent filtering approach used in our approach. They annotated their de novo assembled transcripts with the known amino acid sequences used in their design of the capture array; our approach does not assume prior information on the var transcripts. Finally, their approach was validated only for its ability to recover the most highly expressed var transcript in 6 uncomplicated malaria samples, and they did not assess mis-assemblies in their approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the methods (619–621), were erythrocytes isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation at the time of collection or later?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the methods section to clarify this.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 586–588: “Blood was drawn and either immediately processed (#1, #2, #3, #4, #11, #12, #14, #17, #21, #23, #28, #29, #30, #31, #32) or stored overnight at 4oC until processing (#5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #13, #15, #16, #18, #19, #20, #22, #24, #25, #26, #27, #33).”</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was the current pipeline and assembly method assessed for var chimeras?

This is a lower median percentage than the median of 81.3% (IQR: 73–98%) found in the original analysis (p = 0.28, paired Wilcoxon test) and suggests the new assembly approach is better at capturing all expressed DBLα domains.”</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The letters for the figure panels need to be added.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure has been removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>It is difficult from Table S2 to determine how many unique var transcripts would have enough coverage to be potentially assembled from each sample.

This pattern shifts to a more restricted, homogeneous var expression pattern in semi-immune individuals (expression of few variants) depending on the degree of immunity (Bachmann et al., 2019).</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87726-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this cohort, 15 first-time infections are included, which should also possess a more heterogenous var gene expression in comparison to the pre-exposed individuals, and indeed such a trend is already seen in the number of different DBLa-tag clusters found in both patient groups (see figure panel from Wichers et al. 2021: blue-first-time infections; grey–pre-exposed). Moreover, Warimwe et al. 2013 have shown that asymptomatic infections have a more homogeneous var expression in comparison to symptomatic infections. Therefore, we expect that parasites from symptomatic infections have a heterogenous var expression pattern with multiple var gene variants expressed, which we could assemble due to our high read depth and our improved var assembly pipeline for even low expressed variants.</p><p>Moreover, the distinct transcripts found in the RNA-seq approach were confirmed with the DBLα tag data.

As acknowledged on line 327, many reads will be mis-mapped, and perhaps most challenging is that most vars will not be represented in most samples. In other words, even if mapping were somehow perfect, one would expect a sparse matrix that would not be suitable for statistical comparisons between groups. This is likely why the per-patient transcript analysis doesn't appear to be consistent. I would recommend the authors remove the DE sections utilizing this approach, or add convincing evidence that the count matrix is useable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a general issue of var differential expression analysis. Therefore, we have removed the var differential expression analysis from this manuscript as the per patient approach was more appropriate for the paired samples. We validated different mapping strategies (new Figure S6) and included a paragraph discussing the problem in the result section:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 237–255: “In the original approach of Wichers et al., 2021, the non-core reads of each sample used for var assembly were mapped against a pooled reference of assembled var transcripts from all samples, as a preliminary step towards differential var transcript expression analysis. This approach returned a small number of var transcripts which were expressed across multiple patient samples (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2a). As genome sequencing was not available, it was not possible to know whether there was truly overlap in var genomic repertoires of the different patient samples, but substantial overlap was not expected. Stricter mapping approaches (for example, excluding transcripts shorter than 1500nt) changed the resulting var expression profiles and produced more realistic scenarios where similar var expression profiles were generated across paired samples, whilst there was decreasing overlap across different patient samples (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2b,c). Given this limitation, we used the paired samples to analyse var gene expression at an individual subject level, where we confirmed the MSP1 genotypes and alleles were still present after short-term in vitro cultivation. The per patient approach showed consistent expression of var transcripts within samples from each patient but no overlap of var expression profiles across different patients (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2d). Taken together, the per patient approach was better suited for assessing var transcriptional changes in longitudinal samples. It has been hypothesised that more conserved var genes in field isolates increase parasite fitness during chronic infections, necessitating the need to correctly identify them (Dimonte et al., 2020, Otto et al., 2019). Accordingly, further work is needed to optimise the pooled sample approach to identify truly conserved var transcripts across different parasite isolates in cross-sectional studies.” - Figure S6:</p></list-item></list><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Var expression profiles across different mapping.</title><p>Different mapping approaches Were used to quantify the Var expression profiles of each sample (ex Vivo (n=13), generation I (n=13), generation 2 (n=10) and generation 3 (n=l)).

Similar to line 304, why would comparisons of naïve vs. prior-exposed be informative about surrogates for in vivo studies? Without a gold-standard for what should be differentially expressed between naïve and prior-exposed in vivo, it doesn't seem prudent to interpret a drop in the number of DE genes for this comparison in generation 1 as evidence that biological signal for this comparison is lost. What if the generation 1 result is actually more reflective of the true difference in vivo, but the ex vivo samples are just noisy? How do we know? Why not just compare ex vivo vs generation 1/2 directly (as done in the first DE analysis), and then you can comment on the large number of changes as samples are less and less proximal to in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original paper (Wichers et al., 2021), there were differences between the core transcriptome of naïve vs previously exposed patients.

We investigated whether these differences persisted after in vitro cultivation. We performed differential expression analysis comparing parasite isolates from naïve (n=6) vs pre-exposed (n=7) patients, first between their ex vivo samples, and then between the corresponding generation 1 samples. Interestingly, when using the ex vivo samples, we observed 206 core genes significantly upregulated in naïve patients compared to pre-exposed patients (Figure 7 – Figure supplement 3a). Conversely, we observed no differentially expressed genes in the naïve vs pre-exposed analysis of the paired generation 1 samples (Figure 7 – Figure supplement 3b). Taken together with the preceding findings, this suggests one cycle of cultivation shifts the core transcriptomes of parasites to be more alike each other, diminishing inferences about parasite biology in vivo.”</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I found the many DE approaches very frustrating to interpret coherently.
