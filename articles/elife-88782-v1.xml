spectrum disorder. FXS results from the absence of the RNA-binding protein FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). Neuronal migration is an essential step of brain development allowing displacement of neurons from their germinal niches to their final integration site. The precise role of FMRP in neuronal migration remains largely unexplored. Using live imaging of postnatal rostral migratory stream (RMS) neurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-null mice, we observed that the absence of FMRP leads to delayed neuronal migration and altered trajectory, associated with defects of centrosomal movement. RNA-interference-induced knockdown of <italic>Fmr1</italic> shows that these migratory defects are cell-autonomous. Notably, the primary <italic>Fmrp</italic> mRNA target implicated in these migratory defects is microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). Knocking down MAP1B expression effectively rescued most of the observed migratory defects. Finally, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play by demonstrating that the absence of FMRP induces defects in the cage of microtubules surrounding the nucleus of migrating neurons, which is rescued by MAP1B knockdown. Our findings reveal a novel neurodevelopmental role for FMRP in collaboration with MAP1B, jointly orchestrating neuronal migration by influencing the microtubular cytoskeleton.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>FMRP</kwd><kwd>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein</kwd><kwd>MAP1B</kwd><kwd>microtubule-associated protein 1B</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007353</institution-id><institution>Fondation Jérôme Lejeune</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRT-2017A/1659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caille</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE16-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caille</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC-017989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trembleau</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel neurodevelopmental role for FMRP in collaboration with MAP1B, jointly orchestrating neuronal migration by influencing the microtubular cytoskeleton.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is due to the silencing of the gene <italic>FMR1</italic> and loss of the encoded protein, FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Broadie, 2017</xref>). FMRP is an ubiquitous RNA-binding protein, with high level of expression in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gholizadeh et al., 2015</xref>). It is a general regulator of RNA metabolism and especially of mRNA local translation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>). Its cognate mRNA targets are numerous and diverse, including mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neuronal plasticity like CamKIIα (calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II) and cytoskeletal proteins like microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic>-null mice are the murine model of FXS and have allowed characterization of numerous neurodevelopmental and plasticity defects consecutive to the absence of FMRP. We previously showed the essential role of FMRP in the differentiation and learning-induced structural plasticity of adult-generated olfactory bulb interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scotto-Lomassese et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daroles et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal migration is a crucial step for the establishment of neuronal circuitry, orchestrating the relocation of neurons from their birthplace to their final destination for differentiation. Migration defects lead to severe brain pathologies including lissencephaly and cortical heterotopia and may contribute to psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, migration in the human infant brain appears to be even more extended than anticipated from the rodent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, periventricular heterotopia has been documented in two individuals with FXS, implying a potential role for FMRP in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moro et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-null mice, radially migrating embryonic glutamatergic cortical neurons display a defect in the multipolar to bipolar transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">La Fata et al., 2014</xref>), a critical change of polarity taking place before the initiation of the movement. The key <italic>Fmrp</italic> target mRNA involved in this process is N-cadherin, downregulated in the Fmr1 mutants and whose overexpression rescued the migratory phenotype. Additionally, both FMRP overexpression or knockdown (KD) lead to the misplacement of cortical glutamatergic neurons, also potentially underscoring its role in radial embryonic migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). However, to our knowledge, postnatal neuronal migration in the absence of FMRP has not been studied so far and the dynamics of mutated <italic>Fmr1</italic> neurons have yet to be comprehensively analyzed.</p><p>Here, using the postnatal rostral migratory stream (RMS) as a tangential migration model as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stoufflet et al., 2020</xref>, we present novel insights into the migratory defects induced by the absence of FMRP. Migrating neurons in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-null mice exhibit a distinctive pattern of slowed-down and erratic migration, accompanied by alterations of centrosome movement. Notably, these defects are cell-autonomous, as evidenced by their recapitulation through RNA-interference-induced Fmr1 KD.</p><p>MAP1B is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics within neurons. It is instrumental in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villarroel-Campos and Gonzalez-Billault, 2014</xref>) including neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">González-Billault et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Billault et al., 2004</xref>). We hypothesized its involvement as the <italic>Fmrp</italic> mRNA target in the observed defects. Indeed, elevated levels of MAP1B were detected in the mutated RMS, and the KD-induced downregulation of MAP1B successfully rescued most migration defects. Finally, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these migratory defects, by showing that the microtubular cage surrounding the nucleus of migrating neurons is disrupted in the absence of FMRP. Importantly, this abnormality is rescued by MAP1B KD, shedding light on a previously undiscovered role for the FMRP/MAP1B duo in regulating proper tangential migration at the microtubular level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FMRP is expressed in migrating neurons of the postnatal RMS</title><p>A massive number of neuroblasts are constantly produced in the ventricular/subventricular zone (V/SVZ) and migrate over a long distance along the RMS to the olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

N-Cadherin emerged as the main FMRP target in this context. It is noteworthy that, while the study did not strongly indicate an impact on radial locomotion per se, drawing conclusive results is challenging due to the relatively low number of analyzed neurons. Subsequently, another study, focusing on miR-129, showed that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KD similarly triggered a misplacement of neurons in the cortical plate. However, this study did not display any further detailed analysis of the precise impact of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KD on radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).

Importantly, while a delay in migration may not necessarily trigger important anatomical anomalies, when abnormally migrating neurons ultimately properly reach their target, it is noteworthy that a delay in the timing of differentiation of delayed neurons can lead to significant functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Live imaging enabled us to conduct a detailed analysis of both NK and centrosome dynamics, revealing profound perturbations in both processes.

MAP1B is among the well-established targets of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). As a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B is expressed early in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tucker et al., 1989</xref>) and plays a crucial role in various stages of neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Billault et al., 2004</xref>) including migration. MAP1B-deficient mice display migration anomalies in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum and MAP1B phosphorylation can be induced by Reelin, a key regulator of radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">González-Billault et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We show MAP1B overexpression in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-mutated neurons and rescue the migratory defects through RNA-interference-induced KD.

To our knowledge, the importance of the FMRP-MAP1B duo for neuronal migration, as described here, stands as the only other documented neurodevelopmental function of FMRP-regulated MAP1B translation. Considering the previously reported role of MAP1B in radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">González-Billault et al., 2005</xref>), it is tempting to hypothesize that our findings may extend to this form of embryonic migration, with the duo also regulating its microtubular dynamic.</p><p>Remarkably, we also elucidate the mechanistic action of the FMRP/MAP1B duo on the microtubular cytoskeleton. In the absence of FMRP, the cage formed by microtubules around the nucleus of migrating neurons appears disorganized. This disorganization primarily results from MAP1B overexpression in the Fmr1 mutants, as evidenced by the rescue of the phenotype through MAP1B KD. Notably, this phenotype of cage disruption was already described in radially migrating neurons upon Lis1, Dynein, and Ndel1 KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shu et al., 2004</xref>). The Dynein/Lis1/Nde1/Nedl1 complex is essential to neuronal migration, allowing proper traction of the centrosome and nucleus along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). Considering that MAP1B has also been reported to impact the interaction between Dynein and Lis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiménez-Mateos et al., 2005</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that MAP1B overexpression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants destabilizes the Dynein/Lis1/Nde1/Nedl1 complex, influencing the link it creates between the nuclear envelope and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>) necessary for proper forward traction.</p><p>In the context of FXS, it is noteworthy that recent studies have revealed that postnatal tangential migration in the infant human brain is even more extensive than in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanai et al., 2011</xref>). Analyzing migration in FXS human organoids or forthcoming assembloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy and Paşca, 2023</xref>) will enable to test the conservation of the migratory phenotype observed as well as its molecular underpinnings.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings unveil a novel facet of FMRP, highlighting its role as a regulator of migration intricately linked to microtubules through MAP1B. This discovery expands our understanding of this multifaceted protein and sheds a new light on its functional repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>Mice were housed in a 12 hr light/dark cycle, in cages containing one or two females and one male.

The nucleus and the centrosome (when centrin-RFP was co-injected) were tracked manually on each time frame during the whole movie.

Authors conducted a series of live-imaging on organotypic brain slices from Fmr1-null mice. They continued their analysis silencing Fmr1 exclusively from migrating neuroblasts using electroporation-mediated RNA interference method (MiRFmr1 KD). These impressive approaches show that neuroblasts tangential migration is impaired in Fmr1-null mice RMS and these defects are mostly recapitulated in the MiRFmr1neuroblasts. This nicely supports the idea that FMRP have a cell autonomous function in tangentially migrating neuroblasts. Authors also confirm that FMRP mRNA target Microtubule Associated Protein 1B (MAP1B) is overexpressed in the Fmr1-null mice RMS. They successfully use electroporation-mediated RNA interference method to silence Map1b in the Fmr1-null mice neuroblasts. This discreet and elaborate experiment rescues most of the migratory defects observed both in Fmr1-null and MiRFmr1neuroblasts. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that FMRP-MAP1B axis has an important role in regulation of the neuroblasts tangential migration in the RMS. Neurons move forward in cyclic saltatory manner which includes repeated steps of leading process extension, migration of the cell organelles and nuclear translocation. Authors reveal by analyzing the live-imaging data that FMRP-MAP1B axis is affecting movement of centrosome and nucleus during saltatory migration. An important part of the centrosome and nucleus movement is forces mediated by microtubule dynamics. Authors propose that FMRP regulate tangential migration via microtubule dynamics regulator MAP1B. This work provides valuable new information on regulation of the neuroblasts tangential saltatory migration. These findings also increase and improve our understanding of the issues involved in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) disorders. The conclusions of this work are supported by the presented data.</p><p>The current version of the study has improved substantially. Authors have enhanced the material and methods section including a more detailed section on the neuronal migration analysis. This amendment is a very valuable addition and strengthens the interpretation of the results, analysis and conclusions. Authors also have strengthened and clarified their results providing a more profound analysis of the migration directionality between controls, Fmr1-null, MiRFmr1 KD and MiRMap1b KD neuroblasts. They have incorporated new results in the study which elaborate FMRP and MAP1B participation in microtubule organization during tangential migration. Authors show that FMRP-MAP1B axis act on microtubule cage surrounding the nucleus. Microtubule cage participate on proper nuclear movement during neuron migration. These results emphasize more the interplay between FMRP, MAP1B, and the microtubule cytoskeleton. The authors have successfully expanded both the introduction and discussion sections of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88782.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Neuronal migration is one of the key processes for appropriate neuronal development. Defects in neuronal migration are associated with different brain disorders often accompanied by intellectual disabilities. Therefore, the study of the mechanisms involved in neuronal migration helps to understand the pathogenesis of some brain malformations and psychiatric disorders.</p><p>FMRP is an RNA-binding protein implicated in RNA metabolism regulation and mRNA local translation. FMRP loss of function causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. Previous studies have shown the role of FMRP in the multipolar to bipolar transition during the radial migration in the cortex and its possible relation with periventricular heterotopia and altered synaptic communication in humans with FXS. However, the role of FMRP in neuronal tangential migration is largely unknown. In this manuscript, the authors aim to decipher the role of FMRP in the tangential migration of neuroblasts along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in the postnatal brain. By extensive live-imaging analysis of migrating neuroblasts along the RMS, they demonstrate the requirement of FMRP for neuroblast migration and centrosomal movement. These migratory defects are cell-autonomous and mediated by the microtubule-associated protein Map1b.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript highlights the importance of FMRP in neuronal tangential migration. They performed an analysis of different aspects of migration such as nucleokinesis and cytokinesis in migrating neuroblasts from live-imaging videos. The authors have reinforced the results that associate defects in microtubule organization in Fmrp1 KO neurons and this rescue with the microtubule-associated protein Map1b. Overall, results concerning the role of Fmr1 in the tangential migration of neuroblasts are solid and convincing.</p><p>However, the work is still quite incomplete. My main concern is still what are the functional consequences of delay in neuroblast migration in the integration and function of OB interneurons and this relation with FXS pathophysiology. An anatomical examination of the RMS in the Fmr1KO mice is still missing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88782.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Messaoudi</surname><given-names>Salima</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Biologie Paris Seine, Sorbonne University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Allam</surname><given-names>Ada</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Biologie Paris Seine, Sorbonne University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stoufflet</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Curie</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Paillard</surname><given-names>Theo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Biologie Paris Seine, Sorbonne University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Le Ven</surname><given-names>Anaïs</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute Curie</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fouquet</surname><given-names>Coralie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sorbonne Université, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Doulazmi</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Biologie Paris Seine, Sorbonne University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Trembleau</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sorbonne Université, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Caille</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Biologie Paris Seine, Sorbonne University, Université Paris Cité</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>To Reviewer #1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the constructive and insightful comments provided by the reviewer.

We apologize for any initial lack of detail, including the omission of information on sinuosity index and directionality radar. Regarding the query about speed, we want to clarify that it indeed encompasses the percentage of pausing time. The speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the cell by the total time it migrated.</p><p>(2) We would like to provide a clarification regarding the statistical analysis in our figures. The figures now represent the median, and the legend indicates the median along with the interquartile range. This approach is in line with the use of non-parametric analysis for variables that do not adhere to a normal distribution. Regrettably, in the previous version, there was an oversight in the figure legends where the mean, along with the standard error of the mean, was incorrectly stated instead of the intended representation of the median. We sincerely apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Moving forward, the corrected legend now accurately reflects the statistical measures used in the analysis.</p><p>The global Kruskal Wallis analysis, followed by Dunn’s post hoc analysis, does indeed indicate that Fmr1 KD globally replicates the Fmr1-null phenotype. However, we concur with the reviewer's point regarding directionality, and we apologize for any lack of precision in the initial version. Upon further analysis, we have identified a significant difference in directionality (Fisher test p &lt; 0.001). This more pronounced directionality defect in the KD could potentially be indicative of a lack of compensation, a factor that may not be at play in the Fmr1 null context. We appreciate the opportunity to address this issue and our revised version includes the necessary details to accurately convey these findings.</p><p>(3) We appreciate the referee's agreement with our perspective.</p><p>(4) In response to the recommendations from all referees, we have expanded both the introduction and discussion sections of our manuscript. The initial brevity of these sections was due to the short format we had initially chosen.

This figure highlights the collaborative impact of FMRP and Map1B on the microtubular structure of migrating neurons. We firmly believe that this molecular elucidation of the migration phenotype constitutes a noteworthy addition to our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold></p></disp-quote><p>(1) In light of the referee's recommendation, we conducted more resolutive staining of FMRP in SVZ neurons cultured in Matrigel, providing a more precise depiction of its subcellular localization (see Figure 1). Additionally, we have removed the sentence referring to growth cone staining, as it was not visibly present in cultured neurons. We appreciate the guidance from the referee in refining our study.</p><p>(2) We have also added a new figure 4 with better staining of MAP1B in the RMS as well as a more resolutive MAP1B staining in cultured neurons.</p><p>With all due respect, we maintain that the western blot experiments, conducted in three independent experiments, unequivocally support the conclusion of a 1.6X increase in MAP1B in the RMS of Fmr1null mutants, a trend observed in other systems.</p><p>In accordance with the referee's suggestion, we endeavored to quantify RMS immunostainings. Regrettably, the results proved inconclusive. This outcome is not entirely unexpected, as immunostainings are recognized for their inherent challenges in quantification. The additional complexity introduced by neonate perfusion further contributes to the notable interindividual variability observed.</p><p>(3) The efficiency of the two interfering RNAs is now documented in the text.Regarding the directionality radar, as highlighted for Ref 1 (public review, point #2), we acknowledge that, while Fmr1KD generally recapitulates the migratory phenotype of the Fmr1 mutants, more precise statistical analysis reveals differences in directionality, which is now documented. We apologize for the previous lack of precision.</p><p>(4) The suggested experiment of overexpression is interesting but we faced challenges in its execution. Attempts to overexpress MAP1B through intraventricular electroporation of a CMV-MAP1B plasmid resulted in the immobilization of transfected cells in the SVZ, hindering further analysis of migration. We hypothesize that this outcome may be attributed to a discrepancy in the actual dosage of MAP1B in the mutants.</p><p>(5) Concerning this point, and as mentioned above, we have incorporated a crucial piece of information into the manuscript, presented in Figure 6. The data reveal a severe disruption in the microtubular cage surrounding the nucleus of migrating neurons in Fmr1 mutants, a phenomenon rescued by MAP1B knock-down. Based on these findings, we believe we can confidently conclude that the microtubule-dependent functions of MAP1B play a role in the migratory phenotype of Fmr1 mutants. We consider this experiment to be a highly valuable addition to our work, shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>To Reviewer #3</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for their insightful comments and have taken their consideration with great considerations.</p><p>In addition and as said above, we want to stress that we have implemented a significant additional modification by introducing a new figure (Fig. 6).

We have since expanded these sections, incorporating additional information about FMRP and MAP1B and their influences on migration.</p><p>Regarding the La Fata article, as highlighted in our discussion, it's important to note that while the study did not strongly indicate an impact on radial locomotion per se, drawing conclusive results is challenging due to the relatively low number of analyzed neurons. Consequently, we do not believe that it poses a challenge to our findings.</p><p>With respect to MAP1B overexpression, as previously mentioned in response to Ref #2, point 4, our attempts resulted in the inhibition of migration, potentially due to an overdosage of the protein.</p><p>In terms of anatomical consequences, as highlighted in our discussion, while our neurons experience a delay in migration, they eventually reach their destination. Although a delay in migration may not directly result in significant anatomical anomalies, we acknowledge that the timing of differentiation can be crucial. As noted by Bocchi et al. (2017), a delay in the timing of differentiation for neurons reaching their target could lead to notable functional consequences. In any case, we have tOned down any references to the implication for the pathology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendation for the authors</bold></p></disp-quote><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The size of the figures has been modified</p></list-item><list-item><p>The pausing time and sinuosity are now defined</p></list-item><list-item><p>The centrin-RFP labeling was indeed too weak in the previous version, which we corrected.
