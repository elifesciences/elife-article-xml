<italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here, we employ diverse CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to generate a series of targeted lesions within the endogenous cis-regulatory module (CRM) required for <italic>kni</italic> expression in the L2 vein primordium. Phenotypic analysis of these ‘<italic>in locus</italic>’ mutations based on both expression of Kni protein and adult wing phenotypes, reveals novel unexpected features of L2-CRM function including evidence for a chromosome pairing-dependent process that promotes transcription. We also demonstrate that self-propagating active genetic elements (CopyCat elements) can efficiently delete and replace the L2-CRM with orthologous sequences from other divergent fly species. Wing vein phenotypes resulting from these trans-species enhancer replacements parallel features of the respective donor fly species. This highly sensitive phenotypic readout of enhancer function in a native genomic context reveals novel features of CRM function undetected by traditional reporter gene analysis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30281.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk and botanist whose work with pea plants in the 19th century founded the field of genetics. Though he was not aware of genes at the time, Mendel essentially worked out that pea plants had two copies of each gene, and that each copy had a 50% chance of being passed on to any one offspring. Yet not all genes actually follow this pattern of inheritance.</p><p>In 2015, researchers reported that they had used components of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to edit genes so that they could propagate in a “Super-Mendelian” fashion. Indeed, when it was engineered into fruit flies, any parent carrying this active genetic element passed it on to almost every offspring. Active genetic elements have potential applications in many different fields of scientific research. These include providing new ways to explore how genes control the formation and activity of different organisms.</p><p>Now, Xu, Gantz et al. – including the two researchers involved in the 2015 work – have used a new active genetic element called a CopyCat element and more traditional genome editing to analyze the control of a gene that coordinates the formation of a simple structure in a fruit fly – a vein in the wing. The goal was to understand which sections of DNA controlled where and when genes are activated to result in this structure being reliably located in its correct position.</p><p>First, Xu, Gantz et al. used genome editing to make mutations in a stretch of DNA that regulates the gene involved in wing vein formation. The effects of these mutations unexpectedly suggested that pairs of chromosomes might be interacting to control the activity of this gene. This was something that had not been seen before, which shows the advantage of editing a gene’s regulatory sequence at its normal location within the genome.</p><p>Next, Xu, Gantz et al. used the CopyCat tool to delete the regulatory sequence and replace it with sequences from three other species of flies. When the sequence was replaced with that of a housefly, a complete vein formed but it was further forward than normal for a fruit fly, and more closely matched the position of the wing vein in a housefly. These findings show how gene activity can affect the position of a simple structure; they also suggest that this strategy could help scientists to understand how the genomes of different species have evolved.</p><p>Xu, Gantz et al. hope these advances will encourage other researchers to use active genetic elements in a broad range of organisms to enable and accelerate their research. Since these tools fundamentally change the rules of genetic inheritance, they have many applications beyond research too. These applications are not without their risks and would need careful consideration, but could include engineering wild mosquito populations to combat diseases like malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>in-locus</kwd><kwd>active genetics</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>knirps</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>wing vein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM117321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bier</surname><given-names>Ethan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul G.

Wing veins provide structural support necessary for flight and supply nutrients to sensory organs that coordinate wing beat motions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bier, 2000</xref>]). The number and positioning of veins are highly selected characteristics that vary among dipterans, holding evolutionary significance pertinent to the divergence of insect species and their modes of flight (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bier, 2000</xref>]).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> wing venation is determined by an intricate gene regulatory network (GRN) acting during larval and early pupal stages to position the five major longitudinal veins (L1-L5) and to sculpt the overall final shape of the wing. Secreted morphogens, including Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp), activate the expression of primary response genes, such as <italic>spalt</italic> (<italic>sal = salm + </italic> salr) and <italic>optomotor-blind</italic> (<italic>omb</italic>, also known as <italic>bifid</italic>), in broad domains. These patterning genes have been proposed to subsequently induce the formation of vein primordia along their borders by ‘for-export-only-signaling’ mechanisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bier, 2000</xref>]) and cross-repressive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Khatib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The L2 vein primordium forms along the anterior border of the <italic>sal</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sturtevant et al., 1997</xref>), where the zinc finger transcription factors, <italic>knirps</italic> and its neighboring homolog, <italic>knirps-related</italic> (<italic>knrl</italic>) are induced and direct the L2 vein development program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunde et al., 1998</xref>). Genomic lesions associated with several independently generated <italic>radius incompletus</italic> (<italic>ri</italic>) regulatory alleles of the <italic>kni</italic> locus, include deletions or point mutations within a 4.8 kb fragment upstream of the <italic>kni</italic> coding region that greatly reduce or eliminate expression of reporter genes in the L2 primordium and result in L2 vein truncation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>).

The recent advent of highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered randomly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) genome editing tools has provided a method to precisely alter CRM sequences and observe the resulting effects on development of the final L2 vein structure in the adult wing, permitting more sensitive decoding of CRM functionality. The type II CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease system evolved in bacteria as a defensive measure against viruses to cleave invading foreign DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>). This natural defense system has been engineered into a bipartite genome editing tool, consisting of a guide RNA (gRNA) that directs double stranded DNA cleavage by the Cas9 endonuclease at specific locations within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>) and has been adapted for use in a myriad of organisms (reviewed in: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassett and Liu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Overcash et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sander and Joung, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sternberg and Doudna, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gratz et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kondo and Ueda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Following gRNA/Cas9 cleavage at a given target site, mutations can be generated at that genomic location via one of two pathways: error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair, which typically generates small insertions and/or deletions (indels) at the cut site, or the more precise homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway that copies sequences from a homologous DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>). With the advent of CRISPR technology, these methods have also been employed to generate ‘active genetic’ elements that are copied in the germline via HDR and inherited in a Super-Mendelian fashion (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz and Bier, 2016</xref>]).</p><p>In the current study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mutations in the endogenous <italic>Drosophila kni</italic> L2-CRM and analyzed the phenotypic effects of these lesions on adult wing vein pattern. We generated a series of targeted sequential deletions spanning a ~ 2 kb segment encompassing the previously identified minimal 1.4 kb L2-CRM fragment plus additional well-conserved adjacent sequences. We also recovered and analyzed a variety of additional non-targeted mutations associated with imprecise lesions that were most likely generated by NHEJ. These studies provide a much higher resolution view of CRM function by linking CRM lesions in their native chromosomal context to precise phenotypic outputs. In addition, we validate the high efficiency of homology-directed, CRISPR-mediated, site-specific transgenesis as a viable alternative to traditional transgenesis methods (e.g. P-element or ɸC31-based systems). We also introduce the use of active genetic elements we refer to as CopyCat cloning vectors that can be inserted at determined locations and are copied with high efficiency from one parental chromosome to another during germline transmission, in the presence of an unlinked source of Cas9. Finally, we show that such active CopyCat vectors can be used for efficiently replacing the L2-CRM with homologous sequences from other fly species, resulting in alternative patterns of L2 vein placement. These new active genetics tools should greatly accelerate detailed combinatorial analysis of gene regulatory networks in a variety of experimental settings, as well as analyzing the function of exogenous DNA sequences found among diverged species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>In locus</italic> deletion of the L2-CRM eliminates the adult L2-vein and Knirps expression in the larval L2-primordium</title><p>As summarized in the introductory section, well-validated CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools now make it routine to generate genome alterations via random mutagenesis near guide RNA (gRNA) cleavage sites (via the NHEJ pathway) or to create targeted edits based on templates carrying homologous sequences on either side of the gRNA-directed cut site (via homology direct repair - HDR). We employed the latter precise approach to generate a series of deletions of the endogenous L2-CRM. We utilized two gRNAs directing Cas9 cleavage on each side of a specific region to be deleted, as well as single-stranded oligonucleotides donors (ssODN) with 60 bp of homology to either DNA end flanking the region targeted for deletion (see Materials and Methods). We first used two gRNAs (gRNA-A and gRNA-B) to delete a 2023 bp regulatory region encompassing the previously identified 1.4 kb minimal L2-CRM. The choice of this region was based primarily on significant sequence conservation among closely related flies which extended beyond both borders of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> ) analyzed in our original L2-CRM reporter studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>).

(<bold>N</bold>) Classic pairing-dependent transfection in which a functional CRM on one allele acts in-trans to promote transcription of the homologous allele. In this particular example, the functional CRM is in-cis to a loss-of-function protein coding mutation (deletion), while the functional protein coding region of the homologous chromosome is in-cis to a non-functional CRM (deletion of both sub-modules of the CRM). In this situation, all productive CRM-promoter interactions are in-trans. (<bold>O</bold>) A chromosomal rearrangement that disrupts pairing between homologous chromosomes blocks transvection. (<bold>P</bold>) When one of two redundantly acting CRM sub-modules is deleted without interfering with precise chromosomal alignment, activity can be sustained by pairing-dependent interactions between the remaining sub-modules on both homologues.

For this model, we hypothesize that generic interactions between CRM modules on homologous chromosomes may modulate CRM function. Such interactions could be sustained by a variety of potential mechanisms including (1) stabilizing protein complexes acting in cis; (2) interactions between non-coding RNAs generated from one CRM and interacting with proteins, RNA, or DNA on the opposing homolog, (3) coordinated alterations in chromatin dependent on steric access to identical chromosomal sequences.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30281-fig3-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30281.008</object-id><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Range of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> mutant phenotypes based on chromosome pairing.</title><p>Alignment of L2 veins from a panel of flies showing the range of phenotypes associated with pairing of third chromosome homologs.

This anterior displacement phenotype was quantitated in N = 20 wings by three separate measures: (1) ratio of the length of L2/L3 veins: average = 0.781 ± 0.006 for WT versus 0.637 ± 0.016 for <italic>riCC-Mdom</italic>, p&lt;1.2×10<sup>−18</sup>; (2) the angle between the L2 and L3 veins diverging from their proximal intersection point: average = 13.63 ± 0.58 degrees for WT versus 18.64 ± 0.58 degrees for <italic>riCC-Mdom,</italic> p&lt;2.0×10<sup>−17</sup>; and (3) the number of thick innervated bristles forming anterior to the point of intersection of the L2 vein with the margin: average = 11.15 ± 0.9 bristles for WT versus 28.9 ± 1.8 bristles for <italic>riCC-Mdom</italic>, p&lt;2.8×10<sup>−20</sup>.

We also indicate three short regions that display a particularly high degree of sequence conservation across Drosophilids and other Schizophora flies, that we refer to as hyper-conserved identity islands (labeled ID1, ID2 and ID3, respectively, magenta, red and green boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> also indicated in the multispecies alignment depicted in Figure 5A, and at the DNA sequence level in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The generated deletions were tested for phenotypes in trans-heterozygosity with the <italic>riAB</italic> deletion allele and in the homozygous condition. Consistent with prior studies that identified a central region required for CRM activity (i.e. a 252 bp region deleted in <italic>ri1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) that contains essential Scalloped activator binding sites [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>]), the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletions, which both partially overlap with the region deleted in <italic>ri1</italic>, produced strong vein-loss phenotypes similar to those of <italic>ri1</italic> when placed in trans to <italic>riAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Also, consistent with the prior mapping of a repressor domain to distal sequences missing in the EC fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: blue box), the homozygous <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> deletion produced a mild ectopic vein phenotype in peripheral regions of the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The homozygous <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> deletion produced a similar mild ectopic vein phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) lending support to our suspicion mentioned above that conserved sequences that were not included in our previous reporter analysis, contribute to the overall CRM function. Since both the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> deletions produced mild ectopic vein phenotypes, we generated a composite <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> deletion (by generating the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> deletion in the background of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic>) to determine whether these separated domains of the L2 CRM might act in concert. We found that this was indeed the case, as the homozygous combined <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> deletion produced a much more pronounced phenotype in which large thickened veins formed around L2 and L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), a phenotype that was similar albeit less pronounced in trans-heterozygotes over the AB deletion (<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4/riAB</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Consistent with this phenotype, significant levels of ectopic Kni expression were observed in the third instar imaginal discs of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1+</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> homozygous mutants in both anterior and posterior domains of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), in a pattern similar to that driven by the EC-lacZ reporter construct analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>). The domains of ectopic Kni expression in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> homozygotes are largely complementary to those of the Spalt transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P–R</xref>) as is the case for wild-type Kni expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>), indicating that binding sites for Spalt to repress Kni expression in central regions of the wing, are likely retained in the remaining CRM sequences. Interestingly, the pattern of ectopic Kni expression in homozygous <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> single mutant wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) was similar in both pattern and level to that in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> double mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), and only mild ectopic Kni expression was observed in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Slightly later in development during pre-pupal stages, however, narrower domains of high level Kni expression are observed in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1R</xref>) in comparison to the persisting broader domains of Kni expression present in the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1O</xref>). These later differences in Kni expression may help account for differences in the severity of ectopic wing vein phenotypes in the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> single mutant versus the double <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic>+Δ<italic>4</italic> mutant(see Discussion). Thus, a combination of the Kni expression patterns and resulting adult morphological phenotypes provide more informative distinctions between these various mutants than can be ascertained by either measure alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromosomal pairing may play a role in L2-CRM activity</title><p>In addition to phenotypes described above that were consistent with and extended previous observations, we also encountered unexpected results when testing the effect of homozygous <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletions. In contrast to the strong vein-loss phenotypes associated with these deletions in trans to the complete <italic>riAB</italic> deletion described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>), the phenotypes of these lesions were greatly reduced when homozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). This disparity was particularly striking for the homozygous <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion, which generated an almost wild-type phenotype, recognizable only by a subtle meandering or less pigmented L2 vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This very weak phenotype, which was observed in four independently derived <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> mutant strains, is particularly surprising given that a single base pair change within that region associated with the <italic>ri53j</italic> allele leads to a substantial vein loss phenotype when homozygous ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The recovery of these two deletions that produced surprisingly mild homozygous phenotypes suggested the possibility that a pairing-dependent process might contribute to sustaining CRM function. Consistent with this hypothesis, trans-heterozygotes of the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion over the point mutant ri53j allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), - a configuration predicted to disrupt precise alignment of homologous chromosomes - resulted in a pronounced vein-loss phenotype. We tested the pairing hypothesis more directly using the classic chromosomal inversion comparison by placing the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion in-trans to the <italic>ri1</italic> mutant either in the context of a native third chromosome or in a multiply inverted balancer chromosome (<italic>TM3, ri1</italic>) that greatly reduces pairing-dependent phenomena such as transvection (i.e. wherein the CRM on one chromosome acts to promote transcription from the homologous chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis, 1954</xref>]). Consistent with the pairing-based mechanism, the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) was significantly weaker than that observed in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/TM3, ri1</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), an effect that was highly consistent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for comparative L2 vein arrays of these two genotypes). A similar, albeit less dramatic, difference was also observed between the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2/ri1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2/TM3ri1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) phenotypes. Reflective of the adult wing phenotypes, Kni expression in larval wing was only modestly reduced in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), was further reduced in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and virtually undetectable in either <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/TM3ri1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) or <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/riAB</italic> trans-heterozygous discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). As a final test of the CRM-pairing hypothesis we crossed the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> mutants to each other and observed a substantial vein-loss phenotype in the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2/ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> trans-heterozygotes, again consistent with a disruption of local chromosomal pairing of the remaining activating elements. Cumulatively, these data provide evidence for a pairing-dependent interaction between CRM sequences on homologous chromosomes that promotes CRM activity (see Discussion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M–R</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Novel fortuitously generated mutations with unexpected phenotypes</title><p>In addition to recovering strains of flies carrying the targeted deletions mentioned above, we also identified an ample collection of imprecise or fortuitously generated mutations that most likely resulted from DNA repair by the NHEJ or other break-repair pathways responding to single or double cleavage events at various locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For example, a deletion (<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3.35</italic>) that spans sequences removed in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> and includes small indels results in a variable loss of vein phenotype when placed in trans to <italic>riAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) but has a wild-type phenotype when homozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in contrast to the extra vein phenotype manifest by <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Additionally, we recovered mutants which were generated with the use of a single gRNA, gRNA-C, targeting a conserved region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). They included deletions (EV 5–1 and EV 7–1) that have very similar breakpoints but result in differing degrees of vein-loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), and the addition of a single nucleotide at the edge of the ID3 conserved region (EV 9–2) which has a phenotype that varies from wild type to an <italic>ri-</italic>like vein phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In another case (<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1.1)</italic>, a 65 bp sequence that has been copied and inserted upstream causes a mild ectopic vein phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Perhaps not surprisingly, a deletion removing sequences spanning <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1</italic> to a portion of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>4</italic> (<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>1.6</italic>) gives a composite partial vein loss and ectopic vein phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>), while a mutant with a deletion spanning <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic>-Δ<italic>4</italic> plus a 25 bp insertion (<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3.38</italic>) causes an extreme vein-loss phenotype similar to that of <italic>riAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K,L</xref>). Although further analysis of several of these mutants will be necessary to fully understand the basis for associated venation phenotypes, we note two salient features of this mutant class. First, a variety of mutations preferentially affect portions of the L2 vein along the proximo-distal (PD) axis, revealing a previously unappreciated role of the PD patterning system in contributing to L2 morphogenesis. Second, in several cases, apparently minor variations in the positions of chromosomal breakpoints or small indels, result in markedly altered final vein patterns that may reveal important effects of specific sequences or requirements for precise spacing between functional motifs. Our recovery of several mutants with novel unanticipated phenotypes highlights the strength of an <italic>in locus</italic> analysis as all these mutations, even those resulting in very mild phenotypes, were readily identified phenotypically.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Efficient Cas9-dependent germline transmission of an active <italic>riAB</italic> CopyCat element</title><p>We recently demonstrated an active genetic process, which we refer to as the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), to generate both somatic mutations and meiotic gene-drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz and Bier, 2015</xref>). The key feature of this process is the integration of a vector containing a gRNA and a Cas9 transgene at the precise genomic location of the gRNA-directed cleavage site. We also have proposed a split-drive configuration we refer to as CopyCat elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz and Bier, 2016</xref>), in which the Cas9 source is provided in-trans in a standard Mendelian fashion and the CopyCat element carries one gRNA to target insertion of a gene cassette or two gRNAs to simultaneously trigger cassette insertion and deletion of the region in between the two gRNA cleavage sites. CopyCat cloning vectors could, in principle, be used as versatile elements for germline transformation, which once inserted, are passed down to the progeny in a Super-Mendelian fashion (&gt;&gt;50% inheritance) in the presence of a separate Cas9 source that can be later segregated away. This conditional control of Super-Mendelian inheritance can facilitate combinatorial genetic schemes by circumventing constraints imposed by Mendelian inheritance (i.e. random chromosomal segregation and linkage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz and Bier, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We tested the concept of a two gRNA CopyCat element by generating an active <italic>riAB</italic> allele.

Transformant lines carrying this and other similar CopyCat constructs described below were recovered at frequencies similar to those typical of germline transformation using either P-element vectors or the ɸC31 recombinase system, exemplifying how Cas9-mediated site-directed transgenesis can serve as a viable alternative to traditional methods of germline transformation. We combined the <italic>riCC-AB</italic> allele with the previously characterized <italic>y1-MCR</italic> element, which contained a germline-expressed Cas9 gene, a gRNA targeting the <italic>yellow</italic> locus, and homology arms that precisely flank the genomic cleavage site.

The results of nine such crosses carried out in parallel are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, all of which demonstrated a high rate of somatic mutagenesis of the <italic>yellow</italic> locus, indicating the efficient activity of the <italic>y-1MCR</italic> element. In four crosses, the <italic>riCC-AB</italic> allele was copied with 100% efficiency to F2 progeny, in three crosses the efficiency averaged 89%, and in two crosses the element was inherited at Mendelian frequencies. Regardless of the rate of germline transmission noted in these various crosses, the observable L2 truncation frequencies was indicative of somatic activity of the <italic>riCC-AB</italic> CopyCat and Cas9 alleles which were very similar and approximated that observed in their F1 female parent (~70%). We conclude that in this system the <italic>riCC-AB</italic> double-cut CopyCat element typically propagates via the germline with high efficiency and that the somatic and germline activities of the <italic>riCC-AB</italic> element seem to be separable events. This effect is probably due to high levels of Cas9 protein produced by the <italic>vasa</italic> driver in the egg, that can freely diffuse prior to cellularization, causing mutations affecting large regions of the organism, consistent with observations reported by Port et al.

In this study, we illustrate several important advantages of performing <italic>in locus</italic> CRM analysis as an alternative to traditional CRM-reporter constructs. First, altering CRM sequences in their native chromosomal environment can reveal subtle or context-dependent forms of regulation that are lost or obscured when performing analysis of CRM-reporter genes inserted into ectopic chromosomal sites. For example, the novel L2-CRM alleles we generated at the <italic>kni</italic> locus revealed previously unappreciated trans-interactions that may reflect chromosome-pairing-dependent CRM functions, as well as evidence for a proximo-distal patterning input to L2 specification. Second, phenotypic readouts can be far more sensitive discriminators of CRM function than assessments of gene expression as they represent the function of the CRM compounded over time. Third, the combination of reading out endogenous gene expression patterns and their resulting morphological phenotypes can identify distinguishing features of mutants that neither measure alone could resolve. Finally, we demonstrate super-Mendelian inheritance of active genetic elements (e.g. CopyCat vectors) which have the potential to greatly accelerate the assembly of complex genetic stocks thereby facilitating a new era of synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Novel insights into L2-CRM function provided by <italic>in locus</italic> analysis</title><p>The ability to generate targeted deletions and combinations of such lesions while recovering a myriad of imprecise lesions as a byproduct of CRISPR mutagenesis strategies, fundamentally transforms the process by which CRM function can be analyzed. In this study, we highlight three fundamentally new insights and attendant questions into the activity of a CRM that we had thought we already understood quite well.</p><p>(1) Do CRMs on homologous chromosomes cooperate in a pairing-dependent fashion? The vastly different phenotypes of the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion (and to a lesser extent <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> as well) when homozygous versus in-trans to the larger full CRM <italic>riAB</italic> deletion was the first major surprise of this current study. In the case of other previously identified partial CRM loss-of-function mutations such as <italic>ri1</italic> or <italic>ri53j</italic>, the phenotypes of homozygotes are only modestly increased when placed in trans to <italic>riAB</italic> as is typical when a hypermorphic allele is placed over a deletion. The <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> phenotype, however, is nearly wild-type, while that of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/riAB</italic> trans-heterozygotes results in significant vein loss. This type of trans-chromosomal interaction, which we refer to as CRM-synergy, is reminiscent of, the phenomenon of transvection as described originally by Ed Lewis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis, 1954</xref>). In the case of transvection, a regulatory entity (CRM in modern parlance) on one chromosome promotes expression of a trait (activates transcription) on the other chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), and this trans-interaction between the CRM and basal promoter is abrogated by chromosomal inversions that interfere with chromosomal pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to transvection, for CRM-synergy we hypothesize that there are interactions between the two CRMs of different chromosomes that mutually reinforce the abilities of both CRM elements to engage either basal promoter. One possible explanation for CRM-synergy in the case of the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> or <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletions is that two mutually reinforcing CRM sub-complexes could form on sequences present in either region deleted in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> or <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3,</italic> and that these complexes normally act in concert to provide full CRM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Perhaps when either of the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> or <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletions are homozygous, the remaining complexes present on the other remaining submodule can sustain CRM function as long as those elements on the two homologous chromosomes are well paired and can benefit from the trans-CRM interaction. When they are placed over the larger deletion, however, this pairing breaks down since the one remaining submodule can no longer interact productively with its homologous partner. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that the phenotype of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>) is aggravated by interruption of chromosome pairing by the rearranged <italic>TM3, ri1</italic> balancer chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>) and that <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic>/<italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> trans-heterozygotes display a substantial vein-loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>). It is also noteworthy that there is only a modest vein loss phenotype manifested in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> flies despite the fact that the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/riAB</italic> and <italic>ri1/riAB</italic> phenotypes are comparable. This effect may arise from the fact that deleted sequences in <italic>ri1</italic> overlap with those missing in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3.</italic> Consistent with this hypothesis, the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri53j</italic> phenotype is substantially stronger than that of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> despite the fact that the <italic>ri53j/ri53j</italic> phenotype is typically less severe than that of <italic>ri1/ri1</italic>. Since <italic>ri53j</italic> is a point mutant allele that is covered by the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion, alignment of homologous chromosomes in <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri53j</italic> trans-heterozygotes would likely be disrupted as compared to <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> homozygotes that entirely lack the mutated nucleotide in <italic>ri53j</italic> and surrounding sequence. Further analysis will be required to determine the nature of the hypothesized pairing-dependent interaction and to exclude other potential explanations such as 1) the potential creation of novel transcription factor binding sites at the junction points of particular deletions which could then alter vein phenotypes by a neomorphic mechanism or 2) the <italic>ri53j</italic> mutation disrupts binding of an activator that normally acts by overcoming the formation of an inhibitory complex on adjacent sequences that are deleted in the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> mutant (these most obvious alternative explanations, however, do not readily account for the inversion-dependent differences in the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3/ri1</italic> phenotype nor the failure of <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> and <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>2</italic> deletions to complement). Another question that remains to be addressed is why the <italic>ri53j</italic> point mutant allele has a stronger homozygous phenotype than the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletion that covers it. One possibility to explore is that the <italic>ri</italic>Δ<italic>3</italic> deletes both necessary activator sites (e.g. the <italic>ri53j</italic> site) and repressor sites leading to a weaker homozygous phenotype than deletion of just the activator sites.</p><p>(2) Split, cooperative, negative regulatory elements in the L2-CRM. In-locus deletion of sequential regions of the full L2-CRM suggested that two separate regions of the enhancer might contribute to repression of <italic>kni</italic> expression in peripheral regions of the wing primordium. Remarkably, when these two deletions were combined, a highly synergistic ectopic vein phenotype was observed. The ability to assay the effects of these deletions directly on gene function was a key feature of the experiments that reveal this strong cooperative phenotypic interaction. This observation motivates future studies to understand the mechanism by which the separated CRM sequences might interact. Do they assemble similar protein complexes that act in a redundant fashion? Might the two domains bind different transcription factor complexes but loop in some way to compete with activators binding to central regions of the CRM or to block a pairing-dependent form of trans-chromosomal cooperative activation? Another hypothesis to consider is that sequences in the <italic>riΔ1</italic> region include not only sites for repressors, but also for inputs that limit anterior <italic>kni</italic> expression during early prepupal stages. Recall that the double <italic>riΔ1+Δ4</italic> and single <italic>riΔ4</italic> mutants exhibit comparable levels of ectopic Kni expression in larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,L</xref>), but that the zone of strong ectopic Kni expression seems narrowed during pre-pupal stages in <italic>riΔ1+Δ4</italic> relative to <italic>riΔ4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1O,R</xref>). These observations might help explain why the <italic>riΔ+,Δ4</italic> double mutant has a more extreme ectopic vein phenotype than the <italic>riΔ4</italic> single mutant since previous studies have shown that high-level ubiquitous <italic>kni</italic> expression eliminates expression of both vein and intervein markers, possibly via overly exuberant induction of lateral inhibitory processes. According to this seemingly paradoxical hypothesis, the narrower zone of high level Kni expression observed the <italic>riΔ1+Δ4</italic> double mutant may be less subject to vein elimination by such lateral inhibitory influences than the <italic>riΔ4</italic> single mutant with persistent high level broad ectopic Kni expression throughout the anterior domain. Further analysis will be required to test this hypothesis. Also, one puzzle that remains unanswered by the current analysis is how the Spalt locus might negatively regulate CRM function in central regions of the wing as we failed to recover any mutations that induced ectopic veins in this territory. Unfortunately, the DNA-binding sites for Spalt proteins (Salm and Salr), if any, in the L2-CRM, are among the few transcription factors for which a well-defined binding site consensus remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Celis and Ostale, 2017</xref>). Perhaps, the failure to recover mutants in all our different experiments that induce ectopic veins in central regions of the wing reflects an interspersion of Sal repressor sites with activator sequences (e.g. known functionally important Scalloped sites)? Further refined deletion analysis of activator domains should help address this question as well as studies to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> Spalt protein binding sites. Sequence comparisons with the highly diverged L2-CRMs from <italic>M. domestica</italic> and <italic>C. capitata</italic> may prove helpful in this effort, as the exclusion of Kni expression from the central Spalt expression domain suggests that at least the <italic>riCC-M.dom.</italic> CRM retains sensitivity to Spalt-mediated repression, although this effect could be indirect. We note that these new features and models of <italic>kni</italic> regulation derive from a combination of morphological and <italic>in locus</italic> gene expression data that were not revealed previously based solely on analysis of traditional L2-CRM-reporter gene fusion constructs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lunde et al., 2003</xref>]).</p><p>(3) Novel unexpected phenotypes. Approximately half of CRISPR-induced mutations we recovered were the targeted mutations we set out to isolate. The remaining fortuitously generated lesions included imprecise indels at one or both of the targeted cleavage sites or, in some cases, deletions or duplications of short sequences at a distance from the cleavage sites that may reflect an error-prone form of HDR repair based on the presence of micro-homologies (sometimes referred to as micro-homology-mediated end joining or MMEJ). In some cases, these unanticipated mutations generated surprising phenotypes, including L2 deletions biased to proximal or distal regions of the vein, dramatically different phenotypes of deletions resulting from minor differences in endpoints, and in one case the addition of a single base in a non-conserved region of the CRM resulting in a vein-loss phenotype. While the basis for these various unexpected phenotypes remains to be determined, the recovery of a diverse array of ancillary mutations accompanying targeted CRISPR-based mutagenesis offers a potential treasure trove for gaining unbiased insights into CRM function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inter-species CRM replacements using active CopyCat elements</title><p>We previously demonstrated a new CRISPR-based method referred to as the Mutagenic Chain Reaction (MCR) that results in efficient copying of genetic elements to the homologous chromosome during meiosis resulting in strong gene drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz and Bier, 2015</xref>). Similar gene-drive systems have also been shown to transmit efficiently to offspring in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>) and to copy efficiently in diploid yeast where such mutations can be transmitted subsequently during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiCarlo et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these initial studies, we proposed the design of a new type of transgenesis vector that we refer to as CopyCat elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz and Bier, 2016</xref>) that could be copied efficiently to the homologous chromosome during meiosis in a Cas9-dependent fashion thereby bypassing traditional constraints of Mendelian inheritance, such as those associated with independent chromosomal assortment or genetic linkage. CopyCat elements can contain either a single gRNA that cuts at the site of vector insertion into the genome or two gRNAs that generate a self-propagating deletion of sequences lying between the two gRNA cut sites. In this study, we demonstrate that double cut CopyCat cloning vectors function as efficiently as conceived. In addition, CopyCat vectors can be used routinely to recover site directed genomic insertion making them an attractive alternative vehicle for transgenesis. Furthermore, when CopyCat elements are in presence of a Cas9 source, they can be passed on via the germline with super-Mendelian efficiency, a feature which should substantially simplify and shorten otherwise tortuous genetic schemes needed to assemble complex arrays of transgenes. If active genetics systems can also be developed in vertebrate and plant systems, they could revolutionize genetic manipulations in an array of organisms, in which standard Mendelian constraints pose a yet greater impediment than in fruit flies.</p><p>Potential caveats for the transmission of active genetic elements: The high frequency of CopyCat transmission in the experiments presented in this study suggest that this should be a generally applicable method. We noted, however, that in two of the nine crosses, transmission of the element was only Mendelian. The basis for the failure of the active copying process in such instances remains to be further evaluated, however, based on previous analysis of MCR transmission in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz and Bier, 2015</xref>) and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>), the most likely explanation is that NHEJ repair can in some instances intervene between the time of egg fertilization and the partitioning of germ cell lineages, which takes place following seven cell divisions in the blastoderm embryo. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the frequency of such NHEJ events seems to be fairly low as revealed by propagation of the y1-MCR occurring at comparable frequencies via eggs that either are preloaded or not with a source of Cas9 (e.g. eggs from females that carry the MCR element versus eggs from wild-type females fertilized by MCR males). In contrast, in mosquitoes there is a large difference in transmission frequency between these two scenarios (98–99% chromosome conversion via males versus only 12–25% conversion via females - [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>]). The basis for this difference in male/female propagation between the two Dipteran species remains to be determined. However, it may be that for double cut CopyCat elements, which by their nature are more demanding of the HDR repair process than single cut MCRs, that non-HDR events are more frequent. Alternatively, the nuclease targeting of the two gRNA sites may occur asynchronously or the Cas9 enzyme may preferentially bind one gRNA thereby reducing cleavage directed by the second gRNA. In either of these scenarios, if the gRNA-A cuts before the gRNA-B, it could generate an NHEJ event at the location ‘A’ preventing successful HDR-driven chromosomal conversion of the CopyCat element at a subsequent cell cycle, when the gRNA-B has a chance of successfully guiding Cas9 to generate a dsDNA cleavage. Future experiments should resolve this question. Another factor to be kept in mind when using CopyCat elements as a genetic tool is that DNA repair mechanisms involved in copying these elements may be more error prone than standard cellular DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malkova and Haber, 2012</xref>).</p><p>CopyCat CRM-replacement elements should accelerate evo-devo analysis of gene-regulatory networks: We also present proof-of-principle experiments showing that CopyCat elements can also carry gene sequences of interest that replace those deleted in a single genetic event. Such CopyCat elements should greatly facilitate the assembly of multiplex replacements to help identify genetic sequences from divergent species that underlie the morphological diversification. Indeed, we were surprised that replacement of just the <italic>kni</italic> L2-CRM with candidate homologous regulatory sequences from the housefly or Medfly led to pronounced anterior shifts of the L2 vein typical of vein placement in those donor species, suggesting that alterations in this single down-stream regulatory element are capable of mediating significant morphological changes. The nature of the salient changes in the L2-CRM remain to be investigated. Candidates for negative regulators in peripheral regions of the wing primordium that may contribute to these anterior vein shifts include the repressors Brinker and Optix/Six3 which have been implicated as part of a cross-inhibitory network involved in L2 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Khatib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, knock-down of Optix function in anterior regions of the wing results in large anterior shifts of the L2 vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Khatib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín et al., 2017</xref>), although this phenotype results at least in part from decreased proliferation of cells in the anterior domain where Optix is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martín et al., 2017</xref>). It also will be of significant interest to compare such changes that have occurred in different lineages that have yielded similar alterations in vein positions. For example, will similar or different sequences be identified as the key substrates for the anterior vein shifts we observe in <italic>M. domestica</italic> versus <italic>C. capitata</italic>? Sequencing and selective functional testing of additional species may provide estimates for how often such alternative evolutionary trajectories are taken. Also, how many CRMs of genes acting in the wing gene regulatory network would need to be replaced to transform the <italic>D. mel.</italic> wing into one resembling a housefly or Medfly? CopyCat-mediated CRM replacements should greatly enable studies to answer these and other frontier questions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The impact of genome editing approaches on cis-regulation studies</title><p>The studies presented here highlight the phenomenal impact of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing and active genetics in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and by extension, most likely in many other organisms. These methods that efficiently generate targeted mutations, as well as a mix of fortuitous mutations in regulatory regions, provide unprecedented genetic leverage in dissecting non-coding DNA functionality. For example, as described above, <italic>in locus</italic> analysis of CRM function based on a combination of readout of endogenous gene expression at different developmental stages and on final morphological phenotype, revealed features of <italic>kni</italic> regulation that were not evident from previous CRM-gene-fusion studies. These new insights include: proposed chromosome pairing dependent CRM interactions, identification and analysis of complex cooperative interactions between CRM sub-domains, isolation of novel CRM mutations with unexpected phenotypes, and subtle phenotypic analysis of divergent CRM function during evolution. In addition, the comparable efficiency of CRISPR-based HDR-mediated transgenesis to that of traditional methods offers the possibility of delivering genetic cargo of interest to any desired chromosomal location. It should also be possible to develop genome-spanning collections of active CopyCat elements capable of delivering transgenic elements to a broad array of chromosomal insertion sites in a variety of sexually reproducing organisms as alternatives to Mendelian recombination-based systems. Multiple CopyCat elements could then be rapidly combined in the presence of an unlinked source of Cas9. Manipulations of this kind should significantly facilitate the import of entire gene regulatory networks from one organism into another to address important questions in evolution and promote the goals of principle-directed synthetic biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody (guinea pig)</td><td>guinea pig anti-knirps</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunde et al.

Crosses giving the expected deletion band were kept and individual F1 progeny from those crosses were crossed again to the riAB deletion and re-tested. F2 flies again testing positive were then crossed to a TM3 balancer stock, and flies lacking an overt L2 phenotype (i.e. the non-AB/TM3 flies) were crossed to each other to establish a stock. Stocks homozygous for the desired deletion were then selected based on the absence of the TM3 balancer.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Yoshinori Tomoyasu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscripts, the authors present a detailed analysis of a regulatory element that regulates knirps expression in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and ultimately controls the formation of the L2 wing vein of the adult. The paper makes use of both CRISPR/Cas9 for mutagenesis of the element as well as for the replacement of the enhancer with sequences from other fly species using so-called CopyCat vectors. From a technical viewpoint, the paper is an important contribution in establishing very efficient and accurate methods for swapping in new regulatory elements within a gene, and this approach holds great promise for the entire evo-devo field. On top of this technical advance, the paper presents several new and important findings using these methods. First, the work better defines the sequences important to the function of the cis-regulatory module by generating a wide variety of new mutant alleles. Second, the authors show evidence for a pairing-dependent process that governs the activity of this regulatory module. Third, the authors achieve a clean swap of the normal <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CRM with the CRM from three other fly species, which leads to changes in the L2 vein that mimics the phenotypes seen in the other fly species. Clearly, there is quite a bit more detailed analysis that could be done in the future, and the paper lays the groundwork for what will be an excellent system for future analyses of cis-regulatory function and evolution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers have agreed that the paper is more appropriate as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paper. While there are some clear biological insights, these are not followed up in sufficient detail to lead to a major advance. However, the technical aspects will be useful to others, and the work generated here will almost certainly allow these authors and others to advance this particular system and possibly create significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the mechanism at work to set the position of the L2 vein and how it has evolved. The authors should revise the paper with this in mind.</p><p>2) The authors should provide some quantitation on the shift of the position and length of the L2 vein after the enhancer swaps (from other Dipteran species). In particular, the authors should quantify the shift in L2 position seen with the <italic>M. domestica</italic> CRM (distance of shift after normalizing for variation in wing size) and shortening of L2 seen with the C. capitata CRM (length of L2 relative to total wing length).</p><p>3) The authors should provide some data on the expression of <italic>kni</italic> and <italic>salm</italic> in the wing disks of <italic>M. domestica</italic> and <italic>C. capitata</italic> to assess if indeed the pattern of these genes suggests general similarities in the mechanisms of vein placement, and to assess if the pattern seen when the respective CRMs are placed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is reflective of the normal pattern of expression for kni in the source species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30281.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers have agreed that the paper is more appropriate as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; paper.

With regard to the <italic>C. capitata</italic> replacement, we have measured the length of the rescued L2 vein segment normalized by the length the intact L3 vein.

These results confirm that these two genes are expressed in a similar pattern in <italic>C. capitata</italic> and <italic>D. mel.</italic> In consultation with the editors, it was decided, in order to avoid a significant potential publication delay, that it would not be necessary to provide comparable data from <italic>M. domestica</italic> given that: 1) the <italic>M. dom.</italic> replacement expresses <italic>kni</italic> in a stripe abutting the <italic>salm</italic> domain in <italic>D. mel.</italic>; and 2) because <italic>kni</italic> is expressed in a similar pattern relative to <italic>spalt</italic> in a yet more diverged fly species (<italic>MegaseliaMegaselia abdita</italic>) as well as in <italic>C. capitata</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
