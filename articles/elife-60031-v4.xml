perception has almost exclusively shown that becoming aware of a stimulus leads to increased neural responses. By designing a novel form of perceptual filling-in (PFI) overlaid with a dynamic texture display, we frequency-tagged multiple disappearing targets as well as their surroundings. We show that in a PFI paradigm, the disappearance of a stimulus and subjective invisibility is associated with increases in neural activity, as measured with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), in electroencephalography (EEG). We also find that this increase correlates with alpha-band activity, a well-established neural measure of attention. These findings cast doubt on the direct relationship previously reported between the strength of neural activity and conscious perception, at least when measured with current tools, such as the SSVEP. Instead, we conclude that SSVEP strength more closely measures changes in attention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perception</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>perceptual filling-in</kwd><kwd>SSVEP</kwd><kwd>frequency-tagging</kwd><kwd>consciousness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT120100619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuchiya</surname><given-names>Naotsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP130100194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsuchiya</surname><given-names>Naotsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The strength of frequency-tagged neural activity during perceptual filling anti-correlates with the contents of consciousness, yet positively correlates with a neural measure of attention, dissociating these often confounded brain processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central question in cognitive neuroscience is asking what the neural correlates or constituents of consciousness may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klink et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Miller, 2007</xref>). Recent empirical research suggests that various psychological processes, such as cognitive access, expectation, and the act of report, may confound our interpretation of these correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aru et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frässle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tsuchiya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">van Boxtel and Tsuchiya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">van Boxtel et al., 2010a</xref>). Among them, one of the most hotly debated is task-relevant attention and its relation to visual phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Block, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kouider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lamme, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lau and Rosenthal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Posner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2016</xref>). Are attention and visual experience always tightly intertwined, or can they be disentangled? Despite accumulating behavioral evidence in favor of the latter, it remains unclear whether the neural mechanisms of attention and visual awareness are distinct. Notwithstanding new methodological developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Maier and Tsuchiya, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Smout and Mattingley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Webb et al., 2016</xref>), there is still an unmet empirical need for experimental paradigms which can address this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pitts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Tallon-Baudry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">van Boxtel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">van Boxtel and Tsuchiya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">van Boxtel et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Perceptual filling-in (PFI) is one candidate paradigm that can potentially dissociate attention from consciousness. During PFI, a distinct region of the visual periphery disappears and becomes interpolated by the surrounding image background. PFI is a relatively underexplored class of multistable phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kim and Blake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sterzer et al., 2009</xref>), but it has distinct advantages over its predecessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Komatsu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Weil and Rees, 2011</xref>). For example, compared to more widely studied forms of multistable stimuli that require inter-ocular suppression, PFI occurs regularly in normal vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Anstis and Greenlee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">De Weerd, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Durgin et al., 1995</xref>), as in the visual areas that are occluded by the blindspot, and the blood vessels in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Komatsu, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the behavioral and neuronal study of consciousness and attention, PFI has an unusual and potentially very revealing property: directing attention toward targets in the visual periphery <italic>facilitates</italic> perceptual disappearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Weerd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lou, 1999</xref>). This perceptual property is rare, but not unique to PFI. It has been observed in research on afterimages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">van Boxtel et al., 2010b</xref>), motion aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Murd and Bachmann, 2011</xref>), and motion induced-blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Geng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schölvinck and Rees, 2009</xref>). Outside the literature in perception, attention can also harm performance in tasks that involve memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Voss and Paller, 2009</xref>) and skilled motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beilock et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Logan and Crump, 2009</xref>). However, PFI, together with motion induced-blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Geng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schölvinck and Rees, 2009</xref>), is arguably the most versatile tool amongst these phenomena, particularly as the use of multiple disappearing targets can enable a graded measure of visual phenomenology to be recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). Since PFI can dissociate attention and consciousness at the perceptual level, in strictly behavioral paradigms, it has been proposed as a highly promising paradigm to dissociate the neural correlates of attention and consciousness as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2016</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that PFI indeed dissociates neural measures which normally positively correlate with both attention to, and the conscious perception of, visual stimuli.</p><p>As neural measures of stimulus disappearance and reappearance during PFI, we focus on steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs). SSVEPs are periodic large-scale cortical responses to rhythmic visual stimuli, ‘frequency-tagging’ a neural population specific to each flickering stimulus for subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tononi et al., 1998</xref>). SSVEPs have a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and as a result have been widely adopted in the basic visual, cognitive, and clinical neurosciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, SSVEPs have been extensively used as the neural correlates of visual consciousness, predominantly when combined with binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown and Norcia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cobb et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lansing, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tononi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). During binocular rivalry, dissimilar monocular images presented to each eye compete for perceptual dominance, with conscious awareness typically fluctuating spontaneously between each image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alais, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alais and Blake, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Levelt, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Maier et al., 2012</xref>). When two flickering stimuli compete during rivalry, the relative strength of frequency-tagged activity positively correlates with behavioral reports of the dominant image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown and Norcia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cosmelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jamison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kamphuisen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lansing, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lawwill and Biersdorf, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Roy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Srinivasan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sutoyo and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tononi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In a largely separate and parallel body of literature, SSVEPs have also been employed as a measure of selective attention, which increases the strength of SSVEP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Morgan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Müller et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Müller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Müller and Hillyard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Müller and Hübner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Walter et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, an increase in SSVEP strength when stimuli are attended also occurs when flickering items are presented simultaneously in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Müller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In their recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Smout and Mattingley, 2018</xref>, further demonstrated the potential of the SSVEP to dissociate the neural effects of attention from consciousness. Specifically, although their participants were unaware of an SSVEP-inducing stimulus embedded in noise, allocating spatial attention to the side of the invisible stimulus enhanced the strength of the SSVEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Smout and Mattingley, 2018</xref>). This result extended previous behavioral and neural studies showing that processing related to an invisible stimulus can be enhanced by attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">van Boxtel et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advantages, SSVEPs have never been applied to experimental paradigms where the effects of conscious visibility and focus of attention on neuronal activity are expected to diverge. Here, we employed a PFI paradigm to directly induce such a situation, as the probability of a stimulus disappearing (i.e. being filled-in) increases, rather than decreases, with attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Weerd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lou, 1999</xref>). We employed a multi-target, multi-response paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>), in which all disappearing targets were matched in color, form, and temporal flicker, and tasked participants to covertly monitor all targets for instances of PFI. Thus, the neuronal effects of consciousness and attention are expected to be in opposition in this paradigm, if attention to the targets facilitates their disappearance.</p><p>Importantly, we developed a novel method that allowed us to capture neural markers of attention and/or consciousness during PFI, that separately frequency-tagged targets and their visual surrounds. We achieved this by building upon previous work that has facilitated PFI by making the surrounding regions dynamic, such as when updated with visual noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Weerd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Weerd et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ramachandran and Gregory, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Spillmann and Kurtenbach, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Weil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Weil et al., 2008</xref>). Our critical manipulations were to calibrate the dynamic noise texture to evoke an SSVEP and to extend this texture over our enlarged target regions. While target size normally impedes perceptual disappearances during PFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Weerd et al., 1998</xref>), we included a pre-experiment calibration session to ensure frequent occurrences of large parafoveal PFI for each participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task design.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Four peripheral targets, defined by their blue-color, circular shape, and temporal flicker, were superimposed over a dynamic texture to induce perceptual filling-in (PFI).

In this model, a primary stage of seconds-long adaptation occurs in neural populations that are sensitive to the boundary between a target and background region. This stage interacts with an interpolation of the surrounding visual features into the target region, likely achieved via the lateral spread of neural activity through horizontal connections between pyramidal cells (for review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Spillmann and De Weerd, 2003</xref>). Evidence for this account has primarily been drawn from careful psychophysical manipulations which vary the strength of boundary representations and speed of adaptation within filling-in paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Weerd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Paradiso and Nakayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ramachandran and Gregory, 1991</xref>), as well as single unit recordings in the receptive fields of filled-in regions in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Weerd et al., 1995</xref>). In the latter, De Weerd et al., first established the average time to experience filling-in when viewing a gray square region on a dynamic texture using four human subjects. Then, using the same apparatus, monkey single-unit responses were shown to increase after several seconds to match the spike rate measured within the same receptive field when viewing only the homogenous texture. As the timing of this climbing activity corresponded to the average timing of filling-in reported in humans, this has been interpreted in support of an active and early retinotopic filling-in mechanism. The correspondence remains suggestive, however, because these previous studies did not establish a tight correlation between neural activity and perceptual reports through trial-by-trial fluctuations or inter-individual variance.</p><p>By uniquely frequency-tagging both the target and surrounds, our paradigm is able to provide new evidence in support of an interaction between the target and background regions, time-locked to behavioral reports in human participants, whose neural activity and perceptual reports were obtained simultaneously. Previous work has analyzed SSVEPs evoked only by a single target during PFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Weil et al., 2007</xref>), or only by the surrounding background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>), leaving the precise sequence of these neural activations unclear.</p><p>Here, we are able to investigate this sequence, and as a consequence of having both target and surround tagging frequencies, look at interactions between the stimulus representations. Due to nonlinearities in visual processing, the interactions between simultaneously presented flickering stimuli produce nonlinearities in the frequency domain of EEG spectra, known as intermodulation (IM) components (e.g. f2-f1; for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gordon et al., 2019</xref>). These IM components have been proposed to index interactions between stimulus representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Boremanse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gundlach and Müller, 2013</xref>), which peak prior to a perceptual change during binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>), and which increase when stimuli are attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kim and Verghese, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, we tested whether the relative timing differences in target, surround, or IM-SNR could reveal insights into the temporal relationship between the target and surround representations during PFI.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows, after overlaying the SNR time courses for perceptual disappearance and reappearance, the latency of significant changes to target (f1) and surround (f2) SNR differed substantially. Specifically, changes to surround-SNR preceded changes to target-SNR by approximately 200 ms (one time-step in our moving window spectrogram analysis). We also observed that the magnitude of IM-SNR transiently peaked prior to a perceptual disappearance, although the overall strength of the IM component was substantially weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we proceeded by analyzing the relative timing of these differences in SNR at f1, f2, and IM, by retaining the first significant time-point in a temporally contiguous cluster (see Materials and methods). In order to estimate the reliability of these timing differences, we performed a non-parametric jackknife resampling procedure, repeating our analysis in a leave-one-out process. The median, jackknifed estimates replicated the pattern observed in our group-level data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). During PFI, the median first significant time-point for f2 (median = −1.22 s, <italic>SD</italic> = −0.02) preceded f1 (median<italic> =</italic> −0.43 s; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.26 s). Importantly, for every jackknifed subsample, changes in f2 always preceded f1, and the difference between these distributions was significant (paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 9.36, p=1.94 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, z = 3.52, p=4.38 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). The timing of changes in IM-SNR was not as statistically reliable. No significant cluster was retained on 43% of our jackknifed subsamples, which we attribute to the reduced strength of IM-SNR. Notably, however, and despite this reduced strength, changes in IM SNR occurred between the times observed for the fundamental frequencies (median<italic> =</italic> −0.83 s, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.09).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Jackknifed latency estimates of SNR timing differences during PFI and PMD.</title><p>First significant time-points (see Materials and methods) in surround-specific SNR (f2; black), target-specific SNR (f1; blue), and the intermodulation component (IM; pink).

We asked participants to report on the disappearance of multiple visual stimuli and revealed that the SSVEP strength of disappearing targets <italic>increases</italic> as they become invisible. Based on alpha-band activity, we propose that SSVEPs are highly unlikely to be a precise measure of the conscious perception of a tagged object, as has previously been assumed. Instead, we propose that SSVEPs in this paradigm are more likely to measure neural processes related to attentional enhancement and suppression. We discuss alternative interpretations below, and these results in the context of existing literature distinguishing visual attention and conscious perception, the insights gained regarding neural mechanisms of PFI, and relevance to theories of consciousness.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visual attention and conscious perception</title><p>The nature of the relationship between attention and consciousness is one of the most hotly debated and empirically examined topics in consciousness research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dehaene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">van Boxtel and Tsuchiya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">van Boxtel et al., 2010a</xref>). As reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Maier and Tsuchiya, 2020</xref>), increasing psychological and neuroscientific evidence suggests that attention and consciousness are not supported by the same mechanisms (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Norman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2009</xref>). Among this accumulating evidence, counterintuitive findings that attention can actually decrease visual awareness in certain situations provide the most direct psychological evidence to argue for the dissociation between attention and consciousness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ling and Carrasco, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lou, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mehrpour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">van Boxtel et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yeshurun and Carrasco, 1998</xref>). Along with other perceptual phenomena, PFI is among the most promising paradigms to examine these opposing effects of attention and consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Maier and Tsuchiya, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Tsuchiya and Koch, 2016</xref>). Building on this prior research, our paper is the first to demonstrate a neural correlate of such counterintuitive and opposing effects of attention and consciousness.</p><p>We examined the neural mechanisms underlying PFI, focusing on the SSVEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>). The SSVEP technique is a highly versatile tool, allowing researchers to frequency-tag various psychological processes, such as spatial and feature-based attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Morgan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Müller et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Müller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Müller and Hillyard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Müller and Hübner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Walter et al., 2012</xref>) as well the conscious perception of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown and Norcia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lansing, 1964</xref>). As we and others have previously pointed out, however, perceptual paradigms that manipulate conscious perception tend to confound the effects of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aru et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Koch and Tsuchiya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">van Boxtel and Tsuchiya, 2015</xref>). Thus, previous uses of the SSVEP technique might have reflected the neural correlates of any or a combination of these factors.</p><p>More specifically, when used together with binocular rivalry, SSVEP strength has typically been interpreted as a neural correlate of conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown and Norcia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cosmelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jamison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kamphuisen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lansing, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lawwill and Biersdorf, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Roy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Srinivasan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sutoyo and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tononi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). In one notable study, a reduction in SSVEP strength was interpreted to indicate the cessation of binocular rivalry entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). In their study, Zhang and colleagues obtained this result after withdrawing attention from rivalry stimuli and concluded that ‘binocular rivalry requires visual attention’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brascamp and Blake, 2012</xref> for behavioral evidence for this claim).</p><p>Another viable, and potentially simpler explanation, is that SSVEP strength instead reflects attention, which is typically positively correlated with conscious perception. By opposing the effects of attention and conscious perception, and demonstrating that the strength of target SSVEPs do not capture visual phenomenology, our current results are in line with this more parsimonious interpretation.</p><p>Importantly, our interpretation that SSVEPs reflect attention but not consciousness is supported by indirect, yet convergent evidence. First, psychophysical studies of PFI have established that increased attention to targets, which share colors or forms facilitates their disappearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Weerd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lou, 1999</xref>). We capitalized on this result by designing targets which shared color, form, and temporal flicker, and replicate that these targets disappear together more frequently than by chance, strongly suggesting an interhemispheric facilitatory grouping mechanism. Second, an event-related suppression of alpha-band activity is consistent with spontaneous increases in attention around the time of PFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Moreover, the same pattern was not observed for PMD periods, which placed equivalent demands as PFI on reported-related motor selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">van Ede et al., 2019</xref>), and somatosensory spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anderson and Ding, 2011</xref>), suggesting this alpha-band suppression was not related to the mu rhythm. Third, across participants, the magnitude of target-SNR increase correlated with the depth of alpha suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), but only during PFI periods. Fourth, our IM results (at f2-f1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), also indicate a transient increase around the time of PFI disappearance, which peaked between the enhancement of the surround (f2) and target (f1) SNR. Previous work has shown that IM-SNR is strongly dependent upon attentional selection of multiple objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gordon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), which is consistent with attention to the target and surrounds in our PFI paradigm. The same pattern was not observed during PMD, where target-SNR decreased prior to button press, and was followed by changes to the surround and IM-SNR, <italic>after</italic> button press. This delayed modulation of the IM signal compared to PFI periods can be understood by observing that IM during PMD is relatively constant during disappearances, but IM-SNR increases after targets are physically returned to the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Jointly, these four distinct and convergent lines of evidence argue against other alternative explanations. Other interpretations, such as SSVEP changes due to an increase in global arousal, or vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Silberstein et al., 1990</xref>), generally occur over tens of seconds, and so seem unlikely to account for the transient and temporally ordered SNR changes we report. Further, these and other alternate accounts, such as motor preparation and somatosensory attention, cannot easily explain why both the target and surround-SNR also decrease when targets reappear during PFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as reporting on disappearance and reappearance seem to require similar levels of global arousal and motor preparation. To explain these target-specific, directionally-specific, and temporally ordered effects, we believe that it is most parsimonious to invoke an explanation that involves a known interplay between attention and PFI, and a transient enhancement of SSVEP responses due to attention, although in the case of PFI, the effect of attentional enhancement is to paradoxically increase the strength of an invisible signal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neural mechanisms of PFI</title><p>Existing theories propose that a combination of activity in the retinotopic visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Weerd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Weerd et al., 1995</xref>), and higher-level association areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dennett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Weerd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kingdom and Moulden, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Pessoa et al., 1998</xref>) initiate and maintain periods of invisibility during PFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Weil and Rees, 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that an increase in surround-SNR precedes an increase in target-SNR by approximately 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that the temporal order of these activations is consistent across participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, the timing of significant changes to the intermodulation (IM) component falls between those for the surround- and target-SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The same pattern was not replicated for PMD periods, as first the target, then surround, and finally IM-SNR were significantly modulated.</p><p>Broadly speaking, IM components have been interpreted as an index of the non-linear integration of neural signals, and the existence of neural interactions between sensory stimulus representations (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gordon et al., 2019</xref>). For example, changes in IM strength have previously been observed when two visual stimuli compete for perceptual dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sutoyo and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), and to peak prior to a change in conscious percept during binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katyal et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, we view the existence and temporal order of IM activations to reveal an important piece of evidence with respect to the neural mechanisms of PFI in human participants. This temporal ordering effect seems difficult to reconcile with a model of PFI, which claims that interactions between stimulus representations are unnecessary to account for the phenomenology of filling-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dennett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Weerd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kingdom and Moulden, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Pessoa et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>However, elements of our stimulus design also challenge features of the low-level model. Notably, one key component of low-level accounts is that disappearance is preceded by an adaptation of neurons sensitive to the border between a target and surround. For example, when an achromatic target with a more clearly defined border is filled-in, neural correlates in human V1 and V2 have been identified with fMRI, and BOLD responses reduce in target-sensitive regions in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Mendola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Weil et al., 2008</xref>). In our display, target borders were continuously changed due to the dynamic texture that was shared by targets and surrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). As a consequence, boundary adaptation may be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Spillmann and Kurtenbach, 1992</xref>), and it remains possible that neurons higher in the visual hierarchy with a sensitivity to color (such as in V4) are the neural correlates of PFI in our paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Theories of consciousness and visual phenomenology</title><p>At first sight, our finding of neural activity which increases in magnitude when a target stimulus becomes invisible, appears incompatible with various theories of consciousness. For example, first-order theories of conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Mehta and Mashour, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zeki, 2007</xref>) propose that the strength of activity within content-specific visual processing areas determines the vividness of that visual experience. Similarly, the global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dehaene and Naccache, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>) also considers stronger neural activation as a prerequisite to entry within the global neuronal workspace and subsequent conscious access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">van Vugt et al., 2018</xref>). Insofar as the strength of target SSVEP signals when measured with EEG may reflect the strength of target-specific spike activity in the sensory cortex, our finding does challenge such theories that propose response strength is positively correlated with the vividness of conscious experience. Currently, however, the exact mechanisms of SSVEP generation are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawashima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Notbohm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rager and Singer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Salelkar and Ray, 2020</xref>), and future studies will be necessary to clarify their input.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge the precedent in the literature of a negative correlation between the magnitude of neural spiking and visibility. Prominent examples include single neuron spike-rates recorded during binocular rivalry (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Logothetis, 1998</xref>). In these studies, each neuron’s receptive field and preferred stimuli was carefully mapped before a binocular rivalry session in macaques. During recording, 22% of the recorded neurons in V4 and MT were responsive during rivalry. Of these neurons, half showed enhanced firing rates when the preferred stimulus was dominant, while the other half showed enhanced firing rates when their preferred stimulus was <italic>suppressed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Logothetis, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Logothetis and Schall, 1989b</xref>). These neurons in anti-correlation with the animals' perception counter the notion that the strength of activity early in the sensory cortex determines the contents of conscious perception.</p><p>Meanwhile, there exists another family of theories that propose that certain types of causal interactions underlie conscious phenomenology, such as recurrent processing theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lamme, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lamme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000</xref>) and integrated information theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Haun and Tononi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Tononi, 2004</xref>). For these theories, it is not the strength, but the patterns of neuronal connectivity and their states that determine phenomenology as a whole. To test these theories, consciousness research may need to move away from simple detection or discrimination paradigms, where the visibility of an isolated object is measured against a uniform background. Instead, enriching the sensory input with multiple features and a meaningful background could provide empiricists with a richer repertoire to investigate the interplay of neurons in the visual cortex, and, for example, to investigate how the spatial structure of vision arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Haun and Tononi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Koenderink et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, by introducing a dynamic texture tagging display, we have taken a first step toward characterizing the interactions between various visual features based on the strength of SSVEP signals. To tease apart the neural correlates of conscious phenomenology from those of attention and reports, future work may be able to test whether SSVEPs during PFI at attended/unattended locations replicates the pattern which we have described, using innovative no-report methods to time-lock event-related PFI at unattended locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tsuchiya et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>We show increased neural responses to the disappearance of stimuli, which challenges long-held beliefs regarding a positive correlation between the strength of SSVEPs and visual phenomenology. From indirect, yet convergent evidence, we conclude that SSVEP strength in our paradigm is more parsimoniously explained to reflect a neural correlate of attention. This demonstrates the need to carefully re-examine previous uses of the SSVEP as a neural correlate of consciousness, and positions the dynamic texture tagging technique as a promising method to deepen our understanding of SSVEP mechanisms, and open new lines of empirical enquiry in consciousness research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen healthy adults (12 females, 19–40 years, <italic>M</italic> = 26.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.63) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in this study.

Targets were initially centred close to fixation (4.3° visual angle in eccentricity measured from the fixation dot to the center of the target). Participants were instructed to fixate the central dot and were asked to report on PFI at the parafovea. If participants reported PFI, they were then asked to describe their experience more explicitly. Depending on their subjective reports, we adjusted the eccentricity of the targets along the diagonal (from 4.3 to 8.7°, in steps of 0.4°) so that their perceptual experience was described as ‘appearing and disappearing often, for a few seconds at a time’. All participants reported that PFI occurred.</p><p>Concurrently with these manipulations, the power spectrum as well as log(SNR) spectrum at POz were displayed in real time.

To mimic the frequency of genuine PFI, PMD did not occur in the first 10 s of each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schieting and Spillmann, 1987</xref>). The order of all PMD periods were randomized for each participant, as were the location of removed targets in the case of one, two, and three targets. These physical disappearance periods enabled us to monitor how well participants were able to report on the visibility of four simultaneously presented targets, and additionally served as a control condition for comparison with the neural signals evoked by genuine PFI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Participant and trial exclusion based on PMD periods</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that the use of PMD periods can identify participants who are unable to report on four simultaneous targets, as well as experimental trials which are unsuited for further analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, whether a participant accurately reported the PMD period on time (via button press) was used to estimate that participant’s engagement with the task.</p><p>Unlike our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>), we tailored our stimulus so that PFI happens very often across all participants. Thus, it was often the case that the physical removal of a target (PMD onset) occurred for targets which have already disappeared from consciousness due to genuine PFI. Such occurrences were more frequent for those participants experiencing greater amounts of PFI. To obtain accurate estimates of how accurately and quickly participants responded to the physical removal of a target we estimated the baseline button-press likelihood per individual participant, by performing a bootstrapping analysis (with replacement). To perform this bootstrap, for any PMD onset in trial T at time S (seconds), we randomly selected a trial T’ (T = T’ was allowed) and we epoched [S-2, S+4] button press data at corresponding PMD target locations in T’.</p><p>We repeated this for all available trials (T = 1...48) to obtain a single bootstrapped set of 48 trials per participant. This procedure was repeated 1000 times, and the mean button press time-course for each 48-trial set was retained as the null-distribution of button-press likelihood, over time, per participant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> (gray) shows the bootstrapped likelihood of button press for a single participant. We then used the null distribution z-scores of ±1.96 as the 95% CI for each participant (after first converting the data using the logit transformation due to a violation of normality). We defined the reaction time to PMD-onset as the first time point after which each participant’s median button-press data exceeded the top CI of their null-distribution likelihood. We excluded participants (<italic>n</italic> = 3, See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with no PMD-onset reaction time in the first 2 s (i.e. [0, S+2]). We note that for two of these participants, it appeared that buttons were consistently released at PMD-onset – potentially indicating buttons were released during PFI rather than pressed as per instructions. For the remaining participants, the mean reaction time to respond to PMD onsets, and thus the disappearance of a peripheral target was 0.68 s (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.31).</p><p>Having identified which participants could successfully indicate target disappearance based on their button press data (<italic>N</italic> = 16), we continued to remove any trials in which a PMD was not correctly detected from subsequent analysis. This ensured that throughout each trial, participants were accurately reporting on PFI, and that all retained data was on task. To identify individual trials for exclusion, we regarded a PMD period as failed if the corresponding button was not pressed for at least 50% of the allowed response time window. This window was the duration of the PMD (3.5 to 5 s). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref> shows a histogram of the number of rejected trials per participant (overall, only 16 trials were rejected) across 16 retained participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Simultaneous PFI and location-shuffling analysis</title><p>To examine whether an increasing number of filled in targets (nPFI; <italic>n</italic> = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) affected PFI characteristics, we performed a shuffling analysis to create a null distribution that removed the temporal correlation between targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). This analysis tests whether simultaneous PFI occurs more often that can be expected by chance. Specifically, we created 1000 shuffled trials per participant, that could contain the button-press data for each location from any trial throughout their experimental session (e.g. one shuffled trial could consist of top left button press time course from trial 10, top right from trial 43, bottom left from trial 12, bottom right from trial 2). We selected a random trial for each location, allowing multiple locations from one trial to be included to form one shuffled trial (i.e. bootstrap with repetition). This shuffling procedure conserves the total amount of PFI recorded, while ensuring that the button-press data at a given location could come from any independent trial. If target disappearances during PFI were independent, then destroying the temporal correlation in shuffled data should not matter, and shuffled and experimental data would look similar. We repeated our behavioral analysis (as detailed above) on this shuffled data, with the results displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We also performed quadratic model-fit analyses to compare the magnitude and direction of the fitted coefficients for observed and shuffled data. For this analysis, we retained the coefficient (β; 2nd order polynomial) from the fit to our observed data as our observed statistic. We also fit the same quadratic model to each of the shuffled data sets (<italic>n</italic> = 1000) and used these coefficient values as a null distribution to compare with the observed β. If the observed β exceeded the top 95% of the null distribution, we regarded the quadratic fit for the observed data as significant at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>EEG preprocessing</title><p>After data collection, noisy channels were identified using a modified version of the PREP pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2015</xref>). We omitted the bad-by-RANSAC criterion that identifies correlated channel groups which deviated from other channels. This was necessary as frequency-tagging elicits responses in localized, often highly correlated channel clusters. Bad channels were then spherically interpolated (channels rejected per participant <italic>M</italic> = 5.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.62). After channel rejection and interpolation, whole-trial EEG data were re-referenced to the average of all electrodes, and linearly detrended before being downsampled to 250 Hz. We then applied a Laplacian transform to improve the spatial selectivity of our data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the whole trial spectrum from electrode POz, as well as topographical distribution of frequency-tagged components.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>SSVEP analysis via rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS)</title><p>SSVEP topography can vary based on individual participant anatomy, the entrained neural network, which depends on tasks and stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ding et al., 2006</xref>), as well as based on the frequency of flicker selected (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As such, we applied a spatiotemporal filter called rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), to reduce the distributed topographical response at SSVEP frequencies to a single component time-series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Gulbinaite, 2017</xref>). The RESS single component is a weighted average of all channels, which can be analyzed in the time-frequency domain instead of relying upon the selection of a single or multiple channels based on post-hoc data inspection.</p><p>Specifically, RESS works by creating linear spatial filters tailored to maximally differentiate the covariance between a signal flicker frequency and neighborhood frequencies, thereby increasing the SNR at the flicker frequency. We constructed RESS spatial filters from 64-channel EEG, by applying a narrow-band Gaussian (full-width at half maximum = 0.5 Hz) filter to the original EEG data in the frequency-domain, centered at the target, surround and IM frequency, respectively (and independently). As the frequency-neighborhood across different signals would contain different amounts of simultaneous flicker, we proceeded by selecting broadband neural activity to construct reference covariance matrices. Comparing signal to broadband activity has previously been shown to allow the reconstruction of SSVEP signals using RESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Gulbinaite, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, RESS spatial filters were constructed per participant per frequency of interest (target, surround, and IM). We used epoched data from all time-windows −3000 to −100 ms and 100 ms to 3000 ms around button press/release, avoiding PMD periods. We avoided the 200 ms around button press/release to optimize RESS filters in the absence of motor-evoked activity. Each filter was fitted without distinguishing whether targets were disappearing or reappearing due to button press or release, in order to reduce the possibility of overfitting these condition comparisons. After application of the RESS spatial filters, we reconstructed the time course of SSVEP log(SNR) from the RESS component time-series as described below. With RESS, we were able to focus our analysis on a single component time-series per frequency of interest, without arbitrarily selecting a single channel or averaging channels, eliminating the need for corrections for multiple comparisons across channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>SSVEP SNR calculation</title><p>In the SSVEP paradigm, we compute the SNR at each frequency, which in logarithmic scale corresponds to log of the power at each frequency minus the mean log power across the neighborhood frequencies. Throughout this paper, the neighborhood used in SNR calculation always excludes the frequency half-bandwidth nearby f Hz, which is calculated with a formula: f = (k+1)/2T, where k = the number of tapers used in time-frequency decomposition and T = temporal window (seconds) of the data.</p><p>For our moving-window SNR analyses, we first computed the single-taper (k = 1) spectrogram using a 2.5 s window, with a half-bandwidth of 0.4 Hz, and shifted the window in a step size of 250 ms. We then compared the signal at f Hz to neighborhood [f-2.5, f-0.5] Hz and [f+0.5, f+2.5] Hz. For our whole-trial SNR analysis with a half-bandwidth of 0.017 Hz, we compared the signal at f to neighborhood [f-0.12, f-0.06] Hz and [f+0.06, f+0.12] Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Evoked responses in the alpha band</title><p>We used a two-step analysis process to calculate the relative alpha amplitude during all PFI and PMD periods. First, after all PFI and PMD periods were epoched and preprocessed as described above, we bandpass filtered the time series with a narrow-band Gaussian filter (8–12 Hz, full-width at half maximum = 2 Hz). Second, to the bandpass filtered signals, we applied the Hilbert transform to compute the alpha-band amplitude as the envelope of the Hilbert-transformed filtered signal. Third, to obtain evoked responses in the alpha band, within participants, we divided the time course of the amplitude by the average over the period −2.5 to −1.5 s prior to button press (gray window shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) for each participant.</p><p>To identify electrode-cluster-time points, in which the difference between baseline and evoked alpha responses were significant, we implemented non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests (Fieldtrip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>; ft_timelockstatistics.m function). Specifically, using all electrodes, we set a minimum spatial cluster size of three neighbors, and a threshold for cluster identification at p=0.05 (uncorrected). Spatiotemporal clusters of test-statistics (<italic>t</italic>-scores from dependent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests) which exceeded p&lt;0.05 (uncorrected) were then identified. We then corrected for multiple-comparisons using Monte Carlo permutation tests (1000 repetitions). In each permutation, we exchanged the data label between conditions at random within participants, and repeated the above procedure to identify spatiotemporal clusters on these permuted data, and obtained a null distribution for clustered-test statistics (<italic>t</italic>-scores). By comparing the null distribution to the observed cluster statistic, we finally obtain the cluster-level p-value corrected for multiple-comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cluster-based permutation tests should be interpreted with caution, and used to infer only about the overall statistical contrast, and not to infer the location or latency of a significant effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sassenhagen and Draschkow, 2019</xref>). After identifying the presence of a significant cluster, we also displayed the average activity within each cluster, over the entire epoch (−2.5 to 2.5 s after button press). We then compared this activity to baseline and corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR q = 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Event-by-event image analysis of button press and log(SNR)</title><p>We performed image-based event-by-event analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>), to investigate whether the changes in log(SNR) may reflect the amount of PFI. This image-based analysis is necessary due to variations in the frequency and duration of reported PFI per participant.</p><p>To accommodate these differences, we first sorted all PFI events in descending order, based on the sum of buttons pressed over a 3 s period. We used the period [0, +3] relative to button press for PFI disappearances, and [−3, 0] relative to button release for PFI reappearances. This duration-weighted number of buttons pressed we term ‘the amount of PFI’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>). After sorting based on the amount of PFI, we then resampled participant data along the trial dimension (y-axis) to normalize trial counts to 100 trials for each participant. This process of resampling along the trial dimension was repeated for the event-by-event time course of log(SNR), except the order of trials was predetermined by the corresponding button-press per participant. A schematic pipeline for this entire procedure is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. Finally, to quantify whether changes in log(SNR) occur with an increasing amount of PFI, we grouped trials when the amount of PFI was between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or greater than 3. The results have been visualized using the raincloud plots statistical package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>SNR timing differences</title><p>To investigate the timing of changes to target and surround SNR, we superimposed the time-course for disappearances and reappearances, by aligning at button press and release. We then compared the magnitude of these SNR time-courses using consecutive paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests (two-tailed), at each time point. To confirm the differences between the target and surround-specific changes in SNR, we also performed a non-parametric jackknife resampling procedure. As the waveforms under consideration for f1 and f2 have different peak amplitudes and shapes, we avoided latency estimates based on peak-criterion (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Miller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, we repeated our temporal cluster-based analysis after subsampling participants in a leave-one-out analysis, to estimate the reliability of this effect. Specifically, we compared the SNR time courses for disappearance and reappearance using running paired samples two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests at each time point. The first time point in a temporally contiguous cluster of at least 500 ms was retained as the first difference in SNR during PFI. To increase the temporal resolution of our jackknife estimates, we linearly interpolated the SNR time courses from 250 ms time steps (4 Hz) to 1 ms time steps (1000 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis – EEG</title><p>To assess the significance of SSVEP peaks in the EEG spectra, we corrected for multiple comparisons with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) q = 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benjamini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We corrected for multiple comparisons in SNR time-series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b,d, and e</xref>) using non-parametric temporal cluster-based corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). Specifically, we first detected any temporally contiguous cluster by defining a significant time point as p&lt;0.05 uncorrected. Then, we concatenated the contiguous temporal time points with p&lt;0.05 and obtained a summed cluster-level test statistic for the cluster. The sum of observed test statistics (e.g. <italic>t-</italic>scores) in a temporally contiguous cluster were then retained for comparison with a permutation-based null distribution. To create the null distribution, we repeated the procedure of searching for and retaining contiguous time points which satisfied the p&lt;0.05 (uncorrected) cluster criterion, after first shuffling the condition labels 2000 times. For within-participant comparisons, this amounts to randomly permuting the averages for each condition within each participant. From each of the 2000 repetitions, we obtained the maximum sum of cluster-level test statistics, which served as a null distribution. We regarded the effect to be significant if the original summed cluster-level statistics exceeded the bottom 95% of the null distribution of the summed statistics (as p<sub>cluster</sub> &lt;0.05).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Human subjects: Ethics approval was obtained from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC #CF12/2542 - 2012001375).

We compared the amount of PFI per trial, duration per PFI, and total duration of PFI during either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 target PFI periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, blue bars). We found that while 0 target PFI periods were most frequent (occurring 6 times per trial), when targets did disappear, simultaneous 4 target disappearances were the most common (4 times per trial, compared to &lt;2 times per trial for 1, 2, and 3 target disappearances). This interesting trend continued for both the duration per PFI (7 s per 0 target,&lt;2 s for 1–3 targets, 5.5 s for 4 targets) and total duration of PFI (32 s for 0, &lt;2 s for 1–3, and 20 s for 4, respectively), showing that 4 target disappearances were the most common, disappeared for a longer duration, and greatest total duration per trial.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (c-h, gray bars) displays the results of this analysis, showing the mean across all 1000 shuffled sets of data. In contrast to observed data, the shuffled data showed PFI for 1, 2, and 3 targets being more common (6, 7, and 6 times per trial respectively), than for 0 and 4 targets (each occurring less than 4 times per trial). For PFI duration, especially durations for 4 target PFI were shorter in the shuffled data. Strikingly, and in direct opposition to our observed data, the total duration of 0, 1, 2, and 3 target PFI per trial was roughly equivalent in shuffled data (each ~14 s duration), with 4 target PFI occurring for the least amount of time (&lt;10 s).</p><p>To investigate whether these trends obtained over 4-target locations were likely to occur by chance, we performed a shuffling analysis (see Materials and methods) and recalculated PFI characteristics (PFI per trial, PFI duration, and total duration), as a function of the number of targets filled-in (nPFI).</p><p>To statistically evaluate the differences in these trends, we compared the coefficient for the quadratic fit of our observed data to all the coefficients in our null distribution for shuffled data. For all PFI measures, the observed coefficient was outside the 95% of the null distribution (corresponding to p&lt;0.05). For the PFI per trial and total duration per trial, the positive quadratic term for the effect of nPFI in our observed data is in direct opposition to the distribution of quadratic coefficients in our shuffled data. Taken together, we interpret this result as evidence of a synergistic spatial-interaction between multiple PFI targets, that increases the likelihood of simultaneous disappearances across visual hemifields and target locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60031.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wyart</surname><given-names>Valentin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>École normale supérieure, PSL University, INSERM</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cottereau</surname><given-names>Benoit R</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>CerCo laboratory (UMR 5549), CNRS</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your careful investigation of the neural correlates of visual disappearance during perceptual filling-in (PFI) using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) has yielded surprising and insightful results.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This manuscript describes a human EEG study which aims at characterizing the neural correlates of visual disappearance during perceptual filling-in (PFI) using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). The authors report that target disappearance leads in this paradigm to an increase rather than to a decreased SNR of the target SSVEP. The authors interpret this &quot;neural correlate of invisibility&quot; as an empirical challenge for existing theories regarding the relationship between SSVEP and conscious perception. The two reviewers have found the study to be creative and its findings to be of potential importance for the field. However, they have also raised concerns regarding the interpretation of the findings proposed by the authors, which would require additional analyses to be supported by the data and a more extensive account of the existing literature on the relationship between the neural correlates of visual awareness and attention. There are also concerns regarding the number of subjects included in the analyses which should be clarified. The paragraphs below describe the main concerns that have been discussed among reviewers and the reviewing editor, and that should be addressed explicitly in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Novelty of the findings. Although the findings are interesting and novel in this particular context of perceptual filling-in, they may not be as surprising as the authors present them to be. Indeed, previous work (including some cited by the authors, e.g., Morgan, Hansen and Hillyard, 1996) has shown a clear connection between SSVEP and attention. And it is also known from previous work that PFI increases with attention (Lou, 1999; De Weerd, Smith and Greenberg, 2006). The present finding adds to this existing body of work by showing that when PFI (a &quot;visual disappearance&quot; effect) is used to dissociate awareness and attention, SSVEP follows attention rather than consciousness. In other words, rather than showing that SSVEP is a general neural measure of invisibility, an alternative interpretation of the finding is that SSVEP is a neural measure of attention, which in this particular setting of frequency-tagged PFI becomes a neural measure of invisibility (see also the second concern below).</p><p>2) The Abstract and the Discussion should be revised in a way that considers the finding beyond the specific context of PFI used in this study. For example, the suggestion that the &quot;brain actively represents disappearing, or absent stimuli&quot; should be accompanied by the alternative interpretation that SSVEP reflects a neural measure of attention rather than awareness, which in the particular setting of PFI go in opposite directions. Also, as raised by reviewer #1, previous work has studied the dissociation between the neural correlates of visual attention and awareness (among others, see e.g. Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2008; 2009; Koivisto et al., 2009; Norman et al., 2013). A deeper review of the existing literature on this topic (in the Introduction and/or Discussion) would afford to better understand what is already known and also to provide insights for future work.</p><p>3) Nature of the relation between SSVEP/alpha power and attention. The authors ground their interpretation on previous studies (Lou, 1999; De Weerd et al., 2006) where attending to target features increased PFI probability, and also on the correlation they found between target-tagged SNR and alpha power. However, these are both indirect evidence – in the case of alpha power, it amounts to reverse inference to assign changes in alpha power to changes in attention. And attention was not directly manipulated in the present study, which would have provided a much stronger monitoring of the relation between attention and awareness (see, e.g., Morgan et al., 1996 or Müller et al., 2006). We thus suggest the authors to be more cautious regarding the interpretations that they seek to draw regarding attention in their study. Attention was not manipulated experimentally, and using alpha power as a measure of attention amounts to reverse inference.</p><p>4) Specificity of the finding. These results presented in the manuscript do not demonstrate that all sensory-cortical activity goes along with attention instead of awareness, as the authors' Abstract/significance statement/Discussion suggest to be the case (&quot;by showing that the strength of stimulus-specific neural activity can encode the conscious absence of a stimulus&quot;, or &quot;we found that neural activity increased […] when targets became invisible&quot;). In Abstract and significance statement, the authors only state &quot;neural activity&quot; or &quot;neural response&quot;, instead of SSVEP, which can be misleading. Similarly, in the Discussion, the authors should note that it remains entirely possible that other types of neural activity (e.g. spike rate or recurrent activity) in visual cortex correlates with the vividness of conscious experience, which would in principle be consistent with existing theories of visual awareness (e.g., GNW).</p><p>5) Comparison between PFI and phenomenally matched disappearances (PMD). To better characterize the difference between the responses to PFI vs. to PMD, and support the claim that target-tagged SNR decreases rather than increases during PMD (subsection “Increased SNR during invisibility is unique to targets during PFI”), it would be very important to show the target-tagged SNR changes around button press for PMD – i.e. the equivalent of Figure 2B and E for PMD.</p><p>6) Neural mechanisms underlying the observed findings. Almost no discussion about the neural mechanisms underlying the surprising finding is provided. It seems important to better explain the cortical processes involved (e.g., the authors could compare more carefully their results with those obtained in macaque electrophysiology by De Weerd et al., 1995). At the analytical level, one possibility would also be to analyse the SSVEP SNR at the intermodulation frequencies (I see in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 that responses at F2 minus F1 = 5Hz are significantly above noise). This would permit to characterize and discuss the interactions between the neural responses corresponding to the processing of the targets and to those corresponding to the processing of the surround (see e.g. Appelbaum et al., 2008).</p><p>7) Analysis of SNR change latencies. The analysis of SNR change latencies (currently described in the supplements) would deserve to be more documented and to appear in the main document. The finding that changes in background SNR precede changes in target SNR is an important result which clarifies the temporal sequence of neural activations. It would be interesting to determine when the SNR change corresponding to the inter-modulation product (e.g., at F2 minus F1) appears (see the previous concern).</p><p>8) Relation between duration of PFI and SSVEP. In the Discussion, the authors mention: &quot;As more targets disappeared and presumably drew attention, both the duration of their absence and strength of target SNR increased.&quot; However, the duration effect, shown in supplementary materials, is not referenced in the main text. In Figure 2, in addition to investigating the relation of SSVEP with the number of disappeared targets, the authors should also test the relation of the same neural measure with the duration of PFI – or remove this sentence from the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Davidson et al. characterize the neural correlates of visual disappearance during perceptual filling-in (PFI) using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). They show that target disappearance actually leads to an increase rather than to a decrease of the target SNR. This finding is potentially of importance and the study might ultimately lead to a publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.

But does it necessarily imply that this target-SNR increase reflects attention instead? The authors base their interpretation on previous studies (Lou, 1999; De Weerd et al., 2006) where attending to target feature increased PFI probability (which I think is not exactly equivalent to the PFI magnitude reported here) and also on the correlation they found between target-SNR and evoked alpha.

A major weakness is that the interpretations seem a bit exaggerated and alternative interpretations not considered. Using a creative paradigm of perceptual filling-in, the authors show that increased attention (indexed by a reduction in alpha power over central-parietal locations, and supported by previous psychophysics studies) is associated with perceptual filling-in, and the phenomenal disappearance of targets. By tagging targets and surround with different frequencies, they show that SSVEP elicited by targets increases at the time of perceptual filling-in. These results suggest that SSVEP, thought to index the content of visual perception in previous binocular rivalry studies, can be dissociated from conscious perception in this paradigm, and instead reflect attention.</p><p>While the results are interesting and novel, they are perhaps not as surprising as the authors present them to be. Given that previous studies have shown a clear connection between SSVEP and attention (e.g. Morgan, Hansen and Hillyard, 1996, cited by the authors), these results shown that when attention and awareness are dissociated (as the last author has nicely demonstrated/argued previously), SSVEP goes with attention.</p><p>These results do not demonstrate that all sensory-cortical activity goes along with attention instead of awareness, as the authors' Abstract/significance statement/Discussion suggest to be the case. E.g., in Abstract/significance statement, the authors only state &quot;neural activity&quot; or &quot;neural response&quot;, instead of specifically SSVEP, which can be misleading. Similarly, in the Discussion, it remains a possibility that other types of neural activity (e.g. spiking rate or recurrent activity) in sensory cortex correlates with the vividness of conscious experience, which would in principle be consistent with first-order or GNW theories.</p><p>An analysis comment:</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors mention &quot;As more targets disappeared and presumably drew attention, both the duration of their absence and strength of target SNR increased.&quot; The duration effect, shown in supplementary materials, is not referenced in the main text as I as I could find. In Figure 2, in addition to investigating SSVEP's relation with the number of disappeared targets, the authors could also test its relation with the duration of PFI.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60031.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Novelty of the findings.

Instead, we argue that SSVEP strength is a neural measure of attention.</p><p>To clarify, we have amended the title of our paper into:</p><p>“The SSVEP tracks attention, not consciousness, during perceptual filling-in”</p><p>We have also removed statements that could be mistaken as claims the SSVEP is a general measure of invisibility.</p><p>As you see below, we have also extended our analysis and Discussion to buttress our argument that the SSVEP is more likely to be a neural measure of attention than to capture the current contents of visual phenomenology.</p><p>With regard to the novelty of our findings, we believe that this latter distinction is important, and apologise that this had not been made clearer. Indeed, we believe that one of the novel contributions which is afforded by our unique experimental design is the clarification of the relationship between SSVEPs, attention and visual conscious perception. It is true that previous work has linked SSVEP strength to attention. Crucially however, a parallel literature has existed which assumes SSVEP strength also captures visual phenomenology.</p><p>For example, one influential paper (Zhang et al., 2011), used the strength of SSVEPs as a proxy for conscious contents during binocular rivalry. This has been a foundational paper to argue that binocular rivalry requires visual attention due to their key manipulation – a comparison of SSVEP modulation between attended and unattended conditions. The authors found the depth of SSVEP modulation to be reduced during unattended rivalry, and argued as a result that binocular rivalry had ceased. We can now revise these claims to state that rivalry may well have continued, as SSVEPs are a neural measure related to attentional amplification and suppression, and not phenomenal vision. This distinction was not possible before dissociating attention and awareness as we have done in our paradigm.</p><p>This is just one example, and many older (e.g. Lansing, 1964; Tononi et al., 1998) and new (e.g. Bock et al., 2019) experiments are similarly based on the premise that SSVEPs correlate with visual phenomenology without considering the influence of attention.</p><p>We have now highlighted this novel contribution in our Discussion, by summarising the above example for the audience of <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>“In one notable study, a reduction in SSVEP strength was interpreted to indicate the cessation of binocular rivalry entirely (Zhang et al., 2011). […] Another viable, and potentially simpler explanation, is that SSVEP strength instead reflects attention, which is typically positively correlated with conscious perception”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Abstract and the Discussion should be revised in a way that considers the finding beyond the specific context of PFI used in this study. For example, the suggestion that the &quot;brain actively represents disappearing, or absent stimuli&quot; should be accompanied by the alternative interpretation that SSVEP reflects a neural measure of attention rather than awareness, which in the particular setting of PFI go in opposite directions. Also, as raised by reviewer #1, previous work has studied the dissociation between the neural correlates of visual attention and awareness (among others, see e.g. Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2008; 2009; Koivisto et al., 2009; Norman et al., 2013). A deeper review of the existing literature on this topic (in the Introduction and/or Discussion) would afford to better understand what is already known and also to provide insights for future work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions to expand the context of our work and consider alternate interpretations. We have now rewritten our Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to accommodate alternative explanations, and to deepen our review of existing literature on this topic.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“Research on the neural basis of conscious perception has almost exclusively shown that becoming aware of a stimulus leads to increased neural responses. […] Instead we conclude that SSVEP strength more closely measures changes in attention.”</p><p>Our Introduction has also been revised to consider the broader context of attention and consciousness research, beyond the example of PFI, used in the present study:</p><p>For example, from our Introduction:</p><p>“In the behavioural and neuronal study of consciousness and attention, PFI has an unusual and potentially very revealing property: directing attention toward targets in the visual periphery facilitates perceptual disappearance (De Weerd, Smith, and Greenberg, 2006; Lou, 1999). […] Here, we demonstrate that PFI indeed dissociates neural measures which normally positively correlate with both attention to – and the conscious perception of, visual stimuli.”</p><p>In our Discussion, we have also now included a new subsection, that positions our results more generally in the context of what is known about visual attention and awareness. We also discuss alternative explanations, and provide recommendations for future work. See Discussion subsection “Visual attention and conscious perception”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Nature of the relation between SSVEP/alpha power and attention. The authors ground their interpretation on previous studies (Lou, 1999; De Weerd et al., 2006) where attending to target features increased PFI probability, and also on the correlation they found between target-tagged SNR and alpha power.

We thus suggest the authors to be more cautious regarding the interpretations that they seek to draw regarding attention in their study. Attention was not manipulated experimentally, and using alpha power as a measure of attention amounts to reverse inference.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point, and have now explicitly acknowledged the indirect nature of this evidence in our Discussion:</p><p>“Importantly, our interpretation that SSVEPs reflect attention but not consciousness is supported by indirect, yet convergent evidence”.</p><p>We agree that a direct manipulation of attention would be a strong test of our claims, and specify this as a possibility for future work:</p><p>“To tease apart the neural correlates of conscious phenomenology from those of attention and reports, future work may be able to test whether SSVEPs during PFI at attended / unattended locations replicates the pattern which we have described, …”</p><p>However, we also maintain that an explanation based on attention is the most parsimonious interpretation of our results.</p><p>To justify our claims, we have now included an extended discussion of the convergent evidence, as well as evidence against alternative explanations based on report-related motor selection, somatosensory spatial attention, arousal, and vigilance.</p><p>We also note that our interpretation based on attention has been strengthened by extending our analysis of PFI and PMD SNR timing differences (see reviewer comment 7, below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Specificity of the finding. These results presented in the manuscript do not demonstrate that all sensory-cortical activity goes along with attention instead of awareness, as the authors' Abstract/significance statement/Discussion suggest to be the case (&quot;by showing that the strength of stimulus-specific neural activity can encode the conscious absence of a stimulus&quot;, or &quot;we found that neural activity increased […] when targets became invisible&quot;).

We have now amended our Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to focus on the specificity of the effect regarding SSVEPs.</p><p>In our Abstract:</p><p>“We show that in a perceptual filling-in paradigm the disappearance of a stimulus and subjective invisibility are associated with increases in neural activity, as measured with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), in electroencephalography (EEG). […] These findings cast doubt on the direct relationship previously reported between the strength of neural activity and conscious perception, at least when measured with current tools, such as the SSVEP.”</p><p>We have also now included a discussion of the likelihood that other types of activity (spike-rates) correlate with conscious experience, and that the link between spike-rates and SSVEPs are not well established:</p><p>“Insofar as the strength of target SSVEP signals when measured with EEG may reflect the strength of target-specific spike activity in the sensory cortex, our finding does challenge such theories that propose response strength is positively correlated with the vividness of conscious experience. Currently, however, the exact mechanisms of SSVEP generation are not well understood (Kawashima et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2017; Norcia et al., 2015; Notbohm, Kurths and Herrmann, 2016; Rager and Singer, 1998; Salelkar and Ray, 2020), and future studies will be necessary to clarify their input.”</p><p>We also discuss previous literature regarding the link between spike-rates in visual cortex and conscious experience. We also paraphrase the important point made above, that the patterns of activity, which includes recurrent processing may correlate with phenomenology:</p><p>“Meanwhile, there exists another family of theories that propose that certain types of causal interactions underlie conscious phenomenology, such as recurrent processing theory (Lamme, 2006, 2014; Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000) and integrated information theory (Haun and Tononi, 2019; Tononi, 2004). For these theories, it is not the strength, but the patterns of neuronal connectivity and their states that determine phenomenology as a whole.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Comparison between PFI and phenomenally matched disappearances (PMD). To better characterize the difference between the responses to PFI vs. to PMD, and support the claim that target-tagged SNR decreases rather than increases during PMD (subsection “Increased SNR during invisibility is unique to targets during PFI”), it would be very important to show the target-tagged SNR changes around button press for PMD – i.e. the equivalent of Figure 2B and E for PMD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised Figure 2 to include the SNR time-course during PMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Neural mechanisms underlying the observed findings.

It seems important to better explain the cortical processes involved (e.g., the authors could compare more carefully their results with those obtained in macaque electrophysiology by De Weerd et al., 1995). At the analytical level, one possibility would also be to analyse the SSVEP SNR at the intermodulation frequencies (I see in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 that responses at F2 minus F1 = 5Hz are significantly above noise).

We have now moved our analysis of SNR change latencies into the main document, and expanded this analysis to include changes in the SNR of the IM component.

In the Discussion, the authors mention: &quot;As more targets disappeared and presumably drew attention, both the duration of their absence and strength of target SNR increased.&quot; However, the duration effect, shown in supplementary materials, is not referenced in the main text. In Figure 2, in addition to investigating the relation of SSVEP with the number of disappeared targets, the authors should also test the relation of the same neural measure with the duration of PFI – or remove this sentence from the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify our analysis. We have now more explicitly referenced the duration effect in the main text:</p><p>“We first confirmed in our behavioural analysis that targets disappeared together more frequently than in isolation (see subsection “A spatial interaction between target locations increases PFI duration when targets disappear together”; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Consistent with our prior work, we also replicate that the duration of PFI increases with an increasing number of invisible targets, strongly suggesting a facilitatory grouping mechanism across visual hemifields and target locations (Davidson et al., 2020).”</p><p>As for the suggestion to extend our SSVEP analysis to PFI duration, we wish to clarify that the ‘amount’ of PFI is not just the number of absent targets, but also includes duration information. We quantified the ‘amount’ of PFI based on our event-by-event image analysis, which is the duration-weighted number of buttons pressed over a 3 second period.</p><p>To clarify this in our main text we have now revised the wording throughout our main text and Materials and methods e.g.:</p><p>“…measuring the “amount of PFI”, which we defined as the duration-weighted number of invisible targets (see Materials and methods)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, Davidson et al. characterize the neural correlates of visual disappearance during perceptual filling-in (PFI) using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).

This finding is potentially of importance and the study might ultimately lead to a publication in eLife.

A deeper review of the existing literature on this topic (in the Introduction and/or Discussion) would permit to better understand what is already known and also to provide leads for future investigations.</p></disp-quote><p>See above (comment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall, I think this is a creative study, with very interesting findings. A major weakness is that the interpretations seem a bit exaggerated and alternative interpretations not considered. Using a creative paradigm of perceptual filling-in, the authors show that increased attention (indexed by a reduction in alpha power over central-parietal locations, and supported by previous psychophysics studies) is associated with perceptual filling-in, and the phenomenal disappearance of targets. By tagging targets and surround with different frequencies, they show that SSVEP elicited by targets increases at the time of perceptual filling-in. These results suggest that SSVEP, thought to index the content of visual perception in previous binocular rivalry studies, can be dissociated from conscious perception in this paradigm, and instead reflect attention.</p><p>While the results are interesting and novel, they are perhaps not as surprising as the authors present them to be. Given that previous studies have shown a clear connection between SSVEP and attention (e.g. Morgan, Hansen and Hillyard, 1996, cited by the authors), these results shown that when attention and awareness are dissociated (as the last author has nicely demonstrated/argued previously), SSVEP goes with attention.</p></disp-quote><p>See above (comment 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These results do not demonstrate that all sensory-cortical activity goes along with attention instead of awareness, as the authors' Abstract/significance statement/Discussion suggest to be the case. E.g., in Abstract/significance statement, the authors only state &quot;neural activity&quot; or &quot;neural response&quot;, instead of specifically SSVEP, which can be misleading. Similarly, in the Discussion, it remains a possibility that other types of neural activity (e.g. spiking rate or recurrent activity) in sensory cortex correlates with the vividness of conscious experience, which would in principle be consistent with first-order or GNW theories.</p></disp-quote><p>See above (comment 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An analysis comment:</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors mention &quot;As more targets disappeared and presumably drew attention, both the duration of their absence and strength of target SNR increased.&quot; The duration effect, shown in supplementary materials, is not referenced in the main text as I could find. In Figure 2, in addition to investigating SSVEP's relation with the number of disappeared targets, the authors could also test its relation with the duration of PFI.</p></disp-quote><p>See above (comment 8).</p></body></sub-article></article>
