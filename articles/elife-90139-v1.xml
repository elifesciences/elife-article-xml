We address the feasibility and determinant molecular features of this mechanism using multi-scale modeling. All-atom simulations of 4E10, PGZL1, 10E8, and LN01 docked onto HIV-like membranes consistently form phospholipid complexes at key complementarity-determining region loop sites, solidifying that stable and specific lipid interactions anchor bnAbs to membrane surfaces. Ancillary protein-lipid contacts reveal surprising contributions from antibody framework regions. Coarse-grained simulations effectively capture antibodies embedding into membranes. Simulations estimating protein-membrane interaction strength for PGZL1 variants along an inferred maturation pathway show bilayer affinity is evolved and correlates with neutralization potency. The modeling demonstrated here uncovers insights into lipid participation in antibodies’ recognition of membrane proteins and highlights antibody features to prioritize in vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>lipid membranes</kwd><kwd>broadly neutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>MPER</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1 AI144462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Ian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011769</institution-id><institution>Scripps Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>John and Susan Diekman Skaggs Graduate School Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maillie</surname><given-names>Colleen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that lipid binding at antibody loops and framework regions stabilizes membrane interactions, providing molecular details for neutralization mechanisms and strategies for HIV-1 vaccine development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies can target integral membrane proteins very near to the lipid bilayer surface, including at epitopes partially embedded within the headgroup region. During antigen engagement, antibodies complementarity-determining regions (CDR) may need to navigate lipid molecules to gain access to a concealed or dynamically buried site. Evolving tolerance or even affinity to lipid bilayers could be beneficial in recognition of membrane-proximal epitopes, potentially forming simultaneous cooperative interactions with antigen and membrane yielding additional avidity and specificity. Conversely, propensity to bind lipids or cell membranes poses a significant auto-immunity risk. B-cells producing antibodies targeting host membranes are downregulated in healthy organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodnow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verkoczy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, rare antibodies with lipid affinity can emerge, particularly in cases of chronic inflammation and infection as in HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matyas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>). Maturation pathways of these rare events remain unclear, but must strike a careful balance of polyreactivity to avoid or overcome autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caillat et al., 2020</xref>). A better understanding of how antibodies develop membrane affinity and target membrane-proximal epitopes would be impactful for antibody therapeutics, auto-immunity, and vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton and Hangartner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krebs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rujas et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We sought to address this phenomenon for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) 4E10, PGZL1, 10E8, and LN01 which stem from unique lineages and all target the semi-concealed membrane-proximal epitope region (MPER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardoso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardoso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2008</xref>) of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). Interestingly, these bnAbs show varying degrees of affinity for lipid components; some associate with lipid bilayers or cultured cells even in the absence of antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matyas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiegler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). This membrane interaction behavior appears to correlate with neutralization potency and is attributed to shared CDR loop features including a long hydrophobic CDR-H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irimia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zwick et al., 2004</xref>). The correlation between membrane association and neutralization has been established, given that mutations or chemical conjugations to solvent-exposed antibody loop residues which enhance association to phospholipid vesicles consequently boost efficacy of pseudovirus neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rujas et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, mutations reducing hydrophobicity drastically reduce neutralization activity while also weakening association to lipid bilayers, despite minimal impacts to antigen affinity (e.g. 4E10 CDR-H3 H100-H102 Trp-Trp motif; PGZL1 clone H4K3’s CDR-H1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Julien et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, phospholipid membrane interactions evolved by MPER-targeting bnAbs appear critical for their mechanism of immune protection against HIV. Yet, the breadth of molecular features responsible for association with membranes and mode of lipid-embedded epitope engagement are not clear.</p><p>Structural characterization of MPER-targeting bnAbs with full-length Env trimer or gp41 fragments also indicate that the surrounding lipid bilayer plays a role in antibody access and epitope recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rantalainen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of Env trimers bound to bnAbs PGZL1, 4E10, and 10E8 within in different model membranes suggest their CDR loops form intimate contacts with surrounding lipids while engaging MPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rantalainen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Antigen binding fragments (Fab) crystal structures of those bnAbs as well as LN01 soaked with short-chain phospholipids all revealed ordered headgroup moieties complexed within the CDR loops in the presence and absence of antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matyas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting the antibodies encode specific lipid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matyas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the molecular features mediating membrane affinity for these bnAbs appear critical to their maturation and mechanism of immune protection against HIV in vivo.</p><p>These data support a two-step bnAb neutralization mechanism proposed previously, wherein a population of bnAbs in vivo may first associate with membranes via embedding their CDRs, then laterally diffuse across the bilayer surface to subsequently engage Env at MPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irimia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rantalainen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carravilla et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soto et al., 2016</xref>). The reverse order, MPER binding followed by CDR membrane insertion, is also often posited. Here, we developed multi-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches suited to investigate these mechanisms and the unique maturation landscape these rare antibodies must navigate to avoid auto-immune consequences. For these MPER bnAbs, we focused on the in silico capacity to characterize the molecular features mediating phospholipid affinity at atomic detail, not afforded by previous structural approaches. We find that unbiased all-atom MD simulations accurately and reproducibly predict ab initio binding of phospholipids stably bound at specific CDR binding sites previously identified in co-crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irimia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>). Integrating coarse-grain (CG) simulations, we capture the full process of antibodies scanning and embedding into lipid bilayers to biologically relevant conformations. The simulations illuminate key molecular features tuning bnAbs’ lipid interaction and preferred membrane-bound geometry, advancing on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carravilla et al., 2020a</xref>), including surprising contributions from framework regions. Biased simulations provide rough estimates of membrane interaction strength, applied to demonstrate that in silico bilayer affinity correlates with neutralization efficacy of experimentally characterized PGZL1 variants along a pseudo-maturation trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>This modeling platform provides an improved framework for navigating the proposed two-step bnAb neutralization mechanism both for retrospective and proactive evaluation of antibody repertoires, which should have utility in vaccine design and therapeutic antibody engineering. Likewise, our results inform more broadly generalized molecular principles for the in vivo selection of antibodies targeting membrane proteins, beyond HIV, at partially concealed juxtamembrane regions – desirable epitope regions given they often have high protein sequence conservation relative to water-soluble exposed sites. Reliable atomic detail views of antibody conformations at the membrane surface and loop phospholipid binding sites should be powerful for better understanding membrane protein epitope engagement, pathogen neutralization mechanism, and checkpoints regulating self-sensing antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Atomic simulations accurately model MPER bnAb 4E10 and PGZL1 phospholipid interactions at HIV-like membrane surfaces</title><p>To assess the stability, organization, and spectrum of phospholipid interactions inferred from previous lipid-bound crystallography and cryo-EM experiments, we first performed unbiased all-atom simulations of 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8 peripherally embedded to the surface of model lipid bilayers. Initial membrane-bound Fab conformations were computed using PPM2.0<sup>3735</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lomize et al., 2012</xref>), globally optimizing protein insertion based on per-residue hydrophobicity and solvation, each resulting in reasonable predictions with CDR-H3 embedded. Four 1 μs pseudo-replicate simulations were initiated per bnAb, with two replicates tilted by ± 15 degrees to modestly vary the starting membrane-interacting pose, utilizing an explicit simplified HIV-like model anionic bilayer: 25% cholesterol, 5% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), 70% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>4E10 and PGZL1 are homologous (85% sequence identity, sharing IgG <italic>VH1-69, VH4-34,</italic> and <italic>VH4-59</italic>), and have very similar affinities, breadths, and potencies (paricularly comparing 4E10 and PGZL1.H4K3). 4E10 is notably more poly-reactive: binding to cultured cells, numerous isolated phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matyas et al., 2009</xref>), and vesicles of most compositions even in the absence of antigen – whereas 10E8, LN01, and PGZL1 do not. PGZL1 and 4E10 crystal structures both bear putative lipid electron density at several surface loops, notably recurring within a CDR-H1 site – a region when mutation reduced the neutralization potency 10-fold for PGZL1-H4K3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zwick et al., 2001</xref>). Given their similarities, we first compared the lipid bilayer interaction mechanisms in 4E10 and PGZL1 simulations. Upon time-averaging phospholipid density from four independent trajectories, both bnAbs showed strong hotspots for a lipid phosphate bound within the CDR-H1 loops, with minimal phospholipid or cholesterol ordering around the proteins elsewhere. The simulated lipid phosphates bound within CDR-H1 have exceptional overlap with electron densities and atomic details of modelled headgroups from respective lipid-soaked co-crystal structures of 4E10 and PGZL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irimia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>), with phosphate mean positions RMSDs of 0.6 and 0.7 Å, respectively, relative to the X-ray structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Thus, our simulations reproduce ab initio with atomic accuracy the evidence of 4E10 and PGZL1 bnAbs’ mechanism of membrane association. These results validate the CDR-H1 antibody-lipid interactions proposed from previous co-crystal structures are feasible in the context of full biologically realistic HIV-like bilayers and form very readily. The CDR-H1 lipid phosphate complexes appear to be stable, specific interactions that anchor and orient CDR loops at the bilayer surface for antigen engagement, complementing protein-lipid interactions which are less geometrically specific, that is lipid tail solvation of apolar groups in the CDR-H loops such as CDR-H3 tryptophans.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>4E10 and PGZL1 CDR lipid phosphate binding sites and membrane interaction profiles in all-atom fluid HIV-like bilayer MD simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative frame from an MD simulation of the phospholipid complex at 4E10 Fab CDR-H1 (top left).

When CDR-H3 is inserted, CDR-H1 is presented as a rigid pre-formed binding site conveniently at the membrane’s headgroup layer for rapid formation of complexes, with those phospholipids likely in a steady-state equilibrium freely exchanging (nano-microsecond timescale) yet heavily favoring the bound state.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-90139-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>De novo predicted phosphate binding in atomistic 4E10 Fab MD simulation Atomistic simulation of 4E10 Fab (heavy chain: dark blue, light chain: light blue) initially docked to the membrane using OPM PPM server prediction.</title><p>Lipids and cholesterol are shown as grey sticks with phosphates from top and bottom leaflets shown as orange spheres.

Characterizing the cumulative per-residue interaction profiles of 4E10 and PGZL1 with bilayer lipids categorized into headgroup, glycerol, or hydrocarbon layers illustrates the deep immersion of heavy-chain loops, with the light-chain making some peripheral polar headgroup contacts (namely CDRs L1 and L3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). The patterns of lipid interactions compare well with previous 4E10 simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carravilla et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carravilla et al., 2020b</xref>), yet are more expansive here – possibly due to the sustained phospholipid-CDR-H1 complex and greater simulation length.</p><p>Aligning interaction profiles with corresponding primary sequences contextualizes the amino acid molecular features responsible and their origin in antibody maturation. One novel observation consistent between our 4E10 and PGZL1 simulations was that heavy-chain framework region 3 (FR-H3) extensively intercalates into the bilayer surface. This finding demonstrates that predominantly germline encoded antibody surface features can provide significant contributions to the membrane binding mechanism and surface orientation of antibodies – a key insight for invoking and honing antibody-lipid interactions in vaccine design. For the light-chain loops and FR-H3 of PGZL1 and 4E10, charged residues mediate their shallower headgroup surface interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), whereas the CDR-H loops bare neighboring stretches of hydrophobic and lipophilic polar residues facilitating their deeper embedding. Compared to PGZL1, 4E10’s CDR-H loops are further buried, more extensively contacting lipid aliphatic tails – which may in part explain 4E10’s higher tendency for poly-specificity. The comprehensive protein-lipid atomic-detail maps further detail that the mechanisms for membrane interaction and antibody maturation driven are largely by the solvation for apolar surface loops – the extent of hydrophobic burial – complemented by compatible polar residue electrostatics. The majority of bnAb protein-lipid interactions arise from surface residues’ macroscopic chemical properties, contrasting the much more sequence and conformationally specific phospholipid binding sites constructed at CDR-H1. Thus, the multivalent combination of surface features combined with highly specific lipid anchoring sites may be a convergent theme for maturation and mechanism for MPER-targeting bnAbs, including the previously undervalued contribution from germline-encoded framework regions to lipid association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phospholipid complex formed in the CDR Light Chain groove of 10E8 bound to membrane surfaces</title><p>We similarly investigated bnAb 10E8, which differs in its genetic origins and expected light-chain-mediated membrane binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irimia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georgiev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2017</xref>).

In our simulations, the stably bound POPC phosphate was slightly offset (2.7 Å) from the proposed CDR-L1 crystallographic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and instead localized to FR-L3 stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network from Ser83 hydroxyl, Gly84 backbone amide, and Asn85 C-alpha proton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Simultaneously, the POPC choline moiety occupied the precise crystallographic CDR-L1 site, wherein the choline cation was coordinated by four pre-organized unpaired backbone carbonyls stemming from the specific CDR-L1 short loop helix conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We find these bivalent complexes engaging both moieties of the lipid phosphocholine (PC) zwitterion at this CDR-L1 FR-L3 groove with &gt;70% occupancy overall across replicate simulations with high stability: 0.5 Å RMSF for CDR-L1–choline site and 0.5 Å RMSF for FR-L3–phosphate site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

The time-averaged per-residue lipid interaction profile demonstrates how 10E8 uses both heavy (CDR-H3) and light chain loops (CDRs L1, L2, L3; FR-L3) to orient the antibody geometry on the membrane surface to position 10E8’s phospholipid binding groove site at the headgroup-rich bilayer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These simulations supplement experimental findings with novel atomic details to establish that genetically distinct MPER antibodies share a consistent mechanism of utilizing CDR loops and framework to mediate bilayer interactions, with 10E8 utilizing FR-L3 for phosphate specificity in a stable lipid complex to anchor this bnAb at the membrane surface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>10E8 bivalent lipid headgroup interaction and bilayer insertion predicted in MD simulationagrees with proposed crystallographic lipid binding pocket.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top left, representative frame from MD simulation of lipid interacting with 10E8 Fab.

Fab surface geometries were defined by immersion depths of each CDR loop and two global domain angles relative to membrane plane and thresholded to distinguish seven substates, distributing well into population fractions from 5% to 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–H</xref>). Clustering of all bnAb simulation time together expectedly resulted in 4E10 and PGZL1 mapping to shared macroscopic states while the more light-chain directed 10E8 clustered separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B, C</xref>), reflecting the large differences to CDR-H1 depth and approach angle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Upon clustering the 4E10 ensemble, interestingly, all substates maintained 86–98% occupancy of the CDR-H1 phospholipid complex, whereas 10E8 and PGZL1 ensemble substates showed more conformation-specific variance in their respective phospholipid binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E, G, I</xref>). For example, two 10E8 substates exhibit low CDR-L1 PC headgroup occupancy (23%, 33%) due to a domain rotation (20–30<italic>°</italic>) resulting in more CDR-H contacts at the expense of the more typical CDR-L interactions typically observed for 10E8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4I</xref>). These findings highlight the important interplay between bnAbs’ preferred surface orientation and loop composition to form these conformationally sensitive anchoring complexes through positioning of the key phospholipid-binding loops. Loop composition and conformational ensembles are likely honed together during the maturation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Antigen influence on membrane bound conformations and lipid binding sites for LN01</title><p>We next studied bnAb LN01 to interrogate differences in the antibody surface-bound conformational ensemble and phospholipid interactions in the context of a transmembrane (TM) antigen, utilizing the availability of Fab crystal structures complexed with an MPER-TM fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>). MPER-bound LN01 structures bind one phospholipid and one dodecyl-PC detergent in its CDRs, implying possible paratope-epitope-membrane cooperativity in the neutralization mechanism and two putative phospholipid sites anchoring the bnAb to membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The PC headgroup binding site resides in the CDR-H3-L1-L2 inter-chain groove, with the lipid phosphate engaged by CDR-L1 Lys31 via salt bridge and the choline moiety interacting in a cation-pi cage with Tyr32 and CDR-H3 Tyr100g. When present, MPER contributes additional choline-aromatic stacking (Trp680, Tyr681). The second more solvent-exposed site lies between CDR-H1 and -H2, ordering PS or PC headgroups in crystal structures.

Initial membrane surface geometries for apo and MPER-bound states predicted using PPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2019</xref>), which accounted for solvation of the MPER-TM fragment, lead to similar embedded configurations having CDR-H3 deeply inserted with surface contacts from framework H3, light chain (CDR-L1, L3), and heavy chain (CDR-H1, L2). Across three 1 μs replicates each, those loops remained inserted and adopt ensembles similar to the starting conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, K, L</xref>). The MPER-antibody interface including key interactions (e.g. Trp100H to Thr676 H-bond) remained stable. The TM domain maintains a continuous helix through MPER without kinking in a stable tilted geometry (minimal rotation about helix axis) that enables the previously observed snorkeling and hydration of TM Arg686 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hollingsworth et al., 2018</xref>). In both apo and MPER-TM-bound replicates, several POPC binding events were observed within the CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove at atomic accuracy when compared to dodecyl-PC headgroup position in LN01 X-ray structures, with the same sidechain interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–J</xref>). In contrast to PGZL1, 4E10, and 10E8 simulations, phospholipids in LN01’s CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove site have much lower kinetic stability and occupancy: ~30% and~40% aggregate occupancy for MPER-TM-bound and apo, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Occupancy at the second crystallographic CDR-H1-H2 PS/PC site was negligible within any trajectory. Thus, unbiased MD identifies the CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove as the primary phospholipid anchoring site for LN01 in biologically realistic membranes both alone and when bound to TM-embedded MPER, and further emphasizes the importance of lipid in LN01’s maturation and neutralization mechanism.</p><p>Two interesting behaviors stood out in LN01 simulations. First, an additional new CDR-phospholipid binding site was observed reproducibly across apo and MPER-TM-bound trajectories at an alternative groove comprised of and CDR-H2, CDR-H3, and FR-L2 we termed the Loading Site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–J</xref>). Phospholipids appeared to readily exchange the ~7 Å distance between this Loading Site and the primary ‘X-ray’ CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove phospholipid binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although, the two sites were often simultaneously occupied. In the Loading Site, lipid headgroup phosphate oxygens were coordinated by hydrogen bonds to LN01 Tyr100g, Tyr49, and Tyr52 – and optionally to gp41 Trp680 if present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). Bivalent interaction with the headgroup choline occurs simultaneously via a similar electrostatic interactions and cation-pi cage motif from Tyr49, Tyr52, Thr53, Thr100c, Ser100d, and Tyr100g sidechains. The Loading site was occupied more often than the X-ray site: 78% and 58% simulation time for MPER-TM-bound and apo LN01 replicates respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>The second notable behavior observed was that antigen-free LN01 sampled a broader range of geometries at the membrane surface, characterized by two angles describing the Fab relative to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). LN01 complexed with MPER-TM was more deeply and extensively embedded than LN01 alone and resulted in a more focused conformation landscape – aligned with the minimal dynamics of the MPER-TM orientation. Protein-lipid interaction profiles reflect consistency in the protein features mediating membrane association between apo and MPER-TM-bound trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K, L</xref>), with CDR-L and FR-L3 more inserted upon TM antigen engagement upon the minor rearrangement to engage transmembrane antigen. Critically, while apo LN01 favors a different geometry (positive Rotation angle) its membrane surface ensemble heavily samples the major conformation adopted in MPER-TM-bound state (negative Rotation angle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). This observation that LN01’s surface-bound geometry is predisposed for transmembrane antigen engagement suggests that maturing bnAbs’ sequences and structures are primed for the membrane interaction key to access MPER and form the neuralization complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Coarse-grain ab initio insertion simulations capture biologically relevant membrane-bound conformations</title><p>Next, we used extended sampling time afforded by Martini coarse-grained (CG) simulations to more thoroughly explore the process of antibody insertion to lipid bilayers and landscape of feasible bnAb surface-bound conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corey et al., 2019</xref>).

Simulations captured bilayer surface scanning behavior preceding insertion and numerous dissociation events, pointing to the reversibility and dynamics of the process. As a reference, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was tested similarly. BSA’s documented weak affinity for lipid bilayer association (low millimolar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruggeri et al., 2013</xref>) aligns with the drastically reduced membrane contact events (2/18) and lack of sustained insertion observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

For 10E8, Cluster C started and finished in membrane-bound orientations analogous to the pre-inserted simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), although the Fab adopted a slightly different protein-lipid interaction pattern with much shallower CDR-H3 insertion, the bivalent CDR-L1 phospholipid complex still readily formed with high occupancy (&gt;70%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Thus, these multi-scale simulations demonstrate that unbiased CG modeling can generate stable membrane-bound conformations ab initio that integrate smoothly into atomistic simulations which are biologically relevant, in that they capture key phospholipid complexes seen in laboratory experiments inferred to be critical for bnAb function.</p><p>CG sampling also explored additional alternative membrane-bound geometries, which we assessed for kinetic stability in integrative atomic simulations to discern secondary protein binding modes or intermediate conformations aiding membrane association (e.g. preliminary surface-scanning) from simple artifacts. The trajectory initiated from PGZL1’s CG cluster A adopts a novel conformation stable on the 500 ns timescale with CDR-H3 inserted, favoring lipid-CDR-L interactions over CDR-H, that was not competent to complex phospholipids at CDR-H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). All-atom simulation from one alternate conformation of 10E8, CG cluster A, rapidly dissociated from the membrane within 50 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), showing this integrative MD distinguishes this state as an unstable likely artifact. Interestingly, the all-atom trajectory starting from CG cluster B trended towards the same novel conformation as cluster A, but remained stably inserted and bound phospholipid at the CDR-L1 site at high occupancy (70 %), albeit having shallower CDR-H3 insertion alongside canonical 10E8 CDR-L embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). These simulations hint at the feasibility to study compatibility of these lipid complex with broader Fab-membrane geometries, and reveal the need for orthogonally evaluating these conformations such as by biased simulations (e.g. potential of mean force, PMF) which we address later in this manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we modelled the orientation of a full-length IgG based on the simulated position of each bnAb Fab to ascertain how sterically feasible a bivalent Fab-membrane interaction could be and possibility of avidity effects in mechanism. The resulting full-length IgG geometries shows that with one membrane-bound Fab, it is very unlikely a second Fabs can simultaneously engage the bilayer due to restriction from the IgG hinge – except for the case of an extraordinarily flexible hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Biased pulling simulations distinguish experimentally characterized affinity differences</title><p>Finally, we applied biased constant velocity atomistic simulations to compute the force required to dissociate a Fab bound to lipid bilayers – providing a binding strength estimate akin to force spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Doing so tested whether this approach could connect the observed bnAb anchoring phospholipid complexes and membrane-bound conformations with physiological properties such as lipid bilayer affinity and neutralization potency. If informative, this method offers an expedient alternative to canonical free energy calculations such as PMFs which demand tens of µs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corey et al., 2019</xref>), prohibitive for characterizing many antibody variants.

Interestingly, two of three starting poses adopt the CDR-H3 rotamer conformation of Trp100b projecting down towards lipid tails (‘Trp-Down’ state) while the third starting pose has Trp100b in a flipped rotamer pointing towards the lipid-water interface (‘Trp-Up’ state; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Surprisingly, the rupture forces from trajectories starting in the Trp-Down state were nearly identical (&lt;2% difference), and rupture forces from trajectories starting from the Trp-Up state were consistently lower (27 and 47% greater) for 50 and 100 ns, respectively. This cursory trial exhibited promising conformational sensitivity in distinguishing different protein-lipid interactions in a CDR loop and precision from similar initial Fab conformations.</p><p>We next compared the behavior of 4E10 with its well-studied CDR-H3 WAWA variant, the W100aΔA-W100bΔA double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). WAWA has similar K<sub>d</sub> to MPER as 4E10, but significantly reduced affinity to empty HIV-like liposomes and neutralization efficacy (&gt;100-fold higher IC<sub>50</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montero et al., 2012</xref>). Across replicates from different starting states for 4E10 (n=9) and WAWA (n=11), rupture force calculations showed average forces (± S.E.M.) of 63.8±2.8 kJ/nm/mol and 48.0±2.6 kJ/nm/mol, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>), correctly indicating the 4E10 ensemble has a stronger membrane interaction (32 ± 13%; p-value &lt;0.001). Thus, this in silico estimation effectively discerns antibody variants whose high and low lipid bilayer affinities have been previous measured and reinforces the molecular link between WAWA’s reduced membrane binding and neutralization.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated experimentally characterized PGZL1 variants that recapitulate possible stages of a germline maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Mature PGZL1 has relatively high affinity to the MPER epitope peptide (K<sub>d</sub> = 10 nM) and demonstrates great breadth and potency, neutralizing 84% of a 130-strain panel. An ‘Intermediate’ PGZL1 with V-gene germline reversion (gVmDmJ, 100% CDR-H3 identity) showed a modest affinity loss (K<sub>d</sub> = 64 nM), while neutralization potency and breadth (12%) were more substantially reduced than expected due to affinity alone – attributed to impaired lipid bilayer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The fully ‘Germline’ reverted variant (gVgDgM) had no detectable MPER peptide affinity or neutralization. Ensembles for Germline and Intermediate Fab pulling simulations were prepared from unbiased all-atom trajectories, starting from predicted hydrophobicity-optimized inserted poses. The variants adopt insertion geometries like the mature Fab, facilitated by the mostly conserved CDR-H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but did not form CDR-H1-phospholipid complexes. Significantly lower pulling forces were required to dissociate Intermediate and Germline PGZL1 from bilayers, 37.5±14.9 kJ/nm/mol and 41.2±11.7 kJ/nm/mol respectively, than for mature PGZL1, 56.1±11.6 kJ/nm/mol (p&lt;0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Germline PGZL1 likely reflects kinetically stable but low-affinity interactions, representing baseline of rupture forces required to dissociate CDR-inserted antibodies. While the difference in Germline and Intermediate force distributions was not significant (p&gt;0.4), more higher force events were observed for the Intermediate. These results provide further evidence that bnAb phospholipid binding features are acquired and honed along the maturation pathway, entrenching the connection between positive selection of antibody-lipid interactions and neutralization efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a roadmap for applying multi-scale molecular simulations to characterize the biophysical underpinning of lipid membrane interactions within the mechanism of HIV MPER bnAbs. The approaches demonstrated and principles discerned improve understanding of maturation pathways for antibodies targeting membrane-proximal epitopes and should enrich data-driven design of HIV immunogens. Our detailed simulations supplement in vitro binding and crystallographic evidence in establishing that bnAbs develop highly specific phospholipid interactions that facilitate access to the MPER epitope and can participate in epitope-paratope interface in context of full lipid bilayers. These results add validation to which out of the many possible ions and short-chain lipid moieties ordered within those crystal structures may be inferred as putative bilayer phospholipids, a critical consideration in antibody and vaccine design. The additional simulations outlined with different lipid ratios and varied antigens as well as more rigorous PMF studies, could be applied to better inform affinity thresholds and energetic relationships paramount to the lipid complexes and conformational preferences reported here. Furthermore, these modeling approaches should have utility in finding membrane-targeting elements in antibodies towards identifying causes of autoimmune stress. Likewise, the analysis tools in this work might be practical for aiding antibody engineering targeting membrane proteins, for example grafting lipid phosphate binding structural motifs or amino acid sequences with desirable membrane associating properties into distinct antibody loops regions.</p><p>Further, these simulations can serve future examination of molecular details concerning the genetic origins and developmental pathways for incipient lipid-binding antibodies. Through natural or vaccine-induced immunity, coaxing the immune system to develop both lipid and antigen affinity (possibly even cooperativity) during maturation is a difficult task, and hindered by downregulation of membrane binding precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodnow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verkoczy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>). Likewise, MPER bnAbs are difficult to induce and, until recent clinical trials, have only been isolated from patients with chronic HIV-infection and sustained immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rujas et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rujas et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiegler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zwick et al., 2001</xref>). Modern vaccine strategies often elicit certain subsets of precursor B cells, often targeting specific germline genes, in attempt to guide antibodies’ maturation of specific molecular features intended for the targeted epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jardine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steichen et al., 2016</xref>). The question remains whether particular germline genes and lineages are privileged for successful maturation as membrane-targeting (or MPER-targeting) antibodies. This notion is supported by 4E10 and PGZL1 sharing a germline gene (VH1-69) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref> and nearly identical membrane interactions. Certain germlines genes may be predisposed with inherent basal membrane affinity or be favored precursor scaffolds for compatibility with evolution of lipid-binding properties. Specific CDR lipid-binding motifs are predicted to be encoded early in maturation processes for PGZL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), namely the CDR-H1 loop, and complemented by mutations at membrane-contacting FR-H3 and CDR-H3 loop residues incorporated later in maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Across MPER bnAbs, membrane-binding molecular features are likely acquired at strategic timepoints throughout development to balance poly-specificity and evade autoimmune checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Experimental databases of germlines genes usage and of B-cell repertoires sequenced during immunization courses would be ideally paired with the simulations described here to investigate in vivo filtering of lineages with lipid-binding variants and assess possible rules of the autoimmune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briney et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Beyond gp41-targeting antibodies and lipid antibodies in autoinflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dema and Charles, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tao and Kriss, 1982</xref>) or microbial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asherson and Cervera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sène et al., 2008</xref>), we suspect a broader scope of positive outcomes from antibody tolerance and interaction with lipid bilayers may occur in Nature, thus is currently underestimated and underutilized. Although host cross-specificity of 4E10 is well documented, the vastly reduced poly-reactivity of PGZL1 and 10E8 inspires optimism that maturation of phospholipid interactions and membrane tolerance may be incorporated into strategies for vaccine design and therapeutic antibodies for other membrane proteins with conserved buried epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soto et al., 2016</xref>).

CDR loop residues were selected based on IMGT numbering definitions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Membrane embedded surface area</title><p>The membrane embedded surface area was calculated by measuring a fully solvated Fab solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and subtracting the membrane embedded Fab SASA every 0.5 ns of atomistic simulation time. SASA was calculated with VMD measure plugin which implements a point-based random sampling approach with 1.4 nm sphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Interaction profiles</title><p>Interaction profiles were generated by defining the depth of each residue relative to the lipid bilayer over every 0.5 ns for atomistic simulations or every 30 ns for coarse grain simulations. The phosphate layer depth range was defined by calculating the average Z height of the top leaflet phosphates and expanding +/- 3 Å to account for headgroup size and thermal fluctuations in space. The glycerol layer was defined from the bottom of the phosphate layer – 4 Å based on glycerol molecule heights. The hydrocarbon layer was defined as up to 8 Å angstroms below the bottom of the glycerol layer. Because of the four to one mapping of atoms to beads in coarse grain representations, the layer definitions were expanded by 4 Å for coarse grain interaction profiling. Only the top leaflet layers were defined as a Fab was not observed to embedded deeper than below the top leaflet. Any non-lipid interacting residues were mapped to the solution layer of the system. The position of each residue in the Fab was mapped to a defined layer in the system based on residue Z height and time in each layer was aggregated over the total time of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Spontaneous membrane association</title><p>To define an antibody that associated with the membrane in coarse grain systems, the distance of each Fab reside to the phosphate plane in the top or bottom bilayer was measures. This allowed us to account for a Fab that may diffuse across periodic boundaries in the defined system box. Tracking Fab residue positions every 30 ns, if a residue was within 4 Å of the phosphate layer, it was considered a Fab-membrane association.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Structural bioinformatics</title><p>The PICES server was used to curate a list of 33,372 X-ray structure PDB entries with resolution below than 2.5 Å and less than 90% sequence similarity were downloaded into an in-house database. Method of Accelerated Search for Tertiary Ensemble Representatives (MASTER) was used to query protein structural fragments against the custom representative database to return hits with a maximum backbone RMSD of 1.8 Å. These backbone matches were then re-queried to find hits containing sulfate or phosphate anions within 1.5 Å RMSD from the initial query phosphate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Clustering and medoid definitions</title><p>Feature-based clustering was performed on the atomistic or coarse grain simulations. An 8-feature vector was defined for every 0.5 ns in atomistic simulation time that was composed of angle of approach, angle of rotation, and CDRHL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 loop center of mass depths. In these clustering approaches, hierarchical agglomerative clustering with Ward’s linkage method was used to minimize the variance between clusters defined. Euclidian distance thresholds were selected for each clustering experiment (antibody system and simulation scheme) to define clusters that optimize (macroscopic substates) or minimize (microscopic substates) divergence for average geometric descriptors across clusters in the context total clustering space.</p><p>To reduce the computational cost of clustering coarse grain simulation data, the feature vector was reduced to only include angle of rotation and angle of approach and sampled every 30 ns of simulation time. From here the same clustering methods as described before were applied and defined Euclidian distance cutoffs to generate three clusters from the sampled time for coarse grain systems. Applied K-medoids clustering with an n equal to 1 was used to identify medoids that are the best representative snapshots of clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Coarse grain to all-atom backmapping</title><p>Spontaneous insertion coarse grain clusters for 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8 were defined using vectors describing each frame by angle of approach and angle of rotation. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed with Ward’s linkage method was used to minimize the variance between clusters. Euclidian distance thresholds were selected for so that three clusters were defined in for each antibody. Representative medoid frames were selected by calculating the frame that minimizes within-cluster sum of squares with Kmedoids algorithm from scikit-learn Clustering module.</p><p>To revert medoid frames from spontaneously associated coarse grain substates into atomistic representations, the original atomic Fab model (PDB ids: 2<italic>F</italic>X9, 6O3D, 5T85 for 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, respectively) was oriented relative to an assembled atomistic membrane (70% POPC, 25% Chol, 5% POPA) based on the corresponding coarse grain geometric representation by transforming the angle of approach and angle of rotation vectors. After docking the Fab, clashing lipid molecules were removed. Systems were solvated with TIP3 water molecules and neutralized with ions to a total concentrations of 0.15 mM NaCl. Minimization, equilibration, and production simulations were performed as previously described for atomistic simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Constant velocity pulling simulations</title><p>To generate starting conformation ensembles, atomic Fab models were docked into HIV-like lipid bilayers with the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) Positioning of Proteins in Membrane 2.0 (PPM) server. 500 ns equilibration simulations were performed as described in Atomistic Simulations and frames were extracted every 50 ns. The same Fab models were used for 4E10, PGZl1, and 10E8 as in primary atomistic simulations. A PGZL1 intermediate model was constructed by building loops into PDB ID 6O41 with ModLoop. PGZL1 germline model was built by introducing mutations into the PGZL1 intermediate model in PyMOL. Both PGZL1 germline and PGZL1 intermediate models were simulated for 50ns in solution with the same protocol in Atomistic Simulations prior to docking into bilayers and 500 ns equilibrations.</p><p>For pulling trajectories, starting frames were simulated with 1000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>3</sup> restraint on lipids for 100 ns production runs. The Berendsen thermostat was applied to protein, lipid, and solvent groups independently coupled to a 310 K bath with temperature time constant 1.0 ps<sup>–1</sup>. The Berendsen barostat was used with semi-isotropic coupling and a 5.0 ps<sup>–1</sup> pressure time constant. Center of mass pulling was turned on between protein and lipid groups. Umbrella sampling potential was applied between the two groups at a rate of 0.03 nm/ns with a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/nm in the direction away from the bilayer. Statistical comparisons for comparing max forces across systems were using with Tukey’s multiple comparison test and unpaired t-tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90139-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Representative simulation coordinate files and example equilibration and production files for simluation set up are uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13830877">Zenodo</ext-link>.

In this study, the authors present a tour de force analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that demonstrate how several HIV-neutralizing membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-targeting antibodies associate with a model lipid bilayer.</p><p>First, the authors compared how three MPER antibodies, 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, associated with model membranes, constructed with two lipid compositions similar to native viral membranes. They found that the related antibodies 4E10 and PGZL1 strongly associate with a phospholipid near heavy chain loop 1, consistent with prior crystallographic studies. They also discovered that a previously unappreciated framework region between loops 2-3 in the 4E10/PGZL1 heavy chain contributes to membrane association. Simulations of 10E8, an antibody from a different lineage, revealed several differences from published X-ray structures. Namely, a phosphatidylcholine binding site was offset and includes significant interaction with a nearby framework region. The revised manuscript demonstrates that these lipid interactions are robust to alterations in membrane composition and rigidity. However, it does not address the reverse-that phospholipids known experimentally not to associate with these antibodies (if any such lipids exist) also fail to interact in MD simulations.</p><p>Next, the authors simulate another MPER-targeting antibody, LN01, with a model HIV membrane either containing or missing an MPER antigen fragment within. Of note, LN01 inserts more deeply into the membrane when the MPER antigen is present, supporting an energy balance between the lowest energy conformations of LN01, MPER, and the complex. These simulations recapitulate lipid binding interactions solved in published crystallographic studies but also lead to the discovery of a novel lipid binding site the authors term the &quot;Loading Site&quot;, which could guide future experiments with this antibody.</p><p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding. These simulations facilitated greater sampling of different initial antibody geometries relative to membrane. These CG simulations , which cannot resolve atomistic interactions, are nonetheless compelling because negative controls (ab 13h11, BSA) that should not associate with membrane indeed sample significantly less membrane.</p><p>Distinct geometries derived from CG simulations were then used to initialize all-atom MD simulations to study insertion in finer detail (e.g., phospholipid association), which largely recapitulate their earlier results, albeit with more unbiased sampling. The multiscale model of an initial CG study with broad geometric sampling, followed by all-atom MD, provides a generalized framework for such simulations.</p><p>Finally, the authors construct velocity pulling simulations to estimate the energetics of antibody membrane embedding. Using the multiscale modelling workflow to achieve greater geometric sampling, they demonstrate that their model reliably predicts lower association energetics for known mutations in 4E10 that disrupt lipid binding. However, the model does have limitations: namely, its ability to predict more subtle changes along a lineage-intermediate mutations that reduce lipid binding are indistinguishable from mutations that completely ablate lipid association. Thus, while large/binary differences in lipid affinity might be predictable, the use of this method as a generative model are likely more limited.</p><p>The MD simulations conducted throughout are rigorous and the analysis are extensive, creative, and biologically inspired. Overall, these analyses provide an important mechanistic characterization of how broadly neutralizing antibodies associate with lipids proximal to membrane-associated epitopes to drive neutralization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90139.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Maillie et al. have carried out a set of multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the viral membrane and four broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope trimer.

These simulations recapitulate lipid binding interactions solved in published crystallographic studies but also lead to the discovery of a novel lipid binding site the authors term the &quot;Loading Site&quot;, which could guide future experiments with this antibody.</p><p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding.

Using the multiscale modelling workflow to achieve greater geometric sampling, they demonstrate that their model reliably predicts lower association energetics for known mutations in 4E10 that disrupt lipid binding. However, the model does have limitations: namely, its ability to predict more subtle changes along a lineage-intermediate mutations that reduce lipid binding are indistinguishable from mutations that completely ablate lipid association. Thus, while large/binary differences in lipid affinity might be predictable, the use of this method as a generative model are likely more limited.</p><p>The MD simulations conducted throughout are rigorous and the analysis are extensive, creative, and biologically inspired.

In this study, the authors present a tour de force analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that demonstrate how several HIV-neutralizing membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-targeting antibodies associate with a model lipid bilayer.</p><p>First, the authors compared how three MPER antibodies, 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, associated with model membranes, constructed with a lipid composition similar to the native virion. They found that the related antibodies 4E10 and PGZL1 strongly associate with a phospholipid near heavy chain loop 1, consistent with prior crystallographic studies. They also discovered that a previously unappreciated framework region between loops 2-3 in the 4E10/PGZL1 heavy chain contributes to membrane association. Simulations of 10E8, an antibody from a different lineage, revealed several differences from published X-ray structures. Namely, a phosphatidylcholine binding site was offset and includes significant interaction with a nearby framework region.</p><p>Next, the authors simulate another MPER-targeting antibody, LN01, with a model HIV membrane either containing or missing an MPER antigen fragment within. Of note, LN01 inserts more deeply into the membrane when the MPER antigen is present, supporting an energy balance between the lowest energy conformations of LN01, MPER, and the complex. Additional contacts and conformational restraints imposed by ectodomain regions of the envelope glycoprotein, however, remain unaddressed-the size of such simulations likely runs into technical limitations including sampling and compute time.</p><p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding. These simulations facilitated greater sampling of different initial antibody geometries relative to membrane.

However, given the large amount of data presented within the manuscript, the text would benefit from clearer subsections that delineate discrete mechanistic discoveries, particularly for experimentalists interested in antibody discovery and design. One area the paper does not address involves the polyreactivity associated with membrane binding antibodies-MD simulations and/or pulling velocity experiments with model membranes of different compositions, with and without model antigens, would be needed. Finally, given the challenges in initializing these simulations and their limitations, the text regarding their generalized use for discovery, rather than mechanism, could be toned down.</p><p>Overall, these analyses provide an important mechanistic characterization of how broadly neutralizing antibodies associate with lipids proximal to membrane-associated epitopes to drive neutralization.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Maillie et al. have carried out a set of multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the viral membrane and four broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope trimer.

I would suggest the following: moving the sentence, &quot;4E10 and PG2L1 are structurally homologous&quot; immediately after the paragraph discussing the simulation initiation. Then, add a sentence that directly compares their experimental affinity, neutralization, and polyreactivity of 4E10 and PG2L1 (later, an unintroduced idea pops up, &quot;These patterns may in part explain 4E10's greater polyreactivity&quot;). Next, lead into the discussion of the MD simulation data with something to the effect of: &quot;Given these similarities, we first compared mechanisms of membrane insertion between 4E10 and PG2L1 to bolster confidence in our predictions&quot;.

Are there experimental mutations in this loop that do not affect affinity (e.g., to a soluble gp41 peptide), but do affect neutralization (like the WAWA mutation for CDR-H3, discussed later)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the Introduction (para 2) and Results (4E10/PGZL1 sub-section) to give more balanced discussion of CDRs H1 &amp; H3. That includes referencing experimental data addressing the reviewer’s question; a PGZL1 clone H4K3 where mutations to CDRH1 were introduced and shown have minimal impact on affinity to MPER peptide via ELISA and BLI, but those mutant bnAbs had significantly reduced neutralization efficacy (PMC6879610).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence &quot;These phospholipid binding events were highly stable, typically persisting for hundreds of nanoseconds&quot; should be moved down to immediately precede, &quot;[However], in a PGZL1 simulation, we observed a&quot;.

These mutants also decreased Kd by approximately 20X, and based on the co-crystal structure with the TM antigen (PDB: 4XCC), seem to play a more direct role in antigen contact. Additionally, these residues should be highlighted on a figure, otherwise it's difficult to understand why they are important for membrane association.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for deep engagement to these supporting experimental details. The R29A+Y32A 10E8 mutant referenced in the text showed only 4-fold Kd increase, a modest change for an SPR binding experiment. Whereas R29E+Y32E 10E8 mutant resulted in 40x Kd increase, the “20x” the reviewer refers to. Both 10E8 mutants showed similar drastically reduced breadth and potency of over 2 orders of magnitude on average.</p><p>These mutated CDR-L1 residues are not directly involved in antigen contact and adopt the same loop helix conformation when antigen is bound. A minor impact on antigen binding affinity could be due altering pre-organization of CDR loops upon losing interactions from the Tyr &amp; Arg sidechains - particularly Tyr31 in contact with CDR-H3.</p><p>As per the suggestion, clearer annotated figure panel denoting these sidechains has been added to Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1 for 10E8 analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Structural searches querying... identified between 10^5 and 2*10^6...&quot; - why is this value represented as such a large range?

It's otherwise difficult to attribute number of occurrences within the 2 A cutoff to biological significance, as this number is not put in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment to contextualize the range and relative frequency of the bnAb loop conformations. RMSD and length of loop are the key parameters, which can be controlled by searching reference loops of similar length. The main point of the backbone-level searching is simply to imply the bnAb loops are not particularly rare when comparing loops of similar length.</p><p>We did as was suggested and added comparison to random loops of the same length to the main text, including a new Supplementary Table 4.</p><p>“…identified between 105 to 2∙106 geometrically similar sub-segments within natural proteins (&lt;2 Å RMSD)40, reflecting they are relatively prevalent (not rare) in the protein universe, comparing well with frequency of other surface loops of similar length in antibodies (Supplementary Table 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We next examined the geometries&quot; could start after its own new subheading. Moreover, while there's an emphasis on tilt for neutralization, there is not a figure clearly modelling the proposed Env tilt compared to the relatively planar bilayer. It would be helpful to have an additional panel somewhere that shows the orientation of the antibody (e.g., a representative pose) in the simulations relative to an appropriately curved membrane, Env, the binding conformation of the antibody to Env, and apo Env, given the tilting observed in PMID: 32348769 and theorized in PMC5338832. What additional conformational changes or tilting need to occur between the antibodies and Env to accomplish binding to their respective epitopes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for outlining an interesting element to consider in our analysis of a multi-step binding mechanism for MPER antibodies. We added additional figure panels in the supplement to outline the similarities and differences between our simulations and Fabs with the inferred membranes in cryo-EM experiments of full-length HIV Env. The simulated Fabs’ angles are very similar with only minor tilting to match the cryo-EM antibody-membrane geometries.</p><p>We added Figure 1-figure supplement 1A &amp; Figure 2-figure supplement 2A, and alter to text to reflect this:</p><p>“The primary difference is Env-bound Fabs in cryo-EM adopt slightly more shallow approach angles (~15_°_) relative to the bilayer normal. The simulated bnAbs in isolation prefer orientations slightly more upright, but presenting CDRs at approximately the same depth and orientation. Thus, these bnAbs appear pre-disposed in their membrane surface conformations, needing only a minor tilt to form the membrane-antibody-antigen neutralization complex.”</p><p>Env tilt dynamics and membrane curvature of natural virions may reconcile some of these differences. Recent in situ tomography of Full-length Env in pseudo-virions corroborates our approximation of flat bilayers over the short length scales around Env.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence &quot;we next examined the geometries&quot; mentions &quot;potential energy cost, if any, for reorienting...&quot;. However, there's no further discussions of geometry or energy cost within this section. Please rephrase, or move this figure to main and increase discussion associated with the various conformational ensembles, their geometry, and their phospholipid association.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer highlights, the unbiased simulations and our analysis do not explicitly evaluate energetics. We removed this phrase, and now only allude to the minimal energy barrier between the similar geometric conformations, relative to the tilting &amp; access requirements for antigen binding mechanism.</p><p>“The apparent barrier for re-orientation is likely much less energetically constraining than shielding glycans and accessibility of MPER”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;.. describing the spectrum of surface-bound conformations&quot; cites the wrong figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing this error; we correct the figure reference to (Figure 2-figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please comment on the significance of how global clustering (Fig. S5A-C) was similar for 4E10 and PGZL1, but different for 10E8 (e.g., blue, orange, and yellow clusters for 4E10 and PHZL1 versus cyan, red, and green clusters for 10E8). As the cyan cluster seems to be much closer in Euclidian space to the 4E10/PGZL1 clusters, it might warrant additional analysis. What do these clusters represent in terms of structure/conformation?
