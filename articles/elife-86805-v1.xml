patterns. Antipsychotic drugs are a class of small molecules with relatively broad binding affinity for a variety of neuromodulator receptors that, in humans, can prevent or ameliorate psychosis. How these drugs influence the function of cortical circuits, and in particular their ability to distinguish between externally and self-generated activity patterns, is still largely unclear. To have experimental control over self-generated sensory feedback, we used a virtual reality environment in which the coupling between movement and visual feedback can be altered. We then used widefield calcium imaging to determine the cell type-specific functional effects of antipsychotic drugs in mouse dorsal cortex under different conditions of visuomotor coupling. By comparing cell type-specific activation patterns between locomotion onsets that were experimentally coupled to self-generated visual feedback and locomotion onsets that were not coupled, we show that deep cortical layers were differentially activated in these two conditions. We then show that the antipsychotic drug clozapine disrupted visuomotor integration at locomotion onsets also primarily in deep cortical layers. Given that one of the key components of visuomotor integration in cortex is long-range cortico-cortical connections, we tested whether the effect of clozapine was detectable in the correlation structure of activity patterns across dorsal cortex. We found that clozapine as well as two other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole and haloperidol, resulted in a strong reduction in correlations of layer 5 activity between cortical areas and impaired the spread of visuomotor prediction errors generated in visual cortex. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that a major functional effect of antipsychotic drugs is a selective alteration of long-range layer 5-mediated communication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antipsychotic drugs</kwd><kwd>predictive processing</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008273</institution-id><institution>Novartis Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell type-specific effects of antipsychotic drugs in cortex could provide a basis for a functional screen of antipsychotic efficacy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under normal conditions, self-generated movements are coupled to sensory feedback in different modalities. Locomotion, for example, is coupled to proprioceptive feedback from muscle movements, somatosensory and auditory feedback from touching the ground, vestibular feedback from translational acceleration, and visual feedback in the form of expanding visual flow. This coupling is key to our brainâs ability to learn internal models of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jordan and Rumelhart, 1992</xref>). Internal models are the transformations between cortical areas and can be used to predict the sensory consequences of movement. Hallucinations and delusions can be explained as a misconfiguration of these internal models: inaccurate predictions of the sensory consequences of movements can result in self-generated activity that is not correctly distinguished from externally driven activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frith, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Self-generated movements result in broad activation of most regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), including some primary sensory areas like visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>) where they have been shown to depend on visual context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>). The framework of predictive processing postulates that in cortex, these movement-related signals are internal model-based predictions of the sensory consequences of movement that are compared to externally generated bottom-up input to compute prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Rao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). Evidence for this interpretation has mainly come from the discovery of movement-related prediction error responses in a variety of different cortical regions and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Audette et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heindorf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley and Miall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</xref>), and the observation that top-down inputs from motor areas of cortex appear to convey movement-related predictions of sensory input to sensory areas of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). The neurons on which the opposing bottom-up input and top-down prediction converge are referred to as prediction error neurons and are thought to reside primarily in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>). To complete the circuit, there also needs to be a population of neurons that integrate over prediction error responses. These are referred to as internal representation neurons. It is still unclear which cortical neuron type functions as internal representation neurons, but based on anatomical arguments it has been speculated that they can be found in deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In humans, externally driven and self-generated activity patterns can be experimentally separated at least partially, for example, by showing subjects a visual stimulus and later asking them to visualize the same stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le Bihan et al., 1993</xref>). This type of experiment is considerably more difficult to perform in animals. Using movement as a proxy for self-generated activity patterns, however, using a virtual environment, we can compare a condition in which self-generated and externally generated activity patterns are correlated to a condition in which they are not. In the visual system, we can use a virtual reality environment to experimentally couple or decouple locomotion from visual flow feedback. We will refer to the former as a closed loop condition and to the latter as an open loop condition. Assuming the predictive processing model is correct, we should find differences in the activation patterns in dorsal cortex in response to locomotion onsets as a function of whether they occurred with or without coupled visual flow feedback. Both prediction error neurons and internal representation neurons should respond differentially. Thus, we set out to investigate whether there are differences between closed and open loop activation patterns of mouse dorsal cortex, and whether these differences are neuron type specific. If hallucinations are indeed the result of aberrant activation of internal representations, possibly as a result of misconfigured internal models, antipsychotic drugs should alter the differential activation patterns in these neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons distinguished closed and open loop visuomotor coupling</title><p>To investigate neuron type-specific differences in activity patterns at locomotion onsets with and without self-generated visual feedback in mouse dorsal cortex, we quantified locomotion onset activity using widefield calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</xref>). A GCaMP variant was expressed using either a retro-orbital injection of an AAV-PHP.eB vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2017</xref>), or a cross between a Cre line and the Ai148 GCaMP6 reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>) (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Mice expressed a GCaMP variant either brain wide (C57BL/6), or in genetically identified subsets of excitatory or inhibitory neurons using Cre driver lines. Please note, we use the term âbrain wideâ here to describe an expression pattern that was determined by the intersection of the AAV-PHP.eB tropism and the expression pattern of EF1Î± or hSyn1 promoters but that was otherwise brain wide (see Discussion). Prior to the start of the imaging experiments, mice were implanted with a crystal skull cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). We used crystal skull preparations as we found that hemodynamic artifacts were smaller in this preparation compared to those observed in clear skull preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For all experiments, mice were head-fixed and free to locomote on a spherical treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Activity from dorsal cortex was imaged while mice were in a closed loop visuomotor condition, in which locomotion on the spherical treadmill controlled forward movement in a virtual corridor. Following this, mice were exposed to an open loop condition during which mice were presented with a replay of the visual flow they had self-generated in the preceding closed loop condition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation patterns in deep cortical layers distinguished closed and open loop locomotion onsets more strongly than superficial layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of GCaMP expression strategy.

Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), we found that locomotion onset resulted in broad activation across most of dorsal cortex in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, comparing locomotion onsets in mice that expressed GCaMP6 only in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive layer 5 (L5) IT neurons, we found that the activation pattern was strikingly different between closed and open loop conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While locomotion onset in the open loop condition resulted in an increase in activity across dorsal cortex, similar to that observed in C57BL/6 mice with brain wide GCaMP expression, locomotion onset in the closed loop condition resulted in a very different activation pattern: In posterior parts of dorsal cortex, the activity decreased, while in anterior parts of the dorsal cortex, the activity increased. To quantify these activation patterns across mice, we selected six regions of interest (ROIs): primary visual cortex (V1), antero-medial secondary visual cortex (V2am), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), primary motor cortex (M1), anterior cingulate cortex at the level of bregma (A24b), and secondary motor cortex (M2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, closed loop locomotion onset resulted in similar activity patterns across these six regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This activity pattern was not markedly different from that observed during locomotion onsets in an open loop condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To quantify the contribution of visual flow onset to the closed loop locomotion onset activity, we measured responses to visual flow onsets that occurred in the absence of locomotion in the open loop condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In C57BL/6 mice with brain wide GCaMP expression, visual flow onsets resulted in responses that were small compared to those observed during locomotion onset, even in V1. Note that a visual flow onset is a relatively weak visual stimulus compared to a drifting grating stimulus. A grating stimulus is typically composed of a gray screen or a standing grating stimulus that suddenly transitions to a drifting grating, and thus the visual flow undergoes a very high acceleration. A visual flow onset in an open loop condition is the replay of previously self-generated visual flow and thus exhibits much lower visual flow acceleration. The absence of a strong visual flow onset response in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide is consistent with a high similarity of closed and open loop locomotion onset responses.</p><p>Different from what we found in mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, the closed loop locomotion onset patterns differed markedly when compared across the six ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, these activation patterns were different from those observed during open loop locomotion onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). While these responses could partially be explained by hemodynamic occlusion, the time course of hemodynamic occlusion in <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre mice that expressed eGFP in L5 IT neurons was similar to that observed in C57BL/6 mice that expressed eGFP brain wide and mainly resulted in a decrease of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, open loop visual flow onsets that occurred in the absence of locomotion resulted in quantifiable responses in V1 and V2am (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), but the closed loop locomotion onset responses in V1 could not be explained by the sum of locomotion and visual flow onset responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A and C</xref>). Most of the widefield signals we record here likely originate in compartments in superficial layers which are composed of axons and dendrites of local neurons, and long-range inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>) (see Discussion). To test how well the widefield signals recorded in V1 reflected local somatic activity in V1, we repeated the experiments using two-photon calcium imaging of somatic activity in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons. We found that while there were differences between the responses measured with widefield imaging and those measured at the soma, both for locomotion onset responses and for visual responses, these differences did not change our conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the differences between closed and open loop locomotion onset responses of L5 IT neurons in relation to those observed in other cortical neuron types, we repeated the experiments for the selection of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4AâI</xref>). For each neuron type, we quantified the similarity of the activity patterns associated with closed and open loop locomotion onsets by calculating the correlation coefficient between the activity traces in a window around locomotion onset (â5 s to +3 s) for each ROI (see Methods). Quantifying the differences in V1, we find that the similarity in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons was lower than that observed in all other neuron types tested, except for <italic>Ntsr1</italic> positive L6 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>). <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons and <italic>Ntsr1</italic> positive L6 neurons also exhibit a lower similarity than other neuron types when comparing the similarity across all ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Both in V1 across mice, as well as when comparing across all areas, we found the highest similarity between closed and open loop locomotion onsets across regions in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide. Thus, among the neuron types tested, excitatory neurons of deep cortical layers exhibited the largest differences between closed and open loop locomotion-related activation across all the selected cortical regions. The remarkable aspect of these findings is not that there are differences between closed and open loop locomotion onsets, particularly in visual regions of cortex one would perhaps expect to find differences, but that these differences are larger specifically in the deep cortical layers.</p><p>To quantify how the interaction between locomotion and visual flow feedback changes across dorsal cortex, we computed correlations between calcium activity and locomotion speed for each ROI, for closed and open loop conditions separately. In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, this correlation was comparable between closed and open loop conditions, was highest in posterior regions of dorsal cortex, and lower in more anterior regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, the correlation between locomotion speed and calcium activity in the closed loop condition was negative in posterior regions of dorsal cortex and positive in anterior regions. Conversely, in open loop conditions, the correlation was positive throughout dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). To test whether it was the coupling of visual flow that resulted in a reduction of the correlation in the closed loop condition or whether the presence of an uncoupled visual stimulus resulted in an increase of correlation in the open loop condition, we also compared these correlations to those observed when mice were locomoting in relative darkness (see Methods). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, the correlation of calcium activity with locomotion in darkness was indistinguishable from that in closed or open loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, an interesting pattern emerged. In visual regions of dorsal cortex, the correlation between locomotion speed and calcium activity in relative darkness resembled that observed in open loop conditions, while in frontal regions, it resembled that observed in closed loop conditions. In visual regions, the coupling of visual flow resulted in a reduction of correlation, while in frontal regions the presence of an uncoupled visual stimulus resulted in an increase of correlations. Thus, the difference between closed and open loop conditions likely had different origins in visual and frontal regions of dorsal cortex. Overall, we concluded that the coupling of locomotion and resulting visual flow feedback not only activated <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons differentially but did so throughout dorsal cortex, well beyond visual regions.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) neurons were differentially activated by locomotion depending on the type of visual feedback.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between calcium activity and locomotion speed in the closed loop (left) and open loop (right) conditions, calculated for each pixel in the image for one example C57BL/6 mouse that expressed GCaMP brain wide.

In our closed loop experiments, forward locomotion was a strong predictor of backward visual flow. It has been speculated that such predictions are used to compute prediction errors in L2/3 of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>). Prediction errors come in two variants: Positive prediction errors that signal more visual flow than predicted and negative prediction errors that signal less visual flow than predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). To probe for negative and positive prediction error signals, we quantified the responses to visuomotor mismatch events and to unexpected visual stimuli (representing less and more visual flow input than expected, respectively). Visuomotor mismatch was introduced by briefly (1 s) halting visual flow during self-generated feedback in the closed loop condition. Visual responses were elicited by presenting full-field (covering the entire toroidal screen) drifting grating stimuli to a passively observing mouse (see Methods). Please note, both types of prediction errors can be probed using a variety of stimuli, but the two we are using here, in our experience, are the most robust at eliciting strong responses in V1. In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, both visuomotor mismatch and grating stimuli resulted in increases of activity that were strongest and appeared first in visual regions of dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, visuomotor mismatch resulted in an increase of activity in V1, while grating onsets resulted in a decrease of activity in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, in dorsal cortex, both mismatch and drifting grating stimuli primarily activated visual cortex but resulted in opposing activation patterns in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons. An increase in activity to negative prediction errors and a decrease to positive prediction errors would be consistent with either a population of negative prediction error neurons or a type of internal representation neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>).

We speculated that the activation of such an internal representation would be particularly susceptible to substances that are known to reduce illusory percepts, like antipsychotic drugs. We thus quantified the changes in dorsal cortex activity associated with a single intraperitoneal injection of an antipsychotic drug (clozapine). In C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide, we found that closed and open loop locomotion onsets were almost unaffected by clozapine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), while there was a small increase in open loop visual flow onset responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, however, clozapine fundamentally changed both closed and open loop locomotion onset responses. In V1, both types of locomotion onset now resulted in a massive increase in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Conversely, open loop visual flow onset responses remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These effects could not be explained by clozapine-induced changes in hemodynamic occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) or locomotion behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

Given that clozapine increased locomotion onset responses in L5 IT neurons in V1, we wondered whether clozapine might more generally change the long-range influence between L5 IT neurons. To investigate this possibility, we computed the correlations of calcium activity between the six ROIs across both hemispheres and all recording conditions. We did this first in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and after a single intraperitoneal injection of clozapine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall, clozapine resulted in a relatively modest decrease in correlations. On repeating this experiment in mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, we found a larger decrease in correlations that appeared to be stronger for regions that were further apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). To quantify these changes, we plotted the correlations as a function of linear distance between the regions as measured in a top-down view of dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Note, this is only an approximation of the actual axonal path length between the regions. To visualize the distribution of correlations, we interpolated the data and represented them as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The resulting representation for the data from C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide before and after clozapine injection is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, respectively. We then split the data into approximately equal portions of short- and long-range correlations using a cutoff of 0.9 times the bregma-lambda distance (approximately 3.8 mm). While both short- and long-range correlations were reduced, this reduction was not significant in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also found no evidence of a difference between short- and long-range correlation changes. In mice that expressed GCaMP6 in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, however, we found a significant reduction in both short- and long-range correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), and both were more strongly reduced than in C57BL/6 mice that expressed GCaMP brain wide (C57BL/6 vs <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre Ã Ai148, short-range: p&lt;0.05; long-range: p&lt;10<sup>â5</sup>; rank-sum test). Moreover, the reduction in activity correlations was stronger for long-range correlations than it was for short-range correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To control for possible clozapine-induced changes in hemodynamic occlusion, we repeated the experiment and analyses in <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre mice that expressed eGFP in L5 IT neurons and found that alterations in hemodynamic occlusion could not account for the decrease in correlations but resulted in a small increase of the same metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>). To test whether the stress of injection, or simply passage of time, could explain the observed effects, we conducted a separate set of experiments in which we injected saline in a cohort of <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre Ã Ai148 mice and performed the same analysis. We found no evidence of a change in correlations with saline injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1FâH</xref>). To further dissect the spatial scale at which this decorrelation occurred, we repeated the experiments in <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre Ã Ai148 mice that expressed GCaMP6 in L5 IT neurons, recording calcium activity using both a widefield and a two-photon microscope. We found that while the activity correlations measured with the widefield imaging decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>), pairwise somatic activity correlations measured by two-photon imaging did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that decorrelation primarily occurs for long-range interactions. Finally, to confirm that the clozapine-induced reduction in correlation was stronger in deep cortical layers, we repeated the experiment in a population of L2/3 and L4 excitatory neurons using <italic>Cux2</italic>-CreERT2 Ã Ai148 mice. We found that clozapine also decreased correlations of cortical activity in superficial excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

If antipsychotic drugs primarily reduce correlations by reducing the strength of communication between cortical regions, independent of whether this communication is direct or indirect, we would expect to find changes in the way responses spread between cortical regions. We used visuomotor prediction error responses that originated in V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to quantify how the spread of these responses in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons was influenced by antipsychotic drugs. The computation of negative prediction errors during movement is thought to be driven by an excitatory prediction of visual flow mediated by long-range cortical input from L5 neurons in regions like A24b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>), as well as an inhibitory bottom-up visual input. By contrast, the computation of a positive prediction error during passive observation is thought to be driven by an excitatory bottom-up visual input and an inhibitory top-down input. Thus, we would primarily expect to find a reduction in mismatch responses in L5 IT neurons and a reduction in the spread of this signal to secondary visual regions. This is indeed what we observed: Mismatch responses were partially reduced in V1 and almost absent in V2am after injection of antipsychotic drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). While responses to onsets of drifting gratings were also reduced in V2am, they were overall less affected by the antipsychotic drugs than mismatch responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that antipsychotic drugs reduce lateral communication in L5. Whether this communication is mediated by direct long-range connections between L5 neurons, or indirectly via other cortical neurons or subcortical loops, remains to be tested.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Antipsychotic drug treatment preferentially reduced responses to and propagation of negative prediction errors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average responses to mismatches in <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre Ã Ai148 mice that expressed GCaMP6 in layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) neurons before (red: primary visual cortex [V1] naive, green: antero-medial secondary visual cortex [V2am] naive, activity was averaged across corresponding regions in both hemispheres) and after (dark red: V1, dark green: V2am) injection of a single dose of an antipsychotic drug (data were averaged over all antipsychotics used: clozapine: five mice, aripiprazole: three mice, and haloperidol: three mice).

Given that the signal attenuation half depth in cortex is on the order of 100 Âµm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravanis et al., 2007</xref>), most signals likely come from the superficial 100 Âµm of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of the <italic>Tlx3</italic> recordings, this would mean that we were recording a mixture of axonal and dendritic signals of the <italic>Tlx3</italic> neurons that have their soma in L5 but have a dense net of axons and dendrites in L1. In the case of the brain wide expression of GCaMP using an AAV-PHP.eB in C57BL/6 mice, the signals we recorded likely also include contributions from thalamic axons. In addition to this, there is a hemodynamic contribution to the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valley et al., 2020</xref>) that is the result of varying occlusion by blood vessels. We attempted to correct for the hemodynamic response using a 405 nm wavelength isosbestic illumination of GCaMP6 but could not recover the hemodynamic responses measured in eGFP experiments. Accurate correction likely requires calibration on eGFP measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valley et al., 2020</xref>). Given that hemodynamic responses should not systematically differ between different mouse lines, and that in the crystal skull preparation the contribution of hemodynamic occlusion to increases in fluorescence was relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), these hemodynamic artifacts should not substantially alter our conclusions. Lastly, it should be kept in mind that responses in these widefield recordings inherently reflect population averages. Assuming there is some form of lateral inhibition among neurons, population averages need not reflect responses of neurons that are tuned to the specific stimulus presented. For example, the suppression to grating stimuli we observed in V1 <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons could be the result of a subset of <italic>Tlx3</italic> neurons that are strongly responsive to the specific grating presented suppressing the rest of the population of <italic>Tlx3</italic> neurons. The sum of both could then result in a net decrease in calcium activity. Thus, an understanding of the mechanism that results in opposing population responses of <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons to positive and negative prediction errors will require measurements with single neuron resolution.</p><p>In our experiments we have focused on <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, but given that L5 IT neurons are densely connected to L5 pyramidal tract neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kiritani et al., 2012</xref>) and to L6 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>), it is not unlikely that these neuron types would follow similar patterns of activity and exhibit similar susceptibility to the influence of antipsychotic drugs. In the comparison of closed and open loop locomotion onsets, we do indeed find that <italic>Ntsr1</italic> positive L6 excitatory neurons exhibit similar levels of dissimilarity as those observed in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). It is possible that responses in the <italic>Ntsr1</italic> recordings, however, were noisier than those in the <italic>Tlx3</italic> recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), likely because of the lower dendritic and axonal volume of <italic>Ntsr1</italic> positive neurons in L1. Thus, while we have focused on the <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons mainly for reasons of experimental convenience, it is possible that both the differential activation in closed and open loop locomotion onsets as well as the susceptibility of long-range correlations to antipsychotic drugs is a general feature of cortical L5 and L6. Another possibility we currently cannot entirely rule out is that the decorrelation effect we observed in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons is specific to the <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre mouse line. However, this seems unlikely given that all mouse lines we used were maintained on the same C57BL/6 background.</p><p>It is still unclear what the relevant sites of action in the brain are of antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs are often antagonists of the D2 receptors, which are most strongly expressed in striatum. Consequently, it is sometimes assumed that the relevant site of action of antipsychotics is the striatum. Consistent with this, an increase in striatal dopamine activates auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maia and Frank, 2017</xref>) and mediates hallucination-like perceptions in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmack et al., 2021</xref>). It is intriguing, however, to speculate that the effects we observed in L5 IT neurons, which provide a dominant input to striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morita et al., 2019</xref>), may be an alternate site of action. While it is possible that the primary site of action of the antipsychotic drugs with respect to the L5 decorrelation phenotype we observed is striatum, this is unlikely. Changes to striato-thalamo-cortical loops could appear as changes in functional connectivity observed in cortex. However, feedback from striatum to cortex is exclusively mediated through thalamus, and neither L4, the primary thalamo-recipient layer in cortex, nor our brain wide recordings exhibited any of the effects we saw in L5 IT neurons. Thus, the effects we saw in L5 IT neurons are either not inherited from striatum or are mediated by a separate set of thalamic neurons via direct thalamic input to deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douglas and Martin, 1991</xref>). Thalamocortical collaterals in deep layers, however, come from thalamic neurons that project primarily to superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberlaender et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we think it is unlikely that the observed effects in L5 IT neurons were inherited from striatum. Independent of whether the treatment-relevant site of action of antipsychotic drugs is indeed in L5 IT neurons, or whether the observed decorrelation of activity is relevant to antipsychotic potency of these drugs, we speculate that the long-range decorrelation of activity could be used as a basis for a functional screen for compounds with antipsychotic efficacy. Given that in the brain wide recordings the decorrelation of activity was weaker compared to that observed in <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons, it might be possible to test for similar effects in human subjects using layer-specific fMRI recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haarsma et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A rather surprising implication of our results is that the dominant mode of coupling in cortex might be lateral, not vertical. Two findings would argue for this interpretation. First, while L5 was differentially activated across cortical regions during closed and open loop locomotion onsets, L2/3 exhibited rather limited differences. Second, antipsychotics decorrelated L5 activity but had no effect on L2/3. Both findings could be explained if the long-range lateral coupling within L5 is stronger than the local vertical coupling between L2/3 and L5.</p><p>One of the diseases treated with antipsychotic drugs is schizophrenia. It has been speculated that disrupted resting-state functional connectivity in brain networks involving cortex is central to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Northoff and Duncan, 2016</xref>). Treatment-naÃ¯ve schizophrenia patients predominantly exhibit increases in resting-state functional connectivity between cortical regions, while medicated schizophrenia patients exhibit more balanced fractions of increased and decreased functional connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anticevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Auditory hallucinations, one of the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia, are associated with increased activation of diverse cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catafau et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dierks et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shergill et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that antipsychotic drugs counteract this by reducing the strength of long-range cortical connectivity mediated by L5 IT neurons, independent of whether the increased activity in schizophrenic patients is indeed driven by aberrant increases in the strength of long-range cortical connections or is a consequence of an aberrant increase in the strength of striato-thalamo-cortical loops. However, a direct involvement of cortical circuits in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is consistent with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. This hypothesis is based on the finding that NMDA receptor antagonists induce schizophrenia-like symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moghaddam and Javitt, 2012</xref>), and that disturbances of NMDA and AMPA receptor-related gene expression are associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). In V1, it has been shown that NMDA receptors are necessary during visual development to establish normal prediction error signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Widmer and Keller, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that a disruption of glutamatergic signaling in cortex that alters the way internal representations are activated by prediction errors is central to the etiology of schizophrenia. If so, we should find impairments in all domains of cortical function, including sensory processing. In the case of the sensory cortex, cortical dysfunctions should be apparent earlier in development, concurrent with the critical period for plasticity in sensory areas of cortex. While the core symptoms of schizophrenia typically appear in late adolescence, sensory processing is indeed impaired in schizophrenic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Javitt, 2009</xref>) and is apparent, for example, in the reduction of surround suppression in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, some of these disturbances are detectable already during childhood as visuo-perceptual and reading anomalies in some subjects that later develop schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parellada et al., 2017</xref>). Positive symptoms of schizophrenia can be explained in a predictive processing framework of cortical function as a disturbance of a prediction error-based update of internal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frith, 2005</xref>). There are two types of prediction error neurons, positive and negative, and, given that cortex likely implements a non-hierarchical variant of predictive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garner and Keller, 2022</xref>), two types of internal representation neurons. One set of internal representation neurons is excited by positive prediction errors and inhibited by negative prediction errors, and the other one is inhibited by positive prediction errors and excited by negative prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons exhibited opposing responses to positive and negative prediction errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and, while several different interpretations are conceivable, these responses would be consistent with those of internal representation neurons. Given that the effects of antipsychotic drugs are predominantly observed in L5 IT neurons, and that anesthesia is thought to decouple L5 neuron soma from their apical tuft and thereby prevent conscious perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki and Larkum, 2020</xref>), we speculate that <italic>Tlx3</italic> positive L5 IT neurons may be one type of internal representation neuron and one of the functionally relevant sites of antipsychotic action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

In a subset of mice (6 C57BL/6, 4 <italic>Emx1</italic>-Cre, and 4 <italic>SST</italic>-Cre mice), we injected an AAV vector based on the PHP.eB capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2017</xref>) retro-orbitally (6 Î¼l each eye of at least 10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml) to drive expression of GCaMP under either the EF1Î± or hSyn1 promoter pan-neuronally, or in a cell type-specific manner using a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) construct. For hemodynamic response control experiments, we used an AAV-PHP.eB-EF1Î±-eGFP to pan-neuronally express eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>) or an AAV-PHP.eB-EF1Î±-DIO-eGFP to restrict eGFP expression to L5 IT neurons in <italic>Tlx3</italic>-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>). To improve optical access to the cortex, we implanted crystal skull cranial windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Prior to removing the skull plate overlying dorsal cortex, we recorded the location of bregma relative to other landmarks on the skull. Superglue (Pattex) was used to glue the crystal skull in place in the craniotomy. In a subset of mice, for the comparison of hemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>), we used a clear skull preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). To do this, we attached the crystal skull coverslip directly onto the cleaned skull surface with a three-component polymer (C&amp;B Metabond, Parkell). A custom-machined titanium head bar was attached to the skull using dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus). An epifluorescence overview image was taken to mark reference points on the dorsal cortical surface. Anesthesia was antagonized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg; Anexate, Roche) and atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg; Antisedan, Orion Pharma). For peri- and post-operative analgesia, we injected buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd.) and Metacam (5 mg/kg; Boehringer Ingelheim). Imaging commenced at the earliest 1 week after head bar implantation or 3 weeks after retro-orbital AAV injection. Clozapine (Novartis), aripiprazole (Otsuka Pharmaceutical), haloperidol (Janssen), amphetamine (HÃ¤nseler), or saline (0.9% NaCl in H<sub>2</sub>O) was intraperitoneally injected at 0.2 Î¼g/g - 10 Î¼g/g, 0.2 Î¼g/g, 0.1 Î¼g/g, 4 Î¼g/g body weight, or undiluted, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virtual reality setup and stimulus design</title><p>For all experiments we used a virtual reality setup as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were head-fixed and free to run on a spherical, air-supported Styrofoam ball. A virtual corridor was projected (using a Samsung SP-F10M projector) onto a toroidal screen positioned in front of the mouse covering a field of view of approximately 240 degrees horizontally and 100 degrees vertically. Recordings were blocked into 5 min sessions. Experiments typically commenced with four sessions of a closed loop condition in which the rotation of the spherical treadmill was coupled to the movement in a virtual corridor. To introduce mismatches, we broke the coupling between locomotion and visual flow by briefly halting visual flow for 1 s at random times. Closed loop sessions were followed by four sessions of an open loop condition, in which rotation of the spherical treadmill and movement in the virtual corridor were decoupled. The visual stimulus consisted of a replay of the visual flow recorded in the previous closed loop condition. Following this we recorded two sessions of what we refer to as a dark condition in which the virtual reality was switched off. Please note, this was not complete darkness, primarily because the shielding of the blue excitation light was not light proof. Finally, we recorded activity in two sessions of a grating condition in which we presented drifting grating stimuli covering the full toroidal screen placed in front of the mouse (eight directions of 6 sÂ±2 s [mean Â± SD] duration each with an inter-grating interval of 4.5 sÂ±1.5 s [mean Â± SD] gray screen, presented in randomized order). These sessions, totaling approximately 1 hr of recording time per day, were acquired for 3 consecutive days. For mice in which we went on to test the effect of drugs on dorsal cortex activity, the first post-drug injection data were acquired +1 hr after drug injection (+30 min in the case of amphetamine because of faster onset kinetics of the drug) and further data were collected at the +24 hr and +48 hr timepoints. Data in the manuscript are shown as the combined data over either all data collected before drug injection (labeled as naive) or after substance injection (labeled as clozapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, amphetamine, or saline, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>All widefield imaging experiments were performed on a custom-built macroscope consisting of commercially available objectives mounted face-to-face (Nikon 85 mm/f1.8 sample side, Nikon 50 mm/f1.4 sensor side). We used a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs) powered by a custom-built LED driver for exciting GCaMP (or eGFP) fluorescence through an excitation filter (SP490, Thorlabs) reflected off a dichroic mirror (LP490, Thorlabs) placed in the parfocal plane of the objectives. Green fluorescence was collected through a 525/50 emission filter on an sCMOS camera (PCO edge 4.2). Apertures on objectives were usually kept maximally open and the current at the LED driver was used to adjust fluorescence intensity to a value that was kept below 25% of the maximum dynamic range of the sensor. In cases where this was not possible (e.g. transfection of eGFP yielded extremely bright fluorescence, often visible with the naked eye), objective apertures were gradually reduced to avoid overexposure of the sensor. LED illumination was adjusted with a collimator (Thorlabs SM2F32-A) to achieve homogenous illumination across the surface of the cranial window. The resulting Gaussian profile of the illumination cone was further trimmed with black tape on the sample side objective to avoid light shining directly into the mouseâs eye. An Arduino board (Arduino Mega 2560) was used to control LED onsets synced to the frame trigger signal of the camera. The duty cycle of the 470 nm LED was 90%. Raw images were acquired at full speed (100 Hz; except for eGFP controls, which were acquired at 50 Hz effective frame rate) and full dynamic range (16 bit) of the sensor. The raw images were cropped on-sensor and the resulting data was streamed to disk with custom-written software in LabVIEW (National Instruments), resulting in an effective pixel size of 60 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> at a standardized imaging resolution of 1108 pixels Ã 1220 pixels (1.35 MP).</p><p>Two-photon calcium imaging was performed using a custom-built microscope based on a Thorlabs B-scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Illumination source was a tunable femtosecond laser (Coherent Chameleon) tuned to 930 nm. Emission light was band-pass filtered using a 525/50 filter for GCaMP and detected using a GaAsP photomultiplier (H7422, Hamamatsu). Photomultiplier signals were amplified (DHPCA-100, Femto), digitized (NI5772, National Instruments) at 800 MHz, and band-pass filtered around 80 MHz using a digital Fourier-transform filter implemented in custom-written software on an FPGA (NI5772, National Instruments). The scanning system of the microscope was based on a 12 kHz resonant scanner (Cambridge Technology). Images were acquired at a resolution of 750 pixels Ã 400 pixels at a 60 Hz frame rate and a piezoelectric linear actuator (P-726, Physik Instrumente) was used to move the objective (Nikon 16Ã, 0.8 NA) in steps of 15 Âµm between frames to acquire images at four different depths. This resulted in an effective frame rate of 15 Hz. The field of view was 350 Âµm Ã 350 Âµm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data processing</title><p>Off-line data processing and data analysis (section below) were done with custom-written MATLAB (2021a) scripts. For widefield macroscope imaging, raw movie data was manually registered across days by aligning subsequent mean projections of the data to the first recorded image sequence. We placed ROIs relative to readily identifiable anatomical landmarks that had been previously noted during cranial window surgery (see above). This resulted in the selection of six 20 pixels Ã 20 pixels ROIs per hemisphere. Of those ROIs, we calculated the activity as the ÎF/F<sub>0</sub>, wherein F<sub>0</sub> was the median fluorescence of the recording (approximately 30,000 frames in a 5 min recording). ÎF/F<sub>0</sub> was corrected for slow fluorescence drift caused by thermal brightening of the LED using 8th percentile filtering with a 62.5 s moving window similar to what was described previously for two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Raw two-photon imaging data were full-frame registered to correct for brain motion. Neurons were manually selected based on mean and maximum fluorescence images. Raw fluorescence traces were corrected for slow drift in fluorescence using an 8th percentile filtering with a 15 s window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). ÎF/F traces were calculated as mean fluorescence in a selected region of every imaging frame and subsequently subtracted and normalized by the median fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Locomotion and visual flow onsets were determined based on threshold crossing of locomotion or visual flow speed. To select only well-isolated onsets, we used a speed threshold of 30 cm/s and excluded all onsets with locomotion or visual flow in the 3 s window preceding the onset. To increase the number of locomotion onsets that passed the speed threshold criterion for the eGFP imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), we excluded only those onsets if there was locomotion in the 1 s window preceding onset.</p><p>All stimulus response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1FâL</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B, C, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A B, E, and F</xref>) were baseline-subtracted. The baseline subtraction window for unpredictable stimuli (mismatches and grating onsets) was â200 ms to 0 ms before stimulus onset. For closed loop and open loop locomotion onsets, and open loop visual flow onsets, to accommodate calcium indicator offset dynamics and potential anticipatory activity, we placed the baseline subtraction windows for these onsets at â2900 ms to â2700 ms for GCaMP imaging, or â900 ms to â700 ms for eGFP imaging. Varying this window within the bounds of offset dynamics of the indicator and anticipatory activity onset did not change the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. Analyses in which image sequences were aligned to event onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1CâD</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) used the same parameters as above.</p><p>On rare occasions, we observed seizure-like activity after antipsychotic drug injection. These events resulted in atypically high levels of correlation, and to avoid them from influencing our conclusions we excluded these data from further analysis. We excluded sessions if they contained an event in which average activity of all 12 ROIs remained elevated above 30% ÎF/F for more than 10 s. This criterion led to the exclusion of 0.26% of data (10 out of 3801 of 5 min recording sessions).</p><p>To quantify the similarity of closed loop and open loop locomotion onset responses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, we calculated the correlation coefficient between the averaged responses (onsets and mice, 1 s moving average) in a window â5 s to +3 s, for each ROI. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>, we first averaged over onsets in either left or right V1, which resulted in an average locomotion onset response curve for left and right V1, for each mouse and condition (closed and open loop). These curves were subsequently used for calculating the correlation coefficient in the same window as above. The correlation coefficients from left and right V1 are then averaged and reported as individual data points in the figure panel. For this analysis, we excluded mice in which the responses were smaller than 1% ÎF/F in either of the two conditions (3 of 54 mice), as the correlation analysis yields noise in the absence of a clear response.</p><p>For the correlation analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, we first calculated the correlation coefficient of neuronal activity (or fluorescence change, in the case of <italic>Tlx3-Cre</italic> mice that had been retro-orbitally injected with an AAV-PHP.eB-Ef1Î±-DIO-eGFP to express eGFP in L5 IT neurons) for all possible pairs of the 12 ROIs. We then determined the distance between each pair of ROIs and normalized this value by the distance between bregma and lambda obtained from the images during initial surgery for each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We plotted the correlation against the distance for each pair of ROIs and binned the data in a 40Ã40 grid and smoothed the resulting image with a Gaussian filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), to obtain the heatmaps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A, B, D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A, B, D, E, G, and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1BâD, G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C and D</xref>. Contour lines in the heatmaps were then drawn to 50% of the maximum value in the plot. The boxplot quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C, F, and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2E</xref>) were calculated as the change in correlation coefficient of activity after and before treatment for all pairs of ROIs, normalized to the value before treatment and split into short- and long-range using a threshold of 0.9 of the bregma-lambda distance for each mouse. For pairwise neuronal correlations that had been recorded with two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), we calculated the correlation coefficient separately for all pairs of neurons within each field of view. We noticed extreme synchrony of activity of L5 IT soma recorded in 1 field of view with two-photon imaging after clozapine injection and show both distributions for all data as well as the distribution when this 1 field of view is excluded.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, onset aligned data were first averaged for each mouse and then summed in the given combinations. The SEM was calculated over mice.</p><p>To obtain the differences in the correlation between activity and locomotion after and before clozapine injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), we first averaged all correlation coefficients in the individual sessions of a condition (closed loop, open loop, or dark) to generate one correlation coefficient per mouse and ROI, for each condition. We then calculated and plotted the difference between these correlation values after and before clozapine injection.</p><p>We used a hierarchical bootstrap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), or a bootstrap (where data were not nested, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>), distribution to estimate p-values. For hierarchical bootstrap, we first resampled the data (with replacement) at the level of mice, and then, from the selected mice, resampled for recording sessions. In cases where data were not nested, bootstrap samples were drawn from the distribution of data points. We then computed the mean of this bootstrap sample and repeated this 10,000 times to generate a bootstrap distribution of the mean estimate. The p-value was then defined as the proportion of bootstrap samples higher (or lower, depending on the hypothesis) than zero. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>, to account for multiple comparisons, we used family-wise error correction. The significance indicators in the figure panels therefore reflect an adjusted significance threshold, Î±<sub>adj</sub>, according to the formula Î±<sub>adj</sub> = Î±/m, wherein Î± is 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001, and m denotes the number of groups (genotypes, m=9 in both figure panels).</p><p>For widefield imaging time course data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1FâL</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B, C, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A and E</xref>), we used a hierarchical bootstrap estimate of the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>) and the 90% confidence interval. This was done by generating 1000 bootstrap samples chosen hierarchically (first over mice, then over onsets) for each time bin (10 ms) in the plot.</p><p>To compare the similarity of closed and open loop locomotion onset responses, we used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) or mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>) as factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), respectively, followed by a bootstrap distribution-based estimate of p-values as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Matthias Heindorf is author on a patent to use layer 5 decorrelation to screen for antipsychotic efficacy application EP22153051.1</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Georg Keller is author on a patent to use layer 5 decorrelation to screen for antipsychotic efficacy</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by and carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Veterinary Department of the Canton Basel-Stadt, Switzerland (licence number 2573).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>A list of all statistical comparisons for bar and violin plots.</title><p>Note, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4J</xref>, the significance thresholds were corrected for multiple comparisons (see Methods).</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86805-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>A list of number of mice used for each figure and the corresponding indicator expression strategy.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86805-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86805-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and code to reproduce the findings from the paper are freely available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10783459">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10783459</ext-link>.

They used different mouse lines or systemically injected viral vectors to allow imaging of calcium activity from specific cell-types with a particular focus on a mouse-line that expresses GCaMP in layer 5 IT (intratelencephalic) neurons. They examined the question of how the neural response to predictable visual input, as a consequence of self-motion, differed from responses to unpredictable input. They identify layer 5 IT cells as having a different response pattern to other cell-types/layers in that they show differences in their response to closed-loop (i.e. predictable) vs open-loop (i.e. unpredictable) stimulation whereas other cell-types showed similar activity patterns between these two conditions. They also analyzed the responses to visuomotor prediction errors obtained by briefly pausing the display while the mouse is running, causing a negative prediction error, or by presenting an unpredicted visual input causing a positive prediction error. Surprisingly, they find that presentation of a visual grating actually decreases the responses of L5 IT cells in V1. They interpret their results within a predictive coding framework that the last author has previously proposed. The response pattern of the L5 IT cells leads them to propose that these cells may act as 'internal representation' neurons that carry a representation of the brain's model of its environment. Though this is rather speculative. They subsequently examine the responses of these cells to anti-psychotic drugs (e.g. clozapine) with the reasoning that a leading theory of schizophrenia is a disturbance of the brain's internal model and/or a failure to correctly predict the sensory consequences of self-movement. They find that anti-psychotic drugs strongly enhance responses of L5 IT cells to locomotion while having little effect on other cell-types. Finally, they suggest that anti-psychotics reduce long-range correlations between (predominantly) L5 cells and reduce the propagation of prediction errors to higher visual areas and suggest this may be a mechanism by which these drugs reduce hallucinations/psychosis.</p><p>This is a large study containing a screening of many mouse-lines/expression profiles using wide-field calcium imaging. Wide-field imaging has its caveats, including a broad point-spread function of the signal and susceptibility to hemodynamic artifacts, which can make the interpretation of results difficult. The authors acknowledge these problems and directly address the hemodynamic occlusion problem. It was reassuring to see supplementary 2-photon imaging of soma to complement this data-set, even though this is rather briefly described in the paper. Some comparisons in the paper are underpowered as a result of including only a small number of mice (e.g. the PV, Ntsr1 and Cux2 mice) and results involving these mice should be cautiously interpreted, but in general the results are robust. Overall the paper's strengths are its identification of a very different response profile in the L5 IT cells compared to other layers/cell-types which suggests an important role for these cells in handling integration of self-motion generated sensory predictions with sensory input. The interpretation of the responses to anti-psychotic drugs is more speculative but the result appears robust and provides an interesting basis for further studies of this effect with more specific recording techniques and possibly behavioral measures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86805.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heindorf</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Friedrich Miescher Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Friedrich Miescher Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Revised manuscript</p><p>The authors have addressed most of my points, but I still have one outstanding concern about the statistics:</p><p>My Original Question:</p><p>I have a few concerns and questions that I would like to see addressed: (1) Figure 1L - the statistics are a little unusual here as the errors are across visual areas rather than across mice or hemispheres. This isn't ideal as ideally, we want to generalize the results across animals, not areas, and the results seem to be driven mostly by V1/RSC. I would like to see comparisons using mice as the statistical unit either in an ANOVA with areas as factors or post-hoc comparisons per area.</p><p>Author Reply:</p><p>Based on the assumption that visual cortex should respond to visual stimuli, we would have expected to find a difference between closed and open loop locomotion onset responses in all cell types in visual areas of cortex (a closed loop locomotion onset being the combination of locomotion and visual flow onset, while an open loop locomotion onset lacks the visual flow component). Thus, the first surprise was that in most cell types we found very little difference between these two locomotion onset types. Conversely, in Tlx3-positive L5 IT neurons the difference was apparent well outside of the visual areas of cortex (even though the difference was indeed strongest in V1/RSC). To quantify the extent to which closed and open loop locomotion onsets result in different activity patterns across dorsal cortex we performed the analyses shown in Figures 1L and 2. To make the point that the effect was observable on average across cortical areas, we used cortical area as a unit in Figure 1L. We have added the analysis shown in Figure 1L with mice as the statistical unit as Figure S4J and have added the ANOVA information to Table S1, as suggested.</p><p>My revised question:</p><p>The authors have only partially addressed my concerns here. I disagree with the authors that they were making a point about the effect being observable across visual areas. The primary statistical statement they are trying to make is that the similarity between open and closed-loop stimulation is different for Tlx mice, e.g. Line 122: &quot;However, comparing locomotion onsets in mice that expressed GCaMP6 only in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, we found that the activation pattern was strikingly different between closed and open loop conditions&quot; and Line 172-3: &quot;Thus, excitatory neurons of deep cortical layers exhibited the strongest differences between closed and open loop locomotion related activation&quot;. These statements are not correctly supported by the statistical analysis as presented in Figure 1L as it is the variability across mice that is relevant to draw this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the example &quot;However, comparing locomotion onsets in mice that expressed GCaMP6 only in Tlx3 positive L5 IT neurons, we found that the activation pattern was strikingly different between closed and open loop conditions (Figure 1D)&quot; we talk about the example mouse shown. We have not changed phrasing here.</p><p>We have, however, changed the way we talk about Figure 1L and S4J (the second example given by the reviewer), and have rephrased much of this paragraph. Please note, we have also changed Figure S4J to quantify the difference only for V1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is partially addressed by Figure S4J where the authors show standard-errors across mice and report statistics across mice. In Table S1 the statistical test is reported to be a bootstrap test with mice as the statistical unit, however, according to line 985 this was a non-hierarchical bootstrap test. Does this mean that the authors resampled onsets without regard to which mouse they came from to regenerate the response-curves and recalculate the correlation coefficient? Or did they directly resample from the distribution of correlation coefficient values? I suspect the latter, but for some comparisons (e.g. Tlx3 vs PV) there are only two mice in one group, yielding two correlation coefficients, and resampling 2 values 10,000 times would lead to very biased statistics. Either way the approach is far from ideal. There is also no protection against multiple-comparisons in these tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adapted Figure S4J to include only V1, where we find the largest effect (the text is adapted to reflect this) and have added individual data points as suggested in the following comment. The reviewer is correct that we created a bootstrap distribution by resampling correlation values. This means we are resampling 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 14 values depending on the comparison. This should now be clearer in the text. We agree that this is not ideal, but when using mice as a statistical unit, analysis is almost always underpowered. To the best of our knowledge, bootstrap resampling is the best approach to alleviate this problem. Regarding the concern for multiple comparisons: We have now adjusted the significance threshold in Figures 1L and S4J by dividing through the number of groups (here: 9 genotypes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ANOVA reported in Table S1 for Figure S4J isn't described in the methods so I can't say what they did and it doesn't seem to be referred to in the text and is non-significant in any case. Figure S4J also only shows summary statistics whereas individual mice should be plotted. The correct statistical test is either a one-way ANOVA with one factor (genotype) with post-hoc tests between the Tlx3 genotype and the others with suitable multiple-comparisons corrections (this may be the non-significant test in table S1). Alternatively, a linear mixed effects model with Genotype as a fixed effect and Mouse as a random intercept term. This approach is more powerful as it would allow them to use data from all locomotion onsets, but it may struggle to fit datasets with only 2 members for certain genotypes. If they wish to make the more extended point that the pattern across visual areas differs between Tlx3 and other mice they could include 'Area' as another (fixed) factor in the design and look for an interaction with Genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>The ANOVA was indeed a one-way ANOVA with one factor. We have added this information to the methods. As suggested, we have added individual data points to Figure S4J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also agree with the other reviewers that the presentation of standard-errors in Figures 1F-K and elsewhere is somewhat misleading as these are s.e.m. across onsets without taking into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Across mice s.e.m. would give a more accurate view of the variability in the data across the population. I also understand that first averaging across onsets within mice before taking a grand-average throws away a lot of data and s.e.m.s will be considerably larger. The authors should consider linear mixed effects models as an optimal solution for estimating s.e.m. If this is not feasible then the authors could consider showing data from individual mice in a supplementary figure or at least reporting the number of onsets that came from each mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now changed all plots in which we show time course data of widefield calcium imaging to show a hierarchical bootstrap estimate of mean and 90% confidence interval of the mean estimate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Congratulations to the authors on the revision! The revised article has substantially improved, and I have no further comments. I am particularly reassured by the new hierarchical bootstrap analyses as well as by the new analysis with mouse as a statistical unit that reproduces the key finding from the analyses with region as a statistical unit. Moreover, the authors added a vehicle control condition which does not yield any results. Therefore, I have no further methodological concerns and removed my mention of this previous weakness from my public review. Also, the readability of the manuscript has much improved in the revised version. Congratulations again on this important work!</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the help in improving the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comments on rebuttal:</p><p>(1) It is greatly appreciated that the authors have improved aspects of their statistics, I have revised my comments accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to hear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) However, I should clarify my comments regarding statistical concerns were not merely pertaining to a given Figure (e.g. Figure 1) I was only using it as an example. The authors have redone aspects of their analysis using N = number of mice (for statistics/trace figures), but is there a reason they cannot do this for other problematic figures/traces in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted also by reviewer 1, we have changed all time course plots in the manuscript to show a hierarchical bootstrap estimate of mean and 90% confidence interval of mean.</p><p>Using mice as a statistical unit throughout the manuscript unfortunately is not viable in most cases, as we simply do not have enough mice in our dataset and statistical tests based on mice would be underpowered. The manuscript currently contains data from 77 mice, and we would likely need multiples of that to do statistics over mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 1 - I do take the point why regions are being used as the independent N (though the authors justification should be made more clearly in the manuscript) making an N of 12 (though I am less clear why the same region across 2 hemispheres is counted as 2 Ns instead of 1; are they really independent?). However, I am less clear as to the choice in N in other figures. Could the authors clarify this more explicitly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We use regions as a statistical unit in Figures 6 and 7, S6-S8. Regarding the independence of hemispheres, this depends on cell type and region. E.g. activity in left V1 exhibits a higher correlation with activity left V2am than with right V2 (see Figure 5). On average callosal pairs exhibit correlation levels comparable to near cortical neighbors. See also, other work on the topic, for example (Calhoun et al., 2023).</p><p>Regarding choice of N in other figures, this is either ârecording sessionâ or âpairs of regionsâ. We have made this clearer in the figure legends. In the case of testing using recording sessions, the idea is that each recording session constitutes a measurement. Measurements in the same mouse are not independent, and hence we use hierarchical bootstrap for all testing on recording sessions. The choice of âpairs of regionsâ for the correlation analysis follows from the use of regions as a statistical unit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Regarding using N = locomotion onsets (or other definitions other than N = mice) when deriving trace averages/SEMs (for example, as in Figure 1) is visually misleading for the reader as it masks the true variability of the data, and even more misleading given that the authors do necessarily use that definition of N in their statistical tests associated with the data (as the authors commented). Whilst the authors have shown some traces with N=mice for some data, is there a reason they cannot do this for all figures in the manuscript? At the very least the practice of using other definitions of N for the purpose of showing trace averages/SEMs should be justified in the MS.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced all time course plots that used SEM over events (for example locomotion onsets or visual stimuli) with a hierarchical bootstrap estimate of mean and 90% confidence interval of the mean throughout the manuscript.
