cellular mechanisms through which experience causes these changes are not well understood. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe houses synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and downstream projection neurons (PNs) in stereotyped glomeruli. Many glomeruli exhibit structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, indicating a general sensitivity of the fly olfactory circuitry to early sensory experience. We recently found that glia shape antennal lobe development in young adults, leading us to ask if glia also drive experience-dependent plasticity during this period. Here, we define a critical period for structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses in the ethyl butyrate (EB)-sensitive glomerulus VM7. EB exposure for the first 2 days post-eclosion drives large-scale reductions in glomerular volume, presynapse number, and post- synaptic activity. Crucially, pruning during the critical period has long-term consequences for circuit function since both OSN-PN synapse number and spontaneous activity of PNs remain persistently decreased following early-life odor exposure. The highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper is required for this critical period plasticity as ensheathing glia upregulate Draper, invade the VM7 glomerulus, and phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals in response to critical-period EB exposure. Loss of Draper fully suppresses the morphological and physiological consequences of critical period odor exposure, arguing that phagocytic glia engulf intact synaptic terminals. These data demonstrate experience-dependent pruning of synapses and argue that <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory circuitry is a powerful model for defining the function of glia in critical period plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>synapse pruning</kwd><kwd>Draper</kwd><kwd>MEGF10</kwd><kwd>neuron-glia interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS120689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leier</surname><given-names>Hans C</given-names></name><name><surname>Foden</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jindal</surname><given-names>Darren A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkov</surname><given-names>Abigail J</given-names></name><name><surname>Van der Linden Costello</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><name><surname>Coutinho-Budd</surname><given-names>Jaeda</given-names></name><name><surname>Broihier</surname><given-names>Heather T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM152319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leier</surname><given-names>Hans C</given-names></name><name><surname>Foden</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jindal</surname><given-names>Darren A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS110397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leier</surname><given-names>Hans C</given-names></name><name><surname>Foden</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jindal</surname><given-names>Darren A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkov</surname><given-names>Abigail J</given-names></name><name><surname>Van der Linden Costello</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><name><surname>Broihier</surname><given-names>Heather T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory circuit exhibits experience-dependent glial pruning during a well-defined critical period, with long-term consequences for odor processing.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical periods are defined developmental windows in which sensory experience has an outsize influence on circuit function. Not only are sensory circuits uniquely plastic during these temporal windows, but the ensuing changes to circuit function are typically permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levelt and Hübener, 2012</xref>). Critical period dysregulation is increasingly linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBlanc and Fagiolini, 2011</xref>), making the mechanisms that establish both timing and execution of this plasticity of great interest. Since ocular dominance plasticity in the mammalian visual cortex was established by Hubel and Wiesel as the preeminent model for the study of critical periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubel and Wiesel, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>), great strides have been made to define the mechanisms of this form of critical period plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Starkey et al., 2023</xref>). However, the extent to which the specific mechanisms underpinning ocular dominance plasticity are generalizable and conserved among distinct circuit types is uncertain. Discovery of new molecular and cellular mechanisms required for critical period plasticity would be accelerated by the advent of a robust form of critical period plasticity in an accessible genetic model system.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> olfactory system has emerged as an attractive candidate in which to understand the role of sensory experience in circuit development. With a total of 61 unique olfactory receptors (ORs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mier et al., 2022</xref>) expressed in 2281 olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlegel et al., 2021</xref>) that terminate in stereotyped glomeruli in the antennal lobe, it shares the basic organization of the mammalian olfactory epithelium and bulb at a scale that is orders of magnitude less complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mori et al., 1999</xref>). Pioneering work by Ferrús and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devaud et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>) revealed structural changes and behavioral habituation in response to concentrated odorant exposure in early adulthood, similar to that observed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>). Together, the exquisitely stereotyped organization of the fly antennal lobe together with the detailed mapping of its circuitry and the high degree of conservation with mammalian systems make the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory circuit a powerful model for investigating early-life plasticity.</p><p>Subsequent studies yielded insights into the mechanisms by which developing circuits respond to sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gugel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>). An emerging theme is that critical period plasticity in this model likely serves to preserve combinatorial odor encoding. Since many common odorants bind to several ORs with varying avidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Münch and Galizia, 2016</xref>), the ability to discriminate among diﬀerent odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>), encode position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kadakia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taisz et al., 2023</xref>), and assign valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>) relies on specific, balanced combinations of activity levels across various sensory neuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Si et al., 2019</xref>). This code would be jeopardized by exposure to OR-saturating concentrations of a single odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tadres et al., 2022</xref>), leading to diﬀerent forms of adaptation in olfactory lobe circuitry. Short-term adaptations include temporarily blocking OSN firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tadres et al., 2022</xref>), while long-term odorant exposure in young adults induces circuit remodeling to increase inhibition of overactive sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sudhakaran et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, DM2 and DM5, two glomeruli that are moderately sensitive to the odor ethyl butyrate (EB), increase in size as the result of early-life odor exposure. This increase is likely caused by the growth of inhibitory synapses between local interneurons (LNs) and second-order projection neurons (PNs), leading to long-term habituation.</p><p>Recently, a novel form of early-life remodeling was described in VM7, another EB-responsive glomerulus. OSNs expressing the odorant receptor Or42a project to VM7 and are much more strongly activated by EB than either DM2 or DM5, meaning that Or42a OSNs are activated at lower EB concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Münch and Galizia, 2016</xref>). Following early-life EB exposure, VM7 circuitry appears to dampen output not by increasing inhibition, but rather by removing the Or42a OSN axon terminals themselves. The underlying mechanism was first proposed to be axon terminal retraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golovin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>, but more recently shown to require Draper-mediated signaling in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>). Draper is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CED-1 and mammalian Jedi-1 and MEGF10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Suzuki and Nakayama, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). These findings build on recent studies elucidating key functions for glia in regulating critical period timing and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribot et al., 2021</xref>); however, many crucial questions remain unanswered. First, while this form of glial-dependent remodeling requires Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>), it is unknown whether it requires Draper-mediated synapse pruning, since phagocytosis was not assessed. This is an important issue because while Draper is an engulfment receptor, it also serves key non-phagocytic signaling roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McPhee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Second, does this example of glial-dependent remodeling represent a true critical period, or rather, does it reflect broad early-life plasticity that we and others have described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>)? Third, critical periods are widely understood to imply long-term eﬀects on circuit function; yet it is unknown whether there are physiological consequences to early-life remodeling of VM7. This question is particularly salient since Or42a OSN terminal volume appears to recover quickly following EB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>), raising the possibility that it represents a transient, entirely reversible, response to exposure to concentrated odorant.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate experience-dependent pruning of Or42a OSN axon terminals during a strictly delimited critical period. Or42a OSN terminals are remodeled following concentrated odorant exposure from 0 to 2 days of adulthood (days post eclosion (DPE)), but not immediately before or after. EB exposure during this period leads to loss of terminal axon arbors and their presynaptic specializations. Importantly, while Or42a OSN axon arbor morphology recovers following a five-day recovery period, presynaptic number does not, demonstrating long-term consequences of critical period odor exposure. Moreover, spontaneous activity of the postsynaptic PN partners of Or42a OSNs is dramatically reduced both immediately following odor exposure and following the recovery period, indicating persistent eﬀects on odor processing. We find that critical period remodeling requires Draper signaling in ensheathing glia, a glial population that normally enwraps olfactory glomeruli in the antennal lobe. In ensheathing glia-specific <italic>draper</italic> RNAi animals, ensheathing glia do not invade the VM7 glomerulus, and Or42a OSNs are not pruned. Strikingly, odor exposure does not alter VM7 PN spontaneous activity in <italic>draper</italic> knockdown animals, supporting our morphological analysis and arguing that Or42a OSN terminals are intact following odor exposure and only removed by Draper-mediated engulfment. Together, these data demonstrate an essential role for Draper in ensheathing glial infiltration and synaptic engulfment, as well as long-term consequences of experience-dependent synaptic pruning during an early-life critical period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early-life exposure to elevated ethyl butyrate erodes Or42a OSN connectivity and function</title><p>The antennal lobe (AL) is the first processing center for olfactory information in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>).

We previously investigated the function of the highly conserved glial engulfment receptor Draper in regulating axon terminal morphology and synapse number of several OSN populations across early and mid-adulthood to test for a role for Draper in shaping circuitry at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, the phenotypic and cell-type-specific consequences of losing glial Draper are not constant over time. Instead, loss of Draper leads to larger increases in synapse number in young flies than in older flies, suggesting that Draper-mediated synapse refinement is particularly important during early life. These findings piqued our interest in a form of early-life plasticity described in the VM7 glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golovin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>). In this paradigm, animals exposed to concentrated ethyl butyrate (EB) for the first two days of adulthood exhibit a near complete loss of Or42a OSN terminal arbors, suggesting the possibility of glial-mediated phagocytosis. This remodeling is suggested to reflect a new form of critical period plasticity; however, the EB concentrations typically used in these studies (25% [v/v]) also drive loss of terminal arbors when odor exposure occurs in mid-adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>), raising questions about critical period specificity. Moreover, the significance of this plasticity is uncertain, since Or42a terminals exhibit morphological recovery after animals are returned to a normal olfactory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We wanted to better describe the timing, scope, selectivity, and possible long-term consequences of this striking form of early-life plasticity before interrogating a role for glia. To begin, we employed our Imaris-based pipelines to quantify presynaptic number and OSN terminal arbor volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>) in young (0–2 DPE) animals across a range of EB concentrations. Briefly, we precisely masked Or42a-mCD8::GFP-labeled OSN terminal arbors using the Surfaces function in Imaris and quantified bruchpilot (Brp) puncta exclusively within the OSN mask. Brp is the fly homolog of mammalian ELKS/CAST/ERC and is a structural component of the presynaptic electron-dense T-bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the number of presynapses is indistinguishable when quantified by masking endogenous Brp signal or by driving cell type-specific overexpression of Brp-short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>), validating our approach. We focused on defining the lowest odorant concentration leading to robust reductions in VM7 OSN innervation volume and presynaptic number. We exposed 0–2 DPE animals to 5%, 10%, and 15% [v/v] EB or vehicle (mineral oil [MO]) and quantified presynapse number and Or42a terminal arbor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Neither 5% or 10% EB significantly alters overall Or42a innervation volume or presynapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In contrast, we observe a 44% loss of Or42a terminal arbors and a 39% reduction in presynapse number in animals exposed to 15% EB from 0 to 2 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Thus, 15% EB is suﬃcient to drive at least a short-term reduction in Or42a OSN innervation. The comparable decrease in OSN innervation volume and presynapse number suggests that there is not a selective removal of either presynaptic membrane or active zone components.</p><p>The loss of presynaptic release sites suggests fewer functional synapses, but whether innervation of PNs by Or42a OSNs is functionally reduced is unknown. To answer this question, we employed perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology to record spontaneous activity from PNs postsynaptic to Or42a OSNs (VM7 PNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Spontaneous activity of VM7 PNs was recorded ex vivo in brains in which the peripheral OSN axons were left intact, leading to persistence of spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We recorded spontaneous activity from VM7 PNs at 2–3 DPE following EB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Recordings were performed at least two hours after stopping odor exposure to ensure that our results were not confounded by short-term olfactory habituation. Strikingly, spontaneous activity is strongly decreased in VM7 PNs following 0–2 DPE EB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). VM7 PNs were completely silent in 5 of the 7 EB-exposed brains we recorded from, while the frequency of firing in the two animals with residual synaptic activity was decreased 20-fold relative to MO-exposed brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). To assess whether membrane properties of PNs are altered by EB exposure, we measured spike onset latency and the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) decay time constant. We find no diﬀerence in either metric in MO versus EB-exposed brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>), suggesting that intrinsic biophysical properties of these PNs are unchanged; additionally, previous studies have shown that OSN health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>) and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>) is generally unaﬀected by chronic odor exposure.

Whereas OSN axon pathfinding and target recognition are largely completed after the first half of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Komiyama and Luo, 2006</xref>), the second half is characterized by a burst of synapse formation in many AL glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aimino et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muthukumar et al., 2014</xref>).

This prolonged period of synapse addition in olfactory circuits coincides with a period of heightened experience-dependent synapse plasticity. In addition to VM7, other glomeruli (e.g. DM2, DM5, and V) exhibit structural plasticity following chronic odor exposure over the first week of adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devaud et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous work suggests that OSN terminals in VM7 have become insensitive to chronic EB exposure by the second week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>), but whether they can be remodeled throughout the first week is unknown. This is an important question given recent work demonstrating that synapse formation is widespread across the AL from mid-pupal stages through the first week of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimino et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that this broad temporal domain represents a period of enhanced plasticity. Hence, we tested whether the structural plasticity observed by Or42a OSNs at 0–2 DPE reflects a more broadly defined sensitive period, or rather a well-defined critical period with a clear beginning and end. We exposed animals to 15% EB in 48hr intervals immediately before and after the 0–2 DPE window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–I</xref>). We found that exposing pupae to 15% EB for the last 2 days of pupal development (48hr-96hr APF) does not alter innervation volume or presynapse number of Or42a OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D and G</xref>). Thus, although this is a period of active synaptogenesis in the AL, synapse formation in late pupal Or42a OSNs does not appear to be influenced by environmental odorants, likely due in part to the physical barrier of the puparium limiting exposure to odorants and other sensory cues.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The first 2 days after eclosion is a critical period for Or42a OSNs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Schematic of the odorant exposure paradigms used in (<bold>D–I</bold>).

We exposed animals to 15% EB from 2 to 4 DPE, a period during which many glomeruli (including VM7) are still in a phase of synapse addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>) and assayed both terminal arbor size, via Or42a::mCD8-GFP, and presynapse number, as marked by Brp. We found that terminal arbor size and presynapse number in these animals is unchanged from those exposed to mineral oil over the same interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F I</xref>). Thus, the temporal window for experience-dependent plasticity of Or42a OSNs closes at 2 DPE and is unlikely to be a mere reflection of the fact that these terminals are normally in a phase of net synapse addition.</p><p>The temporal features of the critical period for Or42a OSNs are similar to those defined for other EB- sensitive glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, following 0–2 DPE EB exposure, the number of inhibitory synapses between PNs and LNs in EB- responsive glomeruli DM2 and DM5 increases. In other words, for these two glomeruli the increase in glomerular volume is proposed to result from more inhibitory LN1-PN synapses, without a change in the size of the OSN terminal itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>). To further investigate the specificity of experience-dependent OSN pruning, we tested whether the OSNs innervating DM2 (Or22a OSNs), which also sense EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), are pruned following early-life EB exposure. We find that Or22a OSN terminal arbor size is not altered upon EB exposure from 0 to 2 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). This result is consistent with that observed for DM5 OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>), and argues that the loss of primary sensory neuron innervation during the critical period is relatively specific to VM7. We hypothesize that the diﬀerent forms of critical period plasticity observed in VM7 versus DM2 and DM5 may reflect distinct adaptations to chronic saturating odor exposure regulated by the diﬀerent sensitivities of the respective OSNs to EB (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Or42a OSN-PN circuit does not recover from critical period pruning</title><p>Developmental critical periods are temporal windows when sensory experience drives long-term changes to the structure and function of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hensch, 2005</xref>). Thus, before calling the structural remodeling observed in VM7 from 0 to 2 DPE a true critical period, we wanted to establish if EB exposure causes persistent anatomical and/or functional eﬀects. Or42a OSN terminal volume has been found to recover as soon as 12hr after EB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>), calling into question whether this striking anatomical remodeling is the product of a true critical period or a more transient form of time-limited plasticity. Thus, we set out to assess not only Or42a OSN terminal volume, but also presynapse number and PN activity following early-life EB exposure. In these experiments, we exposed 0–2 DPE flies to 15% EB as before, but instead of quantifying synaptic content or spontaneous PN activity immediately, we tested animals five days after the end of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>), Or42a-positive OSN terminals return to their normal size after animals were returned to a normal rearing environment for five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Thus, while OSN axon terminals repopulate the VM7 glomerulus during a recovery period following EB exposure, presynaptic terminals are not restored, opening the door to long-term functional eﬀects of early-life EB exposure.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The VM7 OSN-PN circuit does not recover from critical period pruning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the odorant exposure paradigm used in (<bold>B–H</bold>).

Before testing this, we investigated if ensheathing glial processes infiltrate VM7 following critical period EB exposure, and if so, whether this is Draper-dependent. This question is important because under normal circumstances, ensheathing glia wrap their processes around individual antennal lobe glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freeman, 2015</xref>), but do not extensively infiltrate them. However, they dramatically change their morphology following injury to OSN axons. Severing OSN axons by surgically removing OSN cell bodies in the antennae or maxillary palps leads to Wallerian degeneration of antennal lobe distal axons and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>).

Given that ensheathing glia have the capacity to radically change their morphology in an injury context, we wondered whether they might also do so during the critical period.</p><p>To address this question, we simultaneously labeled ensheathing glial membranes with RFP (GMR56F03-GAL&gt;UAS-mCD8::RFP) and knocked down <italic>draper</italic> expression in ensheathing glia (GMR56F03-GAL4&gt;UAS-<italic>draper</italic> RNAi, UAS-<italic>draper-I</italic> RNAi, or UAS-luciferase [control]) in animals where VM7 OSN terminals are labeled with Or42a-mCD8::GFP. We exposed these animals to either mineral oil or 15% EB from 0 to 2 DPE and estimated infiltration by quantifying the percentage of total VM7 volume overlapping with the volume of ensheathing glial processes in Imaris. In mineral oil- exposed controls, we find that only 3.9% of VM7 volume is infiltrated by ensheathing glial processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with the ensheathing function of this glial subtype. In stark contrast, 24.8% of VM7 volume overlaps with ensheathing glial membranes following critical period EB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that ensheathing glia have invaded VM7 and are thus well-poised to be directly involved in phagocytosing Or42a OSN axons and synapses. Following axotomy, loss of Draper abrogates ensheathing glial infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>) demonstrating that Draper-mediated signaling drives the morphological transformation of glia as well as elimination of debris. This dual requirement for Draper in the AL injury response prompted us to test whether it similarly drives ensheathing glial invasion during critical period remodeling.

To test this idea, we employed a sensor that takes advantage of the acidification in phagocytic compartments. We used MApHS (membrane-associated pH sensor), in which ecliptic pHluorin is fused to the extracellular side of CD4-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ji et al., 2023</xref>). Ecliptic pHluorin is brightest at pH 7.5 but grows increasingly dim as the pH decreases. Because the fluorescence of tdTomato is not pH sensitive, the ratio of pHluorin/tdTomato has been used as a measure of Draper-mediated phagocytosis of the neurons expressing the sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ji et al., 2023</xref>). We expressed MApHS in Or42a OSNs via Or42a-GAL4 and measured the pHluorin/tdTomato ratio in flies exposed to either mineral oil or EB during the critical period. Strikingly, we observe a loss of the pHluorin signal only in flies exposed to EB from 0 to 2 DPE, leading to a decrease in the pHluorin/tdTomato ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This result is consistent with critical period elimination of Or42a OSN presynaptic terminals by phagocytosis. To test whether phagocytosis of Or42a OSN terminals requires Draper-mediated signaling in ensheathing glia, we again silenced <italic>draper</italic> via two independent RNAi lines. To permit independent control of gene expression in sensory neurons and ensheathing glia, we employed two distinct binary expression systems. The GAL4-UAS system was again used to drive MApHS in Or42a OSNs (Or42a-GAL4&gt;UAS- pHluorin::tdTomato) and the LexA-LexAOp system was used to silence <italic>draper</italic> in ensheathing glia (GMR56F03-LexA&gt;LexAop-<italic>draper</italic> RNAi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coutinho-Budd et al., 2017</xref>).

We focused on the VM7 glomerulus, which contains axonal projections of Or42a olfactory sensory neurons, the OSN type with the greatest sensitivity for ethyl butyrate. Or42a OSN terminals exhibit a striking form of early-life structural plasticity; namely, they shrink dramatically in size following intense early-life EB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golovin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we elucidate several key features of early-life VM7 plasticity. First, we define an EB concentration (15%v/v in oil) driving elimination of Or42a OSN terminals only when animals are exposed from 0 to 2 DPE. This odor concentration has no eﬀect when presented either immediately before or after. We go on to show that EB exposure from 0 to 2 DPE has long-term consequences for odor processing since both synapse number and synaptic activity remain persistently decreased following cessation of odor exposure. Together, the clearly delineated temporal window and the persistent eﬀect on olfactory circuit function argue that VM7 remodeling is an excellent model in which to investigate underlying mechanisms. We go on to show that Or42a OSN axon terminals are eliminated by ensheathing glia which invade the glomerulus and phagocytose axon terminals via the engulfment receptor Draper. Here we discuss our findings in the broader contexts of Draper-mediated signaling as well as critical period regulation and plasticity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Draper drives both ensheathing glial infiltration and synapse engulfment in the critical period</title><p>We found that loss of Draper in ensheathing glia completely blocks their ability to invade VM7 and phagocytose Or42a presynaptic terminals in response to critical-period EB exposure. Strikingly, loss of Draper also fully restores spontaneous activity of PNs, arguing that presynaptic terminals remain intact and active until they are engulfed by ensheathing glia. These essential functions of Draper in activity-dependent pruning are similar to the stringent requirement for Draper in the glial injury response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ziegenfuss et al., 2012</xref>). In the context of axon injury, Draper is proposed to act upstream of other steps in the engulfment response, including upregulation of phagocytosis genes and extension of glial membranes to injured axons. We propose that Draper-mediated signaling similarly orchestrates multiple components of the glial response during critical period plasticity.</p><p>The essential requirement for Draper in experience-dependent pruning during the critical period appears distinct from Draper’s role in stereotyped pruning of the mushroom body. During metamorphosis, mushroom body γ lobe axons are engulfed by astrocytes using the Draper and Crk/Mbc/Ced-12 pathways in a partially redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tasdemir-Yilmaz and Freeman, 2014</xref>). Loss of Draper results in a two-day delay in γ lobe pruning, but axons are ultimately pruned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awasaki et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, astrocyte infiltration has been shown to be a key step in γ lobe axon defasciculation and pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marmor-Kollet et al., 2023</xref>). It is also noteworthy that we do not observe fragmentation of EB-exposed Or42a OSN terminals in the absence of glial Draper signaling, as evidenced by the normal spontaneous release from Or42a presynaptic terminals in repo-GAL4&gt;UAS- <italic>draper</italic> RNAi flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). This contrasts with other pruning models in <italic>Drosophila</italic> such as the larval NMJ and the mushroom body γ, where axonal or synaptic debris accumulates in the absence of Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuentes-Medel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tasdemir-Yilmaz and Freeman, 2014</xref>). For example, γ lobe axon remodeling is proposed to constitute a two-step process of (1) axon fragmentation and (2) clearance of neuronal debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakim et al., 2014</xref>). Draper’s function in debris clearance, but not axon fragmentation, indicates that the γ lobe intrinsic axon fragmentation program is intact in <italic>draper</italic> null mutants. In contrast, the absence of Or42a physiological changes with loss of glial Draper in critical period EB exposure opens the door to Draper playing a more instructive role in this process. To address this issue, it will be important to assess if Draper overexpression is suﬃcient to increase the extent of critical period pruning, or whether additional regulatory steps upstream of Draper are involved, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McLaughlin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Draper’s central role in this critical period plasticity model is consistent with work in mammals demonstrating that the mammalian Draper homolog MEGF10 is crucial for experience-dependent synapse pruning during development and in adults.

While astrocytic processes are highly ramified and intimately associated with antennal lobe synapses, they are not responsible for synaptic pruning in the critical period paradigm discussed here or in the antennal lobe axotomy model. However, while astrocytes do not directly eliminate EB-exposed axon terminals in VM7, it is entirely possible that astrocytes are otherwise involved in critical period plasticity. For example, they may orchestrate the events of phagocytosis by signaling to other glial subtypes, as they do in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jha et al., 2019</xref>).

The diﬀerences among these disparate pruning paradigms with respect to glial subtype involved and molecular program engaged demonstrate that synapse pruning is subject to tight, context-specific, regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Glomeruli exhibit dichotomous responses to critical period odor exposure</title><p>By the end of pupariation, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe has attained its characteristic adult morphology and infiltration with astrocyte and ensheathing glial processes, although there is a paucity of data on the degree to which OSNs can detect environmental odorants within the puparium.</p><p>Similarly to mammals which are born without sight or hearing, the pupal stage may act as a physical barrier against the opening of experience-dependent plasticity for this and other sensory circuits. For the first week of life, synapses continue to be added such that the antennal lobe is estimated to expand by roughly 40% over the first 12days of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devaud et al., 2003a</xref>). The animal’s behavioral response to odors matures over the same time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devaud et al., 2003a</xref>). Perhaps not surprisingly then, a large body of work demonstrates that olfactory circuitry retains plasticity into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devaud et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mallick et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>), with the first 48hr of adulthood representing a critical period for several odors, including CO<sub>2</sub> and ethyl butyrate. Intriguingly, the cellular targets of plasticity among glomeruli diﬀer. DM2 and DM5 (two EB-responsive glomeruli) as well as V (the lone CO<sub>2</sub>-responsive glomerulus) increase in size following critical period odor exposure because of elaboration of PN dendrites, likely stemming from strengthening of GABAergic interneuron inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, as described here, another EB- responsive glomerulus, VM7, decreases in size following concentrated odorant exposure resulting from glial phagocytosis of the Or42a OSN axon terminals. While functional consequences have been ascribed to DM2, DM5, and V critical period plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chodankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>), it was unclear whether VM7 remodeling had enduring eﬀects. We now show that while Or42a OSN axon terminal volume recovers, synapse number and postsynaptic PN activity remain decreased for at least 5 days after the end of the exposure, demonstrating long-term consequences of VM7 plasticity during the critical period.</p><p>It is unknown whether VM7 remodeling is restricted to Or42a terminals themselves or whether PN and LN terminals are also targets of critical period remodeling in this glomerulus. It has been reported that the overall size of the VM7 PN dendritic arbor is unaltered following chronic EB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golovin et al., 2021</xref>). Moving forward, it will be important to test whether the number of VM7 PN and LN synapses change following critical period remodeling using new cell-type-specific labeling techniques for pre- and post-synaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aimino et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parisi et al., 2023</xref>). Regardless of whether VM7 plasticity is strictly confined to its OSNs, VM7 appears distinct among EB-responsive glomeruli in pruning OSN arbors at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Why might the cellular target(s) of plasticity diﬀer in VM7 and DM2/DM5? It may be a function of the olfactory system’s flexibility with regard to EB odor coding. EB is known as a ‘public odor’ since it binds with varying aﬃnities to multiple odorant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Münch and Galizia, 2016</xref>). Indeed, EB activates VM7 OSNs at much lower odor concentrations than OSNs in either DM2 or DM5, indicating it has a higher aﬃnity for Or42a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>). We propose that Or42a pruning may be a means to eﬃciently silence these OSNs at high odor concentrations to preserve odor encoding across a wide range of concentrations. Interestingly, Or42b OSNs, which express the closely related Or42b receptor and are also activated at low EB concentrations, are silenced by high EB concentration along much shorter time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tadres et al., 2022</xref>). This is proposed to occur via a reversible ‘depolarization block’ of Or42b OSNs. We propose that critical period Or42a pruning reflects a more drastic version of the same strategy, irreversibly silencing Or42a inputs when they are unlikely to be needed in the adult’s anticipated sensory environment. If so, Or42b OSNs are also predicted to be pruned following chronic exposure to high concentrations of EB. This mechanism may be generalizable to other OSNs expressing high-aﬃnity receptors for public odors, blocking overwhelming input from a single OSN in animals raised in an environment saturated with its cognate odorant. Given that critical periods permit an individual’s early experiences to be hard-wired into their neuronal circuitry, activity-dependent pruning may serve to maintain odor encoding in animals raised in a wide array of sensory environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Or42a-mCD8::GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golovin et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Broadie lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GMR56F03-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC Stock #39157;

Shapiro-Wilks normality testing showed that our data was not normally distributed, so nonparametric tests were used: the Mann-Whitney test for comparisons of two samples, and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons for three or more samples. All tests were two-tailed with an alpha of 0.05, and no outliers were excluded. p-values are represented as follows: ns, not significant (p≥0.05); *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-100989-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and statistical analyses generated by this study are included in the source data files provided for each figure.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Kendal Broadie, Marc Freeman, and Mary Logan for fly stocks.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive these enduring changes are not fully understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the antennal lobe is composed of synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs), arranged into distinct glomeruli. Many of these glomeruli show structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, reflecting the sensitivity of the olfactory circuitry to early sensory experiences.</p><p>In their study, the authors explored the role of glia in the development of the antennal lobe in young adult flies, proposing that glial cells might also play a role in experience-dependent plasticity. They identified a critical period during which both structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses occur within the ethyl butyrate (EB)-responsive VM7 glomerulus. When flies were exposed to EB within the first two days post-eclosion, significant reductions in glomerular volume, presynaptic terminal numbers, and postsynaptic activity were observed. The study further highlights the importance of the highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper in facilitating this critical period plasticity. The authors demonstrated that, in response to EB exposure during this developmental window, ensheathing glia increase Draper expression, infiltrate the VM7 glomerulus, and actively phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals. This synapse pruning has lasting effects on circuit function, leading to persistent decreases in both OSN-PN synapse numbers and spontaneous PN activity as analyzed by perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology to record spontaneous activity from PNs postsynaptic to Or42a OSNs .</p><p>In my view, this is an intriguing and potentially valuable set of data.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>After carefully reviewing the revised manuscript, I am satisfied with the authors' responses to my initial suggestions, particularly regarding the synaptic readouts used in their analyses. The authors have clarified their approach with appropriate changes in wording, which enhance the manuscript's clarity and address my previous concerns. Although I believe it could have been beneficial to incorporate postsynaptic markers to further substantiate the findings, I understand this may not have been feasible within the scope of the current study.</p><p>Overall, I find that the major claims of the manuscript are now sufficiently supported by the presented data. The revisions have improved the manuscript, and I am confident it meets the standards for publication. I therefore recommend the manuscript for publication in its current form.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100989.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leier</surname><given-names>Hans C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Foden</surname><given-names>Alexander J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve Unversity School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jindal</surname><given-names>Darren A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wilkov</surname><given-names>Abigail J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Van der Linden Costello</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vanderzalm</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>John Carroll University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Heights</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coutinho-Budd</surname><given-names>Jaeda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tabuchi</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Broihier</surname><given-names>Heather T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Case Western Reserve University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Time periods in which experience regulates early plasticity in sensory circuits are well established, but the mechanisms that control these critical periods are poorly understood.

It was a genuine delight to read this paper. I have two experimental suggestions that would really round out existing work to better support the existing conclusions and some instances where additional data or tempered language in describing results would better support their conclusions. Overall, though, this is an incredibly important finding, a careful analysis, and an excellent mechanistic advance in understanding sensory critical period biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful and constructive comments on our manuscript. In response to their critiques, we conducted several new experiments as well as additional analysis and making changes to the text. As requested, we carried out an electrophysiological analysis of VM7 PN firing in <italic>draper</italic> knockdown animals with and without odor exposure. To our surprise, loss of glial Draper fully suppresses the dramatic reduction in spontaneous PN activity observed following critical period ethyl butyrate exposure, arguing that the functional response is restored alongside OSN morphology. It also suggests that the Or42a OSN terminals are intact and functional until they are phagocytosed by ensheathing glia. In other words, glia are not merely clearing axon terminals that have already degenerated. This evidence provides additional support to the claim that the VM7 glomerulus will be an outstanding model for defining mechanism of experience-dependent glial pruning. Detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments follow below.</p><p>Regarding the apparent disconnect between the near complete silencing of PNs versus the 50% reduction in Or42a OSN infiltration volume, we agree with the reviewer that this tracks with previous data in the field. While our Imaris pipeline is relatively sensitive, it may not pick up modest changes to terminal arbor architecture. Indeed, as described in Jindal et al. (2023) and in the Methods in this manuscript, we chose conservative software settings that, if anything, would undercount the percent change in infiltration volume. We also note that increased inhibitory LN inputs onto PNs could contribute to dramatic PN silencing we observe. While fascinating, we view LN plasticity beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We removed any mention of ‘silent synapses’ and now speculate about increased inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major Elements:</p><p>(1) The authors demonstrate that loss of draper in glia can suppress many of the pruning related phenotypes associated with EB exposure. However, they do not assess electrophysiological output in these experiments, only morphology. It would be great to see recordings from those animals to see if the functional response is also restored.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment the reviewer requested (see Figure 4F-J). We are pleased to report that our recordings from VM7 PNs match our morphology measurements: in repo-GAL4&gt;UAS-<italic>draper</italic> RNAi flies, there was no difference in the innervation of VM7 PNs between animals exposed to mineral oil or 15% EB from 0-2 DPE. This result is in sharp contrast to the near-total loss of OSN-PN innervation in flies with intact glial Draper signaling, and strongly validates the role we propose for Draper in the Or42a OSN critical period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a disconnect between physiology and morphology with a near complete loss of activity from VM7 PNs but a less severe loss of ORN synapses. While not completely incongruent (previous work in the AL showed a complete loss of attractive behavior though synapse number was only reduced 40% - Mosca et al. 2017, eLife), it is curious. Can the authors comment further? Ideally, some of these synapses could be visualized by EM to determine if the remaining synapses are indeed of correct morphology. If not, this could support their assertion of silent inputs from page 7. Further, what happens to the remaining synapses? VM7 PNs should be receiving some activity from other local interneurons as well as neighboring PNs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that on the surface, our electrophysiology results are more striking than one might expect solely from our measurements of VM7 morphology and presynaptic content. As the reviewer points out, previous studies of fly olfaction have consistently found that relatively modest shifts in glomerular volume in response to prolonged earlylife odorant exposure can be accompanied by drastic changes in physiology and behavior (in addition, we would add Devaud et al., 2003; Devaud et al., 2001; Acebes et al., 2012; and Chodankar et al., 2020, as foundational examples of this phenomenon).</p><p>A major driver of these changes appears to be remodeling of antennal lobe inhibitory LNs (see Das et al., 2011; Wilson and Laurent, 2005; Chodankar et al., 2020), especially GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Perhaps increased LN inhibition of chronically activated PNs, on top of the reduced excitatory inputs resulting from ensheathing glial pruning of the Or42a OSN terminal arbor, would explain the near-total loss of VM7 PN activity we observe after critical period EB exposure. However, given that the scope of our study is limited to critical-period glial biology and does not address the complex topics of LN rewiring or synapse morphology, we have removed the sentence in which we raise the possibility of “silent synapses” in order to avoid confusion. The reviewer is also correct that VM7 PNs have inputs from non-ORN presynaptic partners, including LNs and PNs. So again, perhaps increased inhibitory inputs contributes to the near-complete silencing of the PNs. Given the heterogeneity of LN populations, we view this area as fertile ground for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Language / Data Considerations:</p><p>(1) Or42a OSNs have other inputs, namely, from LNs. What are they doing here? Are they also affected?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, the question of how LN innervation of Or42a OSNs is altered by critical-period EB exposure is an intriguing one that fully deserves its own follow-up study, and we have tried to avoid speculation about the role of LNs when discussing our pruning phenotype. We note at multiple points throughout the text the importance of LNs and refer to previous studies of LN plasticity in response to chronic odorant exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In all of the measurements, what happens to synaptic density? Is it maintained? Does it scale precisely? This would be helpful to know.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the analysis as requested, which is now included in a supplement to Figure 5. We found that synaptic density shows no trend in variation across conditions and glial driver genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5, the controls for the alrm-GAL4 experiments show a much more drastic phenotype than controls in previous figures? Does this background influence how we can interpret the results? Could the response have instead hit a floor effect and it's just not possible to recover?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that following EB exposure, astrocyte vs. ensheathing glial driver backgrounds displayed modest differences in the extent of pruning by volume (0.27 for astros, 0.36 for EG). We note that the two <italic>drpr</italic> RNAi lines that we used had non-significant (but opposite) effects on the estimated size of OSN42a OSN volume in combination with the astrocyte driver, arguing against a floor effect. In addition, a recent publication by Nelson et al. (2024) replicated our findings with a different astrocyte GAL4 driver and <italic>draper</italic> RNAi line. Thus, we are confident that this result is biologically meaningful and not an artifact of genetic background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The estimation of infiltration measurement in Figure 6 is tricky to interpret. It implies that the projections occupy the same space, which cannot be possible. I'd advocate a tempering of some of this language and consider an intensity measurement in addition to their current volume measurements (or perhaps an &quot;occupied space&quot; measurement) to more accurately assess the level of resolution that can be obtained via these methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that our language in describing EG infiltration could have been more precise, and we modified our language as suggested. The combination of the Or42a-mCD8::GFP label we and others use, our use of confocal microscopy, and our Surface pipeline in Imaris combine to create a glomerular mask that traces the outline of the OSN terminal arbor, but is nonetheless not 100% “filled” by neuronal membrane and/or glial processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Do the authors have the kind of resolution needed to tell whether there is indeed Or42a-positive axon fragmentation (as asserted on p16 and from their data in figures 4, 5, 7). If the authors want to say this, I would advocate for a measurement of fragmentation / total volume to prove it - if not, I would advocate tempering of the current language.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a fair criticism: while our assertion about axon fragmentation was based on our visual observations of hundreds of EB-exposed brains, the resolution limits of confocal microscopy do not allow us to rigorously rule out fragmentation within a bundle of OSN axons. Instead, our most compelling evidence for the lack of EB-induced Or42a OSN fragmentation in the absence of glial Draper comes from our new electrophysiology data (Figure 4F-J) in repo-GAL4&gt;UAS-<italic>draper</italic> RNAi animals. We found no difference in spontaneous release from Or42a terminals in flies exposed to mineral oil or 15% EB from 0-2 DPE, which would not be the case if there was Draper-independent fragmentation along the axons or terminal arbors upon EB exposure. We have updated our discussion of fragmentation so that our statements are based on this new evidence, and not confocal microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) There is an interesting Discussion opportunity missed here. Some experiments would, ostensibly, require pupae to detect odorants within the casing via structures consistently in place for olfaction during pupation. It would be useful for the authors to discuss a little more deeply when this critical period may arise and why the experiment where pupae are exposed to EB two days before eclosion and there is no response, occurs as it does. I agree that it's clearly a time when they are not sensitive to the odorant, but that could just be because there's no ability to detect odorants at that time. Is it a question of non-sensitivity to EB or just non-sensitivity to everything?</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s interest in the plasticity of the olfactory circuit during pupariation, although, as they correctly point out, it is difficult to conceive of an odorant-exposure experiment that could disentangle the barrier effects of puparium from the sensitivity of the circuit itself, and our pre-eclosion data in Figure 3A, D, G does not distinguish between the two. While an investigation into mechanism by which the critical period for ethyl butyrate exposure opens and closes is outside the scope of the present study, we would consider the physical barrier of the puparium to be a satisfactory explanation for why eclosion marks the functional opening of experiencedependent plasticity. As the reviewer suggests, we have added this important nuance to our discussion of the opening of the critical period in the corresponding paragraph of the Results, as well as to the Discussion section “Glomeruli exhibit dichotomous responses to critical period odor exposure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Elements:</p><p>(1) Page 6 bottom: &quot;Or4a-mCD8::GFP&quot; should be &quot;Or42a-mCD8::GFP&quot;</p><p>(2) Page 15, end of last full paragraph.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive these enduring changes are not fully understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the antennal lobe is composed of synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs), arranged into distinct glomeruli. Many of these glomeruli show structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, reflecting the sensitivity of the olfactory circuitry to early sensory experiences.</p><p>In their study, the authors explored the role of glia in the development of the antennal lobe in young adult flies, proposing that glial cells might also play a role in experiencedependent plasticity. They identified a critical period during which both structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses occur within the ethyl butyrate (EB)responsive VM7 glomerulus. When flies were exposed to EB within the first two days post-eclosion, significant reductions in glomerular volume, presynaptic terminal numbers, and postsynaptic activity were observed. The study further highlights the importance of the highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper in facilitating this critical period plasticity. The authors demonstrated that, in response to EB exposure during this developmental window, ensheathing glia increase Draper expression, infiltrate the VM7 glomerulus, and actively phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals. This synapse pruning has lasting effects on circuit function, leading to persistent decreases in both OSN-PN synapse numbers and spontaneous PN activity as analyzed by perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology to record spontaneous activity from PNs postsynaptic to Or42a OSNs.</p><p>In my view, this is an intriguing and potentially valuable set of data. However, since I am not an expert in critical periods or habituation, I do not feel entirely qualified to assess the full significance or the novelty of their findings, particularly in relation to existing research.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful critique of our work. In response to their comments, we added additional physiological analysis and tempered our language around possible explanations for the apparent disconnect between the physiological and morphological critical period odor exposure. These changes are explained in more detail in the response to the public review by Reviewer 1 and also in our responses outlined below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I though do have specific comments and questions concerning the presynaptic phenotype they deduce from confocal BRP stainings and electrophysiology.</p><p>Concerning the number of active zones: this can hardly be deduced from standardresolution confocal images and, maybe more importantly, lacking postsynaptic markers. This particularly also in the light of them speculating about &quot;silent synapses&quot;. There are now tools existing concerning labeled, cell type specific expression of acetylcholine-receptor expression and cholinergic postsynaptic density markers (importantly Drep2). Such markers should be entailed in their analysis. They should refer to previous concerning &quot;brp-short&quot; concerning its original invention and prior usage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful approach to our methodology and claims. While the use of confocal microscopy of Bruchpilot puncta to estimate numbers of presynapses is standard practice (see Furusawa et al., 2023; Aimino et al., 2022; Urwyler et al., 2019; Ackerman et al., 2021), the reviewer is correct that a punctum does not an active zone make. Bruchpilot staining and quantification is a well-validated tool for approximating the number of presynaptic active zones, not a substitute for super-resolution microscopy. We made changes to our language about active zones to make this distinction clearer. We have also removed the sentence where we discuss the possibility of “silent synapses,” which both reviewers felt was too speculative for our existing data. Finally, we are highly interested in characterizing the response of PNs and higher-order processing centers to critical-period odorant exposure as a future direction for our research. However, given the complexity of the subject, we chose to limit the scope of this study to the interactions between OSNs and glia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding their electrophysiological analysis and the plausibility of their findings: I am uncertain whether the moderate reduction in BRP puncta at the relevant OSN::PN synapse can fully account for the significantly reduced spontaneous PN activity they report. This seems particularly doubtful in the absence of any direct evidence for postsynaptically silent synapses. Perhaps this is my own naivety, but I wonder why they did not use antennal nerve stimulation in their experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to previous studies of the AL indicating that moderate changes in glomerular volume and presynaptic content can translate to far more striking alterations in electrophysiology and behavior (Devaud et al., 2003; Devaud et al., 2001; Acebes et al., 2012; and Chodankar et al., 2020, Mosca et al., 2017). This literature has demonstrated that chronic odorant exposure can result in remodeling of inhibitory local interneurons to suppress over-active inputs from OSNs. While we do not address the complex subject of interneuron remodeling in the present study, we find it highly likely that there would be significant changes in interneuron innervation of PNs, independent of glial phagocytosis of OSN excitatory inputs, resulting in additional inhibition. Moving forward, we are very interested in expanding these studies to include odor-evoked changes in PN activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional minor point: The phrase &quot;Soon after its molecular biology was described (et al., 1999), the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>&quot; seems somewhat misleading.
