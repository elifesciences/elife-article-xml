These conditions, which feed the spread of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, nephropathy, and other diseases, are commonly clustered under the umbrella term metabolic syndrome (MS) or syndrome X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Saklayen, 2018</xref>). MS is a consequence of chronic over-nutrition, turning the evolutionary drive to gather energy from the environment into a liability. As a whole, MS currently exists as an untreatable malady despite decades of basic research and drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Saklayen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Through the study of a rare genetic condition in humans, neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS, also known as marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome), we recently discovered a fasting-induced, glucogenic, and orexigenic hormone that is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin (encoded by FBN1) and named it asprosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>). Its two major sites of action are the liver and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). At the liver, asprosin causes a glucogenic effect through a cAMP-PKA-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>). It was found recently to promote hepatic glucose release through the binding of OR4M1, an olfactory G-coupled protein receptor in the rhodopsin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, asprosin was shown to bind the mouse ortholog, Olfr734 with high affinity, and elimination of the receptor considerably reduced the glucogenic effects of exogenously administered asprosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>). There is also evidence, that asprosin crosses the blood brain barrier and exerts effects on the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, asprosin directly activates orexigenic AgRP neurons and indirectly inhibits anorexigenic POMC neurons, resulting in appetite stimulation. Patients with NPS, a human genetic model of deficiency in plasma asprosin, present with low appetite associated with extreme leanness and robust insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). NPS mutations in mice (<italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS</sup><sup>/+</sup></italic>) result in phenocopy of the human disorder, and depressed AgRP neuron activity, which can be restored to normal with asprosin replenishment in vivo and ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup></italic> mice are completely immune to diet-induced MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). On the opposite end of the energy-balance spectrum, patients and mice with MS exhibit elevated plasma asprosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ugur and Aydin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baykus et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that pharmacologic inhibition of asprosin is particularly well suited to the treatment of MS, a condition in need of simultaneous reduction in both appetite and the blood glucose burden. Similar to humans, mice with MS display elevations in plasma asprosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baykus et al., 2019</xref>), making them ideal preclinical models for testing this hypothesis.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated three independent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize unique asprosin epitopes and investigated their preclinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of MS. We specifically dissected the suitability of acute and chronic asprosin neutralization in three different mouse models of MS – mice treated with a high-fat diet (diet-induced obesity [DIO]), mice with genetic leptin receptor mutation (<italic>Lepr</italic><sup>db/db</sup>), and mice treated with a diet rich in fructose and cholesterol in addition to fat (AMLN diet). For absolute proof-of-concept, we tested the ability of artificially induced plasma asprosin (adenovirus and adeno-associated virus mediated hepatic overexpression of a forcibly secreted form of asprosin) to raise blood glucose, appetite, and body weight, even in the presence of normal chow, followed by rescue of those parameters with mAb-mediated neutralization of asprosin. Our results demonstrate a promising treatment of MS with the use of anti-asprosin mAbs as a targeted, bimodal therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Animal resource</italic> (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J mice</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Animal resource (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6-Fbn1em1Chop/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:033548">IMSR_JAX:033548</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Animal resource (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J DIO</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:380050">IMSR_JAX:380050</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Animal resource (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000697">IMSR_JAX:000697</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Research rodent food</td><td valign="top">Dustless pellet diet</td><td valign="top">Bio-Ser</td><td valign="top">F0173</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Research rodent food</td><td valign="top">High-fat diet</td><td valign="top">Envigo Teklad</td><td valign="top">TD.06414</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Research rodent food</td><td valign="top">AMLN diet</td><td valign="top">Research Diets</td><td valign="top">D09100301</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-asprosin mAb</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-asprosin mAb</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Human anti-asprosin mAb</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse secondary antibody</td><td valign="top">Tonbo Biosciences</td><td valign="top">72–8042 M001</td><td valign="top">1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rabbit secondary antibody</td><td valign="top">Cytiva’s Amersham ECL</td><td valign="top">NA934-1ML</td><td valign="top">1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adenoviral vector</td><td valign="top">Ad5-hFBN1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">3.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adenoviral vector</td><td valign="top">Ad5-hAsprosin</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">5 × 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adeno-associated viral vector</td><td valign="top">AAV8-hAsprosin</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adenoviral vector</td><td valign="top">Ad5-Empty</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">3.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mouse or 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adeno-associated viral vector</td><td valign="top">AAV8-Empty</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial kit</td><td valign="top">cAMP ELISA kit</td><td valign="top">Crystal Chemicals</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 581001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial kit</td><td valign="top">Glucose quantitation kit</td><td valign="top">Cayman Chemicals</td><td valign="top">Catalog #

Food intake was recorded for 24 hr, and mice were returned to normal housing. Food intake was manually measured in 24 hr experiments in DIO mice and Ad5 and AAV8 studies. In Ad5 and AAV8 studies, mice were singly housed in standard caging and fed a pelleted, dustless diet (F0173, Bio-Serv). In single day DIO experiments, mice were acclimated to crushed high-fat diet (60% calories from fat, TD.06414, Envigo Teklad) in single housing.

Immediately prior to imaging, mice (n = 7 and 8 for each group) were weighed and anesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane in oxygen. Lean mass, fat mass, and overall body weight were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bederman et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the anesthetized mice were placed in a prone position within a Bruker Biospec 7T MRI scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). A 72-mm-diameter volume coil was used for excitation and signal detection to maximize the uniformity of the images. After localizer scans, a relaxation compensated fat fraction (RCFF) MRI acquisition and reconstruction process was used to generate quantitative fat fraction maps for each imaging slice. A semiautomatic image analysis was performed to generate separate fat and water images for each imaging slice. Total fat volume and lean body volume were calculated from a compilation of the fat fraction images and each animal’s weight. The fat fraction and water fraction images were then segmented to calculate the respective volumes of peritoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Plasma parameters</title><p>Mouse glucose was determined using a hand-held glucometer (OneTouch Ultra2, LifeScan) from a droplet of tail blood, and insulin was measured using Crystal Chem (catalog # 90080) mouse insulin ELISA kit.

An anti-rabbit secondary antibody linked to HRP was used to generate a signal, and mammalian-cell produced recombinant human asprosin was used to generate a standard curve. Human asprosin was detected in 10 µl of EDTA-treated human plasma. For detection of human asprosin in plasma of mice treated with human asprosin expressing adeno and adeno-associated viruses, plasma samples were first processed for IgG and albumin removal using Proteome purify2 columns (R and D Systems, catalog # IDR002) and concentrated using vivaspin 500 (VS0131) PES filters before running the ELISA.</p><p>Additional characterization of rabbit and human anti-asprosin mAb was done as previously described for the mouse mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>).

As a control, recombinant asprosin (1 nM) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of isotype-matched IgG antibody. Thereafter, free asprosin was detected using sandwich ELISA as follows: free asprosin in the mixture of recombinant asprosin preincubated with increasing dose of the rabbit mAb or IgG was captured with the rabbit mAb and detected with the anti-asprosin mouse mAb. HRP-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was used to generate a signal. Similarly, free asprosin in the mixture of recombinant asprosin preincubated with increasing dose of the human mAb or IgG was captured with the human mAb and detected with the anti-asprosin rabbit mAb.

Subsequently, captured asprosin was then incubated in parallel with each of the three different mAbs (100 ng/well, 3 × 3 matrix). Depending on which species antibody was used in the second step, a species-matched secondary detection antibody was used. For example, each well that was incubated with a mouse anti-asprosin mAb in the second step was then incubated with an anti-mouse secondary HRP-conjugated antibody. Mouse/mouse, rabbit/rabbit, and human/human pairs served as internal positive control.

Furthermore, a single injection of each of the three mAbs resulted in significant reduction in hepatic cAMP levels in fasting DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g,h</xref>).

All three GOF tools produce an increase in blood glucose, appetite, and body weight in vivo. All three LOF tools produce the opposite in vivo. The fact that these six new experimental strategies produce consistent changes in blood glucose, appetite, and body weight in both directions (loss- or gain-of-function) leaves little doubt as to asprosin’s function in physiology. In other words, these new results make it exceedingly difficult for asprosin’s physiological effects to be explained by potential toxicity or reagent impurity. These diverse GOF and LOF tools also emphasize the high reproducibility of asprosin biology given that the proof obtained from such varied approaches bypasses technical difficulties inherent to any specific reagent/method such as recombinant proteins. To underscore this point, four outside groups have by now replicated asprosin’s physiological effects in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hekim, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and also expanded asprosin biology beyond our discoveries (modulation of muscle AMPK, identification of the liver asprosin receptor OR4M1, identification of a new asprosin-like hormone derived from FBN2, placensin). This is particularly important given the inability of one group (von Herrath et al.) to generate active recombinant asprosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">von Herrath et al., 2019</xref>). Our own experience with the unreliability of recombinant asprosin, whether made from mammalian or bacterial cells, makes it reasonable to assume that von Herrath et al. faced the same difficulties. There is no way to discern the quality of recombinant asprosin beyond measuring its effect in animals and cells. Its structure is not known, nor whether it needs a chaperone to attain correct stability/activity. The group that discovered the liver asprosin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>) and reproduced the glucogenic effects of asprosin, remark on struggling with this issue – “Of note, the quality of Asprosin protein is critical for its activity. Similar to the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">von Herrath et al., 2019</xref>, we cannot purify the active His-Asprosin from inclusion bodies in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, we used GST-Asprosin in this study since GST-Asprosin is much more soluble.” Our experience is similar to this, suggesting the need for a chaperone for attainment of reliable activity. As in this study, in the past we utilized several experimental strategies such as human/mouse genetic-mediated LOF, viral transduction-mediated GOF, and monoclonal antibody-mediated LOF to corroborate recombinant asprosin-mediated results, thereby thwarting the latter approach’s unreliability. von Herrath et al. also attempted an alternative approach, reporting negative results with hydrodynamic gene delivery of asprosin. Unfortunately, neither this data, nor pertinent experimental details, such as use of a signal peptide, or most importantly, whether this strategy resulted in increased plasma asprosin levels, were shown. It is therefore impossible to ascertain the validity of this result. In summary, the problem with the von Herrath study is likely that the authors failed to view recombinant asprosin derived negative results skeptically given the inherent unreliability of that approach. Overall, the results presented here combined with the successful replication efforts by several independent groups render moot any remaining concerns about the physiological relevance of asprosin.</p><p>Asprosin neutralization resulted in reduced food intake and a parallel reduction in body weight and adipose mass in mice on a high-fat diet (DIO mice). A similar hypophagic and body weight reduction phenotype was also seen in more severe preclinical models of MS, such as mice on the AMLN diet and mice with a genetic loss of leptin signaling (<italic>Lepr</italic><sup>db/db</sup>). These results indicate that asprosin neutralization is effective independent of leptin and opens therapeutic avenues for a wide range of cases of hyperphagia and obesity. Furthermore, the direction of improvement in response to asprosin neutralization was dependent on the stage and phase of MS. For example, chronic asprosin neutralization prevented weight gain or led to a significant weight loss, depending on the timing of treatment. Younger <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>db/db</sup> mice, while still in the linear phase of body weight increase (12 weeks of age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>), were protected from weight gain upon asprosin neutralization. On the other hand, older <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>db/db</sup> mice that have reached the plateaued weight phase (30 weeks of age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>) lost weight in response to asprosin neutralization.</p><p>Concurrent with decrease in appetite and body weight, anti-asprosin mAb therapy improved the MS-associated hyperglycemia in all preclinical models studied. Importantly, upon mAb treatment, the reduction in blood glucose in fasting DIO mice was not associated with changes in urine glucose levels, ruling out glucosuria as a potential contributing mechanism. Additionally, mAb-mediated improvements in hyperglycemia were independent of change in food intake given that mice were without access to food. Furthermore, a low IC<sub>50</sub> of 30–55 µg/mouse (~1.5 mg/kg) was determined for the four key features of MS (hyperphagia, obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia). The low IC<sub>50</sub>, well within the spectrum of acceptable therapeutic mAb dosing, highlights the pharmacological inhibitory potency of asprosin neutralization for MS in its entirety, rather than improving only a particular manifestation of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Strik et al., 2018</xref>). While the effect of escalating dose on appetite reduction is linear, it exhibits a defined upper and lower threshold when it comes to improvement of other attributes of MS such as blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and body weight. This may indicate arrival at a physiological equilibrium state and the impact of compensatory mechanisms to prevent further, potentially disastrous changes.</p><p>Interestingly, mAb treatment did not result in any changes in lean euglycemic WT mice except for a short-lived reduction in blood glucose (without crossing over into overt hypoglycemia). These results suggest the dependence of anti-asprosin mAb therapeutics on high endogenous asprosin levels and portends a strong safety profile. A strong safety profile and high specificity of anti-asprosin mAbs is reiterated by the complete lack of a response to mAb treatment in <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup></italic> mice that display little circulating asprosin. It is also reiterated by the lack of confounding toxicity or side effects of asprosin neutralization (as measured by general activity, blood markers of inflammation, kidney, and liver health).</p><p>A single dose of the anti-asprosin mAb-improved MS-associated dyslipidemia in DIO mice as evidenced through a reduction in total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and glycerol. This could potentially be explained by the glucose and insulin lowering effects of asprosin neutralization leading to suppression of lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Santoleri and Titchenell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kersten, 2001</xref>). With chronic neutralization, reductions in total cholesterol were noted in DIO and <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>db/db</sup> mice. However, the effect on other lipid species was not as uniform as with single dosing, suggesting compensatory adaptations with chronic asprosin loss-of-function.</p><p>In addition to the mouse mAb, we generated rabbit and fully human mAbs for this study, both of which neutralized recombinant asprosin, similar to what was previously shown for the mouse mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). The human mAb shares an epitope with the mouse mAb, while the rabbit mAb recognizes a distinct asprosin epitope. All three mAbs at a dose of 250 µg/mouse (~5 mg/kg) improved glucose tolerance and resulted in reduced food intake and body weight. This suggests that steric inhibition of asprosin’s interaction with its receptor is either epitope-agnostic, or that the beneficial effects of asprosin neutralization depend on rapid asprosin disposal, or some combination of these two possibilities. Furthermore, all three mAbs showed an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) in the picomolar to low nanomolar range indicating high affinity mAb-asprosin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Landry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, circulating asprosin elicits the glucogenic and orexigenic function by activating the hepatic G-protein-coupled receptor-associated cAMP-PKA signaling, and by activating the hypothalamic AgRP+neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>). Anti-asprosin mAbs neutralize not only the circulating asprosin in different MS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Romere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duerrschmid et al., 2017</xref>), but also asprosin-mediated hepatic cAMP signaling and AgRP neuron activity, demonstrating neutralization of asprosin action by all three mAbs at the level of both its functions – orexigenic and glucogenic. However, despite the high specificity, affinity, and long half-life displayed by the mAbs, maintenance of pharmacological effects required daily administration. A short ‘effect-life’, out of proportion to mAb half-life, has previously been reported for other mAbs against various circulating antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Rajan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ovacik and Lin, 2018</xref>). This short effect-life might be explained by high asprosin–mAb complex stability under various physiological conditions, leaving newly produced asprosin uninhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ovacik and Lin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ryman and Meibohm, 2017</xref>), thereby necessitating new mAb administration for continued pharmacological effect. In other words, there is sufficient precedence for this issue when it comes to circulating antigens and overcoming this requires a variety of mAb engineering approaches, which are under consideration for anti-asprosin mAbs at this time.</p><p>Conceptually however, the studies presented here offer promise for targeting asprosin in the treatment of MS, with planned lead optimization (to improve effect-life and humanize the lead candidate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gui et al., 2019</xref>), exploratory toxicity and efficacy studies in other species such as nonhuman primates, potentially leading to human trials. In addition, although the receptor for asprosin in the liver has been discovered recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2019</xref>), the identity of its receptor in the CNS remains unknown. These receptor discovery efforts are essential for the development of orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitors of the asprosin pathway, which are validated by the ligand-targeting mAb approach presented here.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that demonstrates the potential of asprosin neutralization using multiple mAbs in vivo to treat MS. As opposed to current and past therapies that target satiety, this approach directly inhibits appetite and separately reduces the blood glucose burden by inhibiting hepatic glucose release. Thus, it is a dual-effect therapy that targets the two pillars of MS, over-nutrition and increased glucose burden. The results presented here, pre-clinically validating the pharmacological inhibition of asprosin for the treatment of MS, are a source of high optimism moving forward.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Georgina Salazar, Andrew Pieper, Richard Premont, Mukesh Jain and Jonathan Stamler for critical reading of the manuscript.

&quot;Asprosin Neutralizing Antibodies as a Treatment for Metabolic Syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Carlos Isales as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mishra et al. present data characterizing the effect of asprosin neutralizing antibodies on the parameters of metabolic syndrome (weight, glucose, lipids, etc). This group were the initial discoverers and characterized asprosin as a hormone that increases blood sugar and stimulates appetite. In their Nature Medicine 2017 article they also present data on a neutralizing antibody. In this follow up manuscript the group characterizes the impact of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies on metabolic parameters of three mouse models of obesity (DIO, NASH diet and Leptin receptor knockout). The translational focus of the manuscript is potential use of monoclonal antibodies against asprosin as a treatment of metabolic syndrome</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A concern is the recent contradictory report by von Herrath et al. Cell Metabolism 2019 in which they failed to see the Asprosin's effect on food intake and glucose levels in mice. In the present manuscript the authors briefly discuss this by saying that this contradiction is &quot;due to use of poor quality recombinant asprosin&quot;. But the contradictory paper in Cell Metabolism is from Novo Nordisk. It is important that the authors resolve this issue by providing a rigorous assessment of data reproducibility.</p><p>(1) One of the central issues is the specificity of the antibody action. The authors should demonstrate if the effect of the asprosin antibodies is blunted in mice that lack either asprosin or its receptor OR4M1.</p><p>(2) Additional characterization of the asprosin neutralizing effect of the AB is required.. It will be helpful to show the endogenous free asprosin levels at different time points after a single or repeated mAb injection. This result is also important to tell whether this mAb will cause other immune responses and side effects that might confound interpretation of the results.</p><p>(3) Previous studies from the authors' group show that asprosin acts on hepatocytes and triggers cAMP signaling. The authors should examine if the neutral antibodies blunt the cAMP signaling in DIO mice.</p><p>(4) Similarly, asprosin was shown to stimulate AgRP+ neurons. The authors need to demonstrate the effect of asprosin antibodies on AgRP+ neuronal activity.</p><p>(5) in Figure 1 the blood glucose drops independent of food intake is this all related to decreased hepatic glucose output or are there any effect on urine. Was urinary glucose measured? Is there increased glycosuria?</p><p>(6) Most of the bodyweight data are presented as &quot;body-weight change&quot;. However, the authors should present them as whole-body weight. In Figure 3 (a, e, j) and Figure 4 (a, e, I, m). please show body weight to rule out the stress or side effects cause by virus injection. For DIO mice, 14 days IgG injection also caused weight loss; for db/db mice, IgG injection increased body weight. Please discuss. In previous papers the authors discuss the increased lean body mass when asprosin is not present. There is no body composition data in this study. Was there any body composition differences with the antibody among the different mouse models (e.g DIO vs Nash diet)?</p><p>(7) Although adenovirus and AAV are widely used for in vivo protein overexpression, it is important to show here that endogenous asprosin levels were increased after virus injection and decreased after antibody neutralization.</p><p>(8) In Figure 5, more data on liver weight, histology, etc. is required to support their conclusion on liver health. The current data from three different mice models are very contradictive, this can be caused by the side effect or off-target effect of this mAb.</p><p>(9) In Figure 5 there are a number of inflammatory markers which can vary according to the model. What about anti-inflammatory markers (cortisol, IL-10 etc) would be helpful to get a better picture of physiologic changes.</p><p>(10) In Figure 6, it is important to demonstrate the neutralizing effect of the mAbs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63784.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A concern is the recent contradictory report by von Herrath et al.

All three GOF tools produce an increase in blood glucose, appetite, and body weight <italic>in vivo</italic>. All three LOF tools produce the opposite <italic>in vivo</italic>. The fact that these six independent experimental strategies produce consistent changes in blood glucose, appetite and body weight in both directions (loss- or gain-of-function) leaves little doubt as to asprosin’s function in physiology. In other words, these new results make it exceedingly difficult for asprosin’s physiological effects to be explained by potential toxicity or reagent impurity. These diverse GOF and LOF tools also emphasize the high reproducibility of asprosin biology given that the proof obtained from such varied approaches bypasses technical difficulties inherent to any specific reagent/method such as recombinant proteins. To underscore this point, to our knowledge four independent groups have by now replicated asprosin’s physiological effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and also expanded asprosin biology beyond our discoveries (modulation of muscle AMPK, identification of the liver asprosin receptor OR4M1, identification of a new asprosin-like hormone derived from FBN2, placensin)<sup>1-4</sup>. This is particularly important given the inability of one group (von Herrath et al.) to generate active recombinant asprosin<sup>5</sup>. Our own experience with the unreliability of recombinant asprosin, whether made from mammalian or bacterial cells, makes it reasonable to assume that von Herrath et al. faced the same difficulties. There is no way to discern the quality of recombinant asprosin beyond measuring its effect in animals and cells. Its structure is not known, nor whether it needs a chaperone to attain correct stability/activity. The group that discovered the liver asprosin receptor (Li et al., 2019) and replicated the glucogenic effects of asprosin<sup>1</sup>, remark on struggling with this issue – “Of note, the quality of Asprosin protein is critical for its activity. Similar to the results from von Herrath et al. (2019), we cannot purify the active His-Asprosin from inclusion bodies in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, we used GST-Asprosin in this study since GST-Asprosin is much more soluble.” Our experience is similar to this, suggesting the need for a chaperone for attainment of reliable activity. As in this study, in the past we utilized several experimental strategies such as human/mouse genetic-mediated LOF, viral transduction-mediated GOF, and monoclonal antibody-mediated LOF to corroborate recombinant asprosin-mediated results, thereby thwarting the latter approach’s unreliability. von Herrath et al. also attempted an alternative approach, reporting negative results with hydrodynamic gene delivery of asprosin<sup>5</sup>. Unfortunately, neither this data, nor pertinent experimental details, such as use of a signal peptide, or most importantly, whether this strategy resulted in increased plasma asprosin levels, were shown. It is therefore impossible to ascertain the validity of this result. In summary, the problem with the von Herrath study is likely that the authors failed to view recombinant asprosin-derived negative results skeptically given the inherent unreliability of that approach. Overall, the results presented here combined with the successful replication efforts by several independent groups render moot any remaining concerns about the physiological relevance of asprosin.</p><p>Given the importance of this issue for the field, we have included it in the Discussion section of the manuscript (line 253-291).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) One of the central issues is the specificity of the antibody action. The authors should demonstrate if the effect of the asprosin antibodies is blunted in mice that lack either asprosin or its receptor OR4M1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute suggestion. We now present data of anti-asprosin mAb treatment of <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup> </italic>mice which serve as a genetic model of asprosin deficiency. <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup></italic> mice were totally unresponsive to the mAb treatment, with no effect at all on blood glucose, 24h cumulative food intake and body weight (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). This demonstrates the inability of asprosin-neutralization to produce a physiological effect in mice lacking circulating asprosin, in contrast to the marked effects seen in mouse models with elevated circulating asprosin. This clearly shows that the glucose-, appetite-, and weight-reducing effects of anti-asprosin mAbs occur due to neutralization of asprosin rather than due to potential non-specificity or toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Additional characterization of the asprosin neutralizing effect of the AB is required.. It will be helpful to show the endogenous free asprosin levels at different time points after a single or repeated mAb injection. This result is also important to tell whether this mAb will cause other immune responses and side effects that might confound interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that with increasing concentrations of the mouse anti-asprosin mAb used in this study, there is a decline in the concentration of free asprosin (please see Suppl. Figure 8C, Duerrschmid C et al., 2017)<sup>6</sup>. We present new data showing dose-dependent decrease in free asprosin using the other two mAbs – rabbit and fully human (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Additionally, we have previously shown reduction in endogenous free circulating asprosin at multiple time points after exposure to the mouse anti-asprosin mAb used in this study, in DIO and <italic>Ob/Ob</italic> mice (please see figure 7c,g, Romere et al., 2016)<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>To further characterize the mechanism of action of the anti-asprosin mAbs at the level of the orexigenic and glucogenic functions of asprosin, we now show the potent neutralizing effect of all three anti-asprosin mAbs on asprosin-mediated AgRP neuronal activity and hepatic cAMP content (Figure 7, please also see response to comment #3 and 5). These results demonstrate that asprosin neutralization specifically inhibits the asprosin pathway at the level of both asprosin functions.</p><p>Furthermore, to ensure that weight loss, reduced hunger and glucose normalizing effects are the result of asprosin neutralization, and not potential toxicity or off-target effects, we measured different markers of sickness – proinflammatory cytokines (IL1β/TNFα), anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGFβ and IL10), markers of hepatic health (plasma ALT and AST levels), markers of renal health (Creatinine and BUN), and two measures of general activity: pedestrian locomotor activity and intentional wheel running activity. We did not observe any indication of potential toxicity/sickness using this multi-layered approach. Please see Figure 1—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Previous studies from the authors' group show that asprosin acts on hepatocytes and triggers cAMP signaling. The authors should examine if the neutral antibodies blunt the cAMP signaling in DIO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present new data showing effects of asprosin neutralization, using all three mAbs on hepatic cAMP levels (Figure 7). All three mAbs significantly reduce hepatic cAMP content <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting successful neutralization of endogenous hepatic asprosin signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Similarly, asprosin was shown to stimulate AgRP+ neurons. The authors need to demonstrate the effect of asprosin antibodies on AgRP+ neuronal activity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important suggestion. While the neutralizing effect of the mouse mAb on AgRP neuron activity has previously been shown by us (please see Supplementary Figure 9, Duerrschmid C et al., 2017)<sup>6</sup>, we now present new data showing the neutralizing effect of the other two mAbs (rabbit and fully human) on AgRP neuronal activity (Figure 7). All three mAbs completely neutralize the ability of asprosin to activate AgRP neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) in Figure 1 the blood glucose drops independent of food intake is this all related to decreased hepatic glucose output or are there any effect on urine. Was urinary glucose measured? Is there increased glycosuria?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, particularly given the anti-diabetic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in the clinic. We measured but did not find any effect of asprosin neutralization on glucosuria in DIO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), specifically at timepoints that coincide with reductions in blood glucose. Thus, we have ruled out enhancement in glucosuria as a potential mechanism for the anti-diabetic effects of asprosin neutralization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Most of the bodyweight data are presented as &quot;body-weight change&quot;. However, the authors should present them as whole-body weight. In Figure 3 (a, e, j) and Figure 4 (a, e, I, m). please show body weight to rule out the stress or side effects cause by virus injection. For DIO mice, 14 days IgG injection also caused weight loss; for db/db mice, IgG injection increased body weight. Please discuss. In previous papers the authors discuss the increased lean body mass when asprosin is not present. There is no body composition data in this study. Was there any body composition differences with the antibody among the different mouse models (e.g DIO vs Nash diet)?</p></disp-quote><p>Body weight change measurement equalizes the average weight of the two groups (IgG versus anti-asprosin mAb) prior to treatment, enabling a clear graphical depiction of the change elicited by the two agents from the same starting point. However, in response to this suggestion, we now present whole-body weight in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, figure 4—figure supplement 1 and 2for all experiments of figures 3 and 4. The body weight trajectories in response to the mAbs show no sudden drops or other changes that would suggest stress or toxicity.</p><p>For DIO and AMLN-diet treated mice, where 14 days of anti-asprosin mAb treatment caused weight loss, the body weight had already reached a plateau prior to treatment. In contrast, for 12-week-old <italic>Db/Db</italic> mice, where 14 days of anti-asprosin mAb treatment prevented weight gain, mice were still gaining weight prior to treatment. In the latter experiment, it is not the IgG that is making the mice gain weight but rather their own intrinsic biology at 12 weeks of age. Asprosin neutralization simply prevents that weight gain. To clarify this point, we have repeated the <italic>Db/Db</italic> experiment, this time with 30-week-old mice where their body weight had plateaued prior to treatment (figure 4—figure supplement 3). In this setting, asprosin neutralization results in weight loss, much like the DIO experiment. The only experiment where IgG showed a minor effect on body weight is in 30-week-old DIO mice (Figure 4e) where IgG injected mice lost some weight at the beginning of the experiment. We attribute this to handling-related transient stress imposed on the mice as the body weight returned to normal midway through the experiment. However, we have repeated the DIO experiment in 16-week-old mice (on HFD for 12 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age), and again found a significant weight reduction produced by the anti-asprosin mAb, and no impact of IgG on body weight (figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Further, we present MRI body composition analysis of body weight, lean mass, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal fat mass in DIO mice before and after 14 days of asprosin neutralization (Figure 5). <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup></italic> mice have asprosin deficiency in addition to Marfan syndrome (from mutant fibrillin-1), leading to a reduction in lean mass (a Marfan syndrome effect) in addition to a reduction in adipose mass<sup>6</sup>. In contrast, anti-asprosin mAb treatment in DIO mice results in a marked reduction in adipose mass without affecting lean mass at all. That is because asprosin neutralization does not affect fibrillin-1 while inhibiting circulating asprosin. That is a key difference between <italic>Fbn1<sup>NPS/+</sup></italic> mice (which show effects of both asprosin and fibrillin-1 inhibition) and mice treated with anti-asprosin mAbs (which show effects of just asprosin inhibition).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Although adenovirus and AAV are widely used for in vivo protein overexpression, it is important to show here that endogenous asprosin levels were increased after virus injection and decreased after antibody neutralization.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 4—figure supplement 1e,1j,1o we show that <italic>in vivo</italic> circulating asprosin levels were significantly increased in mice transduced with asprosin expressing adeno- and adeno-associated viruses, each equipped with an IL2 signal peptide to promote secretion. Please see our response to comment#2 where we have described reductions in free circulating asprosin upon anti-asprosin mAb treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In Figure 5, more data on liver weight, histology, etc. is required to support their conclusion on liver health. The current data from three different mice models are very contradictive, this can be caused by the side effect or off-target effect of this mAb.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with reviewer’s points #9 and 10, in that assessment of mRNA expression and liver triglycerides alone is insufficient to convincingly claim effects of asprosin neutralization on liver health and NASH. A thorough analysis of liver mass normalized to body mass, NAFLD activity scoring (NAS) based on hepatocyte steatosis, inflammation and ballooning, corresponding H&amp;E and Masson’s trichrome stained liver sections for fibrosis, inflammation at mRNA and protein levels, leukocyte infiltration, and gross hepatic steatosis is warranted to conclude any effects of mAb treatment on liver health. Further, it needs to be ascertained whether chronic mAb treatment can prevent or potentially reverse NASH. If any effects are seen, the timeline, trajectory, and persistence of such effects needs to be ascertained. Additionally, a single model of NASH would appear to be insufficient to arrive at a convincing assessment of the efficacy of asprosin neutralization. We would need at least two models, preferably one genetic and one environmental.</p><p>At present, the above seems outside the scope of this study on metabolic syndrome. We expect that ascertaining the effects of asprosin neutralization on liver health and NASH will require at least as much data as we have presented here on metabolic syndrome in order to make a convincing case, suggesting an independent study. To this effect, we have decided to focus exclusively on metabolic syndrome in this report and build the evidence for NASH in a separate study based on the feedback received here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In Figure 5 there are a number of inflammatory markers which can vary according to the model. What about anti-inflammatory markers (cortisol, IL-10 etc) would be helpful to get a better picture of physiologic changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above response to comment#8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In Figure 6, it is important to demonstrate the neutralizing effect of the mAbs.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response #4 and 5. We present new data showing the effects of asprosin neutralization, using all three mAbs, on hepatic cAMP levels (Figure 7). All three mAbs significantly reduce hepatic cAMP content <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting successful neutralization of endogenous hepatic asprosin signaling<sup>1,7</sup>. While the neutralizing effect of the mouse mAb on AgRP neuron activity has previously been shown by us (please see Supplementary Figure 9, Duerrschmid C et al., 2017)<sup>6</sup>, we now present new data showing the neutralizing effect of the other two mAbs (rabbit and fully human) on AgRP neuronal activity (Figure 7). All three mAbs completely neutralize the ability of asprosin to activate AgRP neurons. These results demonstrate that asprosin neutralization specifically inhibits the asprosin pathway at the level of both asprosin functions (glucogenic and orexigenic).</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
