biological outcomes, conferring resistance to some drug substrates and enhancing susceptibility to others. While transporters have traditionally been classified as antiporters, symporters, or uniporters, there is growing recognition that some transporters may exhibit mixed modalities. This raises new questions about their regulation and mechanism. Here, we show that the C-terminal tail of EmrE acts as a secondary gate, preventing proton leak in the absence of drug. Substrate binding unlocks this gate, allowing transport to proceed. Truncation of the C-terminal tail (∆107-EmrE) leads to altered pH regulation of alternating access, an important kinetic step in the transport cycle, as measured by NMR. ∆107-EmrE has increased proton leak in proteoliposomes, and bacteria expressing this mutant have reduced growth. Molecular dynamics simulations of ∆107-EmrE show the formation of a water wire from the open face of the transporter to the primary binding site in the core, facilitating proton leak. In WT-EmrE, the C-terminal tail forms specific interactions that block the formation of the water wire. Together, these data strongly support the C-terminus of EmrE acting as a secondary gate that regulates access to the primary binding site.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd><kwd>proton leak</kwd><kwd>small multi-drug resistance transporter</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM053148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voth</surname><given-names>Gregory A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM141748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henzler-Wildman</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24GM141526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henzler-Wildman</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brousseau</surname><given-names>Merissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The C-terminal tail acts as a secondary gate to regulate substrate access into the primary binding site for transport across the membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotic resistance may be mediated by several mechanisms, including active export of drugs by promiscuous multi-drug efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munita and Arias, 2001</xref>). Among these transporters, the small multi-drug resistance (SMR) family has been found throughout the bacterial kingdom and exhibits particularly promiscuous substrate profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Skurray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pérez-Varela et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldiner, 2009</xref>). The most well-studied SMR transporter is the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein EmrE, which confers resistance to a broad array of toxic polyaromatic cations and quaternary ammonium compounds through secondary active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yerushalmi and Schuldiner, 2000a</xref>). These transporters couple the energetically favorable import of protons down the proton motive force to drive active export of antibiotics and antiseptics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forrest et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boudker and Verdon, 2010</xref>). As the archetype for the family of the smallest ion-coupled transporters, EmrE has become a model system for studying the molecular mechanism of proton-coupled transport and multi-drug efflux.</p><p>EmrE transport is electrogenic for tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>) and electroneutral for methyl viologen (MV<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rotem and Schuldiner, 2004</xref>), consistent with a 2H<sup>+</sup>:1 drug antiport stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yerushalmi and Schuldiner, 2000a</xref>). Early mechanistic models focused on the minimal set of states and transitions necessary for such stoichiometric antiport. More recently, NMR studies of EmrE protonation and alternating access showed that many more states and transitions have populations and rates that are not insignificant at near-physiological pH and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). Inclusion of these states and transitions in the mechanistic model provides pathways that allow for alternative transport activity, including symport, drug uniport, and proton uniport (leak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this model, different environmental conditions (pH) or small molecule substrates that shift the relative rates of different microscopic steps can alter the dominant transport behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hussey et al., 2020</xref>). This has been confirmed experimentally: a small molecule substrate, harmane, triggers uncontrolled proton leak through EmrE to an extent that is detrimental to <italic>E. coli</italic> growth and NADH production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spreacker et al., 2022</xref>). However, the question of how this transporter avoids catastrophic leaks remains unanswered.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model of coupled antiport and uncoupled proton leak through EmrE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All of the drug- and proton-bound states that are reasonably populated at near-physiological temperature and pH and the transitions between these states observed by NMR lead to a model for EmrE transport that allows for both coupled antiport (orange) and proton leak (red solid line). (<bold>B</bold>) In WT-EmrE, the C-terminal tail on the open face acts as a secondary gate (top), minimizing proton leak in the absence of substrate. Truncation of EmrE in ∆107-EmrE removes this gate (bottom). The drug binding to a secondary binding site near the tail opens the gate (top,right), allowing proton exit from the primary binding site near E14, and drug to progress to the primary binding site at E14. This leads to either coupled antiport (A, orange) as shown. If the substrate does not rapidly move into the primary binding site, only proton entry/exit occurs upon opening of the secondary gate, resulting in drug-gated proton leak (A, red dashed line). Truncation of the C-terminal tail in ∆107-EmrE (B,bottom) allows uncoupled proton leak in the absence of substrate (A, red solid line).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105525-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Direct measurements of proton release upon drug binding showed that drug-induced deprotonation occurs at the C-terminal histidine (H110) in addition to the essential glutamate-14 residues that define the primary binding site for drug and proton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the C-terminus on one protomer in the homodimer is highly sensitive to the identity of the drug bound in the primary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison and Henzler-Wildman, 2014</xref>). Early solid-state <sup>31</sup>P NMR experiments suggested a second, lower affinity TPP<sup>+</sup>-binding site near the acidic loop residues E25 and D84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glaubitz et al., 2000</xref>), which are likely to be in close spatial proximity to the C-terminal tail in this small transporter. Together, these data led us to propose a secondary gating model where the C-terminal tail prevents proton release until drug binding at a peripheral site on the transporter surface displaces the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the available EmrE structures provide high-resolution data on the conformation of the C-terminal tail and adjacent loop regions. Early cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures revealed the unique asymmetric arrangement of the transmembrane helices and antiparallel topology of the EmrE homodimer, but had very low resolution and limited density in the loops and tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleishman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Recent, higher-resolution crystal structures and NMR structures have provided more precision on substrate binding within the transport pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kermani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shcherbakov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shcherbakov et al., 2021</xref>). However, the crystal structures used a monobody that required mutation of three residues in the TM1–TM2 loop (E25N, W31I, and V34M), including E25, and there is limited or missing density for other loops on the open face of the transporter and the C-terminal tail after residue 104. In the NMR structures, distance restraints are primarily substrate–protein distances within the transmembrane helices lining the primary binding site, and only chemical-shift-derived backbone torsion angles restrain the loops and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shcherbakov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shcherbakov et al., 2021</xref>). The most recent NMR structures used a loop mutant, L51I, that disrupts the gating mechanism, locking the transporter open, and again had limited restraints in the loops and C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, there is limited structural data for the C-terminal tail and loops, although these regions are functionally important in gating access to the central binding site defined by residue E14. In such cases, molecular dynamics (MD) has proven to be an excellent tool, and the only atomic resolution model of the C-terminal tail is from MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vermaas et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use NMR, in vitro and in vivo biochemical assays, and MD simulations to characterize a C-terminal deletion mutant of EmrE truncated after residue 106, denoted Δ107-EmrE, to directly determine the regulatory role of the C-terminal tail. Comparisons of growth and resistance phenotypes, alternating access rates, and transport activities of Δ107- and WT-EmrE confirm the importance of the C-terminal tail in regulating tightly coupled antiport and minimizing proton leak. Simulations on these two systems also suggest differences in water structure and hydrogen bonding patterns when the C-terminus is truncated. Examination of interactions with the newly discovered substrate harmane, which triggers uncoupled proton leak as the dominant transport mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spreacker et al., 2022</xref>), suggests interactions between the tail and a secondary site on the protein may allow for allosteric regulation of gating, reconciling the free exchange model with minimal leak by the WT transporter in the absence of small molecule substrates. Further, MD simulations provided a possible secondary site and the structural basis for this regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EmrE is properly folded and functional when the C-terminal tail is truncated</title><p>We first assessed whether C-terminal tail truncation affected the ability of EmrE to confer resistance to toxic substrates, the well-established primary function of this transporter.

In these assays, uninduced leaky expression from a low copy number plasmid (p15 origin) with a pTrc promoter keeps transporter expression relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spreacker et al., 2022</xref>). In the presence of ethidium bromide, a substrate commonly used to assess the activity of EmrE and other multi-drug efflux pumps, a functional transporter is required for survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This confirms the known resistance activity of WT-EmrE, that E14Q-EmrE is non-functional, and that Δ107-EmrE is properly expressed to the inner membrane, folded and functionally able to confer resistance to toxic compounds in a manner comparable to the WT transporter.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>C-terminal tail truncation does not impair the ability of EmrE to confer resistance to toxic compounds.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) WT-, E14Q-, or ∆107-EmrE was heterologously expressed in MG1655-∆<italic>emre E. coli</italic> using a plasmid with p15 origin and pTrc promoter without induction to minimize any growth defect due to expression.

This defect becomes apparent around 5 hr, the point at which available fermentable sugars in LB media are depleted, increasing dependence on the proton motive force for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baev et al., 2006</xref>). A similar time-dependent growth inhibition is observed for WT-EmrE in the presence of harmane, and we have previously shown that this substrate triggers uncoupled proton leak through EmrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spreacker et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, while ∆107-EmrE competently performs the proton-coupled drug antiport necessary to confer resistance to toxic substrates, it is detrimental to <italic>E. coli</italic> in the absence of known small molecule substrate in a manner suggestive of proton leak.</p><p>To directly test this hypothesis, we measured proton leak in proteoliposomes. The pH-sensitive dye pyranine was encapsulated inside proteoliposomes at pH 6.5, and the liposomes were then diluted 100-fold into pH 7.5 buffer. If protons leak out of the liposome (down the proton concentration gradient), the internal pH will rise and pyranine fluorescence will increase. We compared the fluorescence, normalized to time zero, of proteoliposomes with WT, ∆107, or E14Q-EmrE. WT-EmrE proteoliposomes show a gradual increase in internal pH over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, solid black), which is faster than the pH change for E14Q-EmrE proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, solid gray). This is consistent with a small amount of proton leak through WT-EmrE and a role for E14 in mediating leak. ∆107-EmrE proteoliposomes show a much faster rise in internal pH in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, solid red). Repeating the experiment with the protonophore CCCP in the external buffer results in rapid proton leak for all proteoliposome samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, dotted lines), and the results match the timescale and amplitude of proton leak observed for the ∆107-EmrE proteoliposomes. Thus, C-terminal tail truncation causes rapid proton leak through EmrE.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>C-terminal tail truncation enhances proton leak.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Pyranine fluorescence directly reports on proton leak through EmrE.

As such, comparing the peak currents for more than one LPR for a given set of gradient conditions allows us to ensure the signal is dominated by steady state transport rather than pre-steady state electrogenic partial reactions, such as substrate binding or proton release from the transporter. (<bold>A</bold>) The peak currents for WT-EmrE with different LPR do not match, and the peak current for ∆107-EmrE with different LPR do not match, indicating contributions from a pre-steady state process (left). Instead, the LPR 400 data for WT- and ∆107-EmrE peak currents match, and the LPR800 data for WT- and ∆107-EmrE match, suggesting that release of protons from the transporter from E14 when the external buffer is switched dominates the peak current in this pH range. No substrate is present and H110 is only present in one construct, so substrate binding or proton release from H110 are unlikely to contribute significantly to this signal. However, the slower kinetics of the off-rates for these currents are not consistent with a strictly pre-steady state process, indicating transport of protons, or leak, is also occurring for both constructs consistent with the initial jump in fluorescence followed by a slower leak over time that was seen in the pyranine assay. The similarity of the integrated currents (transported charge over time, right) for the different LPRs of each construct and the consistently higher signal in ∆107-EmrE across LPRs further signifies the predominance of uncoupled proton leak upon deletion of the C-terminal tail. If pre-steady state signals were dominant, we would expect WT-EmrE to have a higher signal due to the contribution of an additional titratable residue (H110). (<bold>B</bold>) With the same magnitude gradient at high pH, the transporters will be mostly de-protonated, such that we do not see peak currents that are dependent on the density of protein as in A. Instead, the peak currents and off-rates are dependent on the presence or absence of the tail (left), and the transported charge over time is the same for both LPRs of each construct (right). (<bold>C</bold>) In the absence of a pH gradient, addition of an infinite drug gradient to the outside of the liposomes containing de-protonated transporters reveals how coupled transport impacts the observed current. The infinite inward-directed drug gradient causes rapid coupled antiport of two protons out of the liposome for every one MeTPP<sup>+</sup> molecule transported in (initial negative peak current). This creates both a negative inside potential that inhibits further transport and increases the external proton concentration. The resulting inward-directed proton gradient and negative-inside potential drive back transport of protons into the liposome (slower phase, positive current). This positive current is greater for Δ107-EmrE than for WT-EmrE, with the net transported charge returning to near baseline for Δ107-EmrE. There is only limited proton backflow through WT-EmrE, which maintains tighter coupling due to the C-terminal tail. Each curve is an average of at least three technical replicates of individually prepared sensors, and error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105525-fig3-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Initiation of the assay by dilution complicates measurement of the fluorescence baseline, obscuring rapid changes in the few seconds between dilution and initial fluorescence read. We repeated the assay with side-by-side dilution of proteoliposomes (internal pH 6.5) into pH 6.5 buffer (baseline), or pH 7.5 buffer (transport). This baseline normalization reveals a rapid internal pH change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The empty liposome control is flat, showing that the liposomes do not leak without EmrE. However, the signal is non-zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, black arrow), likely due to residual exterior pyranine. The time 0 fluorescence of WT-, E14Q-, and ∆107-EmrE proteoliposomes is much higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue arrow), indicating an additional rapid change in the internal pH in the presence of protein. While the encapsulated pyranine is protected from the direct impact of external pH change, proton transport (leak) through EmrE will change internal pH. The transmembrane pH gradient may also affect EmrE itself, altering the pKa of key residues (E14, H110) and causing rapid release of protons inside the liposome, or cause a rapid burst phase of leak as the transporter transitions from a symmetric-pH conformation to an asymmetric-pH conformation.</p><p>To further assess the initial rapid pH change, we used solid supported membrane electrophysiology (SSME) to measure ∆pH-driven current in proteoliposomes since this technique provides a continuous readout as a gradient is applied. Many proteoliposomes can be adsorbed onto the gold-coated sensor, enabling highly sensitive detection of electrogenic transport. The same lipid to protein ratio was used as in the pyranine assay, and reported values are an average of three independently prepared sensors per mutant to account for variability in liposome adsorption onto sensors. The liposomes are first equilibrated with external buffer identical to the interior, and then a different external buffer is rapidly washed over the liposomes to create a transmembrane pH gradient while recording is in progress. The capacitive current is measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, left A, B</xref>) and integrated to yield the total transported charge in response to the applied gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, right</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In the absence of drug, empty liposomes have minimal charge movement as expected for minimal proton leak. However, both WT- and Δ107-EmrE have measurable current in the presence of a pH gradient, and ∆107-EmrE has consistently higher leak under all pH conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The consistency of the SSME and pyranine assay results establishes the validity of the assay for comparing WT- and ∆107-EmrE proton leak and the ability to perform multiple assays with the same proteoliposome sensors to compare flux at different absolute pH or gradient magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><p>Both WT- and ∆107-EmrE also show increased net charge movement at higher absolute pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In symmetric pH environments, the only amino acid side chains with pKa values near neutral pH are E14 (pKa 6.8 ± 0.1 and 8.5 ± 0.2 at 25°C) and H110 (6.98 ± 0.01, 7.05 ± 0.02) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>). ∆107-EmrE is lacking Histidine (H110), so any proton binding/release from H110 that contributes to the capacitive current will be absent in ∆107-EmrE, but the net charge transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, right</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>) is greater for ∆107-EmrE than for WT-EmrE. This rules out a simple model where proton binding/release from H110 accounts for the fast proton flux. Any conformational change involving the C-terminal tail that contributes to the capacitive current should also decrease as average pH increases and H110 protonation and net charge decrease. However, the opposite pH dependence is observed for WT-EmrE, indicating that this is unlikely to be a major contributor to the SSME current. Furthermore, any rapid release of protons from E14 upon gradient formation will be decreased at high pH as the initial protonation state, and thus the number of protons that can be released, is reduced. Thus, the increased charge movement at higher absolute pH must be due to increased proton leak since there is no other substrate present in these experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the transient current and net transported charge at low pH, high pH, and under conditions where a drug gradient drives transport. These assays show multiphasic behavior, and close examination of the data with different lipid to protein ratios under each experimental condition further distinguishes pre-steady state (proton release, conformational change) and steady state (transport) processes that contribute to net charge movement. A model where movement of the C-terminal tail regulates access to E14 and C-terminal truncation alters this gating process would be consistent with the observed currents and their pH dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>), as well as the longer-timescale change in intraliposome pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We note that the 1-s SSME traces do not reach equilibrium as the current is not zero and net transported charge is still changing at the end of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1, right</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>), but do provide insight into the dead time of the pyranine assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and match the relative magnitude of the observed burst phase. Altogether, this data supports a role for the C-terminal tail as a secondary gate that minimizes proton leak through WT-EmrE in the absence of substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The pH-dependent rate of alternating access in ∆107-EmrE is distinct from WT-EmrE</title><p>We next used solution NMR to assess the impact of C-terminal tail truncation on the structure and dynamics of EmrE, since this will impact gating and transport. Due to the asymmetric structure of EmrE, the two subunits have unique chemical shifts. As EmrE undergoes alternating access, the two subunits swap conformations, resulting in exchange between AB and BA dimer topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>). The rate of the alternating access exchange process affects the NMR line shape, resulting in distinct sets of peaks for each subunit when exchange is slow, line broadening as the rate increases, and eventually coalescence into a single set of peaks at the average chemical shift when exchange is fast. Thus, the appearance of simple 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra can provide significant insight into both the structure and dynamics of the transporter under different conditions.</p><p>In the absence of drug, Δ107-EmrE is in fast-intermediate exchange at both pH values, with only one set of peaks and significant line broadening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the spectra are distinct, with slightly more line broadening at high pH. This indicates that protonation of E14 still affects the overall structure of ∆107-EmrE, and alternating access is slightly slower at high pH. WT-EmrE has similar fast exchange behavior at low pH, but increasing pH results in a significantly slower rate of alternating access (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The pH dependence of alternating access in ∆107-EmrE is distinct from WT-EmrE.</title><p>TROSY-HSQC spectra of ∆107-EmrE in the absence (<bold>A</bold>) and presence (<bold>B</bold>) of the tight-binding ligand tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP<sup>+</sup>).

The similarity of this spectrum of ∆107-EmrE bound to TPP<sup>+</sup> at low pH with the spectrum of WT-EmrE under the same conditions (low pH, TPP<sup>+</sup> bound) also provides additional evidence that the general structure of Δ107-EmrE remains intact and the binding site has undergone minimal perturbation upon truncation of the last four amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>At high pH, TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound ∆107-EmrE shows significant line broadening and partial coalescence of the two distinct sets of peaks in the NMR spectrum, indicating that the rate of alternating access is faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue).

By comparing the intensity of these cross-peaks relative to the auto-peaks as a function of the delay time, we can determine the rate of alternating access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miloushev and Palmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The alternating access rate for TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound Δ107-EmrE is 4 ± 1 s<sup>–1</sup> at low pH, and 17 ± 3 s<sup>–1</sup> at high pH. There is greater scatter in the peak intensity ratio at high pH due to enhanced exchange with water for residues on the open face of the transporter, which reduces the peak intensity. However, there is no overlap between low pH and high pH, clearly demonstrating a significant change in alternating access rate for ∆107-EmrE with pH. TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound WT EmrE has the same rate of alternating access as ∆107-EmrE at low pH, but does not vary significantly with pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison and Henzler-Wildman, 2014</xref>).

The I68<sup>B</sup>–I71<sup>B</sup> distance does not differ significantly.

For comparison, the diameter of a water molecule is measured to be around 2.7 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schatzberg, 1967</xref>). This means a triangle larger than 5.4 Å in size is required for a water molecule to fit inside. Additionally, the most hydrated snapshot in WT-EmrE showed A61<sup>A</sup> takes a conformation more similar to ∆107-EmrE and very different from dry WT-EmrE.

It can provide additional information beyond structural snapshots of a reaction, which are only incomplete samples of the ensemble. For example, the existence of a water chain does not necessarily mean good proton conductance, but by contrast, the PMF for explicit proton transport (including Grotthuss proton shuttling) can provide key thermodynamic and kinetic information about the transport process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Voth, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilan et al., 2004</xref>). However, free energy sampling involving proton transport is also intrinsically complicated. First, proton transport involves chemical bond breaking and formation, which is beyond the capability of classical MD, so expensive quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics may be required. Second, when an excess proton is solvated in the water, the net positive excess charge defect arising from the presence of the excess proton can be delocalized in the water network. It is not possible to define which proton is exactly the ‘excess proton’ as Grotthuss shuttling dynamically rearranges these definitions. To address these issues, we have developed a method called Multiscale Reactive MD (MS-RMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaiser et al., 2024</xref>). It can model bond forming and breaking involving excess proton shuttling at a computational cost near classical MD. In this approach, one can also conveniently define a ‘center of excess charge’ (CEC) to describe the location of the excess positive charge defect.</p><p>We carried out umbrella sampling with MS-RMD that describes the proton transport from E14<sup>B</sup> to the bulk water in WT-EmrE. The CV ‘<italic>x</italic>’ is defined similarly as in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Voth, 2021b</xref>) as the distance between the glutamate oxygen to the CEC, mapped along a vector that aligns with the proton transport direction (see Methods). The resulting PMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicates a deep well near <italic>x</italic> = 0 Å, where the proton is on the glutamate, and a transition state near <italic>x</italic> = 10.0 Å.

The validity of this PMF calculation can be further supported by the pKa calculation from this PMF. The resulting pKa for this E14 is 7.1, close to the experimental value of 6.8 ± 0.1 at 25°C (or 7.0 ± 0.1 at 45°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>).

Since H110 was removed by truncation in ∆107-EmrE, we expected only one protonation event in NMR pH titrations of TPP<sup>+</sup>-bound ∆107-EmrE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), corresponding to the one E14 residue that remains titratable when substrate is bound. A single protonation event would normally result in linear change in peak position from the chemical shift of the protonated state to the chemical shift of the deprotonated state over the course of the titration. This is because proton on-/off- is almost always in the fast-exchange limit for NMR, resulting in the observation of a single peak at the population-weighted average chemical shift at each titration point.

Residues E25 and D84 are located in these loops and have previously been suggested to be part of a secondary binding site for substrates like TPP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glaubitz et al., 2000</xref>). There is no evidence that these residues titrate in this pH range in WT-EmrE or in other mutants for which we have carried out NMR pH titrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), making it unlikely that E25 or D84 titrate in this pH range in the full-length transporter. However, truncation of the C-terminus in ∆107-EmrE could alter the structure, environment, and pKa of these residues. Indeed, the hydrogen bond between R106 and D84 observed in the WT-EmrE simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref>) is broken when the tail is truncated in ∆107-EmrE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and D84 and R106 have some of the largest pH-dependent chemical shift changes.

Examining the residues that sense this lower pKa shows that the TM3–TM4 and TM1–TM2 loops on the open face have larger chemical shift changes associated with the low pKa protonation event than those loops on the closed face of EmrE, while the C-terminal tail residues in both subunits detect the lower pKa. Comparison with the MD simulations shows that the residues involved in the hydrogen bond networks anchoring the C-terminal tail over the pore align well with the full list of residues that are sensitive to the lower pKa in the NMR titrations, including T56<sub>A</sub> (TM2–TM3 loop on the ‘open’ face), V15–G17, I37, Y40, V69, and S72–L73. Thus, although this lower pKa is likely an artifact of tail truncation, this data experimentally supports the importance of the interactions between the tail and the rest of EmrE identified in the MD simulations as important for disrupting the water wire and occluding the E14-binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Proton leak through Δ107-EmrE does not synergize with harmane</title><p>The well-established function of EmrE is proton-coupled antiport of toxic substrates, leading to toxin efflux and drug resistance.

We suspected the enhanced proton leak observed through Δ107-EmrE and this harmane-triggered proton leak might have common elements in their underlying mechanism. Using SSME, we first compared the inherent proton leak through WT- and Δ107-EmrE in the absence of substrate. For the same ∆pH driving force, Δ107-EmrE has ≈3-fold greater proton leak than WT-EmrE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, D</xref>). However, upon addition of 16 μM harmane, there is a large increase in proton leak through WT-EmrE and a small increase in leak through ∆107-EmrE, such that this substrate triggers identical total leak through either transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>).

This model can explain the observed coupling of the C-terminal tail with both drug-binding and protonation events at the primary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>) and the correspondence of proton off-rate and substrate on-rate in prior stopped-flow studies of EmrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2007</xref>).

Truncation of the C-terminal tail in ∆107-EmrE also removes key residues that are part of a secondary substrate-binding site, reduces the sensitivity to harmane-triggered proton leak in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Although drug binding and transport do not report on hydrophobic gating as directly, A61C has impaired resistance to acriflavine and methyl viologen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mordoch et al., 1999</xref>), while A61L has impaired growth on ethidium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). I68W, I68C, and I71W impair growth on ethidium; I68A and I71G impair resistance to methyl viologen; and I61C, I68W, I68C, I71W, and I71C have impaired TPP<sup>+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lloris-Garcerá et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, K22C, T56C, and D84C reduce TPP<sup>+</sup> binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amadi et al., 2010</xref>; K22C reduces ethidium resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amadi et al., 2010</xref>; and D84C shows reduced resistance to ethidium and methyl viologen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yerushalmi and Schuldiner, 2000b</xref>). In methyl viologen uptake assays, substitution of like charge at E25D and R82K resulted in transport comparable to WT, while K22R, D84E, and R106K had impaired uptake indicating a more specific requirement for these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yerushalmi and Schuldiner, 2000b</xref>). Chemical shift perturbations upon harmane binding also highlight D84 and R106 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spreacker et al., 2022</xref>). The secondary gating model and MD simulations presented here provide a rationale for the functional significance of these residues observed in the prior work.</p><p>Active transport requires that a transporter is only ever open to one side of the membrane. This is generally thought to require the formation of an occluded state where the substrate-binding site is closed off from both sides of the membrane as the transporter transitions from the conformation open to one side of the membrane to the conformation open to the other side in order to avoid even transient formation of a channel. Often a single gate is thought to control access to the transport pore, but sometimes multiple gates regulate a more complex transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diallinas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rudnick, 2011</xref>). This is clearly seen in elevator mechanism transporters such as Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. A mobile core domain contains the substrate-binding site and moves up and down relative to the more rigid scaffold domain, effectively transitioning between inward- and outward-occluded conformations. From either of these endpoint occluded states, a small hairpin domain can open to expose the binding pocket for substrate entry or exit. This hairpin gate must close to allow the sliding elevator movement and subsequent gate opening on the other side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Studies of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> have highlighted the evolutionary benefit of a kinetically controlled transport mechanism and the role of allosteric regulation in opening and closing the gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riederer and Valiyaveetil, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh and Boudker, 2018</xref>). UapA, the xanthine-uric acid/H<sup>+</sup> symporter from the Nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) family, operates through a similar elevator mechanism, and residues outside of the primary binding site have also been shown to regulate substrate affinity, specificity, and transport dynamics, supporting a role for allosteric regulation of the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vlanti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koukaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papageorgiou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diallinas, 2013</xref>). In the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) sugar transporters, multiple occluded state structures have been identified, suggesting that multiple gates may regulate the function of these transporters as well and may explain the ability of some transporters in this family to switch between proton-coupled sugar symport and uncoupled proton uniport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madej et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that even very small transporters, such as EmrE, can have complex mechanisms of gating and transport regulation. Within the SMR family, the QAC transporters, including EmrE, are promiscuous transporters with ≈110 amino acids and a highly conserved C-terminal histidine, while the Gdx transporters are selective for guanidinium and are missing the C-terminal tail with a total length of ≈105 amino acids and no C-terminal histidine. Thus, the tail-coupling mechanism may be important for maintaining proton-coupled antiport while transporting a broader array of substrates, but this hypothesis requires further investigation. However, the existence of a secondary gate in EmrE is broadly relevant as phylogenetic analysis has suggested that SMRs may have been the progenitors of the MFS, Bacterial/Archaeal transporters, and drug-metabolite transporter superfamilies as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bay and Turner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jack et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EmrE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Z11877</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21 Gold(DE3)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Agilent Technologies</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">230312</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MG1655-∆<italic>emre</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Creative Biogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Deletion of emre from K12 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pWB-EmrE (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> J.

For comparison of different mutants, sensors were prepared side-by-side for all variants (including all replicates) on the same day using a single batch of sensors to ensure maximum similarity in proteoliposome loading onto the sensor. While results obtained with different batches of sensors prepared on different days show similar results in terms of relative leak between variants, the absolute value varies from batch to batch and day to day. Thus, while ∆107-EmrE was always leakier than WT-EmrE, the absolute flux through the WT- or ∆107-transporter varied between batches of sensors prepared.

The protein was solvated by 162 DMPC molecules, and 40 mM NaCl was added to the water to neutralize the system. The system was coupled to a Nose–Hoover thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nosé, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoover, 1985</xref>) and a Parrinello–Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>), at 310 K and 1 bar, respectively. The system was minimized, then equilibrated with position constraints gradually releasing, as by the default setting of CHARMM-GUI. Then, the system was further equilibrated for 400 ns without constraint, where the RMSD plateaued, and the box sizes were stable. For one simulation, we observed lipids penetrating the protein in this 400 ns equilibration, so we added another 100 ns simulation with backbone constraints to further equilibrate the membrane before releasing these constraints again. Figures were rendered with ChimeraX. The hydrogen distances were analyzed with PLUMED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">The PLUMED consortium, 2019</xref>), by computing the softmin of all hydrogen–hydrogen distances between two sidechains with <italic>β</italic> = 500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Water path length calculation</title><p>The water path length calculation was implemented in an in-house modification of PLUMED. The algorithm can be briefly described as follows: Each water oxygen is considered a node in a graph, and the distance for each edge connecting two nodes is determined by a function that is close to 1 when the oxygen-oxygen distance is smaller than <italic>r</italic>0 and grows rapidly when it is larger than <italic>r</italic>0. This <italic>r</italic>0 is set to 3 Å, which is the typical distance between the oxygens of hydrogen-bonded water. A more detailed discussion can be found in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Voth, 2021a</xref>). Then, for each frame in the trajectory, the shortest path is found for the graph. We used the two oxygens of E14B at the starting point and the midpoint of C<italic>α</italic> of R102A and G57A as the destination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Umbrella sampling with MS-RMD</title><p>The simulations were run with the LAMMPS MD engine, and the umbrella sampling was carried out as implemented in PLUMED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">The PLUMED consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thompson et al., 2022</xref>). The codes were co-compiled with RAPTOR, a plug-in to model proton transport reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mordoch et al., 1999</xref>). The source code of RAPTOR is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/uchicago-voth/raptor">https://github.com/uchicago-voth/raptor</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teng, 2024</xref>). The starting structure was taken from the classical MD simulation of WT-EmrE. A water molecule was protonated at the mouth of the channel, and steered MD was then used to create initial configurations at different CV values. A total of 43 umbrella windows spanning from CV = 0.0 Å to 15.0 Å were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), with a varying restraint force constant of 80–15 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>.

Each umbrella window was equilibrated for 1 ns, and then the production run was for 2 ns. The PMF was reconstructed with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM, version 2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossfield, 2013</xref>). In these simulations, the C<italic>α</italic> of the residues at least 10 Å away from the path and those in TM1–TM2 were restrained to its initial coordinate with a 2.4 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> harmonic potential to ensure the bias force does not unrealistically distort the protein conformation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-105525-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All datasets can be found at MendeleyData (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17632/28fx2zgvhx.1">https://doi.org/10.17632/28fx2zgvhx.1</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brousseau</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Voth</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Henzler-Wildman</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>The C-terminus of the multi-drug efflux pump EmrE prevents proton leak by gating transport</data-title><source>Mendeley Data</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17632/28fx2zgvhx.1</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH through grant R01GM053148 (to GAV) and R35GM141748 (to KHW).

These experiments report the rate of net flux when both proton-coupled substrate antiport and substrate-gated proton leak are possible. We will add this data to the revision, including data acquired with different lipid:protein ratio that confirms we are detecting transport rather than binding. In brief, this data shows that the net flux is highly dependent on both proton concentration (pH) and drug-substrate concentration, as predicted by our mechanistic model. This demonstrates that both types of transport contribute to net flux when small molecule substrates are present.</p><p>In the absence of drug-substrate, proton leak is the only possible transport pathway. The pyranine assay directly assesses proton leak under these conditions and unambiguously shows faster proton entry into proteoliposomes through the ∆107-EmrE mutant than through WT EmrE, with the rate of proton entry into ∆107-EmrE proteoliposomes matching the rate of proton entry achieved by the protonophore CCCP. We have revised the text to more clearly emphasize how this directly measures proton leak independently of any other type of transport activity. The SSME experiments with a proton gradient only (no small molecule substrate present) provide additional data on shorter timescales that is consistent with the pyranine data. The consistency of the data across multiple LPRs and comparison of transport to proton leak in the SSME assays further strengthens the importance of the C-terminal tail in determining the rate of flux.</p><p>None of the current structural models have good resolution (crystallography, EM) or sufficient restraints (NMR) to define the loop and tail conformations sufficiently for comparison with this work. We are in the process of refining an experimental structure of EmrE with better resolution of the loop and tail regions implicated in proton-entry and leak. Direct assessment of structural interactions via mutagenesis is complicated because of the antiparallel homodimer structure of EmrE. Any point mutation necessarily affects both subunits of the dimer, and mutations designed to probe the hydrophobic gate on the more open face of the transporter also have the potential to disrupt closure on the opposite face, particularly in the absence of sufficient resolution in the available structures. Thus, mutagenesis to test specific predicted structural features is deferred until our structure is complete so that we can appropriately interpret the results.</p><p>In our simulation setup, the MD results can be considered representative and meaningful for two reasons. First, the C-terminal tail, not present in the prior structure and thus modeled by us, is only 4 residues long. We will show in the revision and detailed response that the system will lose memory of its previous conformation very quickly, such that velocity initialization alone is enough for a diverse starting point. Second, our simulation is more like simulated annealing, starting from a high free energy state to show that, given such random initialization, the tail conformation we get in the end is consistent with what we reported. It is also difficult to sample back-and-forth tail motion within a realistic MD timescale. Therefore, it can be unconclusive to causally infer the allosteric motions with unbiased MD of the wildtype alone. The best viable way is to look at the equilibrium statistics of the most stable states between WT- and ∆107-EmrE and compare the differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The work is well done and well presented. In my opinion, the authors must address the following questions.</p><p>(1) It is unclear to a non-SSME-expert, why the net charge translocated in delta_107 is larger than in WT. For such small pH gradients (0.5-1pH unit), it seems that only a few protons would leave the liposome before the internal pH is adjusted to be the same as the external. This number can be estimated given the size of the liposomes. What is it? Once the pH gradient is dissipated, no more net proton transport should be observed. So, why would more protons flow out of the mutant relative to WT?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the complexity of both the system and assay and have made revisions to both the main text and SI to address these points more clearly. While we can estimate liposomes size, we cannot easily quantify the number of liposomes on the sensor surface so cannot calculate the amount of charge movement as suggested by the reviewer. We have revised Fig. 3.2 and added additional data at low and high pH with different lipid to protein ratios to distinguish pre-steady state (proton release from the protein) and steady state processes (transport). An extended Fig. 3.2 caption and revised discussion in the main text clarify these points.</p><p>We have also revised SI figure 3.2 to include an example of transport driven by an infinite drug gradient. Drug-proton antiport results in net charge build-up in the liposome since two protons will be driven out for every +1 drug transported in. This also creates a pH gradient is created (higher proton concentration outside). The negative inside potential inhibits further antiport of drug. However, both the negative-inside potential and proton gradient will drives protons back into the liposome if there is a leak pathway available. This is clearly visible with a reversal of current negative (antiport) to positive (proton backflow), and the magnitude of this back flow is larger for ∆107-EmrE which lacks the regulatory elements provided by the C-terminal tail. We have amended the main text and SI to include this discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given the estimated rate of transport, size of liposomes, and pH gradient, how quickly would the SSME liposomes reach pH balance?</p></disp-quote><p>Since SSME measurements are due to capacitive coupling and will represent the net charge movement, including pre-steady state contributions, the current values will be incredibly sensitive to individual rates of alternating access, proton and drug on- and off-rates. Time to pH balance would, therefore, differ based on the construct, LPR, absolute pH or drug concentrations as well as the magnitude of the given gradients. For this reason, we necessarily use integrated currents (transported charge over time) when comparing mutants as it reflects kinetic differences inherent to the mutant without over-processing the data, for example, by normalizing to peak currents which would over emphasize certain properties that will differ across mutants. This process allows for qualitative comparisons by subjecting mutants to the same pH and substrate gradients when the same density of transporter construct is present, and care is given to not overstate the importance of the actual quantities of charges that are moving as they will be highly context dependent. This is clearly seen in Fig 3.2 where the current is not zero and the net transported charge is still changing at the end of 1 second. We have amended SI figure 3.2 and the main text to include this discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Given that H110 and E14 would deprotonate when the external pH is elevated above 7 and that these protons would be released to external bulk, the external bulk pH would decrease twice as much for WT compared to delta107. This would decrease the pH gradient for WT relative to the mutant. Can these effects be quantified and accounted for? Would this ostensibly decrease the amount of charge that transfers into the liposomes for WT? How would this impact the current interpretation that the two systems are driven by the same gradient?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there will be differences in deprotonation of WT and ∆107 and the amount of proton release will also change with pH. We have amended Figure 3.2 to clarify this difference and its significance. For the proton gradient only conditions in Figure 3, each set of liposomes were equilibrated to the starting pH by repeated washings and incubation before measurement occurred. For example, for the pH 6.5 inside, pH 7 outside condition, both the inside and outside pH were equilibrated at 6.5, and both E14 residues will be predominantly protonated in WT and ∆107, and H110 will be predominantly protonated in WT-EmrE. Upon application of the external pH 7 solution, protons will be released from the E14 of either construct, with additional proton being released from H110 for WT-EmrE causing a large pre-steady state negative contribution to the signal (Fig. 3.2A). Under this pH condition, we the peak current correlates with the LPR, as this release of protons will depend on density of the transporter. However, we also see that the longer-time decay of the signal correlates with the construct (WT or ∆107) and is relatively independent of LPR, consistent with a transport process rather than a rapid pre-steady state release of protons. Therefore, when we look at the actual transported charge over time, despite the higher contribution of proton release to the WT-EmrE signal, the significant increase in uncoupled proton transport for the C-terminal deletion mutant dominates the signal.</p><p>As a contrast, we apply this same analysis to the pH 8 inside, pH 8.5 outside condition where both sets of transports will be deprotonated from the start (Fig. 3.2B). Now the peak currents, decay rates, and transported charge over time are all consistent for a given construct (WT or ∆107). The two LPRs for an individual construct match within error, as the differences in overall charge movement and transported charge over time are independent of pre-steady-state proton release from the transporter at high pH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A related question, how does the protonation of H110 influence the potential rate of proton transport between the two systems? Does the proton on H110 transfer to E14?</p></disp-quote><p>The protonation of H110 will only influence the rate of transport of WT-EmrE as its protonation is required for formation of the hydrogen bonding network that coordinates gating. However, protonation of both E14s will influence the rate of proton transport of both systems as protonation state affects the rate of alternating access which is necessary for proton turnover. This is another reason we use the transported charge over time metric to compare mutants as it allows for a common metric for mutants with altered rates which are present in the same density and under the same gradient conditions. We do not have any evidence to support transfer of proton from H110 to E14, but there is also no evidence to exclude this possibility. We do not discuss this in the manuscript because it would be entirely speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is the pKa in the simulations (Figure 6B) consistent with the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated the pKa from this WT PMF and got a pKa of 7.1, which is in close proximity of the experimental value of 6.8</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Why isn't the PMF for delta_107 compared to WT to corroborate the prediction that hydration sufficiently alters both the rate and pKa of E14?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that a direct comparison would be valuable. However, several factors limit the interpretability of such an analysis in this context:</p><p>(a) Our data indicate that the primary difference in free energy barriers between WT and Δ107 lies in the hydration step rather than proton transport itself. To fully resolve this, a 2D PMF calculation via 2D umbrella sampling would be required which can be very expensive. Solely looking at the proton transport side of this PMF will not give much difference.</p><p>(b) Given this, the aim for us to calculate this PMF is to support our conjecture that the bottleneck for such transport is the hydrophobic gate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors suggest that A61 rotation 'controls the water wire formation' by measuring the distribution of water connectivity (water-water distances via logS) and average distances between A61 and I68/I67. Delta_107 has a larger inter-residue distance (Figure 6A) more probable small log S closer waters connecting E14 and two residues near the top of the protein (Figure 5A). However, it strikes me that looking at average distances and the distribution of log S is not the best way to do this. Why not quantify the correlation between log S and A61 orientation and/or A61-I68/I71 distances as well as their correlation to the proposed tail interactions (D84-R106 interactions) to directly verify the correlation (and suggest causation) of these interactions on the hydration in this region. Additionally, plotting the RMSD or probability of waters below I68 and I171 as a function of A61-I68 distances and/or numbers over time would support the log S analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer requested that we provide direct correlation analyses between A61 orientation, residue distances (A61-I68/I71), and water connectivity (logS) to better support the claim about water wire formation, rather than relying solely on average distances and distributions.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to strengthen our analysis with direct correlations. However, due to the slow kinetics of hydration/dehydration events, unbiased simulation timescales do not permit sufficient sampling of multiple transitions to perform statistically robust dynamic correlation analyses. Instead, our approach focuses on equilibrium statistics, which reveal the dominant conformational states of WT- and Δ107-EmrE and provide meaningful insights into shifts in hydration patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) It looks like the D84-R106 salt bridge controls this A61-I68 opening. Could this also be quantifiably correlated?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in response to the previous question, the unbiased simulation timescales do not permit sufficient sampling of multiple transitions to perform statistically robust dynamic correlation analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The NMR results show that alternating access increases in frequency from ~4/s for WT at low and high pH to ~17/s for delta_107 only at high pH. They then go on to analyze potential titration changes in the delta_107 mutant, finding two residues with approximate pKa values of 5.6 and 7.1. The former is assigned to E14, consistent with WT. But the latter is suggested to be either D84, which salt bridges to R106, or the C-terminal carboxylate. If it is D84, why would deprotonation, which would be essential to form the salt bridge, increase the rate of alternating access relative to WT?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the faster alternating access rate was observed for TPP+-bound ∆107-EmrE, not the transporter in the absence of substrate. In the absence of substrate the relatively broad lines preclude quantitative determination of the alternating access rate by NMR making it difficult to judge the validity of the reviewers reasoning. Identification of which residue (D84 or H110) corresponds to the shifted pKa is ultimately of little consequence as this mutant does not reflect the native conditions of the transporter. It is far more important to acknowledge that both R106 and D84 are sensitive to this deprotonation as it indicates these residues are close in space and provides experimental support for the existence of the salt bridge identified in the MD simulations, as discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In a more general sense, can the authors speculate why an efflux pump would evolve this type of secondary gate that can be thrown off by tight binding in the allosteric site such as that demonstrated by Harmane? What potential advantage is there to having a tail-regulated gate?</p></disp-quote><p>This was likely a necessity to allow for better coupling as these transporters evolved to be more promiscuous. The C-terminal tail is absent in tightly coupled family members such as Gdx who are specific for a single substrate and have a better-defined transport stoichiometry. We have included this discussion in the main text and are currently investigating this phenomenon further. Those experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) It is hard to visualize the PT reaction coordinate. Is the e_PT unit vector defined for each window separately based on the initial steered MD pathway? If so, how reliant is the PT pathway on this initial approximate path? Also, how does this position for each window change if/when E14 rotates? This could be checked by plotting the x,y,z distributions for each window and quantifying the overlap between windows in cartesian space. These clouds of distributions could also be plotted in the protein following alignment so the reader can visualize the reaction coordinate. Does the CEC localization ever stray to different, disconnected regions of cartesian phase space that are hidden by the reaction coordinate definition?</p></disp-quote><p>The unit vector e_PT is the same across all windows based on unbiased MD. Therefore, the reaction coordinate (a scalar) is the vector from the starting point to the CEC, projected on this unit vector. E14 rotation does not significantly change the window definition a lot unless the CEC is very close to E14, where we found this to be a better CV. For detailed discussions about this CV, especially a comparison between a curvilinear CV, please see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 48, 16535–16543 “Simulations of the Proton Transport” and its SI Figure S1.In the Supplementary Information, we added figure 6.1 to show the average X, Y, Z coordinates of each umbrella window.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Lastly, perhaps I missed it, but it's unclear if the rate of substrate efflux is also increased in the delta_107 mutant. If this is also increased, then the overall rate of exchange is faster, including proton leak. This would be important to distinguish since the focus now is entirely on proton leaks. I.e., is it only leak or is it overall efflux and leak?</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended SI figure 3.2 to include a gradient condition where an infinite drug gradient is created across the liposome. The infinite gradient allows for rapid transport of drug into the liposomes until charge build-up opposes further transport. This peak is at the same time for both LPRs of WT- and ∆107-EmrE suggesting the rate of substrate transport is similar. Differences in the peak heights across LPRs can be attributed to competition between drug and proton for the primary binding site such that more proton will be released for the higher density constructs as described above. This process does also create a proton gradient as drug moving in is coupled to two protons moving out so as charge build-up inhibits further drug movement, the building proton gradient will also begin to drive proton back in which is another example of uncoupled leak. Here, again we see that this back-flow of protons or leak is of greater magnitude for ∆107-EmrE proteoliposomes that for those with WT-EmrE. We have included this discussion in the SI and main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) Introduction - the authors describe EmrE as a model system for studying the molecular mechanism of proton-coupled transport.

The initial water wire analysis is based on 4 different 1 ms simulations presented in Figure 5. The 3 WT replicates show similar results for the tail-blocking water wire formation, but the details of the system build and loop/C-terminal tail placement are not clear. It does appear that a single C-terminal tail model was created for all WT replicates. Was there also modeling for any parts of the truncation mutant? Regardless, since these initial placements and uncertainties in the structures may impact the results and subsequent water wire formation, I would like a discussion of how these starting structures impacted the formation or not of wires. I think that another WT replicate should be run starting from a completely new build that places the tail in a different (but hopefully reasonable location). This could be built with any number of tools to generate reasonable starting structures. It's critical to ensure that multiple independent simulations across different initial builds show the same water wire behavior so that we know the results are robust and insensitive to the starting structure and stochastic variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their suggestion regarding the discussion of the initial structure. In our simulations, the C-terminal tail was initially modeled in an extended conformation (solvent-exposed) to mimic its disordered state prior to folding. This approach resembles an annealing process, where the system evolves from a higher free-energy state toward equilibrium. Notably, across all three replicas, we observed consistent folding of the tail onto the protein surface, supporting the robustness of this conformational preference.</p><p>For the Δ107 truncation mutant, minimal modeling was required, as most experimental structures resolve residues up to S105 or R106. To rigorously assess the influence of the starting configuration, we analyzed the tail’s dynamics using backbone dihedral angle auto- and cross-correlation functions (new Supplementary Figures 10.1 and 10.2). These analyses reveal rapid decay of correlations—consistent with the tail’s short length (5 residues) and high flexibility—indicating that the system &quot;forgets&quot; its initial configuration well within the simulation timescale. Thus, we conclude that our sampling is sufficient to capture equilibrium behavior, independent of the starting structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does the size of the barrier in the PMF (Figure 6B) imply about the rate of proton transfer/leak and can the pKa shift of the acidic residue be estimated with this energy value compared to bulk?</p></disp-quote><p>We noticed this point aligns with a related concern raised by Reviewer 1.
