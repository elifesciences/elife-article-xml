most prevalent features in human cancers. Here, we show that most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the aberrant assembly of MYB transcriptional co-activator complex. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300 co-activation of a distinct set of transcription factor complexes. These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2, and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML. This work establishes a compelling strategy for their pharmacologic reprogramming and therapeutic targeting for diverse leukemias and possibly other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Leukemia</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

In many tumors, this is due to the pathogenic mutations of promoters, enhancers, and genes encoding either transcription factors or factors that regulate chromatin and gene expression. In blood cancers, and acute myeloid leukemias (AML) in particular, aberrant gene expression is thought to contribute to most important properties of leukemia cells, including self-renewal, growth, and resistance to therapy. For example, numerous pathogenic chromosomal translocations in AML, such as those involving <italic>AML1</italic> (<italic>RUNX1</italic>) and <italic>MLL1</italic> (<italic>KMT2A</italic>) produce chimeric transcription or chromatin remodeling factors that cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Look, 1997</xref>). Consequently, therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal gene expression are compelling because of their ability to target the causal molecular processes and induce leukemia cell differentiation and elimination, leading in principle to durable disease control.</p><p>While specific molecular dependencies have been identified for some genetic subtypes of AML, such as DOT1L or Menin inhibition for <italic>MLL</italic>-rearranged leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krivtsov et al., 2019</xref>), and CARM1 inhibition for <italic>AML1</italic>-rearranged leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenblatt et al., 2019</xref>), distinct pathogenetic mechanisms of diverse AML subtypes also appear to converge on shared molecular pathways. For example, approximately 25% of adult and childhood AMLs, including both <italic>MLL</italic>-rearranged and non-rearranged cases, require aberrant activation of the transcription factor MEF2C, conferring susceptibility to MARK and SIK inhibitors, which are currently being explored for clinical trials for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tarumoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vakoc and Kentsis, 2018</xref>). Similarly, nearly 50% of examined AML specimens exhibit aberrant activation of HGF/MET/FGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kentsis et al., 2012</xref>) and are being currently targeted therapeutically in the ongoing clinical trial of combined MET and FGFR inhibitors in patients with relapsed or refractory AML (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier NCT03125239). Even for therapies targeting leukemogenic proteins directly, such as inhibitors of IDH1/2, FLT3, KIT, SYK, as well as epigenetic and apoptotic therapies such as decitabine and venetoclax, their therapeutic efficacy and resistance depend on the underlying gene expression phenotypic states of AML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tyner et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, there is intense interest in defining shared molecular dependencies controlling leukemogenic gene expression in AML that can provide effective therapeutic options for patients.</p><p>Recently, MYB has emerged as a therapeutic target in AML, as transient suppression of <italic>Myb</italic> nearly completely eliminates leukemia development in mouse models in vivo while sparing normal hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, pioneering studies have implicated Myb as a key mediator of leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klempnauer and Bishop, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luger et al., 2002</xref>). MYB is the cellular homologue of the viral <italic>v-Myb</italic> oncogene that can cause avian leukemias and function as a pioneer transcription factor in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biedenkapp et al., 1988</xref>). MYB functions as a master regulator of gene expression in diverse cell types, including hematopoietic cells where it controls cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramsay and Gonda, 2008</xref>). Both mutations and translocations of <italic>MYB</italic> have causal roles in various human malignancies, including leukemias. For example, aberrant expression of <italic>TAL1</italic> in T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL) is induced by pathogenic somatic mutations that create neomorphic MYB-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansour et al., 2014</xref>).

Altogether, these findings indicate that MYB and its co-factor CBP/P300 are fundamentally dysregulated in AML, presumably through disordered gene expression that characterizes most forms of this disease. However, the specific details of this mechanism remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of suitable tools.</p><p>Recently, we developed a peptidomimetic inhibitor of MYB:CBP/P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswamy et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we report its second-generation version that has significantly increased potency, and consequently suppresses leukemic MYB functions in most AML subtypes tested, while relatively sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300-mediated co-activation of a distinct set of transcriptional factor complexes that are aberrantly assembled with MYB in AML cells, which is associated at least in part with their inappropriate expression. This therapeutic remodeling is accompanied by dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 complexes to genes that control cellular differentiation and growth. These findings provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene control, involving aberrant assembly of transcription factor complexes and sequestration of CBP/P300 to promote oncogenic gene expression and block cellular differentiation. This paradigm should apply to other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control, elucidate specific molecular determinants of leukemia pathogenesis, and enable the development of definitive therapies for patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CBP requirement for the susceptibility of AML cells to peptidomimetic blockade of MYB:CBP/P300</title><p>In prior work, we used genetic and structural evidence to design a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the MYB:CBP/P300 transcription coactivation complex, termed MYBMIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswamy et al., 2018</xref>).

Using molecular mechanics simulations, we previously developed a peptidomimetic inhibitor of this interaction, termed MYBMIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswamy et al., 2018</xref>). MYBMIM uses stereoselective substitution of D-amino acids to confer proteolytic stability, and the cationic TAT domain for cell penetration.

To confirm these peptides can bind the CBP/P300 complex from cells, we immobilized biotinylated CRYBMIM and CREBMIM peptides on streptavidin beads and used them to affinity purify CBP/P300 from non-denatured nuclear extracts of MV411 AML cells. Consistently, we observed efficient binding of nuclear CBP/P300 to peptide-conjugated but not control streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We found that increasing concentrations of free CRYBMIM could compete with the binding of CBP/P300 to immobilized CRYBMIM, with the apparent <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> of approximately 4.7 µM based on quantitative fluorescence densitometry measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We confirmed the specificity of this binding by incubating bound complexes with 100-fold excess of TAT control peptides, which demonstrated no measurable displacement as compared to PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). In contrast, excess CREBMIM was significantly less effective at displacing CBP/P300 from immobilized CREBMIM (apparent <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> &gt;100 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>), consistent with the much higher nM affinity and allosteric effects that characterize the CREB:CBP/P300 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radhakrishnan et al., 1997</xref>). This is also consistent with the presence of distinct CBP transcription factor complexes in AML cells, some of which (MYB) are susceptible to peptidomimetic blockade, and others (CREB) exhibiting more stable interactions. Importantly, CRYBMIM binds CBP/P300 specifically, as exposure of AML cell extracts to streptavidin-immobilized biotinylated CRYBMIM leads to efficient binding to CBP/P300, but not MED15 which is highly expressed in MV411 AML cells and contains a known KIX domain with the closest sequence similarity to CBP/P300 (38% identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).

Consistent with this prediction, comparison of the effects of CRYBMIM on gene expression and consequent apoptosis of MV411 cells revealed that 1 and 4 hr exposures led to significant changes in gene expression with minimal induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to define the changes on gene expression genome-wide upon 1 and 4 hr exposures to CRYBMIM as compared to PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). We found that after 4-hr duration of treatment, CRYBMIM causes significant downregulation of 2869 genes, including known MYB target genes <italic>MYC, IKZF1, GATA2,</italic> and <italic>KIT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b-e</xref>).

Interestingly, in addition to the expected suppression of MYB target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), gene set enrichment analysis also revealed significant induction of myeloid and monocyte differentiation programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2f</xref>). These effects were specific because in contrast to CRYBMIM, CREBMIM treatment exhibited minimal changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with its inability to disrupt the cellular CBP/P300 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

While MYBMIM primarily induces apoptosis of MV411 cells, CRYBMIM effects include both apoptosis and differentiation, as evident from flow cytometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the occupancy of MYB and CBP/P300 genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Consistently, we found that CRYBMIM treatment leads to significant redistribution of both MYB and CBP/P300 on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). For example, after 1 hr of CRYBMIM treatment, both MYB and CBP/P300 are evicted from loci enriched in the MYB-associated DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, lost peaks). By 4 hours of CRYBMIM treatment, MYB was significantly depleted from 2587 promoters and enhancers, primarily at sites associated with the MYB DNA-binding motifs, as well as motifs corresponding to NFY, ETS family, AP-1 family, SP1, and C/EBP family member transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). Noticeably, CBP/P300 was not only depleted from 7579 genes, but also significantly redistributed to 11,324 new loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with the remodeling of its complex upon CRYBMIM treatment. Loci depleted of CBP/P300 were significantly enriched in MYB-associated DNA-binding motifs, as well as those corresponding to the SPI1/ETS, MAF, C/EBP family member, and SP2 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Likewise, loci that gained CBP/P300 upon CRYBMIM treatment were enriched in DNA-binding motifs for the AP-1, RUNX1, EGR, and C/EBP family member transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In all, peptidomimetic blockade of MYB:CBP/P300 assembly causes remodeling of transcription factor complexes at loci controlling leukemic gene expression, associated with genome-wide redistribution of CBP/P300 transcriptional co-activation complexes. Thus, sequestration of CBP/P300 from genes controlling hematopoietic differentiation contributes to the leukemogenic MYB-dependent gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CRYBMIM remodels MYB and CBP/P300 chromatin complexes in AML cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Volcano plots of relative MYB chromatin occupancy in MV411 cells changes after 1 hr (<bold>A</bold>) and 4 hr (<bold>B</bold>) of 20 µM CRYBMIM treatment compared to PBS control, as analyzed by ChIP-seq.

To test this prediction, we carried out comparative gene expression analyses using RNA-sequencing of CRYBMIM effects in <italic>AML1-ETO</italic>-translocated Kasumi1, <italic>DNMTA3A;NPM1</italic>-mutant OCIAML3, <italic>MLL</italic>-rearranged MV411, <italic>NRAS</italic>-mutant;<italic>MYC</italic>-amplified HL60, and <italic>CALM10</italic>-rearranged U937 AML cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To investigate this directly, we quantified CRYBMIM-induced reduction of MYB protein levels in MV411 cells upon co-treatment with the proteosomal/protease inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Consistent with the proteolytic depletion of MYB upon CRYBMIM treatment, MG132 co-treatment led to near complete rescue of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). This effect was specific because overexpression of <italic>BCL2</italic>, which blocks MYBMIM-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswamy et al., 2018</xref>), and rescued the depletion of cellular CREB, presumably due to non-specific proteolysis that accompanies apoptosis, was unable to rescue CRYBMIM-induced proteolysis of MYB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

To test this, we prioritized CEBPA, LYL1, SPI1, and RUNX1 as MYB-associated co-factors based on their physical interactions and functional dependencies in AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and analyzed their chromatin dynamics in response to CRYBMIM treatment using ChIP-seq analysis. Consistent with the release and redistribution mechanism, we observed both coherent and factor-specific dynamics of MYB co-factors on chromatin upon CRYBMIM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Clustering of observed dynamics revealed nine classes of apparent chromatin responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).

This suggests a potential mechanism for the long-hypothesized repressive functions of MYB. While we found no apparent changes in JUN occupancy, motif analysis at loci that both lost and gained MYB and CBP/P300 revealed enrichment of AP-1 sequence elements, consistent with the presence of other AP-1 family member(s) in MYB regulatory complexes.

This is consistent with the CRYBMIM-induced gene expression differentiation programs and accompanying morphologic features of myeloid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While CRYBMIM induces MYB proteolysis, residual MYB can remain bound to chromatin, as evident by its accumulation in specific loci upon CRYBMIM treatment. MYB-binding loci lost upon CRYBMIM treatment showed significant enrichment for known MYB binding motifs, while CRYBMIM-induced MYB peaks did not (p=1e-149 vs 1e-3, 56% vs 5.7% of target sites, respectively). This raises the possibility that DNA-binding affinity of MYB could be regulated by CBP/P300, either by direct effects such as MYB deacetylation upon CRYBMIM treatment, or indirectly via binding with other transcription factors. It is possible that other transcription factors may contribute to oncogenic gene expression in AML cells, such as CREB for example, as evident from their contribution to MYB-independent chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>; pink cluster 2). However, this is likely a minor effect, given the relatively modest reprogramming of gene expression by CREBMIM that targets the CREB:CBP/P300 complexes in AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Globally, the most pronounced feature of MYB complex remodeling is the release of CBP/P300 from genes that are associated with AML cell growth and survival to those that are associated with hematopoietic differentiation.

In contrast to the model in which blockade of MYB:CBP/P300 induces loss of gene expression and loss of transcription factor and CBP/P300 chromatin occupancy, we also observed a large number of genes with increased expression and gain of CBP/P300 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

This involves apparent sequestration of CBP/P300 from genes controlling myeloid cell differentiation.

This is particularly relevant for leukemias which are frequently caused by mutations of genes encoding transcription and chromatin remodeling factors. Among all types of leukemias examined to date, the transcription factor MYB ranks as the most selectively required functional genetic dependency. This nominates MYB both as a compelling therapeutic target, and a focus of mechanistic studies to define fundamental mechanisms of dysregulated gene expression in leukemias.</p><p>By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300-mediated co-activation of a distinct set of transcriptional factor complexes that are aberrantly assembled with MYB in AML cells. The second-generation, cell-penetrant peptidomimetic MYB inhibitor, termed CRYBMIM, has potent and broad-spectrum activity against diverse subtypes of AML, while relatively sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Consequently, its improved activity enables high-resolution, genome-wide studies of chromatin and gene expression dynamics that control MYB-dependent leukemic expression in AML cells. We find that CRYBMIM blocks oncogenic MYB gene expression and restores myeloid cell differentiation. This effect involves aberrantly organized MYB regulatory complexes, stably composed of additional transcription factors including LYL1, C/EBP family members, E2A, LMO2 and SATB1, that are reminiscent of core regulatory circuits observed in MYB-dependent T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanda et al., 2012</xref>). Unexpectedly, we find that MYB-dependent leukemogenic gene expression also involves apparent sequestration of CBP/P300. In turn, peptidomimetic MYB:CBP/P300 blockade releases and redistributes CBP/P300 and other sequestered transcription factors to induce cell differentiation. In all, these findings establish a compelling strategy for pharmacologic reprogramming of oncogenic gene expression that supports its targeting for leukemias and other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.</p><p>What is the origin of aberrant MYB transcriptional complexes and functions in leukemia cells? MYB is not known to be mutated in most cases of AML, and this study points to its aberrant assembly as the convergent mechanism by which it is pathogenically dysregulated. Indeed, previous studies have found cell-type-specific features of MYB gene activation, suggesting the presence of other factors that influence MYB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, MYB alone is not sufficient for leukemic cell transformation, indicating the need for specific co-factors in its leukemogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonda et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>By integrating functional genomics and proteomics, combined with gene expression and chromatin dynamics analyses, we identified a set of factors in complex with MYB that appear to be aberrantly and stably co-assembled, including C/EBP family members, LYL1, E2A, LMO2, and SATB1. Their physical interactions and chromatin co-localization with MYB are associated with oncogenic gene expression and blockade of cell differentiation in AML cells. Interestingly, we found no CRYBMIM-induced remodeling of MYB regulatory complexes independent of CBP/P300, indicating that KIX-dependent interaction between MYB and CBP/P300 is required for most of MYB transcriptional activity in AML cells.</p><p>It is possible that somatic mutations of regulatory DNA elements, such as those physically associated with MYB regulatory complexes, contribute to the aberrant assembly of these complexes on chromatin, as observed for the oncogenic <italic>TAL1</italic> enhancer mutations in cases of T-ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansour et al., 2014</xref>), and recently suggested for other leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2019</xref>). It is also possible that leukemic gene expression by MYB involves additional transcriptional co-activators, such as TAF12, as part of the recently described TFIID-SAGA complex interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), or other TAFs which have also been implicated in transcriptional co-regulation in leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, it is also possible that distinct subtypes of AML diverge from the aberrant regulatory complex assembly model presented here. For example, LYL1, an oncogene that is aberrantly expressed in diverse subtypes of AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng et al., 2005</xref>), assembles with MYB in leukemia cells examined in our study, similar to its functional homologue TAL1 in cases of T-ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanda et al., 2012</xref>). Alternative bHLH transcription factors may cooperate with MYB in some leukemia subtypes, including potential differences in their cells of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones, 2004</xref>). It will be important to determine how aberrant co-expression of such oncogenic regulatory complex co-factors is induced in leukemia cells by diverse oncogenes, such as for example by kinase-dependent dysregulation of transcription factor assembly recently described for MEF2C and LYL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tarumoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vakoc and Kentsis, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The switch-like response of AML cells to peptidomimetic disassembly of the MYB:CBP/P300 chromatin complex suggests that cellular CBP/P300 exists in a dynamic equilibrium under limiting conditions. Such a model is supported by the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to heterozygous deletion mutations that reduce <italic>CBP</italic> gene dosage, leading to human developmental defects. This model also explains the distinct requirements of CBP and P300 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), as also observed in our studies in genetically diverse AML cell types, as well as the functional requirement for P300 in CBP-deficient cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogiwara et al., 2016</xref>). Definition of the mechanisms of this molecular switch regulating discrete gene expression programs is expected to reveal distinct mechanisms of dysregulated gene control in AML and other transcription-dysregulated cancers.</p><p>Current small molecule inhibitors of MYB lack sufficient selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pattabiraman and Gonda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uttarkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uttarkar et al., 2016</xref>). Our peptidomimetic strategy suggests that structure-based design of effective pharmacologic MYB inhibitors is not only possible, but also desirable given its favorable therapeutic index. First, the functional requirement for peptidomimetic blockade of MYB but not CREB or MLL1 binding in supporting oncogenic gene expression and cell survival suggests that ligands to these permissive binding sites may be used to gain binding affinity of pharmacologic MYB inhibitors. Indeed, such a fragment-based design strategy was successfully used to develop effective BH3 mimetics, including venetoclax that has recently been approved for leukemia therapy.</p><p>Quantitative improvement in binding affinity from MYBMIM to CRYBMIM is associated with qualitative improvement in biological potency, due to the combination of enhanced MYB:CBP/P300 binding competition and proteolytic remodeling of its complex. Such event-driven pharmacology has recently been used to develop a variety of pharmacologic modulators of protein interactions, such as PROTACs. The dual mechanism of action observed for peptidomimetic MYB:CBP/P300 inhibitors, involving suppression of oncogenic MYB activity and remodeling of CBP/P300, provides a pharmacologic strategy for both precise chemical probes and improved therapeutics. Indeed, ligation of the KIX domain of CBP/P300 by CRYBMIM may allosterically modulate the activity of its complexes, similar to the allosteric regulation of its acetyltransferase activity by auto-acetylation and intramolecular bromodomain binding.</p><p>Functional proteomic maps of MYB regulatory complexes provided by our study should be useful in identifying key protein-protein interactions and post-translational enzymatic modifications that are aberrantly induced in AML cells, as targets for improved therapies. For example, this may involve transcription factor acetylation by CBP/P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), warranting the investigation of recently developed selective CBP/P300 acetyltransferase inhibitors, which have shown particular activity in hematopoietic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Finally, recent studies have found that stable non-genetic resistance is a common feature of relapsed AML, and this resistance at least in part is due to the use of alternative enhancers to sustain aberrant gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2019</xref>). Therapeutic remodeling of complexes of master regulators such as MYB may constitute an effective strategy to reprogram oncogenic gene expression that may prevent or overcome such resistance, providing a platform for therapy of regulatory complex-mediated gene dysregulation in human cancers.

The associated figures were created using the ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wickham, 2016</xref>) package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>MV411 cells were resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mL and plated in 12-well tissue culture plates. To assess apoptosis, MYBMIM was used as a positive control and cells were treated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramaswamy et al., 2018</xref>). Cells were treated with 20 μM CRYBMIM for 1 hr. Following peptide treatment, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended with PBS with the addition of Annexin V-FITC (1:50) and CD11b (1:50). Cells were incubated on ice for 40 min followed by two washes with cold PBS. DAPI was added prior to flow cytometric analysis (1:10,000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Gene dependency analysis across cancer cell types</title><p>CRISPR knockout screen gene effect data from Project Achilles 19Q4 was downloaded from the DepMap Consortium (DepMap, Broad (2019): DepMap 19Q4 Public Dataset doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.11384241.v2). Dependency scores for each gene were averaged by tumor type. A differential dependency score was then calculated as the relative difference between the average gene dependency score for a tumor type and the average gene dependency score across all cell types. All genes were then ranked by leukemia gene differential dependency scores, and the top 10 and bottom 10 leukemia gene dependencies were plotted as a heat map. p-Values were calculated comparing MYB dependency in leukemias versus all other tumor types using two-tailed t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Mass spectrometry proteomics</title><p>Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above in biological triplicates. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE 10% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) at 100 V for 5 min. To visualize proteins, gels were stained using Silver Stain for Mass Spectrometry kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Relevant gel portions were excised and destained using 50 μL of 30 mM K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] in 100 mM aqueous Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by incubation at room temperature for 30 min, with gentle mixing halfway through. Following destaining, 500 μL of 25 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> were added to each tube and incubated for 5 min at room temperature on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf) at 700 rpm. Solution was removed and gel pieces were washed by adding 500 μL of 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and incubating for 10 min at room temperature on a ThermoMixer at 700 rpm. Wash step was repeated two more times. All solution was removed and 100 μL of acetonitrile was added to each tube and incubated for 5 min at room temperature on a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf) at 700 rpm. All solution was removed and destained gel fragments were vacuum centrifuged and stored at −20°C. For reduction of disulfide bonds, gel fragments were re-hydrated in 25 μL of 10 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> for 1 hr at 56°C. Tubes were cooled to room temperature. For alkylation of thiols, 25 μL of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was added to each tube and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. To quench the alkylation reaction, 5 μL of 100 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Gel fragments were washed by adding 50 μL of acetonitrile and incubation for 5 min at room temperature followed by addition of 500 μL of 100 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. All solution were removed and wash step was repeated. All solution were removed and 100 μL of acetonitrile was added and tubes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. All solution were removed and gel fragments were vacuum centrifuged and stored at −20°C. For digestion of proteins into peptides, gel fragments were cooled on ice. Protease LysC was added at a ratio of 1:25 protease:protein, assuming 1 μg of protein per immunoprecipitation. Gel fragments were incubated for 5 min on ice. Samples were diluted to 50 μL, or to cover gel fragments using 50 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Digestion was carried out for 4 hr at 37°C. Following LysC digestion, trypsin was added to each tube at the 1:25 protease:protein ratio in 50 mM aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Trypsin digestion was carried out for 16 hr at 37°C. To elute peptides from gel fragments, 50 μL of 1% formic acid in 70% acetonitrile was added to each tube and incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a ThermoMixer at 1400 rpm. Eluates were removed and saved, and elution step was repeated with fresh 1% formic acid in 70% acetonitrile. New eluates were pooled with the first elution for a total of 100 μL of eluate per sample. Samples were vacuum centrifuged to dryness. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, samples were desalted and purified by solid phase extraction using C18 Micro SpinColumns (Nest Group) and eluted with 70% acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% formic acid. Eluates were vacuum centrifuged to remove all solution. Samples were resuspended in 8 μL of 0.1% aqueous formic acid and sonicated for 5 min to ensure full resuspension. Three μL of each sample were used for mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>The LC system used a vented trap-elute configuration (EasynLC1000, Thermo Fisher scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) via a nano electro-spray DPV-565 PicoView ion source (New Objective). The trap column was fabricated with a 5 cm × 150 μm internal diameter silica capillary with a 2 mm silicate frit, and pressure loaded with Poros R2-C18 10 μm particles (Life Technologies). The analytical column consisted of a 25 cm × 75 μm internal diameter column with an integrated electrospray emitter (New Objective), packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm particles (Dr. Maisch). Peptides were resolved over 90 min using a 3–45% gradient of acetonitrile with 0.1% aqueous formic acid at 250 nL/min.</p><p>Precursor ions in the 375–3000 m/z range were isolated using the quadrupole and recorded every 3 s using the Orbitrap detector (60,000 resolution, with 445.1200 ions used as lockmass), with an automatic gain control target set at 10<sup>6</sup> ions and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Data-dependent precursor ion selection was enforced, limiting fragmentation to monoisotopic ions with charge 2–5 and precursor ion intensity greater than 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and dynamically excluding already fragmented ions for 30 s (10 ppm tolerance). Selected ions were isolated (Q1 isolation window 0.7 Th) and fragmented using HCD (normalized collision energy 30) using the top speed algorithm. Product ion spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC of 8 × 10<sup>4</sup> ions, maximum injection time 54 ms), in profile mode.</p><p>Mass spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16). For identification, spectra were matched against the human UniProt database (as of October 2017), supplemented with contaminant proteins from the cRAP database with FDR &lt; 0.01. After m/z recalibration, mass tolerance was set at 4.5 and 20 ppm for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed chemical modification, while methionine oxidation and protein N-terminus acetylation were set as variable. Protease specificity was set to trypsin/P, with up to two missed cleavages allowed. The match between runs feature was enabled (0.7 min tolerance, 20 min alignment). Quantification was performed using the LFQ algorithm.</p><p>Contaminating peptides such as keratin and non-human proteins were excluded and label-free quantification (LFQ) intensity values for protein groups were used for analysis. IgG and MYB immunoprecipitation samples were analyzed together (three replicates per condition; six samples total). Proteins in the following categories were excluded from analysis: (i) zero LFQ intensity across all replicates, (ii) zero LFQ intensity in five of six replicates, (iii) proteins with LFQ intensity recorded in only one replicate in both sets of samples. Enrichment scores were defined as the log2 ratio of MYB:IgG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Statistical analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering</title><p>OriginPro 2018 (Origin Lab) was used for statistical analysis. Principal component analysis was performed using prcomp (R Studio). The hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out with R function pheatmap with Pearson’s distance as the distance metrics and ‘average’ as the clustering method.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all our laboratory members, especially Benjamin Herzberg, Shray Khanna and Isaac Krasnopolsky, as well as Henrik Molina, Caitlin Steckler, and the MSK Integrated Genomics Operation core for technical assistance.

The authors have to provide a clear explanation of this apparent discrepancy. Related to this is an important comment of reviewer 3 from Review Commons that the peptide inhibitor induced MYB degradation that is clearly seen after 4 hours of treatment in Figure 11C. Given this observation, how can the authors explain the gained MYB peaks in the ChIP-seq. The authors have not correctly addressed this issue. It is of course reasonable to imagine that MYB stability depends upon its interactions with CBP and that when this is blocked by the peptide MYB is degraded. But if this is the case why does CRIPSR inactivation of CPB not induce the same effects. In fact, the stability of MYB in the CBP KO cells should be investigated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65905.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Dear Dr. Davidson and Dr. Struhl,</p><p>Thank you for your help with this manuscript. I want to emphasize just how refreshing and constructive the Review Commons with eLife process has been. I also want to point out that your suggestions are very helpful. Based on this, we have revised the manuscript, incorporating new data for MYB stability and modifying the conclusions to more accurately reflect the findings.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive suggestions, which have substantially improved this work. We have comprehensively revised the manuscript, and detail individual responses below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The study by Forbes et al. describes and characterizes a 2nd generation peptide-based inhibitor of the MYB:CBP interaction, termed CRYBMIM, which they use to study MYB:cofactor interactions in leukemia cells. The CRYBMIM has improved properties relative to the MYBMIM peptide, and display more potency in biochemical and cell-based assays. Using a combination of epigenomics and biochemical screens, the authors define a list of candidate MYB cofactors whose functional significance as AML dependencies is supported by analysis of the DepMap database. Using genomewide profiling of TF and CBP occupancy, the authors provide evidence that CRYBMIM treatment reprograms the interactome of MYB in a manner that disproportionately changes specific cis-elements over others. Stated differently, the overall occupancy pattern of many TFs/cofactors shows gains and losses at specific cis elements, resulting in a complex modulation of MYB function and changes in transcription in leukemia cells.</p><p>Overall, this is a strong, well-written study, with clear experimental results and relatively straightforward conclusions. The therapeutic potential of modulating MYB in cancer is enormous, and hence I believe this study will attract a broad interest in the cancer field and will likely be highly cited. I list below a few control experiments that would clarify the specificity of CRYBMIM.</p><p>1) Does CRYBMIM bind to other KIX domains, such as of MED15. It would be important to evaluate the specificity of this peptide for whether it binds to other KIX domains.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed all known human KIX domain sequences, and found that the most similar one to CBP/P300 is MED15 (38% identity), as shown in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1D. The sequence similarity of the remaining human KIX domains is substantially lower. To determine the specificity of CRYBMIM in binding the CBP/P300 versus MED15, we exposed human AML cell extracts to biotinylated CRYBMIM immobilized on streptavidin beads versus beads alone. Whereas CRYBMIM binds efficiently to CBP/P300, it does not exhibit any measurable binding to MED15 (even though MED15 is highly expressed), as shown in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1E. While this does not exclude the possibility that CRYBMIM binds to other proteins, the biochemical specificity observed here, combined with the genetic requirement of CBP for cellular effects of CRYBMIM as shown by a genome-wide CRISPR screen (Figure 1B), indicate that CRYBMIM is a specific ligand of CBP/P300. The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, it would be useful to perform a mass spec analysis to all nuclear factors that associate with streptavidin-immobilized CRYBMIM. This again would be help the reader to understand the specificity of this peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that macromolecular ligands like CRYBMIM may interact with cellular proteins in complex ways. To define specific effects, we utilized four orthogonal strategies, explained below.</p><p>First, we purified the CBP-containing nuclear complex using immunoprecipitation and determined its composition by mass spectrometry proteomics. This analysis revealed 833 proteins that are specifically associated with CBP (revised Supplementary file 3). Although technically feasible, the fact that CBP is associated with hundreds of proteins would make the experiment suggested by the reviewer difficult to interpret, because it would be a major challenge to distinguish proteins bound directly by the peptide versus proteins purified indirectly by virtue of the fact that CRYBMIM binds to CBP/P300, which in turn binds to many other proteins. While we recently developed improved methods for cross-linking mass spectrometry proteomics that permit the identification of direct protein-protein interactions (Ser, Cifani, Kentsis 2019, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00085), we believe that these experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, which already includes 40 new figure panels as part of this revision.</p><p>In lieu of this experiment, we purified the CBP-containing nuclear complex after treatment with CRYBMIM or control using immunoprecipitation and determined its composition by targeting Western blotting. This analysis revealed RUNX1, LYL1 and SATB1 are specifically associated with CBP (revised Figure 12B), among which RUNX1 is specifically remodeled in the MYB:CBP/P300 complex upon CRYBMIM binding. This transcriptional factor recruitment and remodeling support the idea of CRYBMIM’s specificity for the MYB:CBP/P300 complex.</p><p>Second, to define the specificity of CRYBMIM, we used glycine mutants of CRYBMIM and its parent MYBMIM, CG3 and TG3, respectively, in which residues that form key salt bridge and hydrophobic interactions with KIX are replaced with glycines, but otherwise retain all other features of the active probes. Both CG3 and TG3 exhibit significantly reduced effects on the viability of AML cell lines, consistent with the specific effects of CRYBMIM (Figure 3D).</p><p>To confirm that this is due to CBP binding, we purified cellular CBP/P300 by binding to biotinylated CRYBMIM, and observed that it can be efficiently competed by excess of free CRYBMIM, but not TAT (Figure 2E).</p><p>Finally, to establish definitively that cellular CBP is responsible for CRYBMIM effects, we generated isogenic cell lines that are either deficient or proficient for CBP using CRISPR genome editing. This experiment demonstrated that CBP deficiency confers significant resistance to CRYBMIM, indicating that CBP is required for CRYBMIM mediated effects (revised Figure 4). We revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The major limitation of this study which modestly lessens my enthusiasm of this work is that the mechanistic model of MYB-sequestered TFs proposed here is based on a face-value interpretation of IP-MS data coupled with ChIP-seq data. Normally, I would expect such a mechanism to be supported with some additional focused biochemical experiments of specific interactions, to complement all of the omics approaches. For example, can the authors evaluate and/or validate further how MYB physically interacts with LYL1, CEBPA, SPI1, or RUNX1. Are these interactions direct or indirect? Which domains of these proteins are involved? Does CRYBMIM treatment modulate the ability of these proteins to associate with one another in a coIP? Do these interactions occur in normal hematopoietic cells? A claim is made throughout this study that these are aberrant TF complexes, but I believe more evidence is required to support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and totally agree with this point. To examine how MYB aberrantly assembles transcription factors in AML, we performed MYB co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a panel of seven genetically diverse AML cell lines with varying susceptibility to CRYBMIM, chosen to represent the common and refractory forms of human AML. Here, we confirmed co-assembly of CBP/P300, LYL1, E2A, LMO2 in all AML cell lines tested, and cell type-specific co-assembly of SATB1 and CEBPA, as shown in revised Figure 8A, which are in agreement with the IP-MS and ChIP-seq results. We further corroborated these findings by co-IP studies of CBP/P300, as shown in the revised Figure 8B. We performed similar co-IP experiments in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and found most of the co-assembled factors in AML cells were not observed in normal cells except for CBP/P300 and LYL1, as shown in the revised Figure 9E. Combined with the apparently aberrant expression of E2A and SATB1 in AML cells but not normal blood cells, this leads us to conclude that MYB assembles aberrant transcription factor complexes in AML cells. These complexes can be remodeled by peptidomimetic inhibitors, leading to their redistribution on chromatin, suppression of oncogenic gene expression and induction of cellular differentiation. We confirmed this mechanism by direct biochemical experiments in AML cells, demonstrating disassembly and remodeling of CBP/P300 complexes, as shown in the revised Figure 12. At least some of these interactions are direct, given the known direct binding between MYB and CEBPA (Oelgeschläger, Nuchprayoon, Lüscher, Friedman 1996, https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.16.9.4717). We revised the manuscript text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Overall, this is a strong, well-written study, with clear experimental results and relatively straightforward conclusions. The therapeutic potential of modulating MYB in cancer is enormous, and hence I believe this study will attract a broad interest in the cancer field and will likely be highly cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this sentiment and completely agree with the reviewer. The phenomenon reported in this work represents the first of its kind demonstration of the aberrant organization of transcription factor control complexes in cancer, and its pharmacologic modulation. We believe that this concept will serve as a transformative paradigm for understanding oncogenic gene control and the development of effective therapies for its definitive treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript reports the generation of a new and improved peptide mimetic inhibitor of the interaction between MYB and CBP/P300. The original MYBMIM inhibitor of this interaction, reported recently by the same laboratory, was modified by addition and substitution of peptide sequences from CREB, thus improving the affinity of the resulting CRYBMIM peptide to CBP/P300. The improved inhibitor profile results in increased anti-AML efficacy of CRYBMIM over MYBMIM. The authors go on to examine the mechanism underlying the anti-AML activity of CRYBMIM by integrating gene expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and mass spectrometric protein complex identification in human AML cells.</p><p>I have some minor questions the authors may wish to comment on:</p><p>1) The relocation of MYB, along with CBP/P300, to genes controlling myeloid differentiation (clusters 4 and 9) upon CRYBMIM treatment is reminiscent of the increased binding of MYB to myeloid pro-differentiation genes in AML cells following RUVBL2 silencing, recently reported in Armenteros-Monterroso et al., 2019. Do the authors know if there is any overlap between genes in either of the clusters and the list reported in the latter study?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this suggestion. We also observe both RUVBL2 and RUVBL1 in the protein complex specifically associated with MYB (Figure 7A and B). We compared the gene expression changes induced by CRYBMIM with those reported by Armenteros-Monterroso et al. in 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-0190495-8), and found that 37% of upregulated genes by RUVBL2 silencing were shared with genes induced by CRYBMIM treatment. In addition, upregulated genes in cluster 4 and 9 included myeloid differentiation-related genes, such as <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>FOSB,</italic> which were also induced RUVBL2 silencing. We revised the manuscript to reflect this association.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the authors comment on a possible mechanism to explain the co-localization of MYB and CBP/P300 to the loci in clusters 4 and 9 following CRYBMIM treatment? Is it possible that CBP/P300 is recruited by other transcription factors to these loci, independently of binding to MYB? Or is the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB at these loci somehow more resistant to disruption by CRYBMIM?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has focused on an interesting point. At least for cluster 9, these genes exhibit gain of CBP/P300 in association with RUNX1 (Figure 11A), which we confirm by direct biochemical studies of MYB and CBP/P300 complexes immunoprecipitated from AML cells (revised Figure 12B-C). These experiments show that CRYBMIM treatment disrupts the MYB:CBP/P300 complexes, leading to the increased assembly of CBP/P300 with RUNX1. These findings are consistent with a dynamic competition mechanism that governs availability of CBP/P300 to transcriptional coactivation, in which distinct transcription factors compete for limiting amounts of CBP/P300. This possible mechanism is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The text states: &quot;Previously, we found that MYBMIM can suppress MYB:CBP/P300-dependent gene expression, leading to AML cell apoptosis that required MYB-mediated suppression of BCL2 (Ramaswamy et al., 2018).&quot; I think this is a typo, since in this study, MYBMIM treatment results in loss of MYB binding to the BCL2 gene and consequent reduction in BCL2 expression. Do the authors mean “MYBMIM-mediated suppression of BCl2” or “loss of MYB-mediated activation of BCL2”?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and have corrected this typographic error in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors explain the failure of excess CREBMIM to displace CBP/P300 from immobilised CREBMIM (Figure 1E-F) by the nature of the CREB:CBP/P300 interaction. Does this imply that CREBMIM is unable to disrupt the interaction between CREB and CBP/P300 in living cells and that the CBP/P300 purified from native MV4;11 lysates by immobilised CREBMIM was from a pool not associated with CREB?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this point. Indeed, we reproducibly observe that CRYBMIM binding to CBP can be competed with excess free CRYBMIM, but CREBMIM binding cannot be completed by excess CREBMIM. This may be due to the different stabilities of the CBP complexes that are available for binding in cells. Alternatively, it is also possible that CREB binding to CBP, as reflected by CREBMIM, has a relatively slow dissociation rate, as compared to MYB, as reflected by CRYBMIM. We have begun to purify cellular CBP complexes (revised Figure 8 and response to comment 2 for reviewer 1), and aim to define their determinants in future studies, as enabled by the introduction of CRYBMIM, CREBMIM and MLLMIM probes in the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Based on this integrative analysis, the authors propose a convincing hypothesis, involving the assembly of aberrant transcription factor complexes and sequestration of P300/CBP from genes involved in normal myeloid development, for the oncogenic activity of MYB in AML. As well as the obvious therapeutic potential of the CRYBMIM inhibitor itself, the data reported here reveal multiple avenues for future investigation into novel anti-AML therapeutic strategies. This is an innovative and important study.</p><p>This study will be of interest to scientists and clinicians involved in leukaemia research as well as cancer biology in general.</p><p>My field of expertise: leukaemia biology, leukaemia models, aberrant transcription factor activity in leukaemia</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with this assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript describes an improved MYB-mimetic peptide (cf the group's earlier work published in Nature Communications, 2018) and its effects on AML cell lines. It also describes – and this constitutes the majority of the paper – the dynamics of chromatin occupancy by MYB and other associated transcription factors upon disruption of the MYB-CBP/P300 interaction. The authors suggest this represents a shift from an oncogenic program to a myeloid differentiation program.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Regarding the improved affinity, and biological activity, of CRYBMIM:</p><p>1) Improved affinity of CRYBMIM cf MYBMIM: clearly, it is improved, but not by a lot. By MST the increased affinity is about 3x. In terms of effects on AML cell viability: there is no direct comparison, and this should be included. In the group's previous paper there is no direct estimate for MYBMIM but it looks like the IC50 is between 10 and 20 μM so the effect is again around 2.5 fold. Also, the effects of the amino acid substitutions in CG3 are also very small (2.4x) given that 3 critical residues are altered. This is quite concerning.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, CRYBMIM exhibits several fold increase in binding affinity, as measured using purified proteins in vitro. Similar increase in cellular potency is observed after short-term treatment of AML cells, as shown in revised Figure 3C. However, increasing the duration of treatment to several days leads to substantial improvement in apparent cellular potency (Figure 3G). For example, while MYBMIM induces approximately 100-fold reduction in cell viability of MV411 cells, CRYBMIM induces more than 1,000-fold reduction. Similarly, whereas MYBMIM exhibited relatively modest effects on OCIAML3 and SKM1 cells, CRYBMIM induces more than 1,000-fold reduction in cell viability. As we show in the revised manuscript, this appears to be due to the combination of increased biochemical affinity and specific proteolysis of MYB, which cooperate to induce extensive remodeling of MYB transcriptional complexes and gene expression (revised Figure 10). In all, this exemplifies how pharmacologic modulators of protein interactions can achieve significantly improved biological potency from relatively modest affinity effects, a concept that recently has been successfully used to develop a variety of PROTACs that leverage this “event-driven” as opposed to occupancy-driven pharmacology. The manuscript has been revised to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does CRYBMIM really &quot;spare&quot; normal hematopoietic cells? Not according to Figure 2E, where there is only a 2-fold difference in IC50.</p></disp-quote><p>To better define the relative toxicity of CRYBMIM and MYBMIM, we examined their effects on the growth and survival of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells as compared to AML cells using colony forming assays in methylcellulose under more physiologic conditions in the presence of human hematopoietic cytokines (revised Figure 3E). While CRYBMIM significantly reduced the clonogenic capacity, growth and survival of MV411 AML cells, there were no significant effects on the total clonogenic activity of normal CD34+ human umbilical cord blood progenitor cells under these conditions. At the highest dose, CRYBMIM induced modest reduction in CFUMG colony formation, and modest increase in BFU-E colony formation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. We revised the manuscript to indicate that CRYBMIM “relatively spares” normal blood progenitor cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2E and Supp Figure S2 appear to be contradictory. The latter shows no effect of 20 μM CRYBMIM on colony formation by normal CD34+ cells, in complete contrast to killing with IC50 of 12.8 μM in Figure 2E. There is no +ve control for Figure S2 ie does the peptide work under colony assay conditions? This MUST be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the attention to this issue. In the original manuscript, we showed dose-response curves of cord blood progenitor cells cultured in suspension supplemented with fetal bovine serum, a system that is known to induce in appropriate hematopoietic cell differentiation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2017.07.003). In the revised manuscript, we show results of colony formation assays of hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured in serum-free, semi-solid conditions supplemented with human hematopoietic cytokines (revised Figure 3E and 3F). This is a more physiologic system which more faithfully maintains normal hematopoietic cell differentiation, as compared to the cellular differentiation induced by fetal bovine serum-containing media lacking hematopoietic growth factors, as used in the experiments in our original manuscript. To establish a positive control, in addition to treating AML cells under the same condition, we used doxorubicin, which is part of current treatment of patients with AML, and which in our experiments, exhibits significant and pronounced reduction in the clonogenic capacity, growth and survival of normal blood progenitor cells (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2F doesn't include any lines that express very low or undetectable levels of MYB. Some of these should be included to further examine specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested CRYBMIM against a large panel of non-hematopoietic tumor and non-tumor cell lines, with varying degrees of MYB expression. Some of those cells exhibit high level of MYB gene expression and MYB genetic dependency, which is at least in part correlated with susceptibility to CRYBMIM. (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Effects on gene expression and MYB binding:</p><p>Data on MYB target gene expression and apoptosis/differentiation, and the conclusions drawn per se are sound, but:</p><p>5) Figure S3 seems to show that MYB protein is lost on treatment with CRYBMIM. This isn't even mentioned in the text but raises a whole range of major questions eg why is this the case? Is this what is responsible for the loss of MYB-p300 interaction and/or biological effects on AML cells? Is this what is responsible for the effects on MYB target gene expression in Figure 3 and MYB binding to chromatin in Figure 4? This must be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to include this discussion, and performed additional experiments to define this phenomenon. We confirmed rapid reduction in MYB protein levels upon CRYBMIM treatment on the time-scale of one to four hours in diverse AML cell lines (revised Figure 10), with the rate of MYB protein loss correlating to the cellular susceptibility to CRYBMIM (revised Figure 10). The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><p>This is consistent with the specific proteolysis of MYB induced by the peptidomimetic remodeling of the MYB:CBP/P300 complex. We confirmed this by combined treatment with the proteosomal/protease inhibitor MG132 (revised Figure 10C). This effect was specific because overexpression of <italic>BCL2</italic>, which blocks MYBMIM-induced apoptosis (Ramaswamy et al., Kentsis, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02618-6), was unable to rescue CRYBMIM-induced proteolysis of MYB, arguing that MYB proteolysis is a specific effect of CRYBMIM rather than a non-specific consequence of apoptosis. The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4 and the accompanying text are a bit hard to follow, but if I understood them correctly, I am surprised that the &quot;gained MYB peaks&quot; don't include the MYB binding motif itself? This at least deserves some comment. Also, there doesn't seem to have been any attempt to integrate the ChIP-seq data with the expression data of Figure 3. This would provide clearer insights into the identities and types of MYB-regulated genes that are directly affected by suppression of CBP/p300 binding to MYB.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The revised manuscript now includes a comprehensive and integrated analysis of chromatin and gene expression dynamics. In contrast to the model in which blockade of MYB:CBP/P300 induces loss of gene expression and loss of transcription factor and CBP/P300 chromatin occupancy, we also observed a large number of genes with increased expression and gain of CBP/P300 occupancy (revised Figure 11—figure supplement 1A-B). This includes numerous genes that control hematopoietic differentiation, such as <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic>, and <italic>ATF3</italic>. As a representative example, in the case of <italic>FOS</italic>, we observed that CRYBMIM-induced accumulation of CBP/P300 was associated with increased binding of RUNX1, and eviction of CEBPA and LYL1.</p><p>Thus, the absence of “gained MYB peaks” is due to the redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors, such as RUNX1. In all, these results support the model in which the core regulatory circuitry of AML cells is organized aberrantly by MYB and its associated co-factors including LYL1, CEBPA, E2A, SATB1 and LMO2, which co-operate in the induction and maintenance of oncogenic gene expression, as co-opted by distinct oncogenes in biologically diverse subtypes of AML (revised Figure 12). This involves apparent sequestration of CBP/P300 from genes controlling myeloid cell differentiation. Thus, oncogenic gene expression is associated with the assembly of aberrantly organized MYB transcriptional co-activator complexes, and their dynamic remodeling by selective blockade of protein interactions can induce AML cell differentiation. The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The MS studies on MYB-interacting proteins seem very interesting and novel. I am not an expert on MS, though, so I'd suggest this section be reviewed by someone who is. Moreover, I was unable to see the actual data from this study because the material I was provided with didn't include Table S4 and S5.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point. For this reason, we have deposited all of our mass spectrometry data to be openly available via PRIDE (accession number PXD019708), and also openly provide all of the analyzed data via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo. 4321824), as additionally provided in the Supplementary Material for this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Should the authors qualify some of their claims as preliminary or speculative, or remove them altogether?</p><p>8) Claims regarding biological activity, specificity and improvements cf MYBMIM should be moderated given the small size of these effects as mentioned above (points 1 and 3).</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in detail in response to comments 1-3 above, we have substantially revised the manuscript to incorporate both new experimental results and additional explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I found the description of the studies related to Figures 5 and 6 somewhat difficult to follow and convoluted. While changes in MYB and CBP/p300 chromatin occupancy clearly occur on M CRYBMIM treatment, it is not clear that the complexes seen on genes prior to treatment represent &quot;aberrant&quot; complexes. These may just be characteristic of undifferentiated (myeloid) cells. The authors appear to argue that because some of the candidate co-factors show &quot;apparently aberrant expression in AML cells&quot; based on comparison of (presumably mRNA) expression data with normal cells, the presence of these factors in the complexes make them &quot;aberrant&quot; (moreover, the &quot;aberrancy score&quot; of Figure 5 C is not defined anywhere, as far as I can see). This inference is drawing a rather long bow, given that the AML-specific factors may not actually be absent from the complexes in normal cells. So this conclusion should be moderated if a more direct MS comparison cannot be provided (for which I understand the technical difficulties).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured protein abundance levels of key transcription factors assembled with MYB in AML cells in various normal human hematopoietic cells (revised Figure 9). We found that most transcription factors that are assembled with MYB in diverse AML cell lines could be detected in one or more normal human blood cells, albeit with variable abundance, with the exception of CEBPA and SATB1 that were measurably expressed exclusively in AML cells (revised Figure 9A). Using unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis, we defined the combinations of transcription factors that are associated with aberrant functions of MYB:CBP/P300, as defined by their susceptibility to peptidomimetic remodeling (revised Figure 9B-D). In addition, we directly examined the physical assembly of MYB with key transcription factors in normal hematopoietic cells using co-immunoprecipitation studies (revised Figure 9E). In agreement with the physical association of MYB seen in AML cell lines, we observed association with CBP/P300 and LYL1 in normal hematopoietic cells. However, we did not observe physical association with E2A and SATB1 in normal cells, which indicates aberrant association of these in AML cell lines. This leads us to propose that these complexes are aberrantly assembled, at least in part due to the inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. The manuscript has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would additional experiments be essential to support the claims of the paper?</p><p>10) Address the issue of the apparent loss of MYB protein upon CRYBMIM treatment. If this is occurring, the whole premise of the subsequent work is undermined.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in detail in response to comment 5 above, we have carried out extensive studies of the specific proteolysis of MYB. We conclude that MYB transcription complexes are regulated both by MYB:CBP/P300 binding and by specific factor proteolysis, and can be induced by its peptidomimetic blockade in AML cells. Such “event-driven” pharmacology is emerging as a powerful tool to modulate protein function in cells, and studies reported in our work should enable its translation into improved therapies for patients, and improved probes for basic science.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Provision of a positive control for the experiment of Figure S2.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in detail in response to comment 2 above, we precisely defined the effects of CRYBMIM and MYBMIM on the clonogenic capacity, growth and survival of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in serum-free, methylcellulose media supplemented with human hematopoietic cytokines. These experiments showed relatively modest effects (9.3 ± 3.8% reduction) of CRYBMIM on normal cells (Figure 3E), as compared to substantial inhibition (54 ± 2.4 % reduction) of the growth and survival of AML cells (Figures 3E). For comparison, doxorubicin led to more than 98 % reduction in clonogenic capacity (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Are the data and the methods presented in such a way that they can be reproduced?</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes a complete description of all methods, including a detailed supplement, listing technical details, with all analyzed data available via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4321824).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Are the experiments adequately replicated and statistical analysis adequate?</p></disp-quote><p>All experiments were performed in at least three replicates, with all quantitative comparisons performed using appropriate statistical tests, as explained in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Specific experimental issues that are easily addressable.</p><p>These are mostly indicated above.</p><p>In addition:</p><p>14) Why is BCL2 expression down-regulated by MYBMIM but not CRYMYB?</p></disp-quote><p>We made the same observation, and attribute this difference to the fact that <italic>BCL2</italic> expression is regulated by several transcription factors, including CEBPA, which is affected by CRYBMIM but not MYBMIM.

The term &quot;therapeutic&quot;, is not appropriate because no therapeutic agents are described in the manuscript nor is any form of AML, even experimentally, treated. Also &quot;CBP&quot; should be replaced with CBP/P300, especially since most evidence suggests that P300 is the likely more important partner of MYB (eg Zhao et al., 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the title to clarify the significance of this work: “Convergent organization of aberrant MYB complexes controls oncogenic gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia.” We have revised the manuscript to indicate CBP/P300.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) It would be worth discussing the core observation that disruption of the MYB-CBP/P300 interaction actually results in changes in MYB DNA binding. That this would occur is not at all obvious, because CBP/p300 doesn't interact with MYB's DNA binding domain nor does it have intrinsic DNA binding activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and agree that remodeling of the MYB complex must affect the binding of MYB and other cofactors to DNA, at least in part mediated by potential acetylation by CBP/P300.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The Nature and Significance of the Advance</p><p>1) The major significance of this work lies in the chromatin occupancy and MYB complex studies. There are a number of very interesting findings including the apparent redistribution of MYB and/or CBP/P300 upon treatment with CRYBMIM. These suggest a series of changes in factors associated with particular gene sets involved in myeloid differentiation, although as mentioned above particular target genes are not specifically identified. However the pathways corresponding to these are listed in Table S6.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to include the target genes in revised Supplementary file 2 as well as DESeq2 tables (deposited in Zenodo, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4321824).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The new peptide design (CRYBMIM) is interesting but its differences in binding and biological effects of MYBMIM are mostly incremental. See above.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree and would like to explain how this work is significant both for conceptual and technical reasons. First, while the biochemical affinity of CRYBMIM is quantitatively increased compared with MYBMIM, this quantitatively increased affinity translates into qualitatively improved biological potency, as a result of “event-driven” pharmacology that characterizes pharmacologic protein interaction modulators (please also see response to reviewer 3, comment 1). MYBMIM suppresses the growth and survival mostly of MLL-rearranged leukemias, whereas CRYBMIM does so for the vast majority (10 out of 11) of studied subtypes of AML. This now enables its therapeutic translation, as we are currently pursuing in collaboration with Novartis. Second, its improved biological activity led to the discovery of the previously unknown and unanticipated CBP/P300 sequestration mechanism of oncogenic gene control. We use this discovery to develop a precise model of aberrant gene control in AML that for the first time unifies previously disparate observations into a general mechanism. This is highly significant because it provides shared molecular dependencies for most subtypes of AML, a long-standing conundrum in cancer biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Place the work in the context of the existing literature (provide references, where appropriate).</p><p>– This manuscript builds on and extends the report from the same group in Nature Communications (2018), which described the earlier peptide MYBMIM, some effects on MYB target genes and on AML cells. It and the previous paper also draw on the findings regarding the role of the MYBCBP/P300 interaction in myeloid leukemogenesis (Pattabirman et al., 2014) and on previous genome-wide studies of MYB target genes (Zhoa et al., 2011; Zuber et al., 2011).</p><p>State what audience might be interested in and influenced by the reported findings.</p><p>– This manuscript will likely be of interest to scientists interested in MYB per se, in AML, in cancer genomics and transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Define your field of expertise with a few keywords to help the authors contextualize your point of view.

The evidence for a MYB-CEBPA interaction is thus very tenuous. The authors should address this issue either by tempering their claims or providing more convincing evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. The mass spectrometry data shows high abundance and high confidence identification of several C/EBP family members, including CEBPA itself. However, as pointed out, CEBPA associates with the MYB complex as measured by Western blots largely in OCIAML2 cells. Thus, we have revised the manuscript throughout to replace CEBPA with “variable C/EBP family member(s),” and tempered all relevant claims accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear why CRISPR inactivation of CBP shown in Figure 4 can have such minor effects, considering that the main message of the paper is that MYB-CBP interactions are critical for activating the genes required for growth of the leukemic cells. The authors have to provide a clear explanation of this apparent discrepancy. Related to this is an important comment of reviewer 3 from Review Commons that the peptide inhibitor induced MYB degradation that is clearly seen after 4 hours of treatment in Figure 11C. Given this observation, how can the authors explain the gained MYB peaks in the ChIP-seq. The authors have not correctly addressed this issue. It is of course reasonable to imagine that MYB stability depends upon its interactions with CBP and that when this is blocked by the peptide MYB is degraded. But if this is the case why does CRIPSR inactivation of CPB not induce the same effects. In fact, the stability of MYB in the CBP KO cells should be investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a simple and effective experiment, and we thank you for suggesting it. Steadystate levels of MYB protein do not appear to change significantly upon depletion of CBP in MV411 AML cells, as compared to wild‐type cells or control cells targeted with CRISPR to <italic>AAVS1</italic>.</p><p>This suggests that either P300 can compensate for CBP‐mediated functions, and/or MYB proteolysis is not regulated solely by its interaction with CBP/P300, but requires specific activity of CBP/P300 induced by CRYBMIM. We have included this result in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the case of chromatin association of MYB upon CRYBMIM treatment as measured by ChIP‐seq, they can be explained by residual MYB protein upon CRYBMIM‐induced proteolysis. This may be due to protection of chromatin‐bound MYB from proteolysis, or alternatively by signal normalization, required for ChIP‐seq analysis. MYB‐binding loci lost upon CRYBMIM treatment showed significant enrichment for known MYB binding motifs, while gained MYB peaks did not (p = 1e‐149 vs 1e‐3, 56 % vs 5.7 % of target sites, respectively). This raises the possibility that DNA binding affinity of MYB could be regulated by CBP/P300, either by direct effects such as MYB deacetylation upon CRYBMIM treatment, or indirectly via binding with other transcription factors. Absolute quantitative measurements, using spike‐in controls, will be needed to define this precisely in future studies. We have revised the manuscript to clarify these points (Figure 6‐figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
