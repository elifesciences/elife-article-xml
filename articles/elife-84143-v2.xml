perturb intracellular protein activities. We previously developed a light-sensitive variant of the microtubule plus end-tracking protein EB1 by inserting a blue light-controlled protein dimerization module between functional domains. Here, we describe an advanced method to replace endogenous EB1 with this light-sensitive variant in a single genome editing step, thereby enabling this approach in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and hiPSC-derived neurons. We demonstrate that acute and local optogenetic EB1 inactivation in developing cortical neurons induces microtubule depolymerization in the growth cone periphery and subsequent neurite retraction. In addition, advancing growth cones are repelled from areas of blue light exposure. These phenotypes were independent of the neuronal EB1 homolog EB3, revealing a direct dynamic role of EB1-mediated microtubule plus end interactions in neuron morphogenesis and neurite guidance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>EB1</kwd><kwd>neuron morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 CA224194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittmann</surname><given-names>Torsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS107480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittmann</surname><given-names>Torsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 RR026758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittmann</surname><given-names>Torsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD028611</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittmann</surname><given-names>Torsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome editing to insert a light-sensitive dimerization module directly into the EB1 microtubule plus end adaptor gene in human induced pluripotent stem cells enables local and acute optogenetic EB1 inactivation highlighting microtubule functions in developing neuronal growth cones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are essential components of the cytoskeleton in both mature neurons, in which polarized MT tracks support axonal transport, as well as during nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van de Willige et al., 2016</xref>). During neuronal differentiation, the expression of many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) is upregulated, and numerous neurodevelopmental diseases are being linked to genetic alterations in MAPs, MT motors, and tubulin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franker and Hoogenraad, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maillard et al., 2023</xref>). Developing neurites must elongate over long distances integrating extrinsic cues to achieve correct nervous system topology. Neurite growth and pathfinding are driven by adhesion and F-actin dynamics in the growth cone, the advancing terminal structure of growing neurites. Analogous to the role of MTs in migrating cells, dynamic MTs enter the F-actin rich growth cone periphery and these so-called ‘pioneer’ MTs participate in growth cone advance and guidance downstream of extracellular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu and Dwyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vitriol and Zheng, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Proteins that associate with growing MT plus ends (+TIPs), such as spectraplakins (MACF1), the adenomatous polyposis coli protein APC, CLASPs, and neuron navigator proteins (Nav1), play critical roles in neuron morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cammarata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coles and Bradke, 2015</xref>). For example, Nav1 mediates interactions between dynamic MT plus ends and F-actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sánchez-Huertas et al., 2020</xref>) and CLASPs are involved in cell-matrix adhesion site remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). These +TIPs bind to growing MT plus ends through small adaptor proteins of the end-binding (EB) family. In humans, EBs are encoded by three MAPRE genes, and although EB1 is the best characterized +TIP adaptor, it remains unclear to what extent EB functions overlap. For example, EB3, which is upregulated in neurons and other differentiated cell types, coordinates MT and F-actin dynamics in developing neurons independent of EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon-Weeks, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of EB1-dependent+TIPs in neuron morphogenesis is inferred mostly from genetic knockout phenotypes in model systems from different species. It has not been tested how +TIP association with growing MT ends participates in controlling growth cone dynamics in real time in developing human neurons in part due to an absence of technology to acutely inhibit these interactions. Here, we utilize our recent optogenetic tool to disrupt EB1 function and thus +TIP MT-binding in growth cones of hiPSC-derived developing cortical neurons. In addition to demonstrating a novel strategy to generate photosensitive variants of multidomain proteins in a single genome editing step, we show that EB1 is necessary to stabilize MTs in the growth cone periphery and to maintain growth cone advance, and that this function of EB1 cannot be compensated by EB3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>One-step genome editing to generate photosensitive protein variants</title><p>We recently reported an optogenetic system to inactivate end-binding protein 1 (EB1) with high spatial and temporal accuracy in living cells by inserting a light-sensitive LOV2/Zdk1 dimerization module between the N-terminal +TIP and C-terminal MT-binding domains of EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, our initial method of generating π-EB1 cell lines required sequential genetic knockouts and re-expression of photosensitive EB1 variants. To enable and demonstrate the utility of this LOV2/Zdk1-mediated multidomain splitting strategy to photo-inactivate proteins expressed at endogenous levels in more complex cell systems such as an hiPSC model of neuronal morphogenesis, we devised a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing strategy to directly insert the LOV2/Zdk1 dimerization module into the EB1 gene and thus convert endogenous EB1 into the photosensitive π-EB1 variant in one genome editing step.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>One-step genome editing to replace EB1 with a photo-sensitive variant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AlphaFold2 model of the π-EB1 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>).

In contrast, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) resulted in very poor expression of the C-terminal half. Of note, self-cleaving 2 A peptides also did not work because the C-terminus of the LOV2 domain cannot be modified without greatly inhibiting Zdk1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We next tested π-element integration in i<sup>3</sup>N cells, an hiPSC line that expresses Ngn2 under the control of a doxycycline-induced promoter to allow inducible differentiation into cortical glutamatergic i<sup>3</sup>Neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Homozygous π-element integration into both copies of exon 5 of the endogenous MAPRE1 (EB1) gene was validated by genomic PCR, sequencing, and immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Because the N-terminal π-EB1 half is expressed from the endogenous EB1 promoter, compared with EB1 in control cells, EB1N-LOV2 expression levels were similar and only mildly reduced in both i<sup>3</sup>N hiPSCs and i<sup>3</sup>Neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). In contrast, expression of Zdk1-EB1C that is driven by the EF1α promoter was markedly increased in i<sup>3</sup>N hiPSCs but was lower in i<sup>3</sup>Neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates a change in the activity balance of these two promoters during i<sup>3</sup>N neuronal differentiation and suggests that the π-element design could be improved by also using the native promotor to drive expression of the C-terminal half. However, we did not try this, because proliferation, stem cell properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and most importantly differentiation into i<sup>3</sup>Neurons appeared normal as indicated by expected changes in expression levels of marker proteins such as EB3, DCX, and KIF2C that increase or decrease, respectively, during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blair et al., 2017</xref>). Because EB1 and EB3 are very similar and may be at least partially functionally redundant, we also removed EB3 expression by introducing a frameshift and premature stop codon near the start of the EB3 open reading frame in π-EB1 i<sup>3</sup>N hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) to be able to ask how EB1 contributes to neuron morphogenesis and compare the relative contributions of EB1 and EB3.</p><p>To visualize π-EB1 photodissociation in genome-edited i<sup>3</sup>N cells, we chose to tag the π-EB1 C-terminal part with EGFP so that longer wavelength imaging channels remain available.

Because we were unable to reliably transfect differentiating i<sup>3</sup>Neurons, we instead used new fluorogenic taxane derivatives as live MT labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucevičius et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lukinavičius et al., 2014</xref>) at very low concentrations to analyze length changes of growth cone MTs that were visible both before and during blue light exposure of the entire growth cone. In control i<sup>3</sup>Neuron growth cones, MTs dynamically extended from the central domain into the growth cone periphery and the average length of these MTs was not affected by blue light. In contrast, in π-EB1 i<sup>3</sup>Neurons MTs in the growth cone periphery frequently shortened in response to blue light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). While π-EB1 photoinactivation-induced MT shortening was most pronounced in π-EB1 EB3-/- i<sup>3</sup>Neurons, MTs also shortened in π-EB1 i<sup>3</sup>Neurons that still expressed EB3 and in both cases the relative MT length after 20 s of blue light was significantly reduced compared with control i<sup>3</sup>Neurons (p&lt;0.001 by ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer HSD).</p><p>Although taxane-based probes label growing MT ends more dimly than the rest of the MT possibly due to slow redistribution kinetics on MTs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ettinger et al., 2016</xref>), we were able to measure growth cone MT polymerization rates during blue light exposure by manual tracking MT length changes. Even though MT growth rates in neurons are lower compared with other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>), it is important to note that absolute MT growth rates in this experiment are further underestimated because of the reduced temporal resolution compared with EB1 tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gierke et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, compared with control i<sup>3</sup>Neurons, after 1 min of blue light exposure, growth cone MT growth rates in both π-EB1 lines were reduced at least fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Thus, taken together these data show that EB1-mediated MT end interactions are required to stabilize and sustain net growth cone MT growth. In addition, our results indicate that endogenous EB3 cannot compensate for the acute loss of EB1 function in i<sup>3</sup>Neuron growth cones. Because we previously observed that π-EB1 photoinactivation can partially displace EB3 from growing MT ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Haren et al., 2018</xref>), we cannot completely exclude a dominant negative effect of π-EB1 photoinactivation on EB3. However, because the EB1N-LOV2 expression level in i<sup>3</sup>Neurons is below that of EB1 in control cells, EB1N-LOV2 likely does not interfere with EB3 binding to MTs by direct competition for binding sites. Our findings are however consistent with not fully understood functional differences between EB1 and EB3 in developing neurons that relate both to their binding sites on MT ends as well as differences in interaction partners. Specifically, EB3 trails behind EB1 on growing MT ends and only EB3 binds to the F-actin regulator drebrin possibly coordinating F-actin and MT dynamics independently of directly controlling MT growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poobalasingam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roth et al., 2018</xref>).

MT growth is thought to activate Rac1 which drives leading-edge actin polymerization, while MT shortening activates RhoA that increases actomyosin contractility through the release of regulatory MT-bound factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcin and Straube, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wittmann and Waterman-Storer, 2001</xref>). To investigate growth cone F-actin dynamics in response to π-EB1 photodissociation-mediated growth cone MT shortening, we used SPY650-FastAct, a fluorogenic jasplakinolide derivative that binds strongly to F-actin filaments and at very low concentrations forms fluorescent speckles that serve as reporters of F-actin flow dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danuser and Waterman-Storer, 2006</xref>).

Because retrograde F-actin flow is directly related to the rate of leading-edge actin polymerization, this indicates that EB1-mediated MT growth or +TIP interactions do not immediately influence growth cone actin polymerization dynamics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>F-actin dynamics in π-EB1 neuron growth cones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth cones of control and π-EB1 EB3-/- i<sup>3</sup>Neurons labeled with SPY650-FastAct before and during blue light exposure.

However, this experiment was technically very challenging.

It is important to note that the π-element only needs to contain ORFs encoding LOV2 and Zdk1 and the required regulatory elements, while the flanking homology arms direct it to the correct genomic locus. The rest of the protein of interest remains encoded by the endogenous gene. Here, we also include a fluorescent protein tag to monitor π-EB1 photodissociation and a leucine zipper coiled-coil to retain dimerization of the π-EB1 N-terminal half during blue light exposure. While we demonstrate the utility of this approach for the MAPRE1 gene in hiPSCs, we believe that a similar strategy could be adapted to many other multidomain proteins supplementing the optogenetic toolbox to investigate localized protein functions in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wittmann et al., 2020</xref>), but it should be noted that photodissociation kinetics may be different with monomeric proteins. The LOV2/Zdk1 module interacts in the dark, which is opposite to all other optogenetic dimerization modules and therefore, enables an unperturbed dark state and acute functional knockout of a given protein activity through blue light exposure. Thus, replacing an endogenous protein with a photosensitive variant in a single genome editing step as presented here has important advantages by allowing modification of proteins for which genetic knockouts might be lethal and further enabling optogenetics in complex cell systems that are not amenable to transient genetic manipulations.</p><p>This approach allowed us to directly demonstrate that EB1 in developing human cortical neurons is required for sustained growth cone MT growth and growth cone advance. Although we do not completely dissect the molecular mechanism underlying the π-EB1 photodissociation-mediated neurite retraction response, unchanged F-actin polymerization dynamics during blue light indicate that retraction likely results from a loss of growth cone adhesion or an increase in neurite actomyosin contractility consistent with MT-shortening induced RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joo and Olson, 2021</xref>). An increase in neurite contractility that does not remain localized to the region of blue light exposure may also explain our difficulty in using π-EB1 photodissociation to control growth cone guidance more precisely. Thus, although other optogenetic tools that provide attractive stimuli could be a promising avenue to control growth cone guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2020</xref>), inhibitory stimuli that induce MT depolymerization may be too difficult to control to be practically useful in synthetic biology approaches building defined neuron networks. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see how π-EB1 in i<sup>3</sup>Neurons or other types of neurons can be used to analyze how MTs and +TIPs contribute dynamically to other aspects of neuron morphogenesis such as branching, dendritic spine dynamics or synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaworski et al.,

pEB1N-LZ-LOV2-IRES-mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C was cloned as follows: EB1N-LZ-LOV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wittmann and van Haren, 2018</xref>) (Addgene plasmid 107614) and EMCV IRES (from MSCV-PIG; Addgene plasmid 18751) were amplified by PCR, connected by overlap extension PCR, and ligated into the NheI site of pmCherry-Zdk1-EB1C (Addgene plasmid 107695).</p><p>2. pUC19-π-EB1_IRES-mCherry (LZ-LOV2-IRES-mCherry-Zdk1) containing the homology-directed repair (HDR) template for targeting the IRES containing a version of the π-element into exon 5 of MAPRE1/EB1 was cloned as follows: &gt;1.5 kb 5’and 3’ homology arms were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from one 6 cm dish of immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1 cells, ATCC) using a Purelink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher). The π-element was PCR amplified from plasmid #1. Homology arms and π-element sequences were cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC19 by Gibson assembly in a single step. Several silent mutations were introduced to ensure that the HDR template could not be targeted by the gRNAs.</p><p>3. pUC19-sv40-blastR-EF1α-mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C was generated by Gibson assembly of PCR amplified SV40promoter-BlasticidinR, SV40polyA, EF1alpha promoter (from a PiggyBac vector) and mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C-polyA (from pmCherry-Zdk1-EB1C) into HinDIII and EcoRI sites of pUC19.</p><p>4. pEB1N-LZ-LOV2-polyA-EF1alpha-mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C was generated by Gibson assembly of PCR amplified polyA-EF1alpha-mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C from plasmid #3 into the BamHI site of pEB1N-LZ-LOV2.</p><p>5. pUC19-π-EB1_EF1alpha-mCherry (LZ-LOV2-polyA-EF1α-mCherry-Zdk1) containing the HDR template for targeting the π-element to exon 5 of MAPRE1/EB1 was cloned by Gibson assembly of PCR amplified homology arms and π-element into the EcoRI site of pUC19 using the same primers as for the IRES plasmid (#2).</p><p>6. For generating π-EB1 knock-in hiPSCs an EGFP-tagged variant of the π-element was used. pUC19-π-EB1_EF1α-EGFP was generated by replacing mCherry in plasmid #5 with EGFP by Gibson assembly of PCR-amplified EGFP into the NcoI sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>Guide RNAs</title><p>7. pSpCas9(BB)–2A-GFP was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid 48138). pSpCas9(BB)–2A-mCherry was constructed by replacing GFP with mCherry. T2A-mCherry was PCR amplified and inserted into the EcoRI sites by Gibson assembly.</p><p>8. Three gRNA sequences that target &lt;25 bp from the integration site in exon 5 of MAPRE1/EB1 were cloned into the BbsI sites of pSpCas9(BB)–2A-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wittmann and van Haren, 2018</xref>) to knock in the π-element into the EB1 gene.</p><p>9. Similarly, three gRNA sequences targeting exon 1 of MAPRE3 were cloned into the BbsI sites of pSpCas9(BB)–2A-GFP and pSpCas9(BB)–2A-mCherry to generate EB3 knockout lines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-3"><title>Other DNA constructs</title><p>10. EB1N-mScarlet-I-LZ-LOV2 and EB1N-mApple-LZ-LOV2 were cloned by inserting PCR amplified mScarlet-I/mApple and LZ-LOV2 into the XhoI and BamHI sites of EB1-GFP-LOV2 by Gibson assembly. While the original EB1N-mCherry-LZ-LOV2 fusion construct did not perform well in iPSC-derived neurons (and showed striking aggregation), the mScarlet and mApple fusions showed the expected localization pattern at MT plus-ends. The two resulting PCR products were inserted into the XhoI/BamHI sites of plasmid EB1N-GFP-LOV2. mScarlet-I was PCR amplified using a mRuby2 forward oligo, which resulted in a slightly altered mScarlet-I N-terminus (MVSKGEEL instead of MVSKGEAV).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>H1299 human small lung cancer cells were authenticated by STR profiling. i<sup>3</sup>N hiPSCs are derived from the WTC11 human induced pluripotent stem cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

The medium was changed every 24 hr for 3 days of culture.</p><p>For imaging-directed differentiation, 20 mm glass-bottom dishes (P35G-1.5–20 C, Mattek) were surface-activated for 1–2 min in a Harrick Expanded Plasma Cleaner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dema et al., 2022a</xref>) set on ‘High’ and coated with 50 µg/ml poly-D-lysine (PDL, A-003-E, Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C, washed extensively in PBS, then coated with 1.5 µg/ml murine laminin in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. After a further PBS wash, 2×10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> pre-differentiated i<sup>3</sup>N cells from the Accutase-dissociated cell pellet were seeded in Maturation Medium (MM), consisting of 50% Neurobasal (12349015, Life Technologies) and 50% DMEM/F12 (21041025, Life Technologies) supplemented with 1 x NEAA, 0.5 x GlutaMAX (35050061, Life Technologies), 1x N2 supplement, 1 x B27 supplement (17504044, Life Technologies), 2 µg/ml doxycycline, 10 ng/ml NT-3, 10 ng/ml BDNF and 0.3 µg/ml murine laminin.

H1299 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in a 10 cm dish at ~75% confluency and 2–3 days later mCherry-positive cells (indicating π-element integration) were FACS sorted into 96-well plates for expansion and further analysis.</p><p>For generating i<sup>3</sup>N π-element lines, both the π-element and gRNA plasmids carried EGFP markers. Thus, cells were FACS sorted 6 days after transfection when we expected that most cells had lost transient expression from the gRNA plasmids. EGFP-positive i<sup>3</sup>N cells were then plated at low density (~3000 cells) in 6 cm Matrigel-coated dishes and cultured in mTeSR with ROCK inhibitor as described above. After 7–10 days, clonal colonies typically had grown enough to be seen by the naked eye. Up to 96 colonies from each dish were manually picked and expanded.</p><p>Initial screening for positive clones in both H1299 and i<sup>3</sup>N cells was by spinning disk confocal microscopy because clones in which fluorescent signal was present on MT plus ends in the absence of blue light must have correctly integrated the π-element such that both halves are expressed as the N-terminal half (π-EB1N) expressed from the endogenous promoter is needed to target EGFP-tagged π-EB1C to MT plus ends. Together with wild-type controls, such clones were further analyzed by genomic PCR with primer sets that bind inside and outside the π-element sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Genomic DNA was isolated using a Purelink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher). Expected PCR products for EGFP EF1α π-element: primer pair 11 a/11b, WT: 189 bp, π-element integration: 3058 bp; 11 c/11b, WT: 1628 bp; π-element integration: 4506 bp; 11e/11 f, WT: no product, π-element integration: 2152 bp.</p><p>For the MAPRE3/EB3 knockout in π-element i<sup>3</sup>N cells, gRNAs were cloned into a mCherry version of the Cas9 plasmid, and transfected cells FACS-sorted for mCherry expression, plated at low density, and clones expanded as described above. Initial positive clones identified by band shift in genomic PCR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for primer sequences) were further analyzed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicon and analyzed by ICE (Synthego Performance Analysis, ICE Analysis. 2019. v3.0. Synthego). Pre-mixed prime-time qPCR primers were from IDT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Live microscopy and π-EB1 photoinactivation</title><p>i<sup>3</sup>Neuron imaging experiments were performed 1–3 days after replating on laminin-coated glass-bottom dishes. At later times i<sup>3</sup>Neurons form intricate networks and it becomes increasingly difficult to locate individual growth cones. SPY555-tubulin and SPY650-FastAct (Spyrochrome) were added to i<sup>3</sup>Neurons at a 1:2000 and 1:3000 dilution, respectively, and 4–610 CP-CTX was added at 5 nM for at least 30 min before imaging, and cells were discarded after a maximum of 3 hr.</p><p>Live microscopy was performed either with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stehbens et al., 2012</xref>) or, for most i<sup>3</sup>Neuron microscopy, with a CFI Apochromat TIRF 60 X NA 1.49 objective (Nikon) on a Yokogawa CSU-W1/SoRa spinning disk confocal system, and images acquired with an ORCA Fusion BT sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu). For high-resolution imaging of dim signal, SoRa mode was combined with 2x2 camera binning resulting in an image pixel size of 54 nm. This system was equipped with a Polygon 1000 pattern illuminator (Mightex) through an auxiliary filter turret and LAPP illuminator (Nikon). Integrated control of imaging and photoinactivation was through NIS Elements v5.3 software (Nikon), in combination with an external pulse generator to trigger the 470 nm photoinactivation LED (Spectra X light engine, Lumencor) for 10 ms pulses at 2 Hz at 5–10% LED power. π-EB1 photoinactivation was confirmed by dissociation of the C-terminal half from growing MT ends. The Polygon was calibrated with a mirror slide before every imaging session, and local light exposure was further verified by imaging the back reflection from the specimen coverslip.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Image analysis and statistics</title><p>MT growth rate analysis in i<sup>3</sup>N hiPSCs was as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Haren et al., 2018</xref>). MT ends in SPY555-tubulin labeled i<sup>3</sup>Neurons as well as neurite length changes were tracked manually using the ‘Segmented Line’ tool of FiJi.

end-binding protein, EB1. This important study replaces endogenous EB1 with a light-sensitive variant, which they use to locally inactivate EB1 in human iPSC-derived neurons. They find that EB1 inactivation induces microtubule depolymerization in the growth cone and neurite retraction. The data is of high quality, the evidence supporting the conclusions is solid, and the findings of this work will be of interest to cell biologists and neurobiologists, while the methods utilized will have even broader general interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84143.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ori-McKenney</surname><given-names>Kassandra M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lowery</surname><given-names>Laura Anne</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02n2fzt79</institution-id><institution>Boston College</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Feng-Quan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00a2xv884</institution-id><institution>Zhejiang University</institution></institution-wrap><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.22.509085">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.22.509085v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Laura Anne Lowery (Reviewer #1); Feng-Quan Zhou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Every reviewer agreed that this new methodology is compelling, but that the functional analysis required additional controls to strengthen the study. Specifically, the authors need to perform controls for Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5. Please refer to the comments by Reviewers #1 and #3 for specific suggestions. In addition, please be sure to provide quantification of the control conditions.</p><p>2) All of the reviewers highlighted the need for additional significance tests. Please be sure to perform statistical analyses for every experiment and include in the legend the n, the statistical test used, and the p-value.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript would benefit from editing for grammar to improve readability. For example, on p.3, a comma is missing after &quot;neuron navigator proteins (Nav1)&quot; and before &quot;play.&quot; Another example – the last sentence of p. 4 is a run-on sentence that spans 7 lines and has incorrect grammar.

(i.e. fewer growth cone MT ends during blue light in the π-EB1 lines). Nevertheless, we redesigned Figure 2 to better illustrate blue light-induced growth cone MT shortening in the π-EB1 lines. In addition to different example growth cones, we also rotated the images vertically and added additional panels during blue light to better show MT shortening. In our quantification, the difference with or without EB3 is very small and not fully consistent, and although we cannot completely exclude a slight effect of EB3, we do not think that EB3 substantially contributes to growth cone MT growth. While this was initially surprising to us, this is consistent with EB3 not binding to the same site as EB1, but rather trailing the EB1 comet. We expanded the discussion of functional differences between EB1 and EB3 and would like to acknowledge Phillip Gordon-Weeks, who pointed this out in a comment on the bioRxiv preprint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.7/Figure 5 – Testing whether precise blue light exposure to small regions inside growth cones targeting only a few MTs could be used to control the direction of growth cone advance – They reported in the text that 42 out of 58 cells still retracted, with only localized exposure.

This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the reason why the numbers did not add up is exactly because there were a few cells that first turned and then retracted. We clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While this is a well-conducted study, the publication of which I would support, there are some details I would like to see addressed before approval for publication:</p><p>Fig1S: These data are not sufficient to support the claim that expression of the N-terminal half of the π-EB1 is comparable to control cells.

Additionally, qPCR should be used to compare expression levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The main point of Figure 1 – supplement 1 was to show in a simple non-neuronal cell line that an IRES did not work well to drive sufficient expression of the C-terminal π-element half and thus provide a rationale why we did not attempt this in hiPSCs. We did not mean to indicate that π-EB1 expression levels are identical to EB1 in control cells, merely that they are similar enough (as opposed to the IRES construct in which there is essentially no mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C expression). We clarified this in the text. While we do not think that quantification of these immunoblots adds substantially to the manuscript, we did, however, include a genomic PCR analysis of the same clones as on the immunoblot showing that only clone #1 was edited correctly and homozygous, while clone #2 was likely heterozygous showing reduced mCherry-Zdk1-EB1C expression both on the immunoblot and by quantification of cell fluorescence intensity. Arguably more important is the π-element expression level in hiPSCs and derived neurons, and we have added an RT-qPCR analysis to Figure 1 quantitatively comparing π-EB1 in edited hiPSCs to EB1 expression in control cells and modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C: What statistical test has been used here?

Paired t-tests before and during blue light as well as ANOVA of all four experimental groups show no statistically significant difference. The reviewer is correct of course that not being able to reject the null hypothesis that all samples belong to the same distribution does not automatically mean that there is no difference, but in our experiment, we cannot measure a difference in F-actin retrograde flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A: Where was the neurite illuminated?

Please indicate in the figure as well as in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4A, the entire field-of-view was exposed to blue light. We now note this in the figure legend. Given that local blue light exposure in the growth cone also frequently resulted in neurite retraction (Figure 5), we think that retraction results from a loss of growth cone adhesion rather than a process in the neurite. However, we did not analyze this further in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Please also show this experiment in the control neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included control i<sup>3</sup>Neurons in the turning experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should at least quantify the presented results with statistical analysis and add the necessary control experiments mentioned in the public review.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included controls and statistical analysis as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A better explanation with new experiments or discussion about the results regarding EB3 is also necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we have expanded our discussion on differences between EB1 and EB3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will greatly improve the study if the new approach used in the study could discover some novel function of EB1 or related cellular mechanism underlying its function.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes.
