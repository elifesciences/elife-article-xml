of members of the <italic>var</italic> multi-gene family and appears to follow a non-random pattern. In this study, using a detailed in vitro gene transcription analysis of the culture-adapted HB3 strain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we show that antigenic switching is governed by a global activation hierarchy favouring short and highly diverse genes in central chromosomal location. Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through adhesion-dependent survival rates. We further show that a gene’s activation rate is positively associated sequence diversity, which could offer important new insights into the evolution and maintenance of antigenic diversity in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01074.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01074.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01074.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our ability to acquire immunity to a disease depends on our immune system learning to recognise foreign molecules—called antigens—that are specific to the disease-causing virus, bacterium or parasite. However, some pathogens, such as the malaria-causing parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, get around this defence through a process called antigenic variation. This involves the parasite switching between different antigens over the course of an infection, preventing the host immune system from learning to recognise them and leading to infections that last many weeks or even months.</p><p>The main antigen in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is a protein called PfEMP1, which is encoded by a family of genes called <italic>var</italic> (‘variable’). <italic>Var</italic> genes have evolved to be highly diverse, and different parasites have different repertoires of around 50–60 <italic>var</italic> genes. This ensures that there are a huge number of distinct variants of the PfEMP1 antigen available within the population, allowing the malaria parasite to maintain long-lasting infections and also to infect the same individuals again and again.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the expression of <italic>var</italic> genes is not random, but it is not clear what determines which genes are expressed at any given time. Now, Noble et al. have performed a detailed investigation of antigenic switching in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Using clonal parasites, they closely monitored the expression of the entire <italic>var</italic> gene repertoire during many generations of parasite culture. They observed that although different cultures initially expressed distinct <italic>var</italic> genes, most of them ended up expressing two particular genes—<italic>var27</italic> and <italic>var29</italic>—at high levels, indicating a hard-wired gene ‘activation hierarchy’.</p><p>Noble et al. found that whenever the parasites switched antigens, <italic>var</italic> genes that were centrally located on chromosomes—such as <italic>var27</italic> and <italic>var29</italic>—were more likely to be activated than those at the ends of chromosomes. Moreover, <italic>var</italic> genes that were highly diverse were more likely to be activated than more conserved genes: this is the first evidence linking <italic>var</italic> gene evolution with gene activation probabilities. Together, these factors gave rise to the proposed activation hierarchy, which favours genes optimised for immune evasion and aids their continued evolution and diversification. Further work is now needed to identify the molecular mechanisms that control antigenic switching and to determine whether these could represent new therapeutic targets for malaria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01074.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01074.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>var</italic> genes</kwd><kwd>antigenic variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>082130/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newbold</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Recker</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first comprehensive analysis of antigenic switching in the malaria-causing parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> provides new insights into the process that prevents individuals from acquiring immunity to the disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acquired antibody-mediated immunity against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is directed against the disease-causing, intra-erythrocytic life-stage of the parasite’s life-cycle. Continual exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection can lead to a form of semi-immunity, whereby protection against life-threatening disease is acquired after a few infections only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 1999</xref>) whereas sterile and long-lasting immunity against infection is never achieved through natural exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenwood et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). The process of natural acquired immunity therefore coincides with a transition from acute and severe infection in young children to asymptomatic carriage in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marsh and Snow, 1997</xref>). At the core of this variable outcome of infection and poor development of immunity lies the major parasite virulence factor and variant antigen, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Members of this family of proteins are expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells and are involved in the binding of parasitised cells to other host cells and tissues (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kraemer and Smith, (2006)</xref>). The conferred binding phenotypes are believed to enhance parasite survival by avoiding splenic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boone and Watters, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffet et al., 2009</xref>) and also contribute to malaria pathology through parasite sequestration in the deep vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ockenhouse et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pongponratn et al., 1991</xref>). Mutually exclusive transcriptional switching between PfEMP1 variants during the course of an infection thus affords the parasite an immune evasion strategy and a means to exploit different host tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Each haploid parasite genome contains approximately 60 members of the <italic>var</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>) encoding distinct PfEMP1 variants, with a high degree of divergence between the antigenic repertoires of any two parasites. The high diversity of <italic>var</italic> genes and <italic>var</italic> gene repertoires is predominantly generated and maintained by frequent recombination and gene conversion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deitsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ward et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freitas-Junior et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraemer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank et al., 2008</xref>), which has also resulted in a high degree of mosaicism within these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ward et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bull et al., 2008</xref>). The modular and highly polymorphic, extracellular portion of PfEMP1 is composed of a variable number of Duffy-binding-like domains (DBL; at least two and up to seven per gene) and cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDR; up to two per gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraemer et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the overall diversity of <italic>var</italic> genes at the sequence level, distinct associations with severe malaria have been identified for several such genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salanti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>), with the involvement of <italic>var2csa</italic> in pregnancy-associated malaria being the clearest example to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>), as well as associations with particular DBL domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warimwe et al., 2009</xref>) and combinations of DBL and CIDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avril et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lavstsen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Var</italic> genes can also be classified according to a conserved upstream promoter sequence into four types termed UpsA, UpsB, UpsC, and UpsE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavstsen et al., 2003</xref>). Of particular interest are the UpsA-type genes, which appear to have diverged from the other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraemer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bull et al., 2008</xref>) and have been shown to be upregulated during severe infections in young hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bull et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaestli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyriacou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rottmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warimwe et al., 2009</xref>). As a possible consequence, acquisition of anti-PfEMP1 immunity appears to follow a particular order, with UpsA variants generally being the first to be broadly recognised in older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warimwe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cham et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, clear associations between the expression of particular genes or Ups-groups, host age and severity of disease are still missing and could in fact be strain- or location-specific. Understanding the underlying pattern of antigenic switching between <italic>var</italic> genes is therefore important to explain not only the mechanisms and dynamics of persistent infections but also the relationship between immune-mediated expression of particular PfEMP1 sub-types and infection outcomes.</p><p>Various studies have investigated <italic>var</italic> gene expression during natural or experimental infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavstsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wunderlich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blomqvist et al., 2010</xref>). However, as the diversity and order of PfEMP1 variants in the human host is influenced by immune responses and other host factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyriacou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warimwe et al., 2009</xref>), attempts to elucidate the underlying patterns of antigenic change and estimate related switching parameters are commonly based on in vitro cultured parasites in the absence of selection pressure. In this setting, Horrocks et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horrocks et al., 2004</xref>) found that the rates at which <italic>var</italic> genes activate or deactivate are non-random, gene-specific and highly dissimilar. It has furthermore been suggested that <italic>var</italic> genes occupying subtelomeric loci tend to switch off faster than those positioned in central chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2007</xref>), offering a possible explanation for the rapid decline in the transcription of subtelomeric genes in parasites during culture adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Recker et al. (2011)</xref> proposed that <italic>var</italic> gene transcriptional change involves a highly structured pathway that has evolved in response to a trade-off between the within-host and the between-host level fitness. However, most of these previous studies were limited in analytical depth due to restrictions in the number of variants considered and/or time points at which gene transcription levels were measured, and could therefore describe only small fragments of the whole switching network.</p><p>In this study, we used a novel approach to provide the first detailed characterisation of antigenic switching in the HB3 isolate of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. We analysed pooled <italic>var</italic> gene transcription data from verified quantitative real time PCR measurements of a diverse set of clonal parasite cultures using a statistically rigorous method of parameter estimation. This revealed a global hierarchy in <italic>var</italic> gene activation favouring a highly diverse set of genes in central chromosomal locations. Our results further suggest a role of active gene transcription in the generation of antigenic diversity and will have important implications for understanding the age- and exposure-dependent pathology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>11 subclones of the lab-adapted HB3 isolate of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were obtained by serial dilution of the parent culture. The clones were cultivated and transcript levels of 38 <italic>var</italic> genes measured by quantitative PCR, first at 29–33 parasite generations (8–9 weeks) after cloning and then at several time points over the following 60–79 generations in each culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>); a detailed description can be found in the ‘Materials and methods’ section. These 38 genes comprised almost all known functional HB3 <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraemer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowe et al., 2009</xref>) and one partial gene. The HB3 parent culture was also observed at seven time points. At the first observation, each of the 11 clones predominantly transcribed one of the nine different <italic>var</italic> genes, which were most likely the genes transcribed at the time of cloning. Importantly, these nine genes—hereafter referred to as ‘starter genes’—were representative of the <italic>var</italic> repertoire diversity in terms of chromosomal location and Ups type.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01074.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Parasite culture and RNA sampling information</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01074.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01074.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Culture</th><th>Starter gene</th><th>Observed generations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><italic>var11</italic></td><td>29, 48, 59, 69, 89</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><italic>var13</italic></td><td>29, 48, 69, 89, 99, 108</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><italic>var13</italic></td><td>30, 49, 70, 90, 100, 109</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><italic>var5</italic></td><td>30, 39, 49, 60, 70, 90</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><italic>var27</italic></td><td>30, 49, 70, 90</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><italic>var27</italic></td><td>29, 38, 48, 69, 89</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><italic>var28</italic></td><td>33, 52, 63, 73, 93</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><italic>var29</italic></td><td>30, 49, 70, 80</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><italic>var30</italic></td><td>29, 48, 59, 69, 89</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><italic>var31</italic></td><td>29, 48, 59, 69, 89, 99, 108</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><italic>var35</italic></td><td>32, 51, 65, 72, 92</td></tr><tr><td>Parent</td><td>–</td><td>0, 9, 19, 40, 60, 70, 79</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Var</italic> gene transcription dynamics</title><p>The proportional transcript levels of the different starter genes declined at notably different rates over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>).

Under the assumption that gene transcription facilitates recombination we would expect more frequently activated genes to share more sequence blocks with other genes, simply because they more often act as recombination sites. To test this we explicitly simulated gene conversion, in which pairs of genes were chosen at random, weighted by their activation bias and homology blocks copied between them (‘Materials and methods). As expected, we found a strong positive correlation between activation bias and our measure of relatedness in terms of network centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Under the same assumption we would also expect genes with higher activation biases to be overall more diverse. Indeed, using the average sequence conservation of all domains as a measure of population level diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckee and Recker, 2012</xref>), we again found this to be significantly and positively correlated, independently of chromosomal location and gene length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <italic>F</italic> = 13.6, p=0.0009 for the model comparison; accounting for uncertainty p=0.0006), suggesting a role of active gene transcription in generating antigenic diversity in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have noted that <italic>var</italic> genes located near the centres of chromosomes tend to be more highly transcribed in vitro than those in subtelomeric location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enderes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fastman et al., 2012</xref>), and it has been suggested that this might be due to low deactivation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we found that high transcription levels are confined to a subset of central genes that encode only four PfEMP1 binding domains (termed Type 1 <italic>var</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>]) and, importantly, are the result of high activation biases rather than low off-rates. That is, even though some of the most highly transcribed genes had very low off-rates, the total sum of other genes switching off with high bias towards these genes significantly outweighs the effect of off-rates. This is consistent with our previous study using artificial transcription data, which also showed that off-rates, at least within a biologically plausible range, can have only a modest effect on the total transcript levels within parasite populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble and Recker, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Reanalysis of data from a recent study on the NF54 parasite strain by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fastman et al. (2012)</xref> supports these findings. Consistent with our results for HB3, centrally located <italic>var</italic> genes encoding only four binding domains were more highly transcribed than the rest of the repertoire (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> = 2.3, p=0.02), with PF3D7_0809100, PF3D7_0421300 and PF3D7_0800100 being the most highly transcribed genes. According to our model, these are predicted to have high activation bias, and indeed, PF3D7_0809100 has previously been reported as the most transcribed <italic>var</italic> gene in NF54 bulk culture, whereas PF3D7_0421300 and PF3D7_0800100 were found to be the two genes most commonly activated by <italic>var</italic> gene switching in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzikowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enderes et al., 2011</xref>). Also in agreement with our results, NF54 gene transcription levels were positively correlated with relatedness to the rest of the repertoire in terms of shared DBL1 and CIDR1 homology blocks (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.3, p=0.044).</p><p>Our results further indicate that the direction of transcriptional switching between <italic>var</italic> genes depends not only on intrinsic activation biases but also on the particular preferences of each deactivating gene. Even though these variations were found to have only a modest effect on in vitro switching, they are expected to play a much greater role during infection, where factors such as immune responses and binding affinities can significantly alter the <italic>var</italic> gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the combination of an activation hierarchy and these specific variations could explain our previously proposed source-sink model underlying antigenic switching in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Recker et al., 2011</xref>), in which genes with high in-degrees, i.e., those most commonly switched to, correspond to the genes here identified as having high activation biases. Intriguingly, also, our results suggest that switch biases may be stronger between genes in similar chromosomal locations: central genes prefer to switch to other central genes, and subtelomeric genes prefer to switch to other subtelomeric genes. More data are needed to fully establish the factors influencing variation in switch biases, however, especially for less activated genes, where parameter estimations are more prone to uncertainties.</p><p>Despite recent advances in elucidating the genetics and epigenetics of <italic>var</italic> gene activation and silencing, not much is known about how mutually exclusive switching between the 60 <italic>var</italic> genes is controlled at the molecular level. The discovery of intrinsic <italic>var</italic> gene activation biases and their associations with chromosomal locations and other genetic features could therefore have important implications for future studies. These factors are clearly correlated, however, and it is uncertain how they are linked by cause and effect. For example, in a recent study it was found that gene length is positively correlated with sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckee and Recker, 2012</xref>), and long <italic>var</italic> genes are more often positioned in subtelomeric regions. Nevertheless, the correlation between activation bias and relatedness, which was found to be independent of chromosomal location, gene length and upstream promoter, suggests a role of gene transcription in facilitating recombination and therefore in generating and maintaining antigenic diversity in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Transcription-associated recombination has been observed in other eukaryotes and may result from increased accessibility to recombination proteins or from stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prado and Aguilera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottipati and Helleday, 2009</xref>). Importantly, for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> this phenomenon could help to explain why different groups of <italic>var</italic> genes within the repertoire display very different levels of diversity within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckee and Recker, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is further possible that some <italic>var</italic> genes are under balancing selection, whereby the relative sequence conservation of longer genes could be due to optimised functionality, for example in terms of binding avidity and/or affinity. This assumption would also help to reconcile apparent contradictions between our observations and <italic>var</italic> gene transcription in vivo. That is, various in vivo studies have reported UpsA <italic>var</italic> genes to be over-expressed during infections in individuals with little previous exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bull et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavstsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kyriacou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warimwe et al., 2009</xref>), despite their low activation rates in vitro. Each <italic>var</italic> repertoire consists of a set of relatively long and conserved genes, such as those predominantly found with in the UpsA group, and another, short and diverse set of genes, such as those predominantly found within the UpsB and UpsC groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckee and Recker, 2012</xref>). Under the assumption that more conserved genes have an in vivo survival advantage, possibly due to higher binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avril et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lavstsen et al., 2012</xref>), these variants will dominate early infections in naive hosts, regardless of activation rates. Their lower sequence diversity, however, will then lead to a more rapid acquisition of protective immunity, causing a transition towards the expression of more diverse variants, facilitated by their inherent activation biases. In light of this we would also speculate that the proposed order in which individuals acquire immunity (anti-UpsA followed by anti-UpsB/C), as well as the proposed associations between the expression of UpsA <italic>var</italic> genes and severe disease outcome, especially in young children, is less determined by the Ups group itself and is more a consequence of within-host selection of long, conserved genes, which are often but not exclusively found within the UpsA group.</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate how selection pressures operating on multiple ecological scales have shaped the phenotypic plasticity embodied within the antigenic repertoire of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Within this setup, <italic>var</italic> genes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie their sequential activation and silencing have co-evolved to allow the parasite to express the most advantageous phenotype in response to its current environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite culture and cDNA preparation</title><p>Parasites were cultured and sorbitol-synchronised using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trager and Jensen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lambros and Vanderberg, 1979</xref>), and RNA was extracted from saponin lysed, mid-to-late ring stage parasites with Trizol as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kyes et al., 2000</xref>).

For model comparisons we used a simulated annealing algorithm to find maximum likelihood parameter sets. These methods have previously been described in detail and tested using diverse artificial data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble and Recker, 2012</xref>).

These 16 genes together accounted, on average, for more than 92% of the sum of transcript levels in each culture (excluding the culture’s starter gene), whereas none of the excluded genes accounted for more than 1%.

Additionally, to account for uncertainty in our parameter estimates, we performed tests on the collected output of our MCMC method. This method samples from the posterior distribution, which means it selects numerous parameter sets such that the probability of each being chosen depends on how likely it is to explain the data. We performed our statistical tests on all the selected parameter sets and calculated mean p-values. We used the same parameter sets to obtain credible intervals for our estimates, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Variation in switch biases</title><p>We found that all <italic>var</italic> genes had similar sets of switch biases, such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for each <italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic>.

Negative values then corresponded to biases that were smaller than average and positive values to those that were larger. We used the subset of switch biases from the 9 starter genes to the 25 most transcribed genes, omitting the diagonal terms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Relatedness network</title><p>We constructed a network in which each node represented a gene and each edge was weighted by the number of shared variable DBL1 and CIDR1 homology blocks. Each gene’s centrality within the network was calculated using a weighted closeness measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Newman, 2001</xref>) implemented by the tnet package for R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Opsahl, 2009</xref>). We applied variance stabilising transformations to the data prior to analysis. Specifically, the centrality measure was rescaled and squared, and to each switch bias we applied the logit transformation, added five and then square-rooted the magnitude. These transformations made the data conform better to the assumptions of our statistical model; test results would have been more significant had we instead used the untransformed data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene conversion model</title><p>We simulated gene conversion in a repertoire of 30 genes, each comprising 40 homology blocks, with 30 possible variants for each homology block. Genes were initially constructed of randomly chosen homology blocks and were assigned activation biases according to a geometric sequence. For 30,000 iterations, pairs of genes were selected at random, with the probability of selection being proportional to activation bias. A randomly chosen homology block was copied from the first of the chosen genes to replace the corresponding block in the second gene. Homology blocks in all genes also underwent random mutation at a rate 10 times lower than the gene conversion rate. We constructed a relatedness network and calculated centrality in the same way as for the HB3 data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Initial conditions of the model</title><p>Our switching model required a set of initial conditions. Assuming that each culture, excluding the parent, began with a single parasite and that populations expanded approximately fivefold per generation, we deduced that the first transcriptional switch most likely occurred, on average, two or three generations after cloning. Therefore we assumed that each of these cultures remained clonal for the first three generations. For the parent culture, we used the first observation as the initial condition. If a switch had occurred in one or more of the initially clonal cultures within the first few generations, when the population was very small, then our assumed initial conditions would be inaccurate. Therefore we also ran our algorithms using the first observations as the initial conditions for all cultures. The parameter estimates were highly consistent with those obtained using clonal initial conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cross-validation of parameter estimates</title><p>The simplest way to estimate switch biases and off-rates for a single <italic>var</italic> gene is to obtain a clone transcribing the gene, grow it in culture and analyse changes in transcript levels over time. A particular strength of our method was that it also estimated parameters for genes we did not clone. To assess the accuracy of results obtained in this way, we performed cross-validation by sequentially excluding data sets. For example, to derive alternative estimates for <italic>var29</italic> we ran the MCMC algorithm without the data for culture #8 (which initially expressed <italic>var29</italic>), and to derive alternative estimates for <italic>var27</italic> we excluded data for cultures #5 and #6. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, confirmed our method’s ability to estimate switch biases of non-starter genes with sufficient accuracy to determine the general switching pattern. Off-rate estimates were however not always accurate, especially for genes with very low transcript levels.</p><p>We used a similar method to test the accuracy of our method for estimating variations in switch biases. Cultures #2 and #3 initially expressed the same starter gene <italic>var13</italic>, and both cultures #5 and #6 initially expressed <italic>var27</italic>. By excluding the data from culture #2 we derived estimates for the <italic>var13</italic> switch biases mostly dependent on the culture #3 data, and vice versa. Similarly we excluded data from each of cultures #5 and #6 to obtain two sets of estimates for the <italic>var27</italic> switch biases. For each of the two different data sets we calculated the deviations from the mean switch biases and found these to be positively correlated (Pearson’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.43, p=0.015), confirming the validity of our method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Validation of model assumptions</title><p>Our likelihood function, used for parameter estimation and model comparisons, assumed that input data were subject to measurement errors following a log-normal distribution. We have previously shown that our MCMC algorithm reliably determines network structures when the measurement error distribution is log-normal (base 2) with standard deviation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and that σ can be reliably estimated using our simulated annealing algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble and Recker, 2012</xref>).

The distribution for the 16-gene model was unimodal and only slightly asymmetrical (skewness 0.4) but was more peaked than a normal distribution (excess kurtosis 2.4), so that it somewhat resembled a Laplace distribution. We tried running the simulated annealing algorithm with an error function that assumed log-Laplace-distributed noise, and this made very little difference to the results. The deviations for the constrained 38-gene model were similarly distributed, excluding a very small minority of outliers.</p><p>Unusually large deviations occurred at 13 of the 64 observed time points, 8 of which were between generations 48 and 52 and therefore belonged to the same round of measurements. Transcript levels deviated more for longer genes than for shorter genes, and northern blotting of the samples taken at the affected time points showed unusually low levels of long, for example <italic>var</italic> length, RNA, confirming that the cause was not PCR error but most likely an as yet unidentified artefact of RNA preparation. Excluding the 13 data points affected by this phenomenon made very little difference to our parameter estimates and statistical test results.</p><p>Analysis of the qRT-PCR replicates revealed that measurements of lower transcript levels had higher standard errors, but the average standard error increased only threefold for each 1000-fold difference in transcript level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Growth rates</title><p>It has been suggested that <italic>var</italic> gene transcript levels in culture may be affected by small differences in parasite growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horrocks et al., 2004</xref>), although no evidence has been found to support this hypothesis.

However, such large differences in growth rates in vitro are biologically implausible and have never been observed.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This well written manuscript describes a thorough in vitro study of the <italic>var</italic> expression pattern in the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> HB3 laboratory strain. The authors study 11 clones for 98 to 108 generations of growth and assess transcription in each culture at 4–7 time points. The relative transcriptional signal (as a percentage of the total <italic>var</italic> gene transcriptional signal) was documented for every measurement and the resulting transcriptional profile was analyzed according to chromosomal position, promoter type, gene length, and sequence diversity. The authors find an expression hierarchy favoring centrally located <italic>var</italic> genes, as has previously been found in other parasite isolates. Specifically centromeric type 1 <italic>var</italic> are found to be highly expressed due to high activation rates. Furthermore it is noticed that frequently expressed <italic>var</italic> genes are more genetically diverse, leading the authors to suggest that <italic>var</italic> transcription facilitates generation of antigenic diversity.</p><p>The strength of this study lies mainly in the high quality dataset and the previously published modeling methodology applied to it, giving a detailed quantitative characterization of the <italic>var</italic> expression hierarchy.</p><p>The referees agree that all results are experimentally and statistically very solid. They raise a few major points that follow:</p><p>1) One question that is not directly evaluated is that of low off-rates of UpsC genes. UpsC genes are generally located in central areas of chromosomes. Therefore this promoter type could potentially serve as a marker for central <italic>var</italic> genes in parasite isolates in which chromosomal position of individual <italic>var</italic> genes is not known. It would therefore be of great benefit to the field if the authors could use their data to ask the question if UpsC promoter off-rates are always very low. For example this data point could be added to the first part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (all genes) by indicating the promoter types of the central and subtelomeric <italic>var</italic> genes (central: UpsC, UpsB and Ups A; subtelomeric: Ups B and UpsA). The authors are in a unique position to ask this question and potentially could provide the field with guidance on how to assess central <italic>var</italic> gene transcriptional activity in field isolates.</p><p>2) The effect of parameter estimation uncertainty on the findings should be clarified. The Discussion mentions that the local switch bias parameter estimates are uncertain (also shown with fuzziness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It must be possible to calculate the uncertainty of the activation-rate and off-rate parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and these should be provided.</p><p>3) Several of the findings based on the estimated parameters have p-values &gt;=0.01 (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2, 3, and 4</xref>). To determine if these findings are significant despite parameter estimation uncertainty, the effect of such uncertainty on these p-values should be calculated/discussed. Moreover, to give the reader an intuitive idea of the significance of the box plot figures, each box should be accompanied by the number of data points it represents (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: UpsA [N=5]).

In particular, we have reworded various parts in the Introduction and added many more key references that were missing in the original manuscript. We have also clarified the terminology and made sure we use important terms, such as “activation bias” and “switch bias”, more consistently throughout. Finally, we have conducted additional statistical tests and have added credibility intervals to our parameter estimates. A point-by-point response to specific points is given below.</p><p><italic>1) One question that is not directly evaluated is that of low off-rates of UpsC genes. UpsC genes are generally located in central areas of chromosomes. Therefore this promoter type could potentially serve as a marker for central</italic> var <italic>genes in parasite isolates in which chromosomal position of individual</italic> var <italic>genes is not known. It would therefore be of great benefit to the field if the authors could use their data to ask the question if UpsC promoter off-rates are always very low. For example this data point could be added to the first part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (all genes) by indicating the promoter types of the central and subtelomeric</italic> var <italic>genes (central: UpsC, UpsB and Ups A; subtelomeric: Ups B and UpsA). The authors are in a unique position to ask this question and potentially could provide the field with guidance on how to assess central</italic> var <italic>gene transcriptional activity in field isolates</italic>.</p><p>UpsC genes are exclusively positioned in central chromosomal location and we investigated the difference between UpsC genes and centrally located UpsB genes (there is only one central UpsA gene in HB3). The results show that there was no significant difference in the off-rates of UpsC genes compared to UpsB genes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The effect of parameter estimation uncertainty on the findings should be clarified. The Discussion mentions that the local switch bias parameter estimates are uncertain (also shown with fuzziness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It must be possible to calculate the uncertainty of the activation-rate and off-rate parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and these should be provided</italic>.</p><p>We have added 95% credible intervals to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, calculated from all the parameter sets selected by our MCMC method. As a result of this process, we also refined our point estimates of the switching parameters (as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We reran all of our statistical tests and redrew our figures in light of these more accurate estimates, though this resulted in only very minor changes.</p><p><italic>3) Several of the findings based on the estimated parameters have p-values &gt;=0.01 (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2, 3, and 4</xref>). To determine if these findings are significant despite parameter estimation uncertainty, the effect of such uncertainty on these p-values should be calculated/discussed. Moreover, to give the reader an intuitive idea of the significance of the box plot figures, each box should be accompanied by the number of data points it represents (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: UpsA [N=5]). A numeric matrix with the estimated switch bias parameters and uncertainties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) should be made available as supplementary material</italic>.</p><p>We have rerun all our statistical tests using all the parameter estimates selected by our MCMC method. As noted above, we have added credibility intervals to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and we further provide the number of data points in the box plots.</p><p><italic>4) The central concept of activation rate should be introduced more clearly. The sentence: “This finding led us to consider switch bias as the sum of two factors: a ‘global activation rate’, solely dependent on the gene to be activated, and a ‘local bias’, dependent on both the activated and the deactivated gene” can be interpreted as: switch bias = activation rate + local bias, where switch bias is the previously defined</italic> β<sub>j,i</sub><italic>, and that this parameter is split in two. It took some time to gather from the remaining text that the activation rate is actually defined as the average switch bias towards a gene</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this was a bit too condensed and also not very consistent in its use. In our revised version we provide more detail on how we define switch biases and activation biases and use these more consistently throughout. Specifically, switch bias, <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>, refers to the probability that when gene <italic>i</italic> switches off, gene <italic>j</italic> becomes activated, whereas a gene’s activation bias is the average of all switch biases towards this gene and therefore the per switch activation probability.</p><p><italic>5) The mentioning of a “global activation hierarchy” is unfortunate (especially in the Abstract) since it is ambiguous and suggests that the findings are valid for parasites worldwide, which is not necessarily the case since this study only concerns the HB3 isolate. The word “global” can be removed without subtracting essential meaning. Similarly, the words “global” and “local” are not necessary when mentioning the parameters “global activation rate” and “local switch bias”</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have removed all references to global and local biases. Our initial reason for choosing “global activation bias” was to highlight the fact that there appears to be a hierarchy of gene activation that is independent of the currently active gene, i.e. independent of local effects. In this respect global referred to the repertoire as a whole, rather than a universal activation hierarchy, which would apply to all <italic>var</italic> gene repertoires.</p></body></sub-article></article>
