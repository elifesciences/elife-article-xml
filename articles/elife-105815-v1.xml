systemic administration of inert actuators. Because chemogenetic control relies on DREADD expression levels, understanding and quantifying the temporal dynamics of their expression is crucial for planning long-term experiments in monkeys. In this study, we longitudinally quantified in vivo DREADD expression in macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography with the DREADD-selective tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]deschloroclozapine (DCZ), complemented by functional studies. Twenty macaque monkeys were evaluated after being injected with adeno-associated virus vectors expressing the DREADDs hM4Di or hM3Dq, whose expression was quantified as changes in [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ binding potential from baseline levels. Expression levels of both hM4Di and hM3Dq peaked around 60 days post-injection, remained stable for about 1.5 years, and declined gradually after 2 years. Significant chemogenetic control of neural activity and behavior persisted for about 2 years. The presence of protein tags significantly influenced expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing overall expression levels. These findings provide valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing the use of DREADDs in long-term primate studies and potential therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemogenetic technology affords remote and reversible control of neuronal activity by expressing receptors that are designed to be activated by systemically delivered biologically inert actuators. One such tool is the widely used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) system, which is based on mutated muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roth, 2016</xref>). DREADDs have been widely used in rodent models and their use in nonhuman primates has recently shown some promise by inducing significant behavioral changes through simultaneous modulation of activity in disparate neuronal populations across large brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). Whether this promise will translate to reality depends on how long DREADDs can exert their effects. Because the efficacy of chemogenetic manipulation depends on DREADD expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grayson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Upright et al., 2018</xref>), maintaining high and stable expression levels is critical for ensuring consistent control throughout all experiments in a study. While this has proven possible in rodent studies that typically only span several months, whether it is true for studies involving macaque monkeys, which often last multiple years, remains a question. Indeed, despite the growing use of DREADDs in monkey neuroscience research, consistent and reliable data on the temporal dynamics of DREADD expression following viral transduction remain scarce. Specifically, little is known about how quickly DREADD expression is established following viral transduction or how long it is maintained. This gap in knowledge complicates efforts to optimize critical parameters, such as the serotypes, constructs, and titers of viral vectors that all influence expression level and duration.</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is an in vivo imaging technique that allows quantification of receptor density in the brain. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of PET for longitudinal measurements of gene expression introduced into the brain via adeno-associated virus (AAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nerella et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vandeputte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies have highlighted the potential of using PET imaging to monitor gene expression over time, most have used it as an indirect measure of target gene expression, without exploring the relationship between expression levels and the resultant functional outcomes.</p><p>Several PET probes have been developed to visualize DREADD receptor expression. Initial studies in rodents used [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine to monitor DREADD expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). In nonhuman primates, longitudinal PET studies using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine have successfully tracked virally expressed DREADDs in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, DREADD-selective ligands such as [<sup>18</sup>F]JHU37107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bonaventura et al., 2019</xref>) and [<sup>11</sup>C]deschloroclozapine ([<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 2020</xref> have been developed. Among these, [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ has become a particularly useful tracer for studying DREADD-mediated functional manipulation in macaques and marmosets. This PET ligand allows researchers to verify the location and density of DREADD expression at the site of AAV injection and at projection sites, as demonstrated in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hirabayashi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hirabayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyakawa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miyake et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mueller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oyama et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oyama et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oyama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roseboom et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, unlike postmortem analysis that relies on the detection of fused or expressed protein tags, [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET provides a direct, quantitative, and noninvasive measure of DREADD expression level in vivo, using standard reference tissue models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET thus serves as a valuable tool for tracking DREADD expression levels throughout long-term chemogenetics experiments in monkeys.</p><p>As the developer of the DREADD-selective agonist DCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>), we have consistently performed multiple [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET scans as part of our DREADD experiments in monkeys, including at baseline before AAV injection, 30â120 days post-injection, and then periodically over the course of the experiments. For the current study, we analyzed these PET data to examine the short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression in vivo and assessed how these changes correlated with the ability to manipulate neuronal activity or behavior. Our results provide valuable information with a few caveats and indicate that the promise of using DREADDs in long-term monkey experiments is real.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>PET imaging data using [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ were collected from 15 monkeys before (baseline) and after injections of AAV vectors for expressing hM4Di or hM3Dq (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To achieve neuron-specific expression, we used AAV vectors with a preference for neuronal infection, such as AAV2 or AAV2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kimura et al., 2023</xref>), or for incorporation with neuron-specific promoters (e.g., human synapsin promoter; hSyn). To assess the specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ, we calculated the binding potential relative to a nondisplaceable radioligand (BP<sub>ND</sub>) using a multilinear reference tissue model with the cerebellum as a reference region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). DREADD expression levels were then quantified as the change in BP<sub>ND</sub> (ÎBP<sub>ND</sub>) from baseline values. This approach allowed us to longitudinally and quantitatively monitor the dynamics of DREADD expression in vivo.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

expression and determine how quickly expression was established following transduction, we analyzed the [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET data from seven monkeys that received AAV vector injections into subcortical regions with similar volumes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). These data were originally collected for vector-testing studies, during which PET scans were frequently repeated up to 150 days post-injection. The dataset was selected according to the following criteria: (1) the titer of injected viral vector was 1.0â3.0Ã10<sup>13</sup> gc/ml, and (2) the peak ÎBP<sub>ND</sub> value exceeded 0.5. Analysis showed that expression levels of hM4Di and hM3Dq increased rapidly, reaching peak expression at approximately 60 days after viral vector injection. Notably, no clear differences in expression dynamics were observed between hM3Dq and hM4Di (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time course of DREADD expression levels up to 150 days after injection.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Parametric coronal images of the increase (relative to baseline) in specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ (ÎBP<sub>ND</sub>) at 30 (<bold>A</bold>) and 64 (<bold>B</bold>) days after adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection, overlaid on MR images.

This capability makes DREADDs promising for investigating the causal roles of specific neural pathways and cell types in the highly specialized brain circuits found in primates. However, ethical and logistical constraints on using a large number of monkeys highlight the need of moving beyond a trial-and-error approach. It is essential to aggregate data and provide insights that are more widely applicable, thus enabling the development of a more efficient experimental design for DREADD research in monkeys. In vivo PET visualization of DREADDs offers a noninvasive and quantitative means for real-time monitoring of receptor expression. The present study analyzed PET and functional/behavioral data from 43 injection sites across 20 monkeys and revealed three key findings: (1) after AAV injection, DREADD expression levels peaked after approximately 60 days and remained stable for up to 1.5 years, followed by a gradual decline observed after 2â3 years; (2) significant chemogenetic effects on neural activity and behavior persisted for around 2 years; and (3) protein tags significantly influenced peak expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing peak expression. These results offer quantitative insights into the temporal dynamics of DREADD expression, thereby informing strategies for designing long-term experiments. They also confirm the efficacy and reliability of DREADD-mediated interventions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>In vivo monitoring of gene expression has been conducted using fluorescent reporters observed through a window or fiber, providing a method to verify transducing protein expression and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diester et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruiz et al., 2013</xref>). Although useful for optogenetics and imaging studies, these methods are invasive, less quantitative, and spatially limited, often requiring cranial surgeries and capturing only two-dimensional data. In contrast, DCZ PET imaging provides a direct, noninvasive, volumetric measure of receptor expression, making it particularly suitable for studies in large animals such as macaques and for translational research with potential application to future human therapies. Nevertheless, PET measurement has certain limitations, including potential variability due to individual differences, underestimation of DREADD expression levels due to the partial volume effect, and the influence of anesthesia on kinetic parameters during imaging sessions. In this study, we have considered these factors and minimized their impact by applying appropriate ROI placements and excluding data collected under inadequate anesthetic conditions (see âMaterials and methodsâ).</p><p>This study included a retrospective analysis of datasets pooled from multiple studies conducted within a single laboratory, which inherently introduced variability across injection parameters and scan intervals. While such an approach reflects real-world practices in long-term NHP research, future studies, including multicenter efforts using harmonized protocols, will be valuable for systematically assessing inter-individual differences and optimizing key experimental parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Temporal dynamics of DREADD expression</title><p>Our [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET measurement showed that DREADD expression peaked around 60 days after AAV injection, regardless of whether hM4Di or hM3Dq was used. This pattern was consistent with our previous data regarding hM4Di expression visualized using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). This gradual rise in AAV-mediated gene expression likely reflects rate-limiting steps following viral infection, including transport to the nucleus, uncoating, and conversion to double-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferrari et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Samulski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Similar temporal patterns of AAV-mediated gene expression have been observed in previous studies using in vivo fluorescent measurement. For example, in rats transfected with an AAV5 encoding fluorescence protein (EYFP) in motor cortex and the hippocampus, in vivo fluorescence signals increased sigmoidally, rapidly until day 35, then slowed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diester et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in macaques, ChR2 expression monitored via fluorescence intensity peaked at around 60 days after AAV9 injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakamichi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although we modeled the time course of DREADD expression using a single sigmoid function, PET data from several monkeys showed a modest decline following the peak. While the sigmoid model captured the early-phase dynamics and offered a reliable estimate of peak timing, additional PET scansâparticularly between 60 and 120 days post-injectionâwill be essential to fully characterize the biological basis of the post-peak expression trajectories.</p><p>Despite being derived from a limited dataset, our findings offer important insights for designing chemogenetics studies in primates. Specifically, beginning functional experiments at approximately 60 days post-AAV injection will yield reliable results and avoid unnecessary delays. This timeline may also be applicable to other genetic studies in monkeys, such as those using optogenetics or calcium imaging, which also require proper expression of functional proteins. However, while these tools rely on rapid, light-driven responses and are relatively less dependent on stable functional protein expression, DREADDs require sustained expression for consistent long-term effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Factors influencing peak DREADD expression</title><p>Although higher AAV titers generally result in increased transgene expression in neurons, excessively high titers can trigger immune responses. In the current study, we used titers that ranged from 1 to 5Ã10<sup>13</sup> gc/ml, achieving a balance between effective expression and minimal immune activation. This may explain why virus titer did not emerge as a significant factor affecting expression levels in our analysis. By contrast, our analysis indicated that the presence and type of protein tags significantly influenced peak DREADD expression levels. Vectors encoding DREADDs with protein tags, particularly 5â-terminal HA tags, were associated with a reduction of peak expression levels. Thus, although these tags are commonly used for antibody detection in DREADD constructs, they negatively impact expression efficacy and potentially affect protein function. Our findings are consistent with a previous PET study using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine and immunohistochemical analysis, which also found reduced hM4Di expression in constructs with 5â-terminal HA tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, constructs incorporating IRES-GFP might also result in lower expression levels due to the size and composition of the AAV vector, as has been shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Furler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kimura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mizuguchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, these constructs have been frequently used in rodent research and have also been effective in producing long-term chemogenetic effects in monkey studies, including the current one (e.g., monkeys #229 and #238). Thus, while the observed decline in DREADD expression resulting from these constructs is not inherently detrimental to experimental outcomes in monkey studies, it serves as a warning that we must be careful when designing vectors to avoid reductions in experimental efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for long-term experiments with DREADD expression</title><p>One of the most important findings was that AAV-mediated DREADD expression was maintained for up to 2 years for hM4Di and at least 1 year for hM3Dq. Throughout the duration of the experiments, chemogenetic effects remained consistent, as verified by individual behavioral and functional assessments. However, hM4Di expression diminished after 3 years, coinciding with the loss of chemogenetic behavioral effects in at least one case. This indicates that while chemogenetic effects can be maintained for up to 2 years, they likely decline gradually beyond this period. Consequently, researchers should anticipate consistent chemogenetic effects for a maximum of 2 years following AAV injection and should be mindful that longer-term experiments are at risk for a decline in effectiveness. Specifically, the inevitable failure to detect DREADDs via immunohistochemistry highlights an important caveat for researchers: timely termination of experiments to ensure verification through in vitro examination is necessary.</p><p>The gradual decline in expression levels observed beyond 2 years has several potential causes. First, AAV vectors typically remain episomal in transduced cells, without integrating into the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weitzman and Linden, 2011</xref>). While this poses less of an issue in nondividing neurons, episomal DNA can still be subject to gradual loss or degradation over time. Second, several mechanisms may contribute to the gradual downregulation of transgene expression, including epigenetic modifications, immune responses, and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muhuri et al., 2022</xref>). For example, promoter silencingâoften associated with epigenetic modificationsâhas been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). Neuron-specific promoters have been shown to achieve more efficient and prolonged transgene expression than ubiquitous promoters like CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paterna et al., 2000</xref>). Our study found no evidence of cell death at AAV injection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that neuronal loss was not a primary cause of the eventual decline in expression levels. Repeated receptor activation did not affect DREADD expression levels or chemogenetic efficacy in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oyama et al., 2022b</xref>). Thus, identifying the factors that cause expression to eventually decline remains of critical importance. With this knowledge, we can develop strategies to maintain persistent transgene expression in neurons for more than 2 years, which will benefit both chemogenetic studies and therapeutic applications. Despite this uncertainty, our data offers important guidelines for chemogenetics studies in nonhuman primates, demonstrating that up to 2 years of reliable expression is achievable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Translational implications</title><p>This research has significant translational implications, particularly for the development of DREADD-based therapies for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. DREADD-based approaches have shown promising therapeutic potential, with successful application in monkey models of disease conditions such as epileptiform seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyakawa et al., 2023</xref>) and Parkinsonâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Extending these findings to human clinical applications positions PET imaging as a powerful tool for real-time, noninvasive confirmation of target protein expressionâa critical factor for ensuring therapeutic efficacy. PET reporter imaging has already shown its value in human gene therapy for certain movement disorders, where sustained protein expression has been correlated with treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mittermeyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tai et al., 2022</xref>). Our study reinforces this utility by demonstrating that when DREADD expression was no longer detectable via PET, the chemogenetic effects were also diminished.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study describes short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression in nonhuman primates using [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET imaging, complemented by assessment of functional efficacy. The findings provide critical insights into the practicality of multi-year studies using chemogenetic neuromodulation with DREADDs, including the expression time course and factors affecting expression stability. This work offers valuable guidance for designing future long-term nonhuman primate studies and underscores the translational potential of using DREADDs combined with PET imaging for noninvasive, gene-targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 20 macaque monkeys (10 Japanese, <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>; 8 Rhesus, <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; 2 Cynomolgus, <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>; 16 males, 4 females; weight, 3.4â9.9 kg; age, 3â13 years at the beginning of experiments) were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The AAV vectors and brain regions into which they were injected are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. Before surgery, structural scans of the head were acquired via magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (7 tesla 400 mm/SS system, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) (Accuitomo170, J. MORITA CO., Kyoto, Japan) under anesthesia (continuous intravenous infusion of propofol 0.2â0.6 mg/kg/min). Overlay MR and CT images were created using PMOD image analysis software (PMOD 4.4, PMOD Technologies Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland) to estimate the stereotaxic coordinates of target brain structures.</p><p>Surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions in a fully equipped operating suite. We monitored body temperature, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> throughout all surgical procedures. Monkeys were immobilized by intramuscular (i.m.) injection of ketamine (5â10 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.2â0.5 mg/kg) after i.m. injection of atropine sulfate (0.02â0.05 mg/kg) and then intubated with an endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1%â3%, to effect). After surgery, prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics (cefmetazole, 25â50 mg/kg/day; ketoprofen, 1â2 mg/kg/day) were administered for 7 days.</p><p>Viral vectors were injected with a stereotaxic apparatus or a hand-held syringe. For stereotaxic injection, burr holes (~8 mm in diameter) were created for inserting the injection needle. Viruses were pressure-injected using a 10 Î¼l Hamilton syringe (model 1701 RN, Hamilton, Reno, UV) mounted on a motorized microinjector (UMP3T-2, WPI, Sarasota, FL) held by a manipulator (model 1460, David Kopf, Tujunga, CA) on the stereotaxic frame. After making an approximately 3 mm cut in the dura mater, the injection needle was inserted into the brain and slowly moved down 1â2 mm beyond the target and then kept stationary for 5 min, after which it was pulled back up to the target location. Injection speed was 0.1â0.5 Î¼l/min. After each injection, the needle remained in situ for 15 min to minimize backflow along the needle and then was pulled out very slowly.</p><p>For handheld injection, the target cortex was exposed by removing a bone flap and reflecting the dura mater. Injections were made under visual guidance through an operating microscope (Leica M220, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at an oblique angle to the brain surface. Each hemisphere received nine tracks of injections: one at the caudal tip, four along the dorsal bank, and four along the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, with 3â5 ÂµL per track, depending on the depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oyama et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>PET imaging</title><p>PET imaging was conducted as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, PET scans were performed using a microPET Focus 220 scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Malvern, USA). Monkeys were initially immobilized with ketamine (5â10 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.2â0.5 mg/kg) and maintained under anesthesia with isoflurane (1â3%) throughout the PET procedures. The isoflurane level was carefully adjusted to ensure the stability of continuously monitoring physiological parameters, such as body temperature, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>. End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> levels were maintained between 35 and 45 mmHg to prevent substantial changes in cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Markwalder et al., 1984</xref>), which could impact tracer kinetics. Transmission scans were performed for about 20 min with a Ge-68 source. Emission scans were acquired in 3D list mode with an energy window of 350â750 keV after intravenous bolus injection of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ (~350 MBq) and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (~200 MBq). Data acquisition lasted for 90 min.</p><p>To estimate the specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ, regional binding potential relative to a nondisplaceable radioligand (BP<sub>ND</sub>) was calculated by PMOD with an original multilinear reference tissue model (MRTMo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). The cerebellum was used as a reference region, and t* was 15 min. The DREADD expression level was defined as ÎBP<sub>ND</sub>, calculated by subtracting the pre-injection value from the post-injection value because the BP<sub>ND</sub> value included off-target binding. This minimized individual differences because off-target binding varied among subjects. The volumes of interest (VOIs) reflecting DREADD expression were identified by drawing contours at half of the maximum ÎBP<sub>ND</sub> value in the ÎBP<sub>ND</sub> parametric image, which was smoothed with a 2 mm Gaussian filter, and overlaid onto the corresponding region in each individual MR image.</p><p>For the FDG study, DCZ (1 Î¼g/kg) or vehicle was administered intravenously 1 min before FDG injection. Data were converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) images, averaged between 30- and 60 min, and normalized to SUV ratio (SUVR) images using the mean whole-brain value. Metabolic changes induced by DCZ were calculated as ÎSUVR and defined by the different DCZ and vehicle conditions, with VOIs for FDG analysis matching those used in the [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ-PET study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Administration of DREADD agonists</title><p>Deschloroclozapine (DCZ; HY-42110, MedChemExpress) was the primary agonist used. DCZ was first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp.) and then diluted in saline to a final volume of 1 ml, with the final DMSO concentration adjusted to 2.5% or less. DCZ was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg for hM4Di activation, and at 1â3 Âµg/kg for hM3Dq activation. For behavioral testing, DCZ was injected approximately 15 min before the start of the experiment unless otherwise noted. Fresh DCZ solutions were prepared daily.</p><p>In a limited number of cases, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Toronto Research Chemicals) or compound 21 (C21; Tocris) was used as an alternative DREADD agonist for some hM4Di experiments. Both compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in saline to a final volume of 2â3 ml, also maintaining DMSO concentrations below 2.5%. CNO and C21 were administered intravenously at doses of 3 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><p>The behavioral experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Here we focus on a modified Brinkman board task and a sensitivity to cold stimulation task, which were used to analyze the behavior of a monkey (#234) that had hM4Di expressed in its primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the modified Brinkman board task, monkeys picked food pellets out of 10 slots in a board with one of their hands (i.e., contralateral or ipsilateral to the DREADD-expressing hemisphere), and the amount of time needed to pick up all 10 pellets was recorded. The time to complete each trial was normalized to the number of pellets successfully picked up to obtain a value that reflected manual dexterity. In a single experimental session, a monkey performed five to ten trials with each hand before and 10 min after intravenous systemic administration of DCZ. In the sensitivity to cold task, monkeys were trained to place a sole of one of their feet on a cold metal plate that was placed in front of their monkey chair. The latency with which they withdrew their foot from the plate was recorded and used as an index of sensitivity to a cutaneous (cold) stimulus. If a monkey did not withdraw its foot within 60 s, the trial was terminated and a withdraw latency of 60 s was assigned for that trial. The monkeys performed five to ten trials for each of two temperature conditions (30Â°C for control and 10Â°C for cold stimulation) both before and 10 min after DCZ administration. Chemogenetic effects were assessed by comparing performance on the tasks pre- and post-injection and between contralateral and ipsilateral hands and feet (only the contralateral side should be affected by DCZ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>All data and statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">R Development Core Team, 2025</xref>). To model the time course of DREADD expression, we used a single sigmoid function, referencing past in vivo fluorescent measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diester et al., 2011</xref>). Curve fitting was performed using least squares minimization. For comparison, a double logistic function was also tested and evaluated using the Bayesian information Criterion (BIC) to assess model fit. Repeated-measures two-way ANOVAs were used to examine the effect of cumulative number of activation times Ãdays after injection on post-peak fluctuation.</p><p>To identify factors influencing peak expression levels, a stepwise model selection using the stepAIC() function from the MASS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Venables and Ripley, 2002</xref>) was performed. To minimize potentially confounding effects related to injection method and volume, we restricted this analysis to cases in which a microinjector was used to deliver the AAV and excluded cortical injections into the orbitofrontal cortex and dlPFC, which involved larger, manually administered injection volumes. Starting with a full model that included six factorsâvirus titer, DREADD type, promoter, tag, serotype, and injection volumeâalong with all their interactions, the best-fitting linear model was determined based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). A permutation-based outlier analysis was also performed to detect and exclude statistical outliers that could disproportionally influence the regression results. The resulting best model included six variables and five interactions (Titer:Promoter, DREADD:Promoter, Titer:Tag, Titer:Volume, and DREADD:Volume). The significance of their contributions to the peak expression level, as well as the effect sizes (generalized eta-squared, <italic>Î·Â²G</italic>), were assessed using type II analysis of variance with the anova_test() function from the rstatix package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kassambara, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology and immunostaining</title><p>For histological inspection, monkeys were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.v.) or sodium thiopental (50 mg/kg, i.v.) after administration of ketamine hydrochloride (5â10 mg/kg, i.m.) and then transcardially perfused with saline at 4Â°C, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at 4Â°C. The brain was removed from the skull, postfixed in the same fresh fixative overnight, saturated with 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer (PB) at 4Â°C, and then cut serially into 50-Î¼m-thick sections on a freezing microtome. For visualizing immunoreactive GFP (co-expressed with hM4Di) signals, a series of every sixth section was immersed in 1% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with rabbit anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:500, G10362, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum for 2 days at 4Â°C.

Nagai et al. investigated the longitudinal expression and efficacy of DREADDs to modulate neuronal activity in the macaque model. The authors demonstrate that both hM4Di and hM3Dq DREADDs reach peak expression levels after approximately 60 days and that stable expression was maintained for up to two years for hM4Di and at least one year for hM3Dq DREADDs. During this period, DREADDs effectively modulated neuronal activity, as evidenced by a variety of measures, including behavioural testing, functional imaging, and/or electrophysiological recording. Notably, some of the data suggest that DREADD expression may decline after two-three years. This is a novel finding and has important implications for the utilization of this technology for long-term studies, as well as its potential therapeutic applications. Lastly, the authors highlight that peak DREADD expression may be significantly influenced by the presence of fused or co-expressed protein tags, emphasizing the importance of careful design and selection of viral constructs for neuroscientific research. This study represents a critical step in the field of chemogenetics, setting the scene for future development and optimization of this technology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The longitudinal approach of this study provides important preliminary insights into the long-term utility of chemogenetics, which has not yet been thoroughly explored.</p><p>The data presented are novel and inclusive, relying on well-established in vivo imaging methods as well as behavioral and immunohistochemical techniques. The conclusions made by the authors are generally supported by a combination of these techniques. In particular, the utilization of in vivo imaging as a non-invasive method is translationally relevant and likely to make an impact in the field of chemogenetics, such that other researchers may adopt this method of longitudinal assessment in their own experiments. Rigorous standards have been applied to the datasets, and the appropriate controls have been included where possible.</p><p>The number of macaque subjects (20) from which data was available is also notable. Behavioral testing was performed in 11 subjects, FDG-PET in 5, electrophysiology in 1, and [11C]DCZ-PET in 15. This is an impressive accumulation of work that will surely be appreciated by the growing community of researchers using chemogenetics in nonhuman primates.</p><p>The implication that chemogenetic effects can be maintained for up to 1.5-2 years, followed by a gradual decline beyond this period, is an important development in knowledge. The limited duration of DREADD expression may present an obstacle in the translation of chemogenetic technology as a potential therapeutic tool, and it will be of interest for researchers to explore whether this limitation can be overcome. This study therefore represents a key starting point upon which future research can build.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>None.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105815.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports histological, PET imaging, functional and behavioural data evaluating the longevity of AAV2 infection in multiple brain areas of macaques in the context of DREADD experiments. The central aim is to provide unprecedented information about how long the expression of HM4di or HM3dq receptors are expressed and efficient in modulating brain functions after vector injections. The data show peak expression after 40 to 60 days of vector injection, and stable expressions for up to 1.5 years for hM4di, and that hM3dq remained mostly at 75% of peak after a year, declining to 50% after 2 years. DREADDs effectively modulated neuronal activity and behaviour for approximately two years, evaluated with behavioural testings, neural recordings or FDG-PET. A statistical evaluation revealed that vector titers, DREADD type and tags contribute to the measured peak level of DREADD expression.</p><p>The article present a thorough discussion of the limitations and specificities of chemogenetic approaches in monkeys.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>These are unique data, in non-human primate (NHP), an animal model that not only features physiological and immunological characteristics similar to humans, but also contributes to neurobiological functional studies over long timescales with experiments spanning months or years. This evaluation of long-term efficacy of DREADDs will be very important for all laboratories using chemogenetics in NHP but also for future use of such approach in experimental therapies. The longevity estimates are based on multiple approaches including behavioural and neurophysiological, thus providing information on functional efficacy of DREADD expression.</p><p>Performing such evaluation requires specific tools like PET imaging that very few monkey labs have access to. This study was done by the laboratory that has developed the radiotracer c11-DCZ, used here, a radiotracer binding selectively to DREADDs and providing, using PET, quantitative in vivo measures of DREADD expression. This study and its data should thus be a reference in the field, providing estimates to plan future chemogenetic experiments.</p><p>Publishing databases of experimental outcomes in NHP DREADD experiments is crucial for the community because such experiments are rare, expensive and long. It contributes to refining experiments and reducing the number of animals overall used in the domain.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This study is a meta-analysis of several experiments performed in one lab. The good side is that it combined a large amount of data that might not have been published individually; the down side is that all things where not planned and equated, creating a lot of unexplained variances in the data. However, this was judiciously used by the authors to provide very relevant information. One might think that organized multi-centric experiments planned using the knowledge acquired here, will provide help testing more parameters, including some related to inter-individual variability, and particular genetic constructs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105815.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary</p><p>This manuscript, from the developers of the novel DREADD-selective agonist DCZ (Nagai et al., 2020), utilizes a unique dataset where multiple PET scans in a large number of monkeys, including baseline scans before AAV injection, 30-120 days post-injection, and then periodically over the course of the prolonged experiments, were performed to access short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression in vivo, and to associate DREADD expression with the efficacy of manipulating the neuronal activity or behavior.

is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Overall, the conclusions of the paper are mostly supported by the data but may be overstated in some cases, and some details are also missing or not easily recognizable within the figures. The provision of additional information and analyses would be valuable to the reader and may even benefit the authors' interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and constructive feedback. We are pleased that the reviewer found the overall conclusions of our paper to be well supported by the data, and we appreciate the suggestions for improving figure clarity and interpretive accuracy. Below, we address each point with corresponding revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that DREADD expression gradually decreases after 1.5-2 years is only based on a select few of the subjects assessed; in Figure 2, it appears that only 3 hM4Di cases and 2 hM3Dq cases are assessed after the 2-year timepoint. The observed decline appears consistent within the hM4Di cases, but not for the hM3Dq cases (see Figure 2C: the AAV2.1-hSyn-hM3Dq-IRES-AcGFP line is increasing after 2 years.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our interpretation should be stated more cautiously, given the limited number of cases assessed beyond the two-year timepoint. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified in the Results that the observed decline is based on a subset of animals. We have also included a text stating that while a consistent decline was observed in hM4Di-expressing monkeys, the trajectory for hM3Dq expression was more variable with at least one case showing an increased signal beyond two years.</p><p>Revised Results section:</p><p>Lines 140, âhM4Di expression levels remained stable at peak levels for approximately 1.5 years, followed by a gradual decline observed in one case after 2.5 years, and after approximately 3 years in the other two cases (Figure 2B, a and e/d, respectively). Compared with hM4Di expression, hM3Dq expression exhibited greater post-peak fluctuations. Nevertheless, it remained at ~70% of peak levels after about 1 year. This post-peak fluctuation was not significantly associated with the cumulative number of DREADD agonist injections (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, main effect of activation times, F<sub>(1,6)</sub> = 5.745, P = 0.054). Beyond 2 years post-injection, expression declined to ~50% in one case, whereas another case showed an apparent increase (Figure 2C, c and m, respectively).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that individual differences may affect expression levels, it would be helpful to see additional labels on the graphs (or in the legends) indicating which subject and which region are being represented for each line and/or data point in Figure 1C, 2B, 2C, 5A, and 5B. Alternatively, for Figures 5A and B, an accompanying table listing this information would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions. In response, we have revised the relevant figures (Fig. 1C, 2B, 2C, and 5) as noted in the âRecommendations for the authorsâ, including simplifying visual encodings and improving labeling. We have also updated Table 2 to explicitly indicate the animal ID and brain regions associated with each data point shown in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors comment on several factors that may influence peak expression levels, including serotype, promoter, titer, tag, and DREADD type, they do not comment on the volume of injection. The range in volume used per region in this study is between 2 and 54 microliters, with larger volumes typically (but not always) being used for cortical regions like the OFC and dlPFC, and smaller volumes for subcortical regions like the amygdala and putamen. This may weaken the claim that there is no significant relationship between peak expression level and brain region, as volume may be considered a confounding variable. Additionally, because of the possibility that larger volumes of viral vectors may be more likely to induce an immune response, which the authors suggest as a potential influence on transgene expression, not including volume as a factor of interest seems to be an oversight.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We agree that injection volume could act as a confounding variable, particularly since larger volumes were used in only handheld cortical injections. This overlap makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of volume from those of brain region or injection method. Moreover, data points associated with these larger volumes also deviated when volume was included in the model.</p><p>To address this, we performed a separate analysis restricted to injections delivered via microinjector, where a comparable volume range was used across cases. In this subset, we included injection volume as additional factor in the model and found that volume did not significantly impact peak expression levels. Instead, the presence of co-expressed protein tags remained a significant predictor, while viral titer no longer showed a significant effect. These updated results have replaced the originals in the revised Results section and in the new Figure 5. We have also revised the Discussion to reflect these updated findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude that vectors encoding co-expressed protein tags (such as HA) led to reduced peak expression levels, relative to vectors with an IRES-GFP sequence or with no such element at all. While interesting, this finding does not necessarily seem relevant for the efficacy of long-term expression and function, given that the authors show in Figures 1 and 2 that peak expression (as indicated by a change in binding potential relative to non-displaced radioligand, or ÎBPND) appears to taper off in all or most of the constructs assessed. The authors should take care to point out that the decline in peak expression should not be confused with the decline in longitudinal expression, as this is not clear in the discussion; i.e. the subheading, &quot;Factors influencing DREADD expression,&quot; might be better written as, &quot;Factors influencing peak DREADD expression,&quot; and subsequent wording in this section should specify that these particular data concern peak expression only.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important clarification. In response, we have revised the title to &quot;Protein tags reduce peak DREADD expression levels&quot; in the Results section and âFactors influencing peak DREADD expression levelsâ in the Discussion section. Additionally, we specified that our analysis focused on peak ÎBP<sub>ND</sub> values around 60 days post-injection. We have also explicitly distinguished these findings from the later-stage changes in expression seen in the longitudinal PET data in both the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Will any of these datasets be made available to other researchers upon request?</p></disp-quote><p>All data used to generate the figures have been made publicly available via our GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/minamimoto-lab/2024-Nagai-LongitudinalPET.git">https://github.com/minamimoto-lab/2024-Nagai-LongitudinalPET</ext-link>). This has been stated in the &quot;Data availability&quot; section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Suggested modifications to figures:</p><p>a) In Figures 2B and C, the inclusion of &quot;serotype&quot; as a separate legend with individual shapes seems superfluous, as the serotype is also listed as part of the colour-coded vector</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the serotype legend was redundant since this information is already included in the color-coded vector labels. In response, we have removed the serotype shape indicators and now represent the data using only vector-construct-based color coding for clarity in Figure 2B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Figures 3A and B, it would be nice to see tics (representing agonist administration) for all subjects, not just the two that are exemplified in panels C-D and F-H. Perhaps grey tics for the non-exemplified subjects could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have included black and white ticks to indicate all agonist administration across all subjects in Figure 3A and B, with the type of agonist clearly specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In Figure 4C, a Nissl- stained section is said to demonstrate the absence of neuronal loss at the vector injection sites. However, if the neuronal loss is subtle or widespread, this might not be easily visualized by Nissl. I would suggest including an additional image from the same section, in a non-injected cortical area, to show there is no significant difference between the injected and non-injected region.</p></disp-quote><p>To better demonstrate the absence of neuronal loss at the injection site, we have included an image from the contralateral, non-injected region of the same section for comparison (Fig. 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In Figure 5A: is it possible that the hM3Dq construct with a titer of 5Ã10^13 gc/ml is an outlier, relative to the other hM3Dq constructs used?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important observation. To evaluate whether the high-titer constructs represented a statistical outlier that might artifactually influence the observed trends, we performed a permutation-based outlier analysis. This assessment identified this point in question, as well as one additional case (titer 4.6 x 10e13 gc/ml, #255, L_Put), as significant outlier relative to the distribution of the dataset.</p><p>Accordingly, we excluded these two data points from the analysis. Importantly, this exclusion did not meaningfully alter the overall trend or the statistical conclusionsâspecifically, the significant effect of co-expressed protein tags on peak expression levels remain robust. We have updated the Methods section to describe this outlier handling and added a corresponding note in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>This study is a meta-analysis of several experiments performed in one lab. The good side is that it combined a large amount of data that might not have been published individually; the downside is that all things were not planned and equated, creating a lot of unexplained variances in the data. This was yet judiciously used by the authors, but one might think that planned and organized multicentric experiments would provide more information and help test more parameters, including some related to inter-individual variability, and particular genetic constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this important point to our attention. We fully acknowledge that the retrospective nature of our datasetâcompiled from multiple studies conducted within a single laboratoryâintroduces variability related to differences in injection parameters and scanning timelines. While this reflects the practical realities and constraints of long-term NHP research, we agree that more standardized and prospectively designed studies would better control such source of variances. To address this, we have added the following statement to the &quot;Technical consideration&quot; section in Discussion:</p><p>Lines 297, &quot;This study included a retrospective analysis of datasets pooled from multiple studies conducted within a single laboratory, which inherently introduced variability across injection parameters and scan intervals. While such an approach reflects real-world practices in long-term NHP research, future studies, including multicenter efforts using harmonized protocols, will be valuable for systematically assessing inter-individual differences and optimizing key experimental parameters.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I just have a few minor points that might help improve the paper:</p><p>(1) Figure 1C y-axis label: should add deltaBPnd in parentheses for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added âÎBP<sub>ND</sub>â to the y-axis label for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The choice of a sigmoid curve is the simplest clear fit, but it doesn't really consider the presence of the peak described in the paper. Would there be a way to fit the dynamic including fitting the peak?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that using a simple sigmoid curve for modeling expression dynamics is a limitation. In response to this and a similar comment from Reviewer #3, we tested a double logistic function (as suggested) to see if it better represented the rise and decline pattern. However, as described below, the original simple sigmoid curve was a better fit for the data. We have included a discussion regarding this limitation of this analysis.

If the second then it means some peak values occurred after 80 days and data are not completely re-aligned.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. The normalization was based on the peak value observed between 40â80 days post-injection, as this window typically captured the peak expression phase in our dataset (see Figure 1). However, in some long-term cases where PET scans were limited during this periodâe.g., with one scan performing at day 40âit is possible that the actual peak occurred later. Therefore, instances where ÎBP<sub>ND</sub> values slightly exceeded the reference peak at later time points likely reflect this sampling limitation. We have clarified this methodological detail in the revised Results section to improve transparency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods section mentions the use of CNO but this is not in the main paper which seems to state that only DCZ was used: the authors should clarify this</p></disp-quote><p>Although DCZ was the primary agonist used, CNO and C21 were also used in a few animals (e.g., monkeys #153, #221, and #207) for behavioral assessments.

Additionally, we have updated the Methods section to clearly specify the use and dosage of DCZ, CNO, and C21, to avoid any confusion regarding the experimental design.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Minor weaknesses are related to a few instances of suboptimal phrasing, and some room for improvement in time course visualization and quantification.

These data were primary part of vector test studies, allowing for repeated PET scans within 150 days post-injection. In contrast, monkeys with cortical injectionsâincluding larger volumesâwere allocated to behavioral studies and therefore were not scanned as frequently during the early phase. We will clarify this rationale in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1: Not sure if a simple sigmoid is the best model for these, mostly peaking and then descending somewhat, curves. I suggest testing a more complex model, for instance, double logistic function of a type f(t) = a + b/(1+exp(-c*(t-d))) - e/(1+exp(-g*(t-h))), with the first logistic term modeling the rise to peak, and the second term for partial decline and stabilization</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs thoughtful suggestion to use a double logistic function to better model both the rising and declining phases of the expression curve. In response to this and similar comments from Reviewer #1, we tested the proposed model and found that, while it could capture the peak and subsequent decline, the resulting fit appeared less biologically plausible (See below). Moreover, model comparison using BIC favored the original simple sigmoid model (BIC = 61.1 vs. 62.9 for the simple and double logistic model, respectively). This information has been included in the revised figure legend for clarity.</p><p>Given these results, we retained the original simple sigmoid function in the revised manuscript, as it provides a sufficient and interpretable approximation of the early expression trajectoryâparticularly the peak expression-time estimation, which was the main purpose of this analysis. We have updated the Methods section to clarify our modeling and rationale as follows:</p><p>Lines 530, &quot;To model the time course of DREADD expression, we used a single sigmoid function, referencing past in vivo fluorescent measurements (Diester et al., 2011). Curve fitting was performed using least squares minimization. For comparison, a double logistic function was also tested and evaluated using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess model fit.&quot;</p><p>We also acknowledge that a more detailed understanding of post-peak expression changes will require additional PET measurements, particularly between 60- and 120-days post-injection, across a larger number of animals. We have included this point in the revised Discussion to highlight the need for future work focused on finer-grained modeling of expression decline:</p><p>Lines 317, âAlthough we modeled the time course of DREADD expression using a single sigmoid function, PET data from several monkeys showed a modest decline following the peak. While the sigmoid model captured the early-phase dynamics and offered a reliable estimate of peak timing, additional PET scansâparticularly between 60- and 120-days post-injectionâwill be essential to fully characterize the biological basis of the post-peak expression trajectories.â</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105815-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2: It seems that the individual curves are for different monkeys, I counted 7 in B and 8 in C, why &quot;across 11 monkeys&quot;?
