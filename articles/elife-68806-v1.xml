conserved process that is regulated at each step by specific factors. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we visualize the formation of the conserved peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the human mitochondrial ribosome. The conserved GTPase GTPBP7 regulates the correct folding of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helices and ensures 2ʹ-O-methylation of the PTC base U3039. GTPBP7 binds the RNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and MTERF4, which sequester H68-71 of the 16S rRNA and allow biogenesis factors to access the maturing PTC. Mutations that disrupt binding of their <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> orthologs to the large subunit potently activate mitochondrial stress and cause viability, development, and sterility defects. Next-generation RNA sequencing reveals widespread gene expression changes in these mutant animals that are indicative of mitochondrial stress response activation. We also answer the long-standing question of why NSUN4, but not its enzymatic activity, is indispensable for mitochondrial protein synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial ribosome</kwd><kwd>peptidyl transferase center</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>RNA modifications</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105184332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT096570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009344</institution-id><institution>Agouron Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001706</institution-id><institution>Louis-Jeantet Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C13474/A18583</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219475/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6946/A14492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092096/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GTPBP7, NSUN4, and MTERF4 facilitate maturation of the peptidyl transferase center of the mitochondrial ribosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are essential for the production and maintenance of the electron transport chain machinery. As with all other ribosomes, the biogenesis of mitoribosomes involves a complex series of coordinated steps during which the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) folds, proteins are incorporated and the active site is formed. The process is facilitated by specific biogenesis factors, including GTPases, rRNA modifying enzymes, RNA helicases, ribonucleases, chaperones, and other scaffolding and adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Studying this process in molecular detail is clinically important because defective mitoribosome assembly can lead to encephalomyopathy, optic neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and hereditary spastic paraplegia, among other disorders.</p><p>The general principles of ribosome assembly are well-conserved across species, but mitoribosome assembly has diverged in notable ways from, and involves different factors than bacterial 70S ribosomes. Analogous to bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes, mitoribosome assembly also proceeds via a series of quality-control checkpoints and GTP hydrolysis serves as the commitment step to drive the reaction forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Britton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karbstein, 2007</xref>). Four GTPases, GTPBP5, 6, 7, and 10 (and perhaps GTPBP8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maiti et al., 2021</xref>) directly bind the 16S rRNA of the 39S mitoribosomal large subunit (mtLSU) to facilitate its maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kotani et al., 2013</xref>), but their mechanistic roles and order of action remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human mtLSU in complex with GTPBP7, an RNA methyltransferase NSUN4 and an RNA scaffolding protein MTERF4, establish the importance of this complex during mitoribosome biogenesis in vivo and decipher the mechanism by which NSUN4·MTERF4·GTPBP7 ensure maturation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the mitochondrial ribosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To trap GTPBP7 and other GTPases that participate in human mitochondrial translation, we included the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog β,γ-methyleneguanosine 5′-triphosphate (GMPPCP) during mitoribosome purification.

These findings are similar to the effects observed when mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are knocked down by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>).

These results are consistent with the catalytic activity of NSUN-4 being dispensable for mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, NSUN-4 makes multiple contacts with the mitoribosome and the chosen M225A and K226A substitutions in NSUN-4 were likely insufficient to disrupt its interaction with the mitoribosome. We therefore introduced the additional mutations L286Y and A287Y, resulting in a dramatic mitochondrial stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare <italic>nsun-4</italic><sup>M225A,K226A</sup> and <italic>nsun-4</italic><sup>M225A,K226A,L286Y,A287Y</sup>).

Given the absence of antibodies against these proteins, we had to resort to a suitable alternative method of quantification.

More dramatic reductions would require all three proteins to be mutated simultaneously in the same strain, which was not done because these individual mutants already cause severe developmental defects, sterility, and poor viability.

The severity of the phenotypes of the <italic>nsun-4</italic>, <italic>mter-4</italic>, and <italic>mtg-1</italic> mtLSU binding mutants underscores the importance of the role of NSUN4/NSUN-4, MTERF4/MTER-4, and GTPBP7/MTG-1 in the mitochondrion. In addition, our results suggest that the effects of disrupting GTPBP7/MTG-1 and MTERF4/MTER-4 interactions with the mitoribosome can be overcome in somatic tissues, potentially by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, as mutant animals can indeed develop to adulthood. Germ cells, however, were particularly sensitive to these mutations, and disruption of mtLSU binding caused sterility. Notably, mutations in mitochondrial translational components, including mitochondrial tRNAs, are known to cause sterility in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demain et al., 2017</xref>). We suggest that germ cell sensitivity to disruptions in mitochondrial translation is a conserved phenomenon throughout metazoans and establish a new model to study these effects.</p><p>To further confirm the effects of disrupting the interaction of these proteins with the mitoribosome, we performed next-generation RNA sequencing on the viable <italic>mter-4</italic> mutants.

These results support our structural data and further suggest that disrupting the interaction of these proteins with the mitoribosome activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and disrupts normal mitochondrial function.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have previously reported the cryo-EM structures of two human late-stage mitoribosomal assembly intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). One intermediate (PDB 5OOM) lacks bL36m, contains the anti-association factors MALSU1·L0R8F8·mt-ACP, and awaits folding of ~20% of the 16S rRNA, including the entire PTC. The second intermediate (PDB 5OOL) comprises fully matured 16S rRNA and all ribosomal proteins, but is incompetent for subunit joining because the anti-association factors are still present. Several events must therefore occur around these intermediates, and the order of events can be inferred from the reasonable assumption that assembly proceeds outwards from the core of the mtLSU to the inter-subunit interface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). (a) bL36m must bind the mtLSU and pack against the folded domain V helices H89–93; (b) the only remaining domain II helices H34–35 must fold; (c) H65–67 of domain IV can also then fold; and finally, (d) H68–71 of domain IV can fold to yield a mature PTC.

We have thus shown, using structure-directed mutagenesis in vivo, that while the methyltransferase activity of NSUN4 on the small subunit can be dispensed with without resulting in a strong phenotype, the protein has a more important non-enzymatic function as a biogenesis factor in the final stages of the formation of the PTC and the tRNA binding sites in the large subunit.</p><p>The proper folding of the PTC, the universally conserved active site of the ribosome, along with the tRNA binding sites, is one of the crucial steps in the assembly of the large subunit. We conclude that this assembly occurs in multiple steps, moving from one in which the elements of the PTC are in a highly disordered state to one where they are ordered but not yet finally folded into their final structure in the large subunit. This assembly requires several protein factors to act together to yield the mature ribosomal subunit. By coupling cryo-EM analysis of human mitoribosome assembly intermediates with in vitro and in vivo studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have identified the physiological importance of three factors in an essential, conserved late-stage mtLSU maturation checkpoint. Although our studies were specifically on mitoribosomes, given the universally conserved nature of the PTC and its importance to the ribosome, we expect that other domains of life will have a similarly complex and orchestrated process requiring multiple factors to facilitate the formation of the active sites of the large ribosomal subunit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell line</title><p>PDE12<sup>−/−</sup> HEK293T cells that were used have previously been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>).

The work by Chandrasekaran et al., contributes to our understanding of the molecular details of mitochondrial ribosome assembly, and how disruptions to this pathway may cause human disease. Using cryo-EM, the authors identified a subpopulation of immature human mitochondrial large ribosomal subunits that interact with assembly factors NSUN4, MTERF4 and GTPBP7. Based on this structure, they introduce mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of these assembly factors that are expected to disrupt binding to the large subunit, and they show that these mutants cause sterility and disrupt mitochondrial proteostasis in the mutant animals. They directly correlate the effect of mutating the mitoribosome binding surfaces on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of NSUN-4 and MTER-4 with reduced co-migration with mitoribosomes. The magnitude of reduction in binding correlates well with the mutations and their ability to activate mitochondrial stress.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Visualising formation of the ribosomal active site in mitochondria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Nikolaus Grigorieff as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.

However, the authors did not confirm that these mutants interrupt the interaction with the LSU and that the mutant proteins were expressed at or above the level of their wild type counterparts. This makes it difficult to determine whether the observed physiological effects were due to loss of this interaction or down-regulation of the proteins. The authors should show that these mutations disrupt binding of MTERF4 and GTPBP7, and that the mutant proteins are produced at or above wild type levels.</p><p>2) The loss of mitochondrial proteostasis observed by the authors could have been caused by the mutant proteins themselves being misfolded, mistargeted or aggregated, as has been described for other ribosome binding proteins. These issues should be addressed in the text.</p><p>3) The authors should include a figure showing the H. sapiens interaction interfaces from their model indicating the resides that are or are not conserved in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs to support their argument of high conservation of these interfaces.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Discussion</p><p>1.

The process by which these macromolecular complexes of eukaryotic ribosomes, in particular their mitoribosomes, assemble is poorly understood. However, high-resolution structures of maturation intermediates of these protein-rich mitoribosomes have just begun to emerge. The manuscript by Chandrasekaran and coworkers reports cryo-EM structures of human mitochondrial large (39S) ribosomal subunit in late assembly stages, in which the complexes were trapped using a non-hydrolysable analog of GTP. A variety of mitoribosomal complexes were isolated using extensive classification of the very large cryo-EM dataset. The major functional findings derived from the analyses of the 55S monosomal population from the same dataset was published last year by this group. As is usually the case, the mammalian mitoribosomal preparations carry a large pool of dissociated 39S subunit, a detailed analysis of 39S fraction is presented as part of this study. Authors identify six proteins that play specific roles in the 39S assembly process, three of which are positioned near the PTC of the 39S subunit, and apparently are involved in proper late-stage folding of the PTC's component rRNA, essential for the peptidyl transferase activity. In addition, authors correlate their structural findings with genetic and biochemical studies using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model organism. The study will be of interest to researcher working in the fields of translation, mitoribosome assembly, and in understanding the molecular mechanism of diseases associated with defects in mitoribosomal assembly. However, there is a major point that should be addressed, before the manuscript could be accepted for publication.</p><p>The comparison of structural work with human 39S subunit assembly intermediates with results of point mutations in C.elegans orthologs of the assembly factors provide a general biological link but lack direct structural correlation or comparison. A figure visualizing the locations (contact sites) of mutated <italic>C. elegans</italic> amino acids in the corresponding mammalian factors will help in a better understanding of the structural and functional correlations derived in the paper. For example, it could explain how the NSUN4 mutants described in line 133-134 could still be associated with the 39S subunit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68806.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors found that mutations in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of MTERF4 and GTPBP7 predicted from their model to interrupt the interaction with 16S rRNA cause sterility, mitochondrial proteotoxic stress and, for MTERF4, developmental delays.

We have therefore addressed these two questions by performing tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) on urea-solubilized total protein extracts to quantify the overall expression levels of MTER-4 and NSUN-4 in the mutant worms relative to wild-type worms. The results (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3) reveal that the mutants are expressed at comparable levels to the wild-type proteins (1.0 – 1.6-fold), indicating that they are not turned over or silenced by cells, a fate that often occurs to misfolded or over-expressed protein variants.</p><p>In parallel, we also isolated total ribosomes (cytosolic + mitochondrial) from these worms in non-denaturing, physiological buffer and compared the amounts of MTER-4 and NSUN-4 bound to mitoribosomes. As expected, complexes carrying these mutations associated with mitoribosomes at only 63 – 86% of wild-type levels. Note that more dramatic reductions would require all three proteins to be mutated simultaneously in the same strain, which was not done because these individual mutants already cause severe developmental defects, sterility and poor viability.</p><p>Finally, the mutations were designed to disrupt solvent exposed sidechains at the mitoribosome binding interface and are not likely therefore to disrupt protein folding. This fact is again confirmed by AlphaFold 2-predicted structures of these mutants (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The loss of mitochondrial proteostasis observed by the authors could have been caused by the mutant proteins themselves being misfolded, mistargeted or aggregated, as has been described for other ribosome binding proteins.

GMPPCP is a well-characterized analog of GTP that has been used successfully to trap biologically relevant intermediates in many contexts, including other on-pathway elongation intermediates as in this publication above. It is perhaps possible that 39S assembly intermediates bound to the other GTPases relevant to 39S assembly, such as GTPBP6, are also present at very low abundance in this dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Grid preparation and Data collection</p><p>2.
