A 21-provider team validated overdue CCS indicated by electronic medical record data. To improve screening, CCS-only sessions were created during regular clinic hours (n=5) and weekends/evenings (n=8). Patients were surveyed on their experience. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>6126 charts were reviewed. Of the list of overdue patients, outreach was performed to 1375 patients to schedule the 13 sessions. A total of 459 (33%) of patients completed screening, 622 (45%) could not be reached, and 203 (15%) canceled or missed appointments. The proportion of total active patients who were up to date with CCS increased from 68% in March to 73% in August 2021. Survey results indicated high patient satisfaction, and only 42% of patients would have scheduled CCS without outreach.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated patient chart list and extra clinical sessions devoted entirely to CCS improved up-to-date CCS rates. However, high rates of unsuccessful outreach and cancelations limited sustainability. This information can be used by other community health centers to optimize clinical workflows for CCS. </p></sec><sec><title>Funding:</title><p>All funding was internal from EBNHC Adult Medicine, Family Medicine, and Women's Health Departments.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Reporting of aggregate data and operational details from this quality improvement project was approved by the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center Chief Medical and Chief Quality Officers.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data for figures attached to submission</p></sec><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-85724-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
