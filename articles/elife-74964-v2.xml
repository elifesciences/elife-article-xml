Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are the principal chemosensors in the GI tract, but investigation of their role in behavior has been limited by the difficulty of selectively targeting these cells in vivo. Here, we describe an intersectional genetic approach for manipulating EEC subtypes in behaving mice. We show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but have different effects on learning. Conditioned flavor preference is driven by release of cholecystokinin whereas conditioned taste aversion is mediated by serotonin and substance P. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by vagal and spinal afferents, respectively. These findings establish a cellular basis for how chemosensing in the gut drives learning about food.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>physiology</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK106399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1-NS116626</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004312</institution-id><institution>Eli Lilly and Company</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method for the genetic manipulation of enteroendocrine cells reveals how different intestinal cell types control food intake and drive post-ingestive learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the desire to eat is innate, our food choices are driven by learning. Thus, the foods you enjoy today are different from your preferences as a child, in part because you have learned to associate specific flavors with their post-ingestive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sclafani and Ackroff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamamoto and Ueji, 2011</xref>). This learning process causes nutrient-rich foods to become more rewarding and toxic substances to become aversive and is critical for guiding animals to choose safe and nutritious food sources in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myers and Sclafani, 2006</xref>). It also contributes to the motivational pull of energy-dense foods in modern society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kern et al., 1993</xref>). For these reasons, it is critical to establish where in the body ingested nutrients and toxins are detected to drive learning, and whether these parallel processes of food reward and aversion involve dedicated cell types, signals, and pathways.</p><p>One of the first sites of post-ingestive chemosensing is the epithelium of the small intestine, which contains a family of specialized sensory cells known as enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaenssens et al., 2018</xref>). EECs exist as multiple subtypes and express receptors and transporters that allow them to monitor the chemical contents of the intestinal lumen. In response to detection of chemical cues, EECs release an array of hormones that include CCK, GIP, GLP-1, PYY, SST, and 5-HT. These molecules can act on local sensory neurons in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaelberer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latorre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al., 2021</xref>) or on distant organs via the circulation to modulate digestion, metabolism and appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaenssens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gribble and Reimann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Najjar et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, EECs link the detection of chemicals in the gut to the feedback regulation of behavior and physiology.</p><p>Given their sensory capabilities, EECs are attractive candidates to drive learning about the post-ingestive effects of different foods. However, investigation of their role in behavior has been hindered by the lack of methods for selectively manipulating these cells in vivo. EECs are sparsely scattered throughout the intestinal epithelium (~1% of cells), undergo rapid turnover (~1 week), and cannot be targeted with viral injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polyak et al., 2008</xref>). While there are marker genes that distinguish EEC subtypes from each other, these genes are also broadly expressed in other tissues that regulate metabolism and appetite, including, critically, sensory neurons throughout the gut. Thus, we lack the capability to directly probe the key nutrient sensors in the GI tract, creating a fundamental gap in our ability to study gut-brain signaling.</p><p>Here, we describe a general strategy for genetic access to a spectrum of EEC subtypes in vivo. We show that this approach can be used to target actuators to EECs selectively relative to all other cells in the body and thereby control the release of their natural cocktail of hormones at their endogenous sites in the intestine. Using this technique, we show that multiple EEC subtypes inhibit food intake but generate opposing valence signals that create either learned aversion or preference for specific foods. These positive and negative valence signals are transmitted by parallel gut-brain pathways that involve distinct neurotransmitters and afferent sensory neurons. These findings establish a cellular basis for how chemosensing in the GI tract is used to drive learning about food and provide a methodological resource for the further investigation of EEC function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first profiled the molecular diversity of EECs in the proximal intestine using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Due to their sparsity, EECs are difficult to characterize comprehensively even when sequencing is performed on a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GrÃ¼n et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haber et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore enriched for EECs prior to sequencing by labeling all cells derived from the common EEC progenitor using <italic>Neurog3-Cre R26<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice and then sorting tdTomato+ cells from the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This lineage-tracing method captures EECs at any stage after differentiation and yielded 7001 cells (with 2,168 EECs) for analysis. We then integrated our scRNA-seq data with a complementary dataset (2337 cells with 1244 EECs) that used a pulse-trace reporter <italic>Neurog3<sup>Chrono</sup></italic> to transiently label EECs at an early stage after differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gehart et al., 2019</xref>). These two datasets differentially enriched for cell types depending on the timing after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D and E</xref>) and together provide more complete coverage of EEC subtypes than either individually.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular diversity of intestinal EECs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of strategies to enrich EECs for the scRNA-Seq.

We observed two well-segregated clusters of enterochromaffin cells that correspond to early and late-stage cells (EC1 and EC2).

We also observed three EEC clusters that share high expression of the peptide hormone <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Sct</italic>. Two of these clusters correspond to the canonical N/L cells (<italic>Cck/Gcg/Pyy</italic>) and I cells (CCK), whereas the third uniquely co-expresses <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Tph1</italic> (cluster EC/EEC). This third population has not been reported in other recent single-cell sequencing studies but likely corresponds to CCK+/5-HT+ cells that have been described immunohistochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2016</xref>).

As a result, EECs have not been subject to the kinds of acute and targeted manipulations that have been critical for unravelling how circuits in the brain and peripheral nervous system control feeding behavior.</p><p>Here, we have described a general strategy for genetic access to a spectrum of EEC subtypes for functional manipulations in behaving mice. This approach uses Flp and Cre drivers as sequential selectivity filters to progressively restrict transgene expression to the intestinal epithelium and then to cell types within that structure. This makes it possible to target rare EEC subsets (each &lt;1% of epithelial cells) with high efficiency (&gt;90% labeling) and undetectable recombination in off-target tissues. Importantly, these tools can be combined with a variety of existing dual recombinase reporter mice to deliver actuators (e.g. DREADDs or opsins) to different EEC subsets, thereby opening the door to systematic functional exploration of these cells in vivo.</p><p>For this study, we assembled a panel of Cre drivers that label either all EECs (<italic>Fev-Cre</italic>) or non-overlapping subsets that collectively span much of EEC diversity (<italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Sst<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ghrl<sup>Cre</sup></italic>). While these markers define canonical EEC subtypes, other classes of Cre drivers could be used to investigate cross-sections of EECs that vary along different dimensions. For example, the expression of nutrient receptors and transporters may define EEC subpopulations that have a shared chemosensory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, in this study, we have not explored how the function of these molecularly defined EEC subsets varies with location in the intestine, but this could be addressed by combining the genetic approach described here with tools for wireless optogenetics in visceral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Manipulations of hormones versus cell types</title><p>Our understanding of how EECs modulate behavior is based primarily on studies of the hormones they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaenssens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myers and Sclafani, 2006</xref>). While much has been learned from this pioneering work, all EECs express more than one hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fothergill and Furness, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grunddal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Habib et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sykaras et al., 2014</xref>), and these hormone cocktails are not released directly into blood but rather into the lamina propria in the vicinity of the axons of vagal and spinal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Latorre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Najjar et al., 2020</xref>). Some EECs likely form direct synaptic connections with these afferent terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaelberer et al., 2018</xref>), and different hormones can be packaged into distinct vesicle pools within the same EEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fothergill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fothergill and Furness, 2018</xref>). This spatial and functional organization of EECs creates potential mechanisms for the same hormone to have different effects depending on where it is released.</p><p>We investigated this by directly stimulating EEC subtypes in vivo and measuring the effect on behavior, which revealed many instances of divergence between EEC activation and hormone pharmacology. For example, we found that direct stimulation of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> cells both inhibits feeding and produces robust conditioned flavor preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), despite the fact that systemic injection of many of the individual hormones produced by these cells induces aversion at doses that inhibit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelikani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch and Hardy, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ervin et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ervin et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halatchev and Cone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanoski et al., 2012</xref>). We also found that the same hormone produced by different EECs can have different functions. For example, a PYY receptor antagonist blocked the anorexia produced by stimulation of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> cells but not <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> cells, even though PYY was expressed by subsets of both EECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Conversely, a 5-HT3R antagonist blocked the anorectic effect of stimulating <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> but not <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> EECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), although many <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> EECs also produce 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These observations are consistent with the idea that EEC signaling is highly organized within the lamina propria, such that neurotransmitters released by EEC subtypes are funneled to specific sensory pathways. The ability to selectively access EEC subtypes for genetic manipulations will enable further studies that map these visceral circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Gut-brain pathways for food reward and aversion</title><p>Post-ingestive signals shape our decisions about what to eat and can override innate preferences, such that animals learn to prefer bitter foods that are nutritious and avoid sweet substances that are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kern et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Myers and Sclafani, 2006</xref>). The gut epithelium is the interface between ingested food and the body and is poised to provide feedback about ingested food that drives learning. However, it has been unclear to what extent there are dedicated sensors in the epithelium that encode the values of ingested substances and drive food preference versus aversion. We therefore investigated the role of EEC subtypes in this process of learning about food.</p><p>The major finding from these experiments was that stimulation of two different EEC types was sufficient to drive either food preference or aversion, and that the effects of these cells were mediated by parallel gut-brain pathways that involve distinct hormones and afferent nerves. Acquisition of food preference was driven by stimulation of EECs labeled by <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> or <italic>Gcg<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and was blocked by antagonists against CCKAR but not any other hormone produced by these cells. Of note, prior work has shown that CCK injections can induce flavor preference at low doses that do not affect feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">PÃ©rez and Sclafani, 1991</xref>) and aversion at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch and Hardy, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ervin et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ervin et al., 1995b</xref>). Our data show that direct stimulation of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> cells can simultaneously produce both satiety and food reward.</p><p>The effect of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> cells on satiety and food preference required intact vagal afferents, but not spinal afferents, which is consistent with an extensive literature showing that the vagus nerve mediates many of CCKâs effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joyner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raybould, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritter and Ladenheim, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 1985</xref>). The CCKAR is expressed in multiple vagal subtypes, including IGLE mechanoreceptors that innervate the stomach (<italic>Glp1r</italic>+) and intestine (<italic>Oxtr</italic>+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams et al., 2016</xref>). These IGLE subtypes inhibit food intake when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2019</xref>) and are required for the reduction in feeding following CCK injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2021</xref>) and therefore likely contribute to the effects of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> EECs on food intake. It is less clear which vagal cells mediate CCKâs effects on flavor preference, although stimulation of all gut-innervating vagal afferents is reinforcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2018</xref>). One plausible candidate is the <italic>Vip</italic>+/<italic>Uts2b</italic>+vagal neurons that innervate the intestinal mucosa and express high levels of CCKAR but do not inhibit food intake when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral 5-HT has been implicated in numerous processes including GI motility, secretion, vasoconstriction, bone growth, inflammation, visceral malaise, metabolism, and appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mawe and Hoffman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spohn and Mawe, 2017</xref>). Enterochromaffin cells are the major source of 5-HT in the gut, and we found that direct stimulation of <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-labeled enterochromaffin cells acutely inhibited food intake and caused dramatic CTA. The inhibition of food intake required 5-HT signaling, whereas the CTA could be fully prevented only by simultaneously blocking receptors for two hormones produced by these cells during training (5-HT3R and TACR1). This is consistent with the hypothesis that some biological functions of EECs are encoded in their ability to release cocktails of hormones with redundant functions.</p><p>Intestinal serotonin can activate both vagal and spinal pathways, but we found that only spinal afferents were required for the reduction in food intake and CTA triggered by stimulation of enterochromaffin cells. This may be mediated by 5-HT3R-expressing spinal afferents that innervate the distal intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hockley et al., 2019</xref>), are functionally coupled to enterochromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellono et al., 2017</xref>), and are poised to transmit aversive visceral signals (such as abdominal pain) that are sensitive to 5-HT3R antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gebhart and Bielefeldt, 2016</xref>). Of note, many vagal sensory neurons also express 5-HT3Rs, and our findings do not rule out a role for those cells in nausea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babic and Browning, 2014</xref>) or non-aversive satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savastano and Covasa, 2007</xref>). However, we did not observe either aversion or 5-HT3R-sensitive anorexia following stimulation of <italic>Cck<sup>Cre</sup></italic> EECs (which act via the vagus and also produce 5-HT). The ability to manipulate EEC subtypes in vivo should enable further studies that investigate how these pathways coordinate diverse physiology using a small set of neurochemical signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals were maintained in temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities with 12 hr light-dark cycle and ad libitum access to water and standard chow (PicoLab 5053).

The CFP were performed on 6 consecutive days during the light cycle.</p><p>Prior to each day of the CFP experiment, mice were water deprived overnight (15 hr). On day 1, the baseline choice of flavored solution was examined using two-bottle test. Mice were given access to two flavored solution in the Coulbourn behavior chamber for 10 min. These two bottle tests were performed in four trials in the same day with about 1 hr between each trial. Positions of the two bottles were swapped in trials 2 &amp; 4 versus trial 1 &amp; 3 to eliminate the effect of bottleâs position on animalâs preference.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Alexander Chesler as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and we have drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, the reviews are overall positive, and the reviewers agreed this is a useful dataset and important technical approach to understand and study EEC function. While no new experiments are requested, we are asking for significant edits. We'd like to see the data presented in a manner that allows the reader to identify and understand the key findings. For example, representative images should better match the quantified data and some information would seem better suited as supplemental figures; we would also like more informative figure legends. Questions were also raised the interpretation of some of findings and worry that some of the descriptions are overstated. For example, since food intake in a hungry mouse might be inhibited by many things including visceral distress or by a feeling of satiety, it is perhaps less surprising than the manuscript suggests that activation of different EEC populations have distinct effects on associative learning. Similarly, are the appetitive effects described really robust? We would like better clarification on the methods. For example, given the conditioning effects of EEC activation, the methods should provide details about the order in which mice were treated with drugs in the pharmacological survey, and whether treatment order was counterbalanced. One reviewer asked that the references be expanded to include previous work in the field, where appropriate. Finally, questions were raised about the variability of the control data that seem greater than other studies so we would like these at least commented on.</p><p>The complete reviews are included below. Please provide point by point responses to both the comments above and each reviewer when you submit your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some points that if address would enhance the manuscript:</p><p>1) While I'm mostly positive about the work, I found the data presentation confusing and at times almost impenetrable. While transparency in data reporting is welcomed, the way it is presented here made it very difficult to identify and evaluate the key findings.</p><p>2) Additionally, the large variation across controls is somewhat surprising, given feeding assays like these in hungry mice tend to be very robust and reproducible across strains. In some cases, the difference across strains seems larger than the manipulations.</p><p>3) The figures are full of control information that could (and should) be in supplementary figures. For the most part the authors are comparing Tac1 vs CCK-positive EECs and the main figures would benefit from focusing on these two groups of cells.</p><p>4) Lastly, the example images in Figure 2H seem to have little correlation with the numbers quantified data in 2I. Furthermore, in 2I, the data are plotted differently in the right and left histograms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some points to consider for making the manuscript more informative to the reader:</p><p>1. Figure 2: it is very difficult to understand exactly what is being plotted in (i) and how it relates to the data shown in (h) and the supplement e.g., Tac1-Cre vs SubP.</p><p>2. Figure 3 shows food intake varies widely in vehicle treated mice and has very different dynamics in the various experimental animals suggesting mechanisms for suppression of intake might be different for different drivers. Similarly, in Figure 4, the effects of CNO also vary between groups making the effects of antagonists potentially misleading. The authors may wish to reassess or at least should explain some of these aspects. As another example of the sorts of problems a reader faces, Figure 4a is entitled: Tac1Cre EEC induced feeding inhibition requires 5-HT3R, but this does not seem an accurate reflection of the data or to fit with the title of Figure 4 figure supplement 1a: Tac1Cre EEC induced feeding inhibition requires TACR1 and NPY2R, which also doesn't fit what the figure seems to show.</p><p>3. The data in Figure 4 and Figure 4 figure supplement 1 on conditioned taste aversion are at first sight compelling but are also quite confusing in that preference index and intake ratio often do not match up. The authors comment that vagotomy decreases water intake (and show this in Figure 5 figure supplement 1), but it is unclear how that would fit with other lick data shown after vagotomy that don't seem to change. Moreover, there are also discrepancies between the preference index and the intake ratio when inhibitors are used. Therefore, it is difficult to assess if for example RP reverses all CTA as would seem from intake ratio or if ODS and RP have additive effects as suggested by preference index. Clearly, the conclusions drawn are affected by the choice of assay that is considered most relevant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74964.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, the reviews are overall positive, and the reviewers agreed this is a useful dataset and important technical approach to understand and study EEC function.

For all experiments involving food intake measurements, mice were provided, in between tests, with ad libitum access in their home cage to the same test pellets used during testing. We have previously shown that this can prevent mice from developing conditioned associations with the test pellets that promote or inhibit consumption (Chen, Lin et al. 2016). We confirmed this here by measuring food intake in the absence of CNO/antagonist at multiple timepoints before and after testing each set of drugs. For experiments involving conditioning (CFP and CTA), we used naÃ¯ve mice, and those mice were not used again in any subsequent experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer asked that the references be expanded to include previous work in the field, where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the references related to vagotomy requested by the reviewer.

Briefly, we do not believe the control data is unusually variable, and we control for any variability by including both genotype controls (mutant versus littermate) and within-animal comparisons (e.g. drug vs. vehicle; before and after training). The latter provide an internal control for variability in baseline food intake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some points that if address would enhance the manuscript:</p><p>1) While I'm mostly positive about the work, I found the data presentation confusing and at times almost impenetrable.

However, the effect we report for <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> is all-or-none, and this effect is replicated using independent cohorts of animals in Figure 5 and 6.</p><p>Measurements of conditioned flavor preference (in Figures 4, 5 and 6) are inherently variable compared to simple food intake measurements, because each animal starts with an idiosyncratic preference and the overall effect sizes are smaller. However, we control for these sources of variation by including genetic controls (co-housed littermates +/- Cre/Flp) as well as within-animal controls (drug vs. saline; before and after training) in almost every experiment. The within-animal comparisons control for baseline differences. Moreover, we replicate the key flavor preference results from Figure 4 with independent cohorts of mice in Figures 5 and 6.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that vagotomy (Figure 6) causes well-known changes in baseline food intake, and these changes can be variable between animals. For this reason, the analysis of these experiments focuses on within animal comparisons (+/- drug or before/after training).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The figures are full of control information that could (and should) be in supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the sentiment that some of the figures can seem complex due to the many controls. For the reasons stated above, we believe the control data is critical for evaluating the claims in the paper, and this control data is easier to evaluate if it is situated side-by-side with the experimental data on the same axes (as opposed to moved to the supplement).</p><p>To make the figures easier to interpret, we have extensively expanded the figure legends to highlight the relevant comparisons and spell out in detail the interpretation. For example, in the revised legend for Figure 5a,b we state explicitly which bars the reader should focus on for the key comparison. We have also made subtle changes to the layout so that the experimental groups are clearly highlighted and the control groups are deemphasized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the most part the authors are comparing Tac1 vs CCK-positive EECs and the main figures would benefit from focusing on these two groups of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the comparison between TAC1 and CCK is the focus of the functional experiments in the paper. Figures 5 and 6 present data only from TAC1 and CCK cells. Figures 1 presents global RNA-seq data and so by necessity include data from all cell types. Figure 2 contains RNA-seq data that is focused primarily on CCK cells. Figures 3 and 4 describe the development and validation of the method and the initial screen of cell types, and so by necessity include data from the other cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lastly, the example images in Figure 2H seem to have little correlation with the numbers quantified data in 2I.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 3H,I (formerly 2H,I) was confusing.

The authors may wish to reassess or at least should explain some of these aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we feel that the responses to CNO in Figure 4a and 4b are reasonably consistent given the number of independent experiments that are shown. It is important to note that we do not use the exact same animals for every drug tested in Figure 4a and 4b (due to cohort attrition, the timing of experiments, etcâ¦), which likely contributes to some baseline variability between subpanels. However, the key statistical comparisons are within-animal, and we use the same cohort of animals for all the tests within each subpanel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As another example of the sorts of problems a reader faces, Figure 4a is entitled: Tac1Cre EEC induced feeding inhibition requires 5-HT3R, but this does not seem an accurate reflection of the data or to fit with the title of Figure 4 figure supplement 1a: Tac1Cre EEC induced feeding inhibition requires TACR1 and NPY2R, which also doesn't fit what the figure seems to show.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this mistake. The title of Figure 5- Supplement 1a (formerly Figure 4- Supplement 1a) has now been corrected so that it matches Figure 5a.</p><p>Figure 5a (formerly 4a) and the supplement both show that a 5-H3TR antagonist significantly reduces the inhibition of feeding caused by Tac1 stimulation. Based on this, we state in the figure title that 5-HT3R is required for this effect. The figures also show that the effect of the 5-HT3R antagonist may be enhanced by combination with a TACR1 antagonist, although the TACR1 antagonist on its own has no effect. We did not incorporate these additional observations into the figure title because they cannot be concisely described.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data in Figure 4 and Figure 4 figure supplement 1 on conditioned taste aversion are at first sight compelling but are also quite confusing in that preference index and intake ratio often do not match up.</p></disp-quote><p>The major difference between in Figure 5c (formerly 4c) and the supplement 5e is that RP alone partially blocks the effect on choice but completely blocks the effect on intake during training. However, it is clear from examining Supplemental Figure 5e that there is high variability in the RP intake data during training (the data are essentially bimodal) and this variability is reduced in the Ods/RP combination. It is not uncommon for the choice and intake tests to give slightly different results, because the choice test is performed on animals that have completed two days of training, whereas the intake measurement is performed after one day of training and so animals have more variable levels of learning. The choice test is also intrinsically more sensitive to preference than intake, because the animals have a choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors comment that vagotomy decreases water intake (and show this in Figure 5 figure supplement 1), but it is unclear how that would fit with other lick data shown after vagotomy that don't seem to change.</p></disp-quote><p>Vagotomy causes gastroparesis that typically slows food and water consumption, and other lick data in the paper show that vagotomy reduces intake, although the effects are somewhat smaller; e.g., in Figure 6b,c (formerly 5b,c) compare the gray bars with and without vagotomy. In Figure 6, the combination of vagotomy and CTA training with Tac1 resulted in very low intake of both fluids in the final choice test. This may be due to a generalized aversion to the testing conditions caused by the combination of vagotomy and a repeated negative stimulus. Whatever the cause, the small number of licks in the choice test made the results difficult to interpret. For this reason, we emphasized the training data in this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, there are also discrepancies between the preference index and the intake ratio when inhibitors are used. Therefore, it is difficult to assess if for example RP reverses all CTA as would seem from intake ratio or if ODS and RP have additive effects as suggested by preference index. Clearly, the conclusions drawn are affected by the choice of assay that is considered most relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the comment above. We believe that if there are sufficient licks for a meaningful comparison, the choice test is the most relevant assay, because it is performed on animals that have completed the training and because it is more sensitive to preference. Regardless, we present all of this in the paper, including the raw data in the Source Data files, so that readers can evaluate the results for themselves.</p><p>References</p><p>Chen, Y., et al.
