hepatotoxicity are major causes of drug attrition. To decrease late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries need to establish biologically relevant models that use phenotypic screening to detect drug-induced toxicity in vitro. In this study, we sought to rapidly detect patterns of cardiotoxicity using high-content image analysis with deep learning and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We screened a library of 1280 bioactive compounds and identified those with potential cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs using a single-parameter score based on deep learning. Compounds demonstrating cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs included DNA intercalators, ion channel blockers, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We also screened a diverse library of molecules with unknown targets and identified chemical frameworks that show cardiotoxic signal in iPSC-CMs. By using this screening approach during target discovery and lead optimization, we can de-risk early-stage drug discovery. We show that the broad applicability of combining deep learning with iPSC technology is an effective way to interrogate cellular phenotypes and identify drugs that may protect against diseased phenotypes and deleterious mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>iPSC-CMs</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>high-content screen</kwd><kwd>cardiotoxicity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep learning combined with induced pluripotent stem cell technology is an effective method to interrogate cellular phenotypes and predict patterns of cardiotoxicity in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug development is a lengthy and expensive endeavor, often requiring an estimated 10 years and $0.8–2.6 billion. The cost—and risk—grows exponentially as drugs advance toward the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiMasi et al., 2016</xref>). To reduce costs and risk, pharmaceutical companies need effective screening methods to prevent drug attrition at late stages of the development process.</p><p>Major causes of therapeutic attrition are drug-induced toxicity, including cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity alone accounts for approximately one-third of drugs withdrawn due to safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weaver and Valentin, 2019</xref>). To decrease the potential for toxicity, and for late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries seek in vitro systems that can identify drug-induced toxicity with phenotypic screening at early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). This screening enables interrogation of a large number of perturbagens (e.g., small molecules, siRNAs, CRISPR gRNAs) in a target-agnostic assay that measures phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eder et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Some of the best in vitro models rely on human primary cells isolated directly from tissues. These models retain the morphological and physiological characteristics of their tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaur and Dufour, 2012</xref>). However, the supply of primary cells is finite. Primary cells also have limited potential for proliferation, are technically complicated to culture for long periods, and are difficult to genetically manipulate. As a result, scientists often turn to immortalized cell lines, such as HEK293T cells, HepG2 human liver cancer cells, and HL-1 cardiac muscle cells. Many of these cell lines have been transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prager et al., 2019</xref>), which may cause karyotypic abnormalities, and they do not fully recapitulate their in vivo counterparts.</p><p>More recently, researchers have turned to cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). Cells derived from iPSCs more closely recapitulate human biology than immortalized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moffat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scannell and Bosley, 2016</xref>). These derived cells have been used for disease modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Judge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Bermejo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ribeiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), proposed for drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grskovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinton and Daley, 2012</xref>), and used to assess arrhythmogenic and structural liabilities of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddah et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, iPSCs can be derived from patients carrying deleterious mutations and genetically modified using nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Judge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kime et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandegar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyaoka et al., 2012</xref>). They can also be expanded to sufficient quantities and cultured for extended periods that facilitate screening at scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghazizadeh and Majd, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, iPSC-derived cell types enable high-throughput interrogation and screening using arrayed libraries of perturbagens.</p><p>As of early 2021, few studies have used iPSC-derived cells for phenotypic screening in a high-throughput manner that is truly scalable and, most importantly, has an assay readout with an appropriate window for screening and high signal-to-noise ratio. The screening window, commonly assessed using the Z-factor, ensures detection of true-positive hits and limits the number of false-negative and false-positive hits. Additionally, most published studies have been limited to single-readout phenotypes, such as cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), expression of a single marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghazizadeh and Majd, 2020</xref>), or reporter screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McLendon et al., 2017</xref>). While these studies revealed great insight into cardiomyocyte biology, they have not described a general and unbiased screening strategy that can be applied to other cell types and used at scale.</p><p>Given the limitation of single-readout assays, researchers have turned to high-content screening to assess cellular features using traditional image processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salick et al., 2020</xref>). However, they must first choose which feature to quantify from a vast array of possible cellular phenotypes, such as nuclear fragmentation, protein aggregation, cell density, organelle damage and distribution, and changes to cytoskeleton organization. While quantifying a combination of these features may reflect the true state or importance of the phenotype, this approach can be challenging. Researchers may need to develop a new algorithm for each feature, and then decide on the biological relevance of each parameter. This strategy is time-consuming and subject to bias.</p><p>An alternative approach uses machine learning to decipher cellular features at high accuracies. For example, deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, uses a set of machine-learning techniques to train neural networks and learn input data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>). Previously, we used phenotypic interrogation with deep learning to identify drug-induced structural toxicity in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maddah et al., 2020</xref>). Herein, we aimed to expand that work to induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in a high-content screen (HCS) of 1280 bioactive compounds with putative primary targets. We then sought to validate identified hits using orthogonal assays to assess cellular stress, including mitochondrial respiration and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Finally, we aimed to use our deep learning approach to screen a library of 1280 diverse compounds with no known targets and identify chemical structures and frameworks that show a cardiotoxicity signal in iPSC-CMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The Z-factor is a statistical measure of assay variability and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). We posited that using a cell density that was too high would tightly pack cells and mask features, whereas using a cell density that was too low would not generate sufficient features for training. Interestingly, as we increased the cell density, we did not observe a bell-shaped effect in the performance of the deep learning models. We found that the higher the cell density, the higher the model accuracy and, most importantly, the higher the Z-factor. At approximately 3000 cells per well of a 384-well plate, the model accuracy and Z-factor plateaued and did not decline with increasing cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>We also found that a minimum cell density is needed to ensure an appropriate screening window.

Higher cell densities yielded higher cellular content for feature training, and they reduced cell edges and background. In addition, more cell-cell contact between iPSC-CMs led to sarcomere alignment that may reduce heterogeneity in training images.

We used the same conditions as the bioactive library screen. However, to optimize the accuracy and applicability of the diverse library screen, we established a new set of training images and developed a new deep learning model that incorporated all generated datasets. From the 1280 diverse compounds, our deep learning approach identified 33 hits to cause cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). Analysis of the structure-activity relationship revealed three structural frameworks with two compounds (also classified as matched pairs) in each framework set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). For example, Framework 2a (cardiotoxicity score: 1.41) and its matched pair Framework 2b (cardiotoxicity score: 0.69) showed that adding an ethylene spacer increased the cardiomyocyte toxicity score by twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Based on this result, high-content phenotypic analysis using deep learning is a powerful approach to identifying chemical frameworks with cardiotoxic liabilities. By using this approach during the lead optimization process, we can de-risk a clinical development program and potentially reduce drug attrition in late-stage clinical trials.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Screen of diverse compound library and identified cardiotoxic chemical frameworks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cardiotoxicity scores of 1280 diverse compounds screened at 1 µM.

Patients given these drugs can develop cardiomyopathy, worsening heart rhythm, heart failure, and death due to cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moslehi, 2016</xref>). To identify proteasome inhibitors that may reduce cardiotoxic liability, we profiled the potency of 10 proteasome inhibitors using the Proteasome-Glo biochemical assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). For each inhibitor, we calculated the biochemical IC<sub>50</sub> and measured the cardiotoxicity score using deep learning. We identified six inhibitors with a similar range of biochemical potencies (~12 to ~25 nM): carfilzomib, bortezomib, epoxomicin, delanzomib, ixazomib, and oprozomib. Carfilzomib, bortezomib, and epoxomicin had the highest cardiotoxicity score; delanzomib showed the lowest cardiotoxicity liability; and ixazomib and oprozomib showed medium levels of cardiotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This analysis is an example of how this type of phenotypic screening would help to de-risk a small-molecule program at an early stage. By focusing on a chemical series (or pathway) that shows high levels of potency for the intended target, we can identify compounds in that series that limit undesired toxicity in a specific cell type with a major liability (such as cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we combined the power of human iPSC technology with high-content image analysis using deep learning to detect signatures of cardiotoxicity in a high-throughput chemical screen. First, we treated iPSC-CMs with drugs known to cause cardiotoxicity in the clinic. We combined the contractility readout, immunostaining, and nuclear count to stratify doses of compounds into defined categories: mildly toxic, toxic, and highly toxic. Next, we trained a neural network with fluorescently labeled images to classify the images by degrees of cardiotoxicity with a data-driven method. We then constructed three deep learning models to understand how the categories would differ based on how the toxicities were classified with imaging. We found that all models strongly agreed in identifying hits that cause cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs.</p><p>Our screening identified classes of compounds that clustered into distinct mechanisms of action and putative target classes. Some of the compounds with the most likely cardiotoxic liabilities included DNA intercalators and ion channel blockers, as well as EGFR, CDK, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We validated these hits using a second round of deep learning and orthogonal assays that measured mitochondrial respiration and evaluated BNP as a marker of stress.</p><p>Cardiomyocytes in the adult human heart contain approximately 30% mitochondria by cell volume. These mitochondria critically regulate many cellular processes, such as metabolism, oxidative stress, cell survival, and apoptotic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ventura-Clapier et al., 2011</xref>). The adult human myocardium is highly metabolically active. Approximately 70–80% of its energy derives from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria fueled by fatty acid–based oxidative phosphorylation. Conversely, in immature neonatal myocardium or iPSC-CMs, ATP production is predominately through the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sacchetto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siasos et al., 2018</xref>). In previous studies, exposing iPSC-CMs to various clinically approved compounds with known cardiotoxicities led to a dose-dependent decrease in mitochondrial function in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rana et al., 2012</xref>). Using mitochondrial bioenergetics in iPSC-CMs, we showed that cardiotoxic hits identified from our HCS negatively affected mitochondrial bioenergetics in iPSC-CMs, including reduced basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration rate.</p><p>Using RNA-seq analysis, we confirmed that iPSC-CMs treated with drugs identified using our phenotypic cardiotoxicity screening approach resulted in downregulation of key structural and developmental genes, including <italic>TCAP</italic>, <italic>MYL3</italic>, <italic>LDB3</italic>, <italic>DES</italic>, <italic>ANKRD1</italic>, <italic>NKX2-5</italic>, and <italic>GATA4</italic>. In addition, ssGSEA showed downregulation of pathways involved in cardiac muscle contraction, development, and differentiation, further validating our phenotypic screening approach to identifying cardiotoxic drugs.</p><p>Use of iPSC-derived models for cardiotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sirenko et al., 2017</xref>) and hepatotoxicity screening has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mann, 2015</xref>). Phenotypic assays with generic readouts, such as cell viability, are typically less sensitive in identifying subtle toxicity signatures and less likely to enable hit triaging at an early stage. Other toxicity assays in iPSC-CMs, such as electrophysiology and multi-electrode arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>), are not scalable for HTS. Instead, high-content imaging, such as used in this study, enables researchers to use more complex assays for HTS lead discovery.</p><p>Essential components are needed to build a useful deep learning neural network. For example, constructing a relatively large and annotated dataset can strengthen the model. In general, the larger the dataset, the better the performance of the model. In addition, the quality of the dataset determines the success of the deep learning model. For instance, a more homogenous set of images in well-controlled studies enables better model performance. Conversely, heterogeneity in the cells leads to less accurate and reliable models. Furthermore, the experimenter should ensure that the classes are balanced in the training dataset. Without this balance, the training dataset will display bias toward the most represented class, and in extreme cases, may completely ignore the minority class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Khoshgoftaar, 2019</xref>). In this study, we trained the model by feeding the neural network between 250 and 500 images of pure iPSC-CMs at high cell densities from each class. We also used eight drugs and hundreds of images from each drug to establish our training dataset. This approach ensured that we achieved a relatively large and balanced annotated dataset, while also reducing cellular heterogeneity. In future work in which researchers may aim to identify a cardiotoxicity score with deep learning using in vitro models, we recommend that they establish a deep learning model based on a large training dataset using known cardiotoxins based on clinical data. Then images from test articles can be analyzed through the neural net to compare the level of toxicity to reference cardiotoxic drugs.</p><p>Widespread use of deep learning methods in the biological sciences can be challenging. This challenge may be attributed to technical and cultural norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moen et al., 2019</xref>). For example, biological data is inherently complex, heterogeneous, and variable. Thus, a certain threshold of data and computational resources is needed for data annotation to build accurate and useful deep learning models. Another concern has been the ‘black box’ nature of the method, or not knowing exactly what features the deep learning net is identifying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moen et al., 2019</xref>). We propose that the black box is ‘a feature and not a bug’ of deep learning. We believe the black box allows researchers to interrogate a large set of perturbations in a cell-agnostic, unbiased, and high-throughput manner. Another advantage of deep learning is that deep neural networks significantly outperformed random forest by 22–27% in four measured metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Idakwo et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that this approach is more robust than traditional chemoinformatics analysis. Although we did not compare deep learning and chemoinformatics in this study, this comparison would be a valuable addition to future research.</p><p>In this study, we showcase the power of deep learning in uncovering new biological insights and how the technology can be more accessible to biologists. Deep learning can be used as an additional tool to interrogate subtle and difficult-to-define phenotypes. Our findings support that deep learning is a highly sensitive method to detect cardiotoxicity phenotypes that are undetectable by traditional single-readout assays. While the scope of our study was limited to identifying cardiotoxicity signatures in iPSC-CMs, the method can be applied to identifying toxicity in other cell types.</p><p>Screening using iPSC-derived cells with deep learning can also be applied to de-risk early-stage drug discovery and ensure that compounds with on- and off-target toxicity are triaged at an early stage in drug development. In particular, deep learning can be used to identify targets with high-throughput perturbation screening (using small molecules, siRNA, and CRISPR libraries). Our screening strategy is cell and modality agnostic, and it can be applied to a range of indications, such as orphan and neglected diseases. Thus, combining iPSC technology and deep learning can accelerate discovery efforts by supporting rapid model development and interrogation of targets that could be used in different areas of research and for multiple indications.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Crystal R Herron for editing the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Feixiong Cheng (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Comment 1– It is difficult to understand how this method (cardiotoxicity score) is predictive of clinical cardiotoxicity if the score is dependent on the training data and drugs used because clinical cardiotoxicity due to drug-induced effects will occur for drugs independently of what would be the surrogate of training data or reference drugs in clinical trials. Probably authors could avoid stating this method as predictive, but instead should present it as an approach for comparing potential cardiotoxic effects between new drugs and reference drugs without predicting clinical safety ranges. A drug can be safe if the range of efficacious concentrations is safely below the toxic range. If the authors still aim to demonstrate that the presented method is predictive of clinical data, a more reflected response to this comment is recommended, taking in consideration the current approaches in the field to test the clinical predictiveness of in vitro data. Since so much clinical and animal data is publicly available for several of the used drugs, it is unconceivable for approaches that aim to be predictive of clinical data to ignore these.</p><p>Comments 2 and 3 – There is no proof of principle results or proposed/ described comprehensive strategy or recommendations to predict clinical data from the results derived from this method. In line with the previous comment, the authors seem to be pretending that most of the used drugs are new drugs and that no clinical data is available. The authors also seem to pretend that clinical data is not currently predicted from in vitro cellular data to estimate safety ranges of drug concentration. The authors should rethink their response, especially when considering that some of the used drugs have been used for so long clinically. These are not investigational drugs. If authors want to &quot;pitch&quot; this method as predictive, please add information on how to predict clinical data from it considering how other authors in the field already predict clinical toxic drug effects (safety ranges) from in vitro cellular data. The results from at least one drug should be demonstrated to be predictive and not false-positives or false-negatives. Alternatively, this effort will not be necessary if authors remove from the manuscript any claims that this method is predictive of drug cardiotoxicity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68714.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The article lacks practical discussion, considerations and recommendations on how to validate the cardiotoxicity score when aiming to predict clinical drug cardiotoxicity, which will require comparing with clinical data.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we described the process of deep learning as a methodology. To use deep learning to predict a cardiotoxicity score, we recommend that researchers establish a deep learning model based on a large training dataset using known cardiotoxins based on clinical data (for example, we used eight drugs listed under Supplementary File 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and hundreds of images from each drug to establish our training dataset). Then images from test articles can be analyzed through the neural net to predict the level of toxicity. We added these details to the Discussion section. If researchers would like to use and/or access our deep learning models and images for their academic or commercial research, we invite them to contact the corresponding author at mandegar@tenayathera.com.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This reviewer recommends the authors to read the review manuscript by Walker and colleagues published in 2020 in the journal Archives of Toxicology and entitled &quot;The evolution of strategies to minimise the risk of human drug‑induced liver injury (DILI) in drug discovery and development&quot; to understand how the pharmaceutical industry uses image-based data to predict clinical toxicity.

We believe that drug toxicity may not be driven only by Cmax but also by AUC exposure (or both may depend on the off-targets). To elucidate which drug’s toxicity is driven by Cmax or AUC, we would need to conduct extensive and regulated follow-up studies based on human data and preclinical species surrogates. However, these studies would be molecule-specific based on analyses such as MetID and not comparable between molecules. Also, data from preclinical species would not be a good indicator for applying Cmax values to human cells. In our paper, the clinical data for the compounds we tested are limited in our libraries (they are composed of limited clinical molecules, preclinical tool molecules, and more). These diverse libraries lack published human pharmacokinetic data. We believe that this analysis would be helpful when more human data is generated and/or released in the public domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear how the deep learning approach outperform traditional approaches, such as doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf2584.</p></disp-quote><p>Sharma et al., (2017) evaluated cardiotoxicity mostly by measuring cytotoxicity and contractility (with a follow-up assay using calcium handling and targeted qPCR). To generate data for our deep learning training, we evaluated loss of contractility (Figure 2A-2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and cytotoxicity of eight known cardiotoxins through nuclear count (Figure 2D). We found that measuring cytotoxicity (either through loss of nuclear count or sarcomere intensity measured by MYBPC3 and ACTN2) and contractility did not provide the dynamic range suitable for high-throughput screening. For example, in Figure 4, we show that measuring nuclear count and sarcomere staining intensity did not provide the appropriate Z-factors for hit detection when the methodology is applied in a high-throughput manner.</p><p>With deep learning, we achieved Z-factors &gt;0.5, which provided a more reliable method for detecting subtle phenotypic differences with high-throughput screening. For example, a relatively low dose of bortezomib (0.1μM) would not be detected as cardiotoxic when using only cytotoxicity and sarcomere staining. But with deep learning, we can reliably detect patterns of toxicity through sarcomere damage (Figure 4). To clarify this idea, our Discussion section states:</p><p>“Our findings support that deep learning is a highly sensitive method to detect cardiotoxicity phenotypes that are undetectable by traditional single-readout assays.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For deep learning models, it is not clear how the authors perform hyperparameter tuning, a key issue for deep learning models.</p></disp-quote><p>We built our models using PhenoLearn, without changing the default parameters. For this study, we did not optimize hyper-parameter tuning, but our default values for the parameters were set based on thousands of images and hundreds of trainings we performed on cellular images. We have described some of this methodology in a published study by Maddah et al., 2020, which we referenced in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors are suggested to compared iPSC-based image-based deep learning models with traditional chemoinformatics approaches, such as random forest-based structure-activity relationships approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In our study, we did not perform traditional chemoinformatics, such as random forest-based structure-activity relationship analysis. We believe this analysis is outside the scope of our manuscript and better suited for a follow-up study. However, we revised our Discussion section to describe the lack of these data as a limitation that would be valuable to assess in a follow-up study. We also referenced a paper by Idakwo et al., 2019 in which deep neural networks significantly outperformed random forest by 22% to 27% in four measured metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The reviewer is confused why the authors presented ProBNP assays. The authors only show negative results of ProBNP; yet, how it related to the deep learning models in current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>ProBNP is a clinical biomarker of cardiac stress. We used a ProBNP ELISA kit as an orthogonal, follow-up assay on media collected from iPSC-CMs treated with the seven validated cardiotoxic compounds and evaluated the levels of BNP. In the media of treated cells, we found inconsistent patterns of ProBNP levels and cardiotoxicity signals. In most cases, the ProBNP signal was lower when treating with a predicted cardiotoxic compound (suggesting loss of cardiac identity). In only one case (PHA-767491) did ProBNP levels increase. Based on our results, we believe that measuring ProBNP levels was not the most reliable marker for predicting cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs. We have revised this section in the manuscript for further clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Cardiotoxicity is highly time-dependent and dose-dependent. How the authors address time-dependent and dose-dependent cardio-toxicity in their deep learning models.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful point. We agree that cardiotoxicity (or toxicity in general) is both time-dependent and dose-dependent. In our manuscript, we reported that a subset of known cardiotoxic drugs led to a time-dependent and dose-dependent loss of contractility (see Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>When we applied deep learning to detect cardiotoxicity, we focused on a single timepoint on fixed cells. We did not perform live imaging because this approach, especially on beating cardiomyocytes, is time-consuming and not easily scalable for high-throughput screening. We could perform sarcomere-based live imaging by establishing stable reporter cell lines, or transfecting/transducing with a sarcomeric protein tagged with a fluorescent marker (eg, ACNT2-mKate2 reporter by Judge et al., 2017). However, our study focused on the scalability of the methodology. Thus, for our primary screen, we assessed a single time point and three doses. Also, to identify hits, most primary high-throughput screening is performed at a single dose. In our study, we broadened the dose range by including three doses in the primary screen to address the dose-dependency of cardiotoxicity.</p><p>We believe that performing deep learning on live cells over time would be a valuable addition to future work. We used such an approach in previous work (Maddah et al., 2020), in which we used deep learning on live images with a small number of compounds. In this study, we reported both a time-dependent and dose-dependent aspect to detecting patterns of hepatotoxicity (Maddah et al., 2020, Figure 4) and cardiotoxicity (Maddah et al., 2020, Figure 6). We have added some of these details to the Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors presented transcriptomics and metabolism analysis. How these omics layers can be integrated into deep learning models in the future studies?</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we focused on the deep learning score as the primary output to predict patterns of cardiotoxicity, and we used transcriptomics and metabolic studies as orthogonal assays to validate our findings. In this study, we did not have the resources to analyze the transcriptional landscape of enough samples from each drug-treatment group to create a rich transcriptional training dataset as an additional data source for deep learning modeling. When such a dataset is available, the expression matrix can be used along with imaging data as the training dataset, and generated layers can be merged in the subsequent steps. Such a dataset could also be analyzed separately by either deep learning or traditional machine learning methods, and the generated classifier can be provided to create an Ensemble model in the next step. In this approach, multivariate projection methods (e.g., methods based on partial least squares, multivariate regression methods, random forests) and Support Vector Machines could be used to develop transcriptional classifiers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The codes and data should be provided in public domains, such as GitHub or other open source websites.</p></disp-quote><p>The code for the SGFT algorithm by Salick et al., 2020 is available on GitHub:</p><p>https://github.com/maxsalick/SGFT</p><p>(We added this link to our Materials and methods)</p><p>Our RNA-Seq data has been deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

However, we provided information on how the code is constructed in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We used PyTorch as the framework for the deep learning library, and a ResNet50 193 architecture, a 50-layer-deep convolutional neural network. Each input image was divided into 12 square sub-images to have sizes ranging from 224 x 224 pixels to 300 x 300 pixels (Maddah et al., 2020). Each sub-image was flipped and rotated to create seven more augmented sub-images, and then fed into the input layer of ResNet50. Pseudo-image generation by rotation and flipping ensures enough diversity is seen by the network so that the algorithm is not biased based on the orientation of the images (Moen et al., 2019). We used 80% of the images to construct the neural network and the remaining 20% to validate the deep learning model. A consistent set of parameters were used for all training operations, including an initial learning rate of 0.01 and 20 epochs.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Comment 1– It is difficult to understand how this method (cardiotoxicity score) is predictive of clinical cardiotoxicity if the score is dependent on the training data and drugs used because clinical cardiotoxicity due to drug-induced effects will occur for drugs independently of what would be the surrogate of training data or reference drugs in clinical trials. Probably authors could avoid stating this method as predictive, but instead should present it as an approach for comparing potential cardiotoxic effects between new drugs and reference drugs without predicting clinical safety ranges. A drug can be safe if the range of efficacious concentrations is safely below the toxic range. If the authors still aim to demonstrate that the presented method is predictive of clinical data, a more reflected response to this comment is recommended, taking in consideration the current approaches in the field to test the clinical predictiveness of in vitro data. Since so much clinical and animal data is publicly available for several of the used drugs, it is unconceivable for approaches that aim to be predictive of clinical data to ignore these.</p><p>Comments 2 and 3 – There is no proof of principle results or proposed/ described comprehensive strategy or recommendations to predict clinical data from the results derived from this method. In line with the previous comment, the authors seem to be pretending that most of the used drugs are new drugs and that no clinical data is available. The authors also seem to pretend that clinical data is not currently predicted from in vitro cellular data to estimate safety ranges of drug concentration. The authors should rethink their response, especially when considering that some of the used drugs have been used for so long clinically. These are not investigational drugs. If authors want to &quot;pitch&quot; this method as predictive, please add information on how to predict clinical data from it considering how other authors in the field already predict clinical toxic drug effects (safety ranges) from in vitro cellular data. The results from at least one drug should be demonstrated to be predictive and not false-positives or false-negatives. Alternatively, this effort will not be necessary if authors remove from the manuscript any claims that this method is predictive of drug cardiotoxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. We removed all claims that this method predicts clinical cardiotoxicity from the manuscript. We rephrased all relevant parts of the manuscript to indicate that this method can be used to detect/identify a cardiotoxicity signal in an in vitro system using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Also, we took the reviewer’s recommendation and modified part of our discussion to indicate that this method can be used to compare the level of toxicity to reference cardiotoxic drugs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
