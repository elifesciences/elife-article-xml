Transcriptome analysis of aging hair follicles uncovered changes in immune pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Our findings demonstrate that the maintenance of hair follicle homeostasis and the regeneration capacity after damage depend on TLR2 in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). In healthy hair follicles, TLR2 is expressed in a cycle-dependent manner and governs HFSCs activation by countering inhibitory BMP signaling. Hair follicles in aging and obesity exhibit a decrease in both TLR2 and its endogenous ligand carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP), a metabolite of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Administration of CEP stimulates hair regeneration through a TLR2-dependent mechanism. These results establish a novel connection between TLR2-mediated innate immunity and HFSC activation, which is pivotal to hair follicle health and the prevention of hair loss and provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair homeostasis</kwd><kwd>TLR2</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>hair loss</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>hair follicle stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL145536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byzova</surname><given-names>Tatiana V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell and animal-based models revealed the new function of TLR2 andcarboxyethylpyrrole as an endogenous TLR2 ligand in the hair follicle cycle in homeostasis and hair follicle regeneration in injury.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair follicles (HFs) represent one of the best examples of mini-organs with the ability to regenerate throughout life, which, in turn, relies on the proliferation and differentiation of HF stem cells (HFSCs) within hair bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakamoto et al., 2021</xref>). The cyclic renewal of HFs is orchestrated by the interplay between inhibitory and stimulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plikus et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the immune privileged status of HFs, they have a unique microbiome and immune system, including resident macrophages and other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paus et al., 2003</xref>). Components of the HF immune system have been implicated in regulating the HF cycle and its regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Domizio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahmani et al., 2020</xref>). Given their exposure to pathogens, HFs are equipped with innate immune receptors, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which detect and respond to pathogens by stimulating the secretion of defensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Domizio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Selleri et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>TLRs play a key role in recognizing and responding to either pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns, mediating the cytokine response. However, the role of TLRs extends beyond this function, as they have been shown to directly promote tissue regeneration and homeostasis in multiple tissues, particularly in stem and progenitor cells. TLRs regulate hematopoietic and intestinal stem cell renewal, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomchuck et al., 2008</xref>). The role of innate immune responses in the tissue-healing benefits of stem cell therapy has been clearly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vagnozzi et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, TLR activation is a critical component of the reprogramming or transdifferentiation of adult cells into pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), emphasizing the close coordination between innate immunity, cell transformation, and regeneration.</p><p>Multiple reports connect altered HFs’ immunity to hair loss, including a breakdown of immune privilege in alopecia areata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahmani et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, androgen, which is tightly linked to TLR activation, was shown to influence the innate immunity of HFs in androgenic alopecia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sawaya, 2012</xref>). The decline of innate immunity processes due to aging or conditions like obesity is widely recognized and these conditions are causatively associated with hair thinning and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghanemi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palmer and Kirkland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). Alopecia patients often have higher body weight index and weight compared to healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakry et al., 2014</xref>). Increased body weight index is linked to more significant hair loss severity in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goette and Odom, 1976</xref>) and a higher prevalence of hair disorders in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mirmirani and Carpenter, 2014</xref>). Mouse models support these findings, showing that activation of innate immunity through pathogen signals might lead to alopecia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2018</xref>) and that high-fat diets inducing obesity cause hair thinning through HFSC depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morinaga et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that activating endothelial TLR2 by endogenous ligands such as CEP (a product of PUFA oxidation) promotes wound healing and tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2010</xref>). Deletion of TLR2 from endothelial cells reduces tumor size by diminishing its vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCoy et al., 2021</xref>). In wounded skin, endothelial TLR2 is crucial for tissue regeneration through increased proangiogenic cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2022b</xref>). Although PUFAs have been shown to benefit hair growth by extending the anagen phase and promoting cell proliferation and hair shaft elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munkhbayar et al., 2016</xref>), the role of innate immunity and in particular, TLR2 in the HF cycle remains unknown.</p><p>Using animal models and human cell lines, we show a new function of TLR2 in the HF cycle in homeostasis and HF regeneration in injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an endogenously produced PUFA metabolite CEP serves as a TLR2 ligand in the hair bulge, promoting hair regeneration and growth through TLR2. In conditions associated with hair loss, i.e., aging and obesity, both TLR2 and its ligand are substantially depleted in HFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TLR2 in HF declines due to aging and obesity</title><p>To assess whether and how aging affects HF innate immunity, we analyzed available RNA sequencing data of mouse HFSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doles et al., 2012</xref>). Pathway analysis revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, as well as TLR signaling, were among the top dysregulated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notch, JAK-STAT, TGF-β, and Wnt, and other pathways essential for HF regeneration were also altered by aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, the level of <italic>Tlr</italic>2 mRNA in HFSCs of old mice was 2-fold lower compared to young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keyes et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, TLR2 at the protein level was substantially lower in 13-month-old mice compared to 2-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) downregulate TLR2 in response to stress like a high-fat diet and aging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dysregulated pathways in old vs young mouse HFSCs.

TLR6 may act as a co-receptor for TLR2 as its expression pattern is similar. While the downstream TLR2 signaling molecules, <italic>Irak1</italic> and <italic>Myd88</italic>, are also upregulated, mirroring the <italic>Tlr</italic>2, IRAK1 inhibitor <italic>Tollip</italic> is suppressed. Together, the results suggest the critical regulatory role of the entire TLR2/TLR6 pathway in the HF cycle.</p><p>High-fat diet-induced obesity causes hair thinning and subsequent loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morinaga et al., 2021</xref>). In our model, a high-fat diet causes a nearly 2-fold decline in TLR2 protein level in HFSCs, compared to normal diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Further, RNA sequencing data reveal that 3 months of a high-fat diet is sufficient to reduce <italic>Tlr</italic>2 levels in HFSCs by more than 2-fold compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morinaga et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, our results and analyses of existing datasets demonstrate that conditions causatively associated with hair thinning and loss, such as aging and obesity, result in a dramatic depletion of TLR2 in HFSCs suggesting a possible regulatory role for TLR2 in HFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TLR2 is upregulated during HFSC activation</title><p>The expression of TLR2 during a normal hair cycle was assessed using a previously characterized TLR2-GFP reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), one of the best tools for the analysis of TLRs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price et al., 2018</xref>). The correlation between the reporter and TLR2 protein expression was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The HF cycle was verified by H&amp;E staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During telogen, a dormant stage for HFSCs, TLR2 was found in the bulge, secondary hair germ (sHG), dermal papilla (DP), and outer root sheath (ORS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). During regenerative anagen, TLR2 expression was detected in the DP and all sHG-derived progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) and quiescent bulge stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). All cells derived from bulge stem cells (ORS) and sHG (hair shaft and inner root sheath [IRS]) were positive for TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In catagen, TLR2 was abundant in the new bulge and sHG formed from ORS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). While TLR2 was expressed in early sHG lineage (including IRS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), it was absent in mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>) and regressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) IRS. This shows that TLR2 is abundant in stem cells but declines upon differentiation. The second telogen’s old and new bulges expressed TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). TLR2 was present in sHG and DP during the second telogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and increased in the late (competent) telogen compared to the early (refractory) telogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). The highest level of TLR2 occurred during active anagen compared to quiescent telogen and catagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the <italic>Tlr2</italic> mRNA level in HFSCs was 5- and 2.3-fold higher in anagen than in telogen and catagen, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, analysis of existing RNA sequencing data using FACS-sorted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorz et al., 2010</xref>) confirmed that TLR2 expression was significantly higher in HFSCs than in epidermal or non-stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

The lack of <italic>Tlr</italic>2 visibly impaired hair regeneration after wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). On day 14 post-injury, HFs in WT mice entered precocious anagen judged by a spot of pigmented skin, which, on day 21, developed into a black hair patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the follicles of TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice remained quiescent lacking regenerated HFs around wounds even after 21 days post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). At this point, the pigmented skin area in WT was ~9-fold larger than in TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice. Skin flaps showed substantial pigmentation and growing hair bulbs around wounds in WT, indicative of active anagen. In contrast, the TLR2<sup>KO</sup> skin flap was devoid of pigmentation, consistent with telogen (inner skin flap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Ki67 staining confirmed an increase in HFs’ activation in WT but not in TLR2<sup>KO</sup> skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). The resulting density of regenerated HFs based on Ker17 staining in WT was 2-fold higher than in TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). Most importantly, this effect was dependent on TLR2, specifically on HFSCs, since TLR2<sup>HFSC-KO</sup> mice exhibited a similar phenotype with a dramatic reduction in pigmentation and hair growth compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>). The upregulation of pSmad1/5/9 in TLR2<sup>HFSC-KO</sup> wounds compared to controls demonstrates that similar to the HF cycle scenario, increased BMP signaling might contribute to diminished HF regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L and M</xref>).

Healthy tissues are typically devoid of this product, which is mainly associated with inflammation and pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yakubenko et al., 2018</xref>). However, in contrast to other tissues, healthy HFs exhibited high levels of CEP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). During anagen, CEP is present within the proximal part of the follicle, while in telogen the entire follicle is encased by this PUFA metabolite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>).

Our in vitro experiments revealed that CEP increases the proliferation of human HFSC in a TLR2-dependent manner since the blockade of TLR2 abrogates the CEP effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). In another model, CEP promotes cell proliferation of human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) by ~2-fold compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we show that CEP promotes hair regeneration in injury in a TLR2-dependent manner. CEP administration promoted HF regeneration in WT wounds. However, it was ineffective in global TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). CEP promoted a 55% increase in the number of HF and cell proliferation in WT wounds, and at the same time, there was no effect in TLR2<sup>KO</sup> wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>).</p><p>To ensure independence from immune cells, WT and TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice were irradiated and transplanted with WT bone marrow prior to wounding.

At the same time, CEP was not effective in TLR2<sup>KO</sup>/WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>), demonstrating the TLR2-dependent mechanism.</p><p>These CEP effects were mediated by TLR2 on HFSCs. In control mice, CEP effectively initiated regeneration of HFs around the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), resulting in ~3-fold higher density of HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>) and dramatic acceleration of cell proliferation by &gt;10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M and N</xref>) as compared to TLR2<sup>HFSC-KO</sup> mice where CEP was mainly ineffective.

(2) In young and healthy animals, TLR2 expression in HFs is cycle-dependent, with the highest expression in HFSCs during the initiation of the anagen phase. (3) The absence of TLR2 in HFSCs prolongs the resting phase of the hair cycle and significantly delays hair regeneration after injury. (4) TLR2 regulates the hair cycle primarily by inhibiting BMP signaling in HFSCs. (5) HFs continuously produce a metabolite of PUFAs, which acts as an endogenous TLR2 ligand and promotes hair growth through TLR2 activation in HFSCs. Besides reduced TLR2, aging is linked to low levels of its ligand in HFs. The stimulatory role of TLR2 signaling in HFs was demonstrated through both animal models and established human cell lines.</p><p>The lack of <italic>Tlr</italic>2 appears to shift the balance between activating and inhibitory cues, leading to a resting phase that is approximately three times longer. This is a substantial impact considering that there are only four to five hair cycles in a mouse lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2021</xref>). The decrease in both TLR2 and its ligand observed in aging and associated conditions will inevitably impede the cyclic regeneration of HFs.</p><p>The immune system was shown to play a role in the activation of HFSCs, even in the absence of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>). TLR2 expression increases at the onset of anagen when the immune response is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paus et al., 2003</xref>) and the HF is most susceptible to pathogens. The upregulation of TLR2 in anagen may initially have a protective function. However, high TLR2 expression in undifferentiated vs. differentiated cells underscores its role in stem cell biology. TLRs, including TLR2, have been shown to play a critical role in stem cell functions in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lathia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomchuck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trowbridge and Starczynowski, 2021</xref>). TLRs’ ligation and signaling can alter stem cell differentiation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trowbridge and Starczynowski, 2021</xref>). Proinflammatory signaling can also activate HFSC proliferation, e.g., during injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). During the immune-privileged anagen phase of the hair cycle, TLR2 signaling may act as a key intrinsic factor in triggering HFSC activation.</p><p>The role of innate immunity in stem cell activation has mainly been linked to TLR3, shown to induce pluripotency in somatic cells through nuclear reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sayed et al., 2015</xref>) and drive HF neogenesis after tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we show that TLR2 drives a rapid inflammatory response and regulates the normal hair cycle and HF regeneration/neogenesis in injury.</p><p>TLR2 promotes the hair cycle by inhibiting the BMP pathway, a key regulator of HFSC quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kandyba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plikus et al., 2008</xref>). Our study demonstrates that reducing excessive BMP signaling reactivates <italic>Tlr</italic>2-deficient HFSCs, revealing a novel link between TLR2, BMP signaling, and the hair cycle. The only known instance of immune system-mediated BMP pathway inhibition occurs during the apoptosis of bulge-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of TLR2 in HF regeneration in both normal hair growth and wound healing emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of TLR2 ligands mediating these responses. At the site of injury, TLR2 can be activated by pathogens or by endogenously produced ligands, such as the oxidative product of PUFA, CEP, generated in abundance during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yakubenko et al., 2018</xref>). CEP and TLR2 are both essential for hair regeneration, and their deficiency observed in pathologies such as aging and obesity might substantially impair hair growth. Exogenous application of CEP accelerates both wound closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2010</xref>) and HF regeneration through TLR2. In addition, both TLR2 and the application of CEP diminish inhibitory BMP signaling, suggesting that CEP and other TLR2 ligands could have therapeutic value for the treatment of hair loss related to burns, traumas, and other pathologies. It is intriguing that while CEP is almost exclusively generated at sites of injury and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiong et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yakubenko et al., 2018</xref>), HFs continuously produce it, most likely by the means of MPO, an anti-bacterial enzyme, capable of generating CEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klebanoff et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to the trend observed in other tissues, where the accumulation of oxidation-generated CEP increases with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2010</xref>), HFs seem to exhibit depletion of CEP with aging. This decline in CEP levels might contribute to the reduced activity of HFSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of CEP in TLR2-dependent HF growth and regeneration highlights the connection between oxidative stress and regenerative processes. Sustained reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in proper regeneration, as seen in the tail amputation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Love et al., 2013</xref>). ROS enhance the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>) and sustain self-renewal in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Belle et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, ROS production in the skin has been linked to the activation of HFSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasco et al., 2015</xref>). We show the underlying mechanism for these observations, where oxidation-generated CEP triggers TLR2 activation, decreases inhibitory BMP signaling, and stimulates HF growth and regeneration. TLR2 appears to serve as a common link between oxidative stress and tissue regeneration.</p><p>To summarize, our study highlights a novel role of TLR2 in promoting tissue regeneration during normal hair growth and wound healing. The identification of an endogenous TLR2 ligand produced by HFs presents a potential target for augmenting hair regeneration in the context of injury and aging, opening up new avenues for regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Inducible K15-CrePR1 mice (Stock No. 005249), TLR2-GFP reporter mice (Stock No. 031822), and TLR2<sup>KO</sup> mice (Stock No. 004650) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Tlr2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice with Exon3 of the <italic>Tlr2</italic> gene flanked by two loxP sites were described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCoy et al., 2021</xref>).

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104). Sample quality assessment was performed on a Fragment Analyzer electrophoresis system (Agilent). Total RNA was normalized prior to oligo-dT capture and cDNA synthesis with SMART-Seq v4 (Takara). The resulting cDNA was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies). Libraries were generated using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina). Medium-depth sequencing (50 million reads per sample) was performed with a NextSeq 550 (Illumina) on a High Output flow cell using 75 base pairs, Paired-End run. Raw demultiplexed fastq paired-end read files were trimmed of adapters and filtered using the program skewer to throw out any with an average Phred quality score of less than 30 or a length of less than 36. Trimmed reads were then aligned using the HISAT2 aligner to the Mouse NCBI reference genome assembly version GRCm38 and sorted using SAMtools. Aligned reads were counted and assigned to gene meta-features using the program featureCounts as part of the Subread package. These count files were imported into the R programming language and were assessed for quality control, normalized, and analyzed using an in-house pipeline utilizing the limma-trend method for differential gene expression testing and the GSVA library for gene set variation analysis. The pathway analysis for differentially expressed genes with adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 was performed using Enrichr web server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr">https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.

For normally distributed data, we use an unpaired two-tailed t-test to compare two groups and the one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc analysis to compare more than two groups. For non-normally distributed data and small sample size (n&lt;6), we appraised statistical differences with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare two sample datasets and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test for three or more groups. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The sample size was calculated based on a significance level of 0.05 and power 80% (0.8).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Dr. Byzova has a relevant patent 9,981,018 'Compositions and Methods for Modulating Toll-Like Receptor 2 Activation'</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were performed according to animal protocols (00002319) approved by the Cleveland Clinic IACUC committee.

By analyzing published dataset and using immunostaining and transgenic TLR2-GFP reporter mice, the authors showed that TLR2 expression is increased in the late telogen compared to the early telogen, implying that it is important for the transition between telogen to anagen hair cycle. They found that the genetic deletion of Tlr2 in hair follicle stem cells delays hair cycle entry in both homeostatic and wound-induced hair follicle regeneration. In addition, they found that CEP is an endogenous TLR2 activating ligand and triggers the progression of hair cycle in a TLR2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, the activation of TLR2 signaling antagonizes BMP signaling which is critical for the maintenance of hair follicle stem cell quiescence. Clinically, they showed that TLR2 expression is decreased in aging and high-fat diet condition, suggesting that the dysfunctional regulation of TLR2 pathway is responsible for age-related and obesity-related hair thinning and hair loss phenotypes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this study presents the role and mechanism of TLR2 in regulating hair follicle regeneration. The functional interrogation parts using HFSC-specific TLR2 genetic deletion is solid, and an endogenous regulator, CEP, is identified.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1.</p><p>- In SFig1A, the IF staining of TLR2 and Tlr2-GFP expression seem almost 100% co-localized, which is not usual experimentally.</p><p>- In Fig 2J, the relative expression levels of Tlr2 in anagen, telogen, catagen HFSCs were tested. But it is just relative comparison and does not mean whether the expression level is meaningful or not. To make this convincing, adding other cell types such as dermal fibroblasts and immunes to the comparison as negative and positive controls would be a good idea.</p><p>- In Fig 2K, the expression of Tlr2 is comparable or a bit lesser in epidermal cells and HFSCs, but the expressions of TLR2 (IF) and Tlr2-GFP in epidermal cells have not been presented at all in the manuscript. As the authors used K15-CrePR1 mice to delete Tlr2 in HFSCs specifically, showing TLR2 IF staining in TLR2-HFSC-KO mice would be nice evidence of significant expression of TLR2 in HFSCs. (still TLR2 expression in epidermis, but no TLR2 expression in HFSCs).</p><p>- In Fig 1B, it is still unclear whether TLR2 staining is in epithelial cell or in dermal cells. TLR2 staining patterns in Fig 1B, SFig 1A, and rebuttal seem different. In Fig S1B and rebuttal, TLR2 expression in HFSCs, HG, DP cells, but in Fig 1B, most of HG and DP cells are not TLR2+.</p><p>- Together, this reviewer still does not think that there is a clear and solid evidence of Tlr2 expression in HFSCs. Searching the Tlr2 expression in published bulk and single cell RNA-seq dataset would be helpful.</p><p>1.</p><p>- In SFig 4B, C, the activation of BMP signaling was hindered by TLR2 signaling activation by PAM3CSK4. But it is in vitro data, and cultured HFSCs are different from in vivo HFSCs, and particularly the changes of HFSCs from quiescence to activation can hardly be recapitulated in vitro.</p><p>- In Fig 4H, it is curious that in TLR2-HFSC-KO mice, P21 HFSCs showed no pSMAD1/5/9, but it is increased in P24.</p><p>- Also, it is wondered that if ID1 and ID2, key target genes, are increased in TLR2-HFCS-KO.</p><p>- The author suggested that BMP7 is a key connection between TLR2 signaling and BMP signaling. It is curious whether BMP7 is a direct target of TLR2 pathway? Are there Nfkb (putative) binding sites in cis-regulatory regions of BMP7?</p><p>1.</p><p>- In Fig 6C, CEP expression is close to hair follicle in both anagen and telogen. Also, in Telogen, CEP expression is strong and very close to HFSCs. But In rebuttal Fig 2, CEP is localized to sebaceous gland, where MPO, a CEP producing enzyme, is expressed. Which one is correct? Also, if CEP is strongly expressed in Telogen (Fig 6C), how can HFSCs stay in quiescence with decreased BMP signaling?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89335.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Luyang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhevlakova</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>West</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia Z</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Detao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Murtazina</surname><given-names>Rakhilya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Horak</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Jonathan Mark</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Molokotina</surname><given-names>Iuliia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Podrez</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Byzova</surname><given-names>Tatiana V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cleveland Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cleveland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To the reviewers.</p><p>We appreciate a detailed and deep review of our manuscript. Below are our comments and responses. Many requested data are present in the Supplementary figures of the manuscript. There seem to be two main concerns: one regarding the evidence of TLT2 expression in HFSCs; and second, regarding CEP/TLR2. As detailed below, we utilized 3 different methods to document TLR2 expression: TLR2-reporter mouse, staining for TLR2 and qPCR of isolated cells for TLR2. The source (the data are in Supplementary Fig. 5A, B and in references below) and nature of CEP (it is not a protein, but metabolic product of Polyunsaturated acid DHA oxidation by MPO amongst other ROS sources) are also explained below.</p><p>1. “The expression analysis of TLR2 is questionable. Many of the conclusions about the level of target genes are based on quantifying fluorescence intensity in microscopy images (e.g., TLR2 level in young or aged mice, BMP7 levels in mice with/without TLR2 KO). This could be strengthened by using qPCR to measure gene expression levels in FACS-sorted HFSCs, which would provide more accurate quantification. Additionally, the authors should test if the TLR2 antibody used is valid.”</p></disp-quote><p>In most instances we have used TLR2 reporter mouse, which presents an advantage over immunostaining. Fig.2 (A-H) shows expression of TLR2 reporter, not the staining with TLR2 abs. For selected experiments we utilized immunostaining with anti- TLR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21759) antibody, which has been validated in our previous publication (see Michael G. McCoy and all. Endothelial TLR2 promotes proangiogenic immune cell recruitment and tumor angiogenesis. // Sci Signal. 2021 Jan 19; 14(666): eabc5371/doi: 10.1126/ scisignal.abc5371). In Fig.S2E of that manuscript we validated these abs using a knockout of TLR2. In the current paper, we further validate anti-TLR2 abs by showing its co-localization with the TLR2-GFP reporter (Fig. S1A).</p><p>We then confirmed reporter and immunostaining data by qPCR showing Tlr2 expression in FACS-purified mouse HFSCs in anagen, telogen, and catagen (Fig.2J), in mouse epidermal cells and FACS-purified HFSCs (Fig.2K), and FACS-purified HFSCs isolated from Control and TLR2HFSC-KO mice (Fig.4E).</p><p>As for the mechanistic link between TLR2 and BMP signaling was identified using RNAseq on FACS-purified HFSCs (supplementary Fig.4), then verified using qPCR (Fig.4E shows Bmp7,Bmp2, Bmpr1a ) and only then immunohistochemistry staining for BMP7 and phosphoSMAD1/5/9 was used (Fig.4A-D, F-H). Note that the large body of requested evidence is presented in Supplementary data. Other mechanistic links shown using qPCR include Nfkb2, Il1b, Il6, and Bmp7 in FACS-purified mouse HFSCs treated with BSA control or CEP (Fig.6Q,6R).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“As the reviewers note, it is not clear whether the TLR2+ signal is located at the basal side of bulge stem cells, basement membrane underlying bulge stem cells, or dermal sheath cells encapsulating bulge structure. Co-staining with basement membrane markers such as collagen and laminin or HFSC basal side membrane markers such as Itga6, Itgb1, and Itgb4 will clarify this. In addition, showing the expression pattern of TLR2 in full skin including epidermis and dermis would be helpful. As TLR2 is highly expressed in immune cells or blood endothelial cells, if the antibody staining is valid, strong positive signals should present in the cells. Moreover, testing the TLR2 antibody in Tlr2 knock-out mouse tissues would be an appropriate control experiment.”</p></disp-quote><p>Once again, in most instances we have used not the staining for TLR2 but TLP2 reporter mouse (Fig.2 legend). Anti-TLR2 abs have been verified in TLR2 KO as described above. Fig.2K shows comparison of Tlr2 mRNA expression in mouse epidermal cells to FACS-purified HFSCs by qPCR.</p><p>TLR2 signal is detected in several cell types within the hair follicle as well as in dermal cells surrounding the hair follicles, such as lymphocytes, resident tissue macrophages, fibroblast, and fibroblast precursors, etc. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137462-TLR2/single+cell+type">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137462-TLR2/single+cell+type</ext-link>). In Author response image 1 below, white arrows point to the TLR2-positive cells around the hair follicle. In our paper, we focus on HFSC TLR2 and use the respective inducible tissue specific TLR2 KO. The contribution of TLR2 on other cell types can be assessed by the comparison of the phenotypes of global TLR2 KO, TLR2 KO-WT bone marrow chimeras and HFSC-specific TLR2 KO. The results are presented in both, main and supplementary figures (Fig.5D-I and SFig.5I-K) shows global TLR2 KO, Fig.6H-I, SFig.5G-h shows bone marrow chimeras and Figs.3,4, 5 (J-M), Fig.5 (J-N) shows the main focus, HFSC-TLR2 KO. Overall, the phenotype (delay of hair regeneration after wounding) seems to be the strongest in TLR2 KO, whereas bone marrow chimeras and HFSCs phenotypes are comparable. Thus, TLR2 on bone marrow derived cells complements the main role for TLR2 on HFSCs.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Staining for TRLR2 (white), DAPI (blue) and Keratin 17 (purple) is shown.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89335-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The increase in expression of TLR2 during the hair follicle stem cell activation should be documented by FACS and/or qPCR. This is important because as noted by one of the reviewers.”</p></disp-quote><p>While original observation was done using both, a TLR2 reporter mouse and immunostaining, the data were confirmed by qPCR showing Tlr2 mRNA expression in FACS-purified mouse HFSCs in anagen, telogen, and catagen (Fig.2J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“In Fig 1D, the authors mentioned that they re-analyzed published RNA-seq data (Greco et al., 2009) to show the increase of Tlr2 and Tlr6 expression in late telogen compared to early telogen. However, there is no RNA-seq data in that paper, but only microarray data of bulge vs HG comparison and dermal papillae cells (DP) in early, mid, late Telo. If the authors used DP data to show the increase of Tlr2 transcripts in late Telo, the analysis is completely wrong and has to be corrected. The problem is compounded by the fact that in other published HFSC RNA-seq datasets (Yang et al., Cell, 2017, Adam et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2020), the expression levels of Tlr2 and Tlr6 are very low (below 5 TPM). In Fig 1G, the authors also re-analyzed Morinaga et al., 2021 data to show the reduction of Tlr2 expression in HFSCs in high-fat diet mice. However, in the raw data of Morinaga et al., 2021 (GSE169173), Tlr2 expression FPKM values are below 1 in both normal diet and high-fat diet samples, which are too low to perform comparative analysis and are not statistically meaningful. Like Tlr2, the expressions of Tlr1 and Tlr6, which form heterodimer with TLR2, are almost 0. Thus, the authors should revisit the dataset and revise their analysis and conclusion.”</p><p>To document the existence of Tlr2 and Tlr6 expression in HFSCs, the authors should perform RNR-seq-based gene expression analysis by themselves. Otherwise, the authors' TLR2 expression analyses in Fig 1 are not convincing. These are serious issues that the authors will want to rectify so that eLIFE readers will not discount their findings and importance.”</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct, we analyzed a published array, not RNAseq data (Greco et al., 2009) using GEO2R tool which allowed us to compare the mRNA expression levels between early, middle, and late telogen in bulge CD34 positive cells. We changed the “RNA-seq” (the term was used incorrectly) to “RNA microarray” in the main text.</p><p>In our manuscript, TLR2 expression is documented not only in Fig.1, but also in Fig.2 and S.Fig.1. We utilized 3 different methods to document TLR2 expression: TLR2-reporter mouse, staining for TLR2 and qPCR of isolated cells for TLR2. Fig.2K shows comparison of Tlr2 mRNA expression in mouse epidermal cells to FACS-purified HFSCs by qPCR to document increased TLR2 expression on HFSCs. Likewise, Fig.2J shows qPCR for TLR2 on HFSC during various phases of hair growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“In Fig 2, to support the expression of Tlr2 in HFSCs, the authors utilized TLR2-GFP mice and showed the strong GFP expression in HFSCs, hair bulb, and ORS. However, as the expression data in Fig 1 are questionable, the GFP reporter data should be carefully analyzed with proper control experiments. For example, although TLRs are highly expressed in immune cells and endothelial cells, which are abundantly present in skin, Fig 2 data did show the GFP expression in these cells. Instead, the GFP signals looked very specific to epithelial compartments, which is odd. Again, to convince readers, the authors should provide more comprehensive analyses of expression patterns of TLR2-GFP mice in skin. Also, if the TLR2-GFP signals faithfully reflect the actual expression of Tlr2 mRNA, the GFP signals should increase in late telogen compared to early telogen. The authors should check whether TLR2-GFP expression follows this pattern.”</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity of TLR reporter was characterized in Price et al. , 2018.

Also as discussed above we show a strong correlation between TLR2-GFP reporter expression and TLR2 expression using coimmunostaining with GFP and TLR2 antibodies with appropriate isotype-match non-immune antibodies as negative controls.</p><p>There is no doubt that TLR2 is expressed on immune, endothelial and epithelial cells. According to the Human Protein Atlas, TLR2 expression is identified in skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, etc., so our findings are well supported by the literature (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137462-TLR2/single+cell+type">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137462-TLR2/single+cell+type</ext-link>). Indeed, we detected TLR2 in cells surrounding the hair follicle (see the pictures above). TLR2 signal was detected in nearly all niches of hair follicles including the CD34-positive cells.</p><p>In Fig.S1 we demonstrated an increased level of TLR2 in the late (competent) telogen compared to the early (refractory) telogen using immunostaining for TLR2-GFP. The results mirrored published RNA-array data in Fig.1D. Again, reporter and immunostaining results have been validated by qPCR for TLR2.</p><p>The levels of TLR2 might be heavily influences by the environment, i.e. pathogens availability.

A better characterization of the molecular-level interaction between TLR2 and BMP signaling can further enhance the impact of this study.</p><p>-The published dataset should be re-analyzed, as some images and their quantification do not appear to be matched. Representative images should be used.”“In Fig 4, the authors propose that the activation of TLR2 pathway inhibits the BMP signaling pathway, which makes HFSCs quiescent. In TLR2-HFSC-KO, the authors showed that BMP7 is increased and pSMAD1/5/9 is sustained. The increase in BMP7 expression and SMAD activation should be demonstrated by additional assays. Are SMAD target genes activated in the cKO mice?”</p></disp-quote><p>This mechanistic link between TLR2 and BMP was originally identified by RNAseq, confirmed by qPCR and then by immunostaining for both, BMP7 and BMP pathway activation based on phosphoSMAD1/5/9 levels. The connection to BMP pathway was also shown by western blotting (S.Fig.4B,C). The rescue experiments have been performed using Noggin injections. According to our data, numerous SMAD target genes are upregulated in TLR2-HFSC-KO, such as Kank2, Ptk2b, Scarf2, Camk1, Dpysl2, as well as BMP2 and BMP7, and these changes were confirmed by qPCR analysis in Fig.4E. Additional evidence is shown in Fig.6, which demonstrates that endogenous TLR2 ligand, CEP-carboxyethylpyrrole, acts by a similar, BMP-dependent pathway. Also, Supplemental Fig.4 adds more details to this link. SFig.4B,C shows that TLR2 activation by canonical ligand PAM3CSK4 inhibits pSMAD levels induced by BMP (western blot is shown). At the same time, as anticipated PAM3CSK4 upregulated NFkB, however, little of no effect of BMP stimulation on NFkB is observed. To summarize: TLR2 affects both, BMP7 production and BMP induced downstream signaling judged by PhosphoSMADs. The later connection appears to go in one direction: TLR2 signaling affects BMP-induced pSMADs, however, BMP signaling does not seem to substantially change TLR2-dependent NFkB. We plan to delve into the intersection of these important pathways in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Functionally, downregulation of BMP signaling by injecting Noggin, a BMP antagonist, in TLR2HFSC-KO mice induces HFSC proliferation. These functional data are solid. However, it is still curious how TLR2 signaling interact with BMP pathway molecularly. Is it transcriptional regulation or translational regulation? Perhaps, RNA-seq analysis of TLR2HFSC-KO could give some hints to answer this question. Furthermore, checking out other signaling pathways such as WNT/LEF1 and pCREB, which are important for hair cycle activation and NFkB, a downstream effector of TLR signaling would be helpful to interrogate mechanistic insights.”</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, TLR2 affects both, BMP7 production and BMP-induced downstream signaling judged by PhosphoSMADs.

However, this axis remained unchanged upon TLR2HFSC-KO (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4J). There were several published reports on the crosstalk between TLR and BMP signaling such as (doi: 10.1089/scd.2013.0345. Epub 2013 Nov 7) showing that activation of TLR4 inhibits BMP-induced pSMAD1/5/8 and this connection requires NFkB. We probed NfkB activation, please, see the responses above.</p><p>However, we were not able to detect substantial effect of NFkB inhibition on BMP signaling in hair follicles (not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. “The function of CEP, a proposed endogenous ligand of TLR2, is still not clear. The authors imply that the decreased CEP level in aged mice could lead to deficient TLR2 signaling, which could further cause aging-associated hair regeneration defects. But this has not been demonstrated. What are the BMPs and pSmad1/5 levels in aged skin? Another important experiment to confirm the importance of this link during aging would be to inject CEP into the aged skin and examine whether this could restore hair regeneration in aged mice. Does CEP activate hair cycling during the endogenous pathway? What might be the source of CEP? Does CEP treatment activate BMP7 signaling? The authors should clarify these issues. The authors suggested that CEP is an endogenous ligand of TLR2, and administration of CEP induces hair cycle entry in a TLR2dependent manner. How potent is CEP in terms of HFSC activation? In Fig 6Q, CEP increases the expression of Nfkb2, Il1b, and Il6, but the fold changes are marginal. Also, if CEP is a critical ligand, the loss of CEP by a genetic deletion or a pharmacological inhibition should result in the delay of hair cycle entry. Furthermore, the source of CEP expression is curious. Is it expressed by HFSCs or dermal fibroblast or immune cells? Finally, comparing the effect of CEP to the effect of other bacterial origin Tlr2 ligands such as heat killed bacteria, purified microbial cell-wall components, and synthetic agonists (Pam3CSK4) would be helpful. It is curious if HFSC directly senses the bacterial materials and triggers hair follicle regeneration or are indirectly directed by immune cells and endothelial cells, which could be primary sensor.”</p></disp-quote><p>CEP is not a protein, it is an oxidative stress-generated metabolite of polyunsaturated fatty acid, DHA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360178/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360178/</ext-link>), thus, it is impossible to generate a knockout of this molecule. As demonstrated in previous publications(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990914/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990914/</ext-link>,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871763/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871763/</ext-link>) CEP serves as a critical endogenous ligand supporting TLR2 signaling in the absence of pathogens. While other TLR2 endogenous ligands, such as HMGBs or HSPs exist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373479/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373479/</ext-link>), CEP binds to TLR2 directly, and its generation is aided by MPO (myeloperoxidase) amongst other peroxidases and sources of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. MPO (produced by immune cells amongst others) serves as an innate immunity response against pathogens, but it also generates CEP adducts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034644/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6034644/</ext-link>) adducts in both protein and lipid form. The knockout of MPO diminishes CEP generation in skin (PMC6034644), thereby demonstrating the causative relationship between CEP and MPO.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Additional immunostaining of mouse skin for Keratin 17 (purple), CEP (green) and MPO (red).</title><p>Similar staining is in S.Fig.5A and quantification is in S.Fig.5B.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89335-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Also, the above-mentioned manuscripts show that CEP effects are milder but overall comparable with canonical TLR2 agonists, PAM3SCK4. As we mention in the present manuscript, normal young mice’s tissues are devoid of CEP (which is generated in response to inflammation) with an exception of hair follicles. This is likely attributed to the secretion of MPO by hair follicles (PMID: 36402231) especially in conditions of inflammation (PMID: 32893875). Supplementary Fig.5A,B show that MPO is present at the high level in sebaceous gland (as a part of anti-microbial mechanism). Again, MPO is a secreted enzyme and it is likely to be a source of continuous DHA oxidation into CEP in hair follicles. We also document that both,TLR2 and CEP levels in hair follicles (but not in other tissues-an important point for CEP) are reduced in aging. Likewise, SFig.5A,B shows that MPO secretion in hair follicle is reduced by more than 60% in aging mice. Thus, it is likely that reduced MPO levels in aging hair follicle produce less CEP. Together with reduced TLR2 levels, the lack of CEP might contribute to hair loss in aging.</p><p>We show that similar to TLR2, CEP in hair follicles operates via a BMP-7 dependent pathway (see Fig.6). We also provide results using canonical bacterial ligand for TLR2, PAM3CSK4 whose effect on HFSCs proliferation is similar to CEP in a TLR2-dependent manner. TLR2 blocking approaches were used (Supp. Fig.4B, C, D, E, Supp. Fig.5D-5F). It remains to be seen whether CEP is required for the normal hair cycling and whether its administration might improve hair loss in aging subjects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The impacts of CEP/TLR2 on proliferation of keratinocytes is still weak. How much of this effect is a result of NFkB activation, and how much is simply due to inhibiting BMP signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>Impact of TLR2 on proliferation was demonstrated using a variety of mouse models, from global TLR2 KO to bone marrow chimeras to HFSCs-specific TLR2 KO, again using multiple approaches. The same applies to the effects of CEP as well as to canonical TLR2 ligand, PAM3CSK4, which were demonstrated both in vivo and in culture to be TLR2-dependent (Fig.6MO and Supplementary Fig.4E-D). As for NFkB connection, see our responses above. It seems that the connection between TLR2 and BMP pathway occurs independently of NFkB activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The links between TLR2 pathway and aging and obesity are only correlative. Although the authors suggest that the reduction of TLR2 expression in aging and obesity may diminish hair growth (Fig 1), there is no direct functional evidence that supports this possibility.
