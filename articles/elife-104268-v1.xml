Wag31 has a characteristic N-terminal DivIVA-domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. While the role of Wag31 in polar elongation is known, there is limited mechanistic insight on how it orchestrates growth and elongation. In this report, we delineate roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Wag31 using genetics, state-of-the-art multi-omics, biochemical, and imaging approaches. We show that Wag31 predominantly interacts with several membrane-associated proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cell wall synthesis, and division. Native levels of Wag31 are critical for the maintenance and distribution of membrane lipids. Both depletion and overexpression of Wag31 perturb lipid homeostasis, leading to the formation of intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs). Protein–lipid crosslinking and imaging studies reveal that purified Wag31 can bind and effectively tether cardiolipin (CL)-containing liposomes. We further show that the tethering activity lies in the DivIVA-domain containing N-terminal of Wag31 while the C-terminal mediates protein–protein interactions of Wag31. Despite retaining its ability to interact with partner proteins, the DivIVA-domain-deleted Wag31 mutant shows defects in liposome tethering in vitro and non-polar localization of CL in vivo, which eventually causes lethality. Our study suggests that membrane tethering ‘licenses’ Wag31 to form scaffolds that help orchestrate protein–lipid and protein–protein interactions necessary for mycobacterial growth and survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wag31</kwd><kwd>intracellular lipid inclusions</kwd><kwd>lipid homeostasis</kwd><kwd>membrane

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell division is a critical event in the life of a bacterium as it is the prime mode of bacterial growth and reproduction. Hence, the process of their division is tightly knitted. The key process in bacterial cell division, that is, assembly of the FtsZ ring at the mid-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991</xref>), is tightly regulated by the Min and Nucleoid occlusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Boer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raskin and de Boer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meinhardt and de Boer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woldringh et al., 1990</xref>). Mycobacterium, which comprises clinically relevant pathogens – <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> lacks both the regulators of FtsZ ring placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Logsdon and Aldridge, 2018</xref>). Instead, they encode for a DivIVA protein, usually encoded by Firmicutes and other Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cha and Stewart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards and Errington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jani et al., 2010</xref>). It is necessary that the bacterial shape, crucial for normal cellular physiology, is maintained during cell division. Rod-shaped bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> encode MreB and multiple MreB-like proteins that sustain the rod morphology of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Letek et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mycobacterial</italic> spp. lack MreB homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thanky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>). The DivIVA protein of <italic>Mtb</italic> called Wag31 is known to regulate both cellular growth and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>), which makes it an exciting candidate to investigate.</p><p>DivIVA proteins were discovered three decades ago during the study of cell division mutants of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>). DivIVA proteins are rich in coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stahlberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muchová et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Letek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rigden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choukate et al., 2020</xref>), which enable them to form higher oligomeric structures and, hence, scaffolds, making them suitable adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flärdh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fadda et al., 2007</xref>). They are known to play diverse roles in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaval and Halbedel, 2012</xref>), for example, they play dual roles of septum positioning and chromosome partitioning in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards and Errington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomaides et al., 2001</xref>); cell separation/resolution post-cell-division in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaval et al., 2014</xref>); pole formation and maturation in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fadda et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> spp., Wag31 is an essential protein that senses negative membrane curvature found at poles and septum and localizes there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>). It plays roles in cellular elongation and septation in concert with other divisome and elongasome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melzer et al., 2018</xref>). It is specifically found in higher amounts at the old pole, where it directs polar elongation by recruiting the acyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) complex involved in fatty acid, mycolic acid, and methyl-branched chain lipid precursor synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hannebelle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santi et al., 2013</xref>). It localizes to the septum after cytokinesis is over, perhaps for septal synthesis via its interactions with FtsI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habibi Arejan et al., 2022</xref>), though the process remains largely unknown. Consequently, loss of Wag31 leads to cell division defects – loss of polar elongation, which renders the cells ‘round’ in shape that occurs due to affected peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>). Though Wag31 participates in coordinating PG metabolism, the mechanism or the protein network by which it does so remains unknown.</p><p>Wag31 has also been associated with the maintenance of the intracellular membrane domain (IMD), a specialized compartment for lipid synthesis, localized predominantly at the old pole in consonance with pole elongation and spottily all around the plasma membrane where it may function to repair membrane defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Heredia et al., 2021</xref>). The loss of Wag31 leads to the delocalization of IMD and its protein markers, such as MurG and GlfT2, but it is not understood whether Wag31 plays a direct role in membrane partitioning or it is just a consequence of localized membrane synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habibi Arejan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Heredia et al., 2021</xref>). The role of Wag31in PG and lipid synthesis that drives cell division remains unclear. Despite numerous studies, the details of how Wag31 orchestrates mega-complexes at the pole or partitions the membrane into two to govern cellular elongation remain elusive.</p><p>Here, we endeavoured to address the lacunae in the functionality of Wag31 by asking the following questions: (1) what are the ultrastructural changes that occur in mycobacteria due to the absence of Wag31, (2) do Wag31-deficient cells undergo transcriptional rewiring to adjust to cell division defects, (3) is the change in cellular morphology from ‘rod-to-round’ accompanied by altered lipid levels, (4) what is the interactome of Wag31, (5) what are the functions of its N- and C-terminal domains, and finally (6) what is its relationship with the mycobacterial membrane. The present study shows that Wag31 levels are critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis in mycobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the N- and C-terminals of Wag31 have distinct functions. The N-terminal of Wag31 binds and tethers the membrane together while the C-terminal interacts with various proteins. Together, the domains help Wag31 to orchestrate membrane-localized processes essential for maintaining normal cellular morphology and physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Wag31 leads to the formation of ILIs</title><p>In the pursuit of bridging the knowledge gap existing in the functionality of Wag31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), we generated a <italic>Wag31</italic> conditional mutant in <italic>Msm</italic>, by integrating a copy of <italic>wag31</italic> under tetracycline (ATc- tet off) regulation at the L5 locus and replacing the native copy with a hygromycin cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The mutant, <italic>Δwag31</italic>, thus generated, was confirmed by PCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The lack of Wag31 led to a drop in the turbidity of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Analysis of bacillary survival in vitro by enumerating CFUs 12 hr post-ATc addition, revealed a 2 log fold difference in the survival of <italic>Δwag31</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Given the essential role of Wag31 in causing polar growth of the cell, we investigated the effect of depletion of Wag31 on bacterial cellular morphology using electron microscopy (EM). Scanning EM (SEM) suggested that the absence of Wag31 caused a transition in the morphology of the cells from rod to round, as previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Apart from round morphology (~36 %), we also observed a rod-to-round transformation stage in which cells were bulged at one pole with the other pole intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). To obtain detailed insights, we performed transmission EM (TEM), which divulges information on the internal structure of cells. We discovered spherical, electron-lucent bodies (indicated by an arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) in the cytosol of all the samples. While <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc harboured a few (~2–3) electron-lucent bodies, their numbers were drastically higher in the case of <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). The cytosol of <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc was filled with multiple variable-sized bodies which resembled lipid bodies that <italic>Mtb</italic> accumulates inside the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barisch et al., 2015</xref>). As the term ‘lipid bodies/lipid droplets’ is used specifically for the lipids acquired by <italic>Mtb</italic> from the host cell, we referred to them as ILIs. We categorized the cells based on the number of ILIs they contained. Their distribution remained reasonably similar within <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc cells for all the classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Whereas <italic>Δwag31</italic> treated with ATc had as high as 85% cells harbouring more than five ILIs and very few cells with less than five ILIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).

Other lipid metabolism interactors of Wag31 included acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Msm2080), involved in lipid catabolism; GpsA, involved in phospholipid biosynthesis; and Msm0372, involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. To validate the high-throughput data, we chose MurG, SepIVA, and Msm2092 and performed pulldown assays with His-tagged Wag31. His-tagged Wag31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) was incubated with <italic>Msm</italic> lysates expressing 3X-FLAG tagged versions of the interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and pulled-down with the help of cobalt beads followed by a western blot analysis.

Western blot analysis did not show an interaction of Wag31 with either MmpL4 or MmpS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>) thus validating the interactome data.</p><p>Since Wag31 is a spatiotemporal regulator of other proteins, we were intrigued to discover the localization of its interacting partners. We used the data curated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2021</xref> and determined that Wag31 majorly interacts with membrane-associated proteins with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). The mycobacterial plasma membrane has been recently shown to have a cell wall-associated compartment called PM-CW and a cell wall-free compartment called PM<sub>f</sub> or IMD, which is the site for lipid synthesis. Based on the available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He and De Buck, 2010</xref>), we found that Wag31 interacts more with IMD proteins than with PM-CW proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>.) In accordance with assigned roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>), PM-CW residing proteins in the interactome are involved in cell wall and cell processes and intermediary metabolism and respiration. Similarly, IMD-homing proteins clustered in the lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis category. These results suggest that Wag31 maintains lipid homeostasis and cellular morphology primarily through its interactions with the membrane proteins participating in such pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Wag31 binds and tethers CL-containing membranes</title><p>Wag31 is a cytoplasmic protein that recognizes negative curvature regions in the cell, that is, poles and septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the precise mechanism by which Wag31 assemblies localize to the poles remains elusive. The predominant interactions of Wag31 with membrane-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were intriguing and led us to investigate if it can directly bind to membranes. We reasoned that such membrane-binding activity might render it capable of acting as a scaffold that anchors and organizes other proteins, thereby modulating their functions. To test this, we performed a lipid crosslinking-based proximity-based labelling of membrane-associated protein (PLiMAP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Purified Wag31 was incubated with ~100 nm extruded liposomes containing each of the abundant classes of bacterial lipids PE, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), or CL. Liposomes contained trace amounts of a reactive fluorescent lipid, which crosslinks with membrane-bound proteins upon photoactivation. These assays revealed that Wag31 preferentially binds CL- but not PG- or PE-containing liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Both CL and PG are anionic lipids, and the preferential binding of Wag31 to CL indicates that the binding cannot be attributed to a charge-based interaction.

The latter has been shown to bind to the membrane via the N-terminal DivIVA-domain (N-DivIVA<sub>BS</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>). However, the functional significance of the N- and C-terminal domains of mycobacterial Wag31 has not been dissected. Considering that the Wag31 N-terminal region shares 42% sequence identity with N-DivIVA<sub>BS</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choukate and Chaudhuri, 2020</xref>), we sought to inspect the effect of disruption of a particular residue (K20) in the N-terminus and the deletion of the entire N-terminus, encompassing the DivIVA-domain (1–60 amino acids) on membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). The K20 residue lies within a positively charged patch, which likely constitutes a membrane-associating surface in the intertwined loop region of Wag31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choukate and Chaudhuri, 2020</xref>). Moreover, mutating the K20 residue has been shown to decrease the cell length and elongation rate by 18% and 22%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habibi Arejan et al., 2022</xref>). The K20A mutation showed a marginal defect in binding to CL liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, d</xref>), indicating that K20 alone is insufficient for membrane binding. However, Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> showed a marked defect in forming SDS-resistant higher-order oligomers, as seen in the binding assays. Interestingly, deletion of the entire N-terminal domain caused a significant defect in both membrane binding and forming SDS-resistant higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, d</xref>). Surprisingly, binding was not entirely abolished, suggesting that the C-terminus of Wag31 may also contribute to membrane binding. Taken together, our results indicate that Wag31 preferentially binds CL-containing membranes and that regions other than the N-terminal domain contribute to membrane binding. The latter feature distinguishes Wag31 from DivIVA<sub>BS</sub>, and Wag31 likely contains membrane binding sites located at both the N- and C-terminal regions, which might lead to differences in the manner in which it interacts with the membrane and partner proteins compared to DivIVA<sub>BS</sub>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tethering is crucial for the survival of mycobacteria.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top panel: Representative fluorescent micrographs showing 10-N-Nonyl-acridine orange (NAO) intensity across <italic>Msm+</italic>ATc, <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc, and <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc samples imaged at 12 hr post-ATc treatment.

In the absence of Wag31-GFP, liposomes appeared as faint but distinct fluorescent puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, first panel). Surprisingly, in reactions containing Wag31-GFP, we observed liposomes clustered into bright fluorescent puncta that were positive for Wag31-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, remaining panels). The Wag31 tetramer has been modelled as a long rod-shaped protein filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choukate et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choukate and Chaudhuri, 2020</xref>) and such clustering of liposomes falls in congruence with the model. It indicates that these long filaments of Wag31 act to tether liposomes. We then systematically evaluated this effect by testing liposomes of different compositions and Wag31 mutants. Again, in the absence of Wag31, both PE- and CL-containing liposomes appeared as faint but distinct fluorescent puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).

Their similar localization pattern, coupled with Wag31’s affinity to bind to CL, led us to examine the effect of this binding in vivo.

Wag31 overexpression also led to a change in the distribution of NAO from the poles and septum to ‘donut-like’ fluorescent foci in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c, d</xref>). As the affinity of NAO for CL is more than other anionic phospholipids and our result (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) indicate that Wag31 prefers to bind CL over PG (another negatively charged phospholipid), the change in the distribution of NAO fluorescence implies that the loss or overexpression of Wag31 causes the mislocalization of CL in mycobacterium.</p><p>Subsequently, we investigated the impact of tethering-deficient Wag31 mutants on cell survival. Wag31 has an N-terminal domain joined to the C-terminal via a linker region.

Interestingly, interactions with all the proteins were retained in the case of Wag31ΔN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>), thus suggesting that Wag31 interacts with other proteins via its C-terminal. Taken together, the results suggest that the N-terminal region of Wag31 is involved in membrane tethering through interactions with CL, and the C-terminal region is involved in modulating interactions with other membrane-associated proteins. Thus, N-terminal and C-terminal of Wag31 have distinct molecular functions that together are crucial for maintaining cell shape, lipid homeostasis, and survival of mycobacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Wag31 modulates mycobacterial cell division by acting as an adaptor protein that recruits the elongation machinery to the old pole for unipolar growth of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of Wag31, rod-shaped cells advance into a spheroplast-like stage, which is thought to arise from dysregulated PG metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, Wag31 has been implicated in maintaining the lipid-rich IMD compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Heredia et al., 2021</xref>). But the molecular mechanisms by which Wag31 manages these functions has remained unclear. In this study, we discover an additional function of Wag31 as a membrane tether, which likely reconciles many of the previously ascribed functions of this protein into a unified model. To gain insights into defects associated with a change in cell shape, we imaged Wag31-deficient cells and found a dramatic accumulation of lipids in the form of ILIs. Interestingly, both <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>ΔWag31</italic>-ATc showed the presence of ILIs, but in much less abundance, indicating that ILIs are a normal occurrence that may function to regulate cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g, h</xref>).</p><p>The loss of Wag31 leads to the accumulation of neutral lipids while its overexpression increase the levels of α-MA, implying that the maintenance of native Wag31 levels is critical for the proper balance of lipid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>). The lipid classes that get impacted by the depletion of Wag31 vs overexpression are different. Wag31 is an adaptor protein that interacts with proteins of the ACCase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) that synthesize fatty acid precursors and regulate their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habibi Arejan et al., 2022</xref>). The varied response on lipid homeostasis could be attributed to a change in the stoichiometry of these interactions of Wag31. While Wag31 depletion would prevent such interactions from occurring and might affect lipid synthesis that directly depends on Wag31–protein partner interactions, its overexpression would lead to promiscuous interactions and a change in the stoichiometry of native interactions that would ultimately modulate lipid synthesis pathways.</p><p>A protein’s interactome is akin to its functional fingerprint. Here, we identify 116 novel interacting partners of Wag31 through mass spectrometry and validate three of these interactions, namely with MurG, SepIVA, and Msm2092, through pulldown studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5i</xref>). However, it can’t be ascertained whether interactions are direct or mediated by other proteins. Strikingly, the bulk of Wag31 interactors are membrane proteins, which might be attributed to the formation of Wag31 oligomers on the membrane. Our results identify MurG, SepIVA, which regulates MurG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freeman et al., 2023</xref>), the D-aminopeptidase Msm2092 and AmiB, both of which are PG remodellers, as Wag31 interactors. Together, these results contribute towards our understanding of how Wag31 affects PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, d</xref>). AccA3 is an interactor of Wag31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habibi Arejan et al., 2022</xref>) and catalyses the first committed step in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids by forming malonyl-CoA. In addition, long-chain-specific acyl dehydrogenase (LCAD), which we report here to be another interactor of Wag31, catalyses the first step in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, which might explain the accumulation of long-chain PEs and long-chain fatty acids.</p><p>As mentioned above, the overexpression of Wag31 leads to an upregulation in α-MA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The localization of the α-MA transporter MmpL3 depends on polar PG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arejan et al., 2024</xref>). MurG is an essential enzyme for PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salmond et al., 1980</xref>) and we report here that it strongly interacts with Wag31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, d</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that homeostatic control on lipid composition arises from the ability of Wag31 to modulate the activity of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and PG synthesis. That both depletion and overexpression of Wag31 affect lipid composition is likely also a manifestation of its ability to function as a homotypic tether, where the tethering ability is inherently sensitive to the tether concentration.</p><p>Our results are the first to establish a membrane tethering function of Wag31. DivIVA proteins possess an N-terminal membrane-binding domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choukate and Chaudhuri, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenarcic et al., 2009</xref>). Our data show that disruption of the N-terminal domain (Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub>) markedly reduces membrane binding and completely abolishes membrane tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f, g</xref>). The N-terminal domain binds CL while the C-terminal coiled-coil domain facilitates multimerization, which together could explain the molecular basis for Wag31 to function in homotypic tethering of CL-containing membranes. Results from testing mutants defective in membrane tethering indicate that this function is important for the proper localization of CL and eventually the survival of mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6c, d</xref>). Thus, alterations in the native levels of Wag31 results in a displacement of CL from the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>). However, given NAO’s ability to bind to anionic phospholipids (albeit with lower affinity), a smaller degree of NAO redistribution intensity might be coming indirectly from other anionic phospholipids displaced from the membrane due to the loss of membrane integrity or cell shape changes caused by Wag31 depletion.</p><p>While, complementation with Wag31 reverses the phenotypic changes observed upon Wag31 depletion, complementation with the membrane tethering-defective mutant (Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub>) fails to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5f, g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a–d</xref>). These results not only highlight the dependence of CL localization on membrane tethering but also underscores the importance of tethering for maintaining cellular morphology, physiology and survival. CL micro-domains at the poles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Renner and Weibel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oliver et al., 2014</xref> have been shown to be an important hub for protein localization and activity. Several studies have implicated CL in modulating the activities of membrane-resident proteins involved in electron-transport, protein translocation, bacterial two-component system, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carranza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ouellette et al., 2022</xref>). Our work delineates the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Wag31. The N-terminal DivIVA-domain facilitates lipid binding and membrane tethering, and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain engages in protein–protein interactions and facilitates the multimerization of Wag31. This is evident from findings that deletion of the N-terminal DivIVA-domain affects lipid binding and tethering but not its ability to bind interacting partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c, d, f, g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7c</xref>). Based on our results, we propose a model in which the N-terminal of Wag31 binds and tethers CL ensuring its proper localization while the C-terminal is free to interact and recruit proteins to the membrane to facilitate cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We reason that the loss of cell shape and viability in the absence of tethering occurs due to mis-localization of CL which in turn has a negative impact on membrane-localized processes at a global scale.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for Wag31-mediated tethering of the membrane.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Model of Wag31 showing the N- and C-terminals.

(<bold>b</bold>) Left: Illustration showing Wag31 scaffolds bound to cardiolipin in the membrane via N-terminal, tethering it and creating CL microdomains at the poles. The C-terminal of Wag31 bound to protein partners, localize them to the membrane, facilitating several membrane-centric processes such as PG and lipid synthesis, that ensure mycobacterial survival. The right panel shows the time-dependent consequences of Wag31 depletion that is early and late stage. The cells are bulged at one pole and start accumulating intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs) in the early stage and as the time progresses, the effect of Wag31 depletion becomes severe, rendering the cells round and full of ILIs. In the absence of Wag31, CL microdomains become delocalized due to the loss of tethering, pulling away several membrane-associated proteins causing non-polar growth and loss of curvature.

The pellets were resuspended in 1:3 (pellet weight:buffer volume) phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 5% glycerol and 1 mM protease inhibitor – PMSF. The resuspension was transferred into pre-equilibrated bead-beating tubes filled to one-fourth with 0.1 mm Zirconia beads. Pre-equilibration was performed by washing the beads with autoclaved MilliQ followed by lysis buffer. The tubes were placed in a bead-beater and subjected to six to eight cycles of bead-beating –1 min on and 2 min rest on ice. To obtain WCL, the tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected in a microcentrifuge tube. The concentration of protein in each sample was estimated by Pierce BCA protein Assay kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific), and 40 μg WCLs were resolved on 10–12% SDS–PAGE gels at constant current and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. This was followed by blocking the membrane with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for an hour at RT and subsequently incubating it with the desired primary antibody for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were either anti-RpoA (raised in rabbit), anti-Wag31 (raised in rabbit), anti-FLAG (raised in mice, Sigma), and anti-His (raised in rabbit, CST). The membrane was washed thrice for 10 min each with PBST (PBS + 0.5% Tween-20) to remove any non-specific binding. Next, the membrane was probed with appropriate secondary antibody (anti-rabbit, Invitrogen or anti-mice, Invitrogen) for an hour at RT, washed thrice for 10 min each with PBST, developed using ECL reagent (Millipore), and visualized on Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch Gel imaging system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sample preparation for SEM and TEM</title><p><italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic> were set up at <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>~0.05 and grown overnight in either the presence of absence of 100 ng/ml ATc.

Cells were then taken forward for critical-point drying with the help of 100 µl Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). Meanwhile, stubs were prepared by placing carbon tape and coverslip on them. 10 µl of the dried sample was spotted on the coverslip and evenly spread. Next, the stub was coated with 0.8 mm Gold and stored in a desiccator or imaged at ×20,000 using FEI Nova NanoSEM 450. For TEM, cells were grown and harvested as described above for SEM. For TEM sample preparation, 50 OD cells were taken, fixed, stained, and gradually dehydrated with ethanol, as explained above. The cells were then infiltrated with Epon 812 resin. This was followed by cutting the resin into several 62 nm thick ultra-thin sections using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7).

Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml sterilized PBS and transferred to a 3 ml glass vial. 2:1 chloroform:methanol mixture was added to it and vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Chloroform contained 1 nm 15:0 FFA to be used as the internal standard for normalization. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at RT to separate the organic layer. The latter was transferred to a new glass vial, and 2 ml chloroform (containing 2% formic acid) was added to the old vial to extract phospholipids from the sample. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at RT to extract the phospholipid-containing organic layer. Both organic layers were pooled and dried under a stream of Nitrogen gas at RT. The dried lipid extracts were re-solubilized in 200 μl of 2:1 CHCl<sub>3</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and 10 μl was injected into an Agilent 6545 QTOF (quadrupole-time-of-flight) instrument for semi-quantitative analysis using high-resolution auto MS/MS methods and chromatography techniques. A Gemini 5U C-18 column (Phenomenex) coupled with a Gemini guard column (Phenomenex, 4 × 3 mm, Phenomenex security cartridge) was used for LC separation. The solvents used for negative ion mode were buffer A: 95:5 H<sub>2</sub>O:CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 0.1% ammonium hydroxide and buffer B: 60:35:5 isopropanol:CH<sub>3</sub>OH:H<sub>2</sub>O + 0.1% ammonium hydroxide. The 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in each buffer was replaced by 0.1% formic acid + 10 mM ammonium formate for positive ion mode runs. All LC/MS runs were for 60 min, starting with 0.3 ml/min 100% buffer A for 5 min, 0.5 ml/min linear gradient to 100% buffer B over 40 min, 0.5 ml/min 100% buffer B for 10 min, and equilibration with 0.5 ml/min 100% buffer A for 5 min. The following settings were used for the ESI-MS analysis: drying gas and sheath gas temperature: 320°C, drying gas and sheath gas flow rate: 10 l/min, fragment or voltage: 150 V, capillary voltage: 4000 V, nebulizer (ion source gas) pressure: 45 psi, and nozzle voltage: 1000 V. For analysis, a lipid library was employed in the form of a Personal Compound Database Library (PCDL), and the peaks were validated based on relative retention times and fragments obtained. This library was selectively curated from the MycoMass database and the LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD). All robustly detected lipid species were quantified by normalizing areas under the curve (AUC) to the AUC of the relevant internal standard added and by normalizing to the total cell number.

One-fifth of the immunoprecipitation (IP) supernatant was resolved on a 10% gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-FLAG Antibody (Sigma). Lysates from confirmed IPs (biological quadruplets) were taken further for mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis. Sample preparation and, mass spectrometry analysis were outsourced to VProteomics, New Delhi. Briefly, the IP samples were reduced with 5 mM TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were digested with 1 μg Trypsin for 16 hr at 37°C. Digests were cleaned using a C18 silica cartridge and resuspended in a buffer containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. 1 μg of peptide was used for analysis in an Easy-nlc-1000 system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometer.

The reaction was incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature followed by exposure to a 1-min long pulse of 365 nm UV light (UVP crosslinker CL-1000L) at an intensity of 200 mJ cm<sup>−2</sup>. The reaction was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and equal volumes for all reactions were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and resolved using SDS–PAGE. iBright1500 (Thermo Fischer Scientific) or Amersham Typhoon (GE) were used for imaging gels. Gels were first imaged for BODIPY fluorescence and later fixed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Tethering assays, fluorescence imaging, and image analysis</title><p>1 µM of Wag31 and its mutants were mixed with 10 µM of 100 nm extruded liposomes in Eppendorf. The mixture was then transferred to a LabTek chamber and imaged using 100× 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective on an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope connected to an LED light source (CoolLED) and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics). Image acquisition was controlled by μManager, and images were analysed using Fiji. For single liposome intensity analysis, all images from the same condition from two independent experiments were combined into one montage. The montage was duplicated and thresholded using Fiji’s Otsu algorithm to generate a binary mask. The mask was overlaid onto the original montage to obtain the maximum intensity of liposomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>NAO labelling, imaging, and analysis</title><p><italic>Msm</italic>, <italic>Msm::wag31</italic> were treated with 5 μM IVN for 12 hr and <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic> were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml ATc for 12 hr. For complementation experiment, 1 ml of each strain was stained with 2 μM NAO for 1 hr protected from light in an incubator shaker and washed thrice with sterilized 1× PBS. 2 μl of cells were spotted on a 1% agar pad (prepared in 7H9) and visualized using a 100×/1.32 NA oil immersion objective on a Leica THUNDER Imaging systems at 475:535 nm (excitation:emission). About 20 Z-stack images, each spaced 0.1 μM apart, were acquired using a scientific CMOS K8 camera (Leica microsystems). For CL-specific labelling, collection was also performed at 642 nm.</p><p>Background correction and Thunder image processing were performed on the images using the Las-X software module (Leica microsystems). Processed images were then analysed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and plotted using GraphPad Prism 9. Briefly, <italic>N</italic> = 100 cells across two independent experiments were examined for their profile of CL distribution by normalizing the cell length and assigning pole with brighter NAO fluorescence intensity as 0 and the other pole as 100. The fluorescence intensity was normalized to the highest fluorescent value for each cell. Corresponding fluorescence intensity value for all cells for every point between 0 and 100 were calculated from the LOOKUP function of excel. The values representing CL fluorescence across 100 cells were averaged out and plotted against normalized cell length in GraphPad prism 9. 0th order smoothening with four neighbours on each size was performed on the curves obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Complementation experiment</title><p>Secondary cultures of <italic>Msm</italic>, <italic>Δwag31</italic>, <italic>Δwag31::wag31</italic>, <italic>Δwag31::wag31<sub>K20A</sub></italic>, and <italic>Δwag31::wag31<sub>ΔN</sub></italic> were set up at <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> ~0.05.

We have added a better clarification on this in the discussion of revised manuscript. The lipid classes that get impacted by the depletion of Wag31 vs overexpression are different. Wag31 is an adaptor protein that interacts with proteins of the ACCase complex (Meniche et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014) that synthesize fatty acid precursors and regulate their activity (Habibi Arejan et al., 2022).</p><p>The varied response on lipid homeostasis could be attributed to a change in the stoichiometry of these interactions of Wag31. While Wag31 depletion would prevent such interactions from occurring and might affect lipid synthesis that directly depends on Wag31-protein partner interactions, its overexpression would lead to promiscuous interactions and a change in the stoichiometry of native interactions that would ultimately modulate lipid synthesis pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The pulldown assays results are interesting, but links are tentative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The interactome of Wag31 was identified through the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Wag31 complemented at an integrative locus in Wag31 mutant background to avoid overexpression artifacts. We used Msm::gfp expressing an integrative copy (at L5 locus) of FLAG-GFP as a control to subtract non-specific interactions. The experiment was performed in biological triplicates, and interactors that appeared in all replicates but not in the control were selected for further analysis. Although we identified more than 100 interactors of Wag31, we analyzed only the top 25 hits, with a PSM cut-off 18 and unique peptides5. Additionally, two of Wag31's established interactors, AccD5 and Rne, were among the top five hits, thus validating our data.</p><p>As mentioned in line 139 of the previous version of the manuscript, we agree that the interactions can either be direct or through a third partner. The fact that we obtained known interactors of Wag31 makes us believe these interactions are genuine. Moreover, for validation, we performed pulldown experiments by mixing <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates expressing His-Wag31 full-length or truncated protein with <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> lysates expressing FLAG-tagged interacting proteins. The wash conditions used were quite stringent for these pull-down assays—the wash buffer contained 1% Triton X100 that eliminates all non-specific and indirect interactions. However, we agree that we cannot conclusively state that the interactions are direct without purifying the proteins and performing the experiment. As mentioned above, this caveat was stated in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors may perhaps like to rephrase claims of effects lipid homeostasis, as my understanding is that lipid localisation rather than catabolism/breakdown is affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In this manuscript, we are trying to convey that Wag31 is a spatiotemporal regulator of lipid metabolism. It is a peripheral protein that is hooked to the membrane via Cardiolipin and forms a scaffold at the poles, which helps localize several enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Homeostasis is the process by which an organism maintains a steady-state of balance and stability in response to changes. Depletion of Wag31 not only results in delocalisation of lipids in intracellular lipid inclusions but also leads to changes in the levels of various lipid classes. Advancement in the field of spatial biology underscores the importance of native localization of various biological molecules crucial for maintaining a steady-cell of the cell. Hence, we have used the word “homeostasis” to describe both the changes observed in lipid metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kapoor et. al. investigated the role of the mycobacterial protein Wag31 in lipid and peptidoglycan synthesis and sought to delineate the role of the N- and C- terminal domains of Wag31.

We have included two non-interactors of Wag31 i.e. MmpL4 and MmpS5 which were not identified in our interactome database as negative controls in the experiment. As shown in Figure S3, we performed His pull-down experiments with both of them independently twice, each time with a positive control (known interactor of Wag31 Msm2092). Fig. S3b revised shows <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate expressing His-Wag31 which was incubated with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG tagged-MmpL4 or -MmpS5 or Msm2092 (revised Fig. S3c). The mixed lysates were pulled down with Cobalt beads that bind to the His-tagged protein and analysed using Western blot analysis by probing with anti-FLAG antibody (revised Fig. S3d.). The data presented confirms that the interactions validated through the pull down assay were indeed specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The role of the N-terminus in the protein-protein interaction has not been ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Wag31<sub>Msm</sub> is a 272 amino acids long protein. The Nterminal of Wag31, which houses the DivIVA-domain, comprises the first 60 amino acids. Previously, we attempted to express the N-terminal (60 aa long) and the C-terminal (212 aa long) truncated proteins in various mycobacterial shuttle vectors to perform MS/MS experiments. Despite numerous efforts, neither expressed with the N/C-terminal FLAG tag or no tag in episomal or integrative vectors due to instability of the protein. Eventually, we successfully expressed the C-terminal Wag31 with an N and Cterminal hexa-His tag. However, this expression was not sufficient or stable enough for us to perform Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity pull-down experiments for mass spectrometry. N-terminal of Wag31 could not be expressed in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> even with N and C-terminal Hexa-His tags.</p><p>To rule out the role of the N-terminal in mediating protein-protein interactions, we cloned the N-terminal of Wag31 that comprises the DivIVA-domain in pET28b vector (Fig. 7a revised). Subsequently, the truncated protein, hereafter called Wag31<sub>∆C</sub> flanked by 6X His tags at both the termini was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and mixed with Msm lysates expressing interactors of Wag31 (Fig. 7b-c revised). Earlier experiments with Wag31<sub>∆1-60&lt;/sub or Wag31∆N (in the revised manuscript) were performed with MurG, SepIVA, Msm2092 and AccA3 (Fig. 7e-g). Thus, we used the same set of interactors to test our hypothesis. Briefly, His- Wag31∆C was mixed with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG-MurG, -SepIVA, -Msm2092 or -AccA3 and pull down experiments were performed as described previously. FLAGMmpS5, a non-interactor of Wag31 was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 7d revised, His-Wag31 could bind to all the four interactors whereas His- Wag31∆C couldn’t, strengthening the conclusion that interactions of Wag31 with other proteins are mediated by its Cterminal. However, we can’t ignore the possibility of other interactors binding to the N-terminal of Wag31. Unfortunately, due to poor expression/instability of Wag31∆C in mycobacterial shuttle vectors, we are unable to perform a global interactome analysis of Wag31∆C</sub></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the characterization of mycobacterial cytoskeleton protein Wag31, examining its role in orchestrating protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions essential for mycobacterial survival.

However, given that NAO is known to bind to various anionic phospholipids, how do the authors know that what they are seeing is specifically visualizing cardiolipin and not a different anionic phospholipid? For example, phosphatidylinositol is another abundant anionic phospholipid in mycobacterial plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Despite its promiscuous binding to other anionic phospholipids, 10-N-Nonyl-acridine orange is widely used to stain Cardiolipin and determine its localisation in bacterial cells and mitochondria of eukaryotes (Garcia Fernandez et al., 2004; Mileykovskaya &amp; Dowhan, 2000; Renner &amp; Weibel, 2011). This is because it has a stronger affinity for Cardiolipin than other anionic phospholipids with the affinity constant being 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M−<sup>1</sup> for Cardiolipin association and 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> M−<sup>1</sup> for that of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol association (Petit et al., 1992). Additionally, there is not yet another stain available for detecting Cardiolipin. Our proteinlipid binding assays suggest that Wag31 preferentially binds to Cardiolipin over other anionic phospholipids (Fig. 4b), hence it is likely that the majority of redistribution of NAO fluorescence that we observe might be contributed by Cardiolipin mislocalization due to altered Wag31 levels, with smaller degree of NAO redistribution intensity coming indirectly from other anionic phospholipids displaced from the membrane due to the loss of membrane integrity and cell shape changes due to Wag31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Authors' data show that the N-terminal region of Wag31 is important for membrane tethering. The authors' data also show that the N-terminal region is important for sustaining mycobacterial morphology. However, the authors' statement in Line 256 &quot;These results highlight the importance of tethering for sustaining mycobacterial morphology and survival&quot; requires additional proof. It remains possible that the N-terminal region has another unknown activity, and this yet-unknown activity rather than the membrane tethering activity drives the morphological maintenance. Similarly, the N-terminal region is important for lipid homeostasis, but the statement in Line 270, &quot;the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 is a consequence of its tethering activity&quot; requires additional proof. The authors should tone down these overstatements or provide additional data to support their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there exists a possibility for another function of the N-terminal that may contribute to sustaining mycobacterial physiology and survival. We would revise our statements in the paper to reflect the data. Results shown suggest that the tethering activity of the Nterminal region may contribute to mycobacterial morphology and survival. However, additional functions of this region can’t be ruled out. Similarly, the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 may be associated with its tethering activity, although other mechanisms could also contribute to this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Authors suggest that Wag31 acts as a scaffold for the IMD (Fig. 8). However, Meniche et. al. has shown that MurG as well as GlfT2, two well-characterized IMD proteins, do not colocalize with Wag31 (DivIVA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402158111">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402158111</ext-link>). IMD proteins are always slightly subpolar while Wag31 is located to the tip of the cell. Therefore, the authors' biochemical data cannot be easily reconciled with microscopic observations in the literature. This raises a question regarding the validity of protein-protein interaction shown in Figure 7. Since this pull-down assay was conducted by mixing <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate expressing Wag31 and Msm lysate expression Wag31 interactors like MurG, it is possible that the interactions are not direct. Authors should interpret their data more cautiously. If authors cannot provide additional data and sufficient justifications, they should avoid proposing a confusing model like Figure 8 that contradicts published observations.</p></disp-quote><p>In the literature, MurG and GlfT2 have been shown to have polar localisation (Freeman et al., 2023; Hayashi et al., 2016; Kado et al., 2023) and two groups have shown slightly sub-polar localisation of MurG (García-Heredia et al., 2021; Meniche et al., 2014). Additionally, (Freeman et al., 2023) showed SepIVA to be a spatio-temporal regulator of MurG. MS/MS analysis of Wag31 immunoprecipitation data yielded both MurG and SepIVA to be interactors of Wag31 (Fig. 3). Given Wag31 also displays polar localisation, it is likely that it associates with the polar MurG. However, since a sub-polar localisation of MurG has also been reported, it is possible that they do not interact directly and another protein mediates their interaction. Based on the above, we will modify the model proposed in Fig. 8.</p><p>We agree that for validation of interaction, we performed pulldown experiments by mixing <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates expressing His-Wag31 full-length or truncated protein with M. smegmatis lysates expressing FLAG-tagged interacting proteins. The wash conditions used were quite stringent for these pull-down assays—the wash buffer contained 1% Triton X100 that eliminates all non-specific and indirect interactions. However, we agree that we cannot conclusively state that the interactions are direct without purifying the proteins and performing the experiment. We will describe this caveat in the revised manuscript and propose a model that reflects the results we obtained.</p><p>References:</p><p>Freeman, A. H., Tembiwa, K., Brenner, J. R., Chase, M.

A better clarification/discussion is required here.

We have included a clarification for this in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The pulldown assays results are interesting, but the links are tentative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The interactome of Wag31 was identified through the immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged Wag31 complemented at an integrative locus in Wag31 mutant background to avoid overexpression artifacts. We used Msm::gfp expressing an integrative copy (at L5 locus) of FLAG-GFP as a control to subtract non-specific interactions. The experiment was performed in biological triplicates, and interactors that appeared in all replicates were selected for further analysis. Although we identified more than 100 interactors of Wag31, we analyzed only the top 25 hits, with a PSM cut-off 18 and unique peptides5. Additionally, two of Wag31's established interactors, AccD5 and Rne, were among the top five hits, thus validating our data.</p><p>Though we agree that the interactions can either be direct or through a third partner, the fact that we obtained known interactors of Wag31 makes us believe these interactions are genuine.

The wash conditions used were quite stringent for these pull-down assays—the wash buffer contained 1% Triton X100 that eliminates all non-specific and indirect interactions.

In this manuscript, we are trying to convey that Wag31 is a spatiotemporal regulator of lipid metabolism. It is a peripheral protein that is hooked to the membrane via Cardiolipin and forms a scaffold at the poles, which helps localize several enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Homeostasis is the process by which an organism maintains a steady-state of balance and stability in response to changes. Depletion of Wag31 not only results in delocalisation of lipids in intracellular lipid inclusions but also leads to changes in the levels of various lipid classes. Advancement in the field of spatial biology underscores the importance of native localization of various biological molecules crucial for maintaining a steady-cell of the cell. Hence, we have used the word “homeostasis” to describe both the changes observed in lipid metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I recommend the following experiments to strengthen the data presented:</p><p>(1) Include a non-interacting FLAG-tagged protein as a negative control in the pull-down experiment to strengthen this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As suggested, we have included non-interacting FLAGtagged proteins as negative controls in the pulldown experiment. We chose MmpL4 and MmpS5 which were not found in the Wag31 interactome data. We performed pull-down experiments with both of them and included an interactor of Wag31 i.e. Msm2092 as a positive control. Fig. S3b revised shows <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate expressing His-Wag31 which was incubated with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG taggedMmpL4 or -MmpS5 or -Msm2092 (Fig. S3c revised). The mixed lysates were pulled down with Cobalt beads that bind to the His-tagged protein and analysed using Western blot analysis by probing with anti-FLAG antibody. The pull down experiments were performed independently twice, every time with Msm2092 as the positive control (Fig. S3d. revised).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Perform the pull-down experiments using only the Wag31 N-terminus to rule out any role that it may have in the protein-protein interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. To rule out the possibility of N-terminal of Wag31 in mediating protein-protein interactions, we cloned the N-terminal of Wag31 that comprises the DivIVAdomain in pET28b vector (Fig. 7a revised). Subsequently, the truncated protein, hereafter called Wag31<sub>∆C</sub> flanked by 6X His tags at both the termini was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and subsequently mixed with Msm lysates expressing interactors of Wag31 (Fig. 7b-c revised). Earlier experiments with Wag31<sub>∆1-60</sub> or Wag31<sub>∆N</sub> were performed with MurG, SepIVA, Msm2092 and AccA3 (Fig. 7 previous) so we used the same set of interactors to test our hypothesis. Briefly, His-Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>was mixed with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG-MurG, -SepIVA, -Msm2092 or -AccA3 and pull down experiments were performed as described previously. FLAG-MmpS5, a non-interactor of Wag31 was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 7d revised, His-Wag31 could bind to all the four interactors whereas His-Wag31<sub>∆C</sub> couldn’t, strengthening the conclusion that interactions of Wag31 with other proteins are mediated by its C-terminal. However, we can’t ignore the possibility of other proteins binding to the Nterminal of Wag31. Unfortunately, due to poor expression/instability of Wag31<sub>∆C</sub> in mycobacterial shuttle vectors, we couldn’t perform a global interactome analysis of Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>- Please check the legend of Fig. 1g, it appears to be labelled incorrectly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked it.

The sequence analysis of the plasmid expressing Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> doesn’t show additional mutations other than the desired K20A.

We attribute greater confidence on the lipidomics data which suggests down regulation of CL species. The NAO staining and microscopy is merely for studying localization of the CL along the cell, and cannot be used to reliably quantify or equate it to CL levels. The staining using a probe such as NAO is dependent on factors such as hydrophobicity and permeability of the cell wall, which we expect to be severely altered in a Wag31 mutant. Therefore, the increased staining of NAO seen in Wag31 mutant could just be reflective of the increased uptake of the dye rather than absolute levels of CL. The specificity of staining and localization however can be expected to be unaltered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Following are suggestions for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>• Figure 1, the meaning of the yellow arrows present in f and h should be mentioned in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated that in the revised legend.
