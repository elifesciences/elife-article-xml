to exist. Here, we explore the cellular versus synaptic origins of spinal rhythmicity at different speeds by performing electrophysiological recordings from premotor excitatory interneurons in larval zebrafish. Chx10-labeled V2a neurons are divided into at least two morphological subtypes proposed to play distinct roles in timing and intensity control. Consistent with distinct rhythm generating and output patterning functions within the spinal V2a population, we find that descending subtypes are recruited exclusively at slow or fast speeds and exhibit intrinsic cellular properties suitable for rhythmogenesis at those speeds, while bifurcating subtypes are recruited more reliably at all speeds and lack appropriate rhythmogenic cellular properties. Unexpectedly, however, phasic firing patterns during locomotion in rhythmogenic and non-rhythmogenic V2a neurons alike are best explained by distinct modes of synaptic inhibition linked to cell type and speed. At fast speeds reciprocal inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while recurrent inhibition in bifurcating V2a neurons helps pattern motor output. In contrast, at slow speeds recurrent inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while bifurcating V2a neurons rely on reciprocal inhibition alone to pattern output. Our findings suggest cell-type-specific, not common, modes of rhythmogenesis generate and coordinate different speeds of locomotion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd><kwd>rhythmogenesis</kwd><kwd>recurrent inhibition</kwd><kwd>reciprocal inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS125187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLean</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS125207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLean</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unexpected complexity in the synaptic basis of locomotor rhythmogenesis is linked to cell type and speed in larval zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All forms of vertebrate locomotion rely on rhythmic activity in muscles operating as functional antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grillner, 1985</xref>). For instance, swimming in fishes relies on left–right alternation of axial muscles across the body, while walking in mammals relies on flexor–extensor alternation along it. A landmark hypothesis posed over a century ago argued for corresponding excitatory ‘half-centers’ within spinal cord (e.g., left–right or flexor–extensor), with reciprocal, feedforward inhibition between half-centers generating rhythmic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 1911</xref>). Since then reciprocal inhibition has been relegated to patterning activity between so-called ‘unit burst generators’ capable of rhythmogenesis via recurrent, feedback excitatory connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grillner and Kozlov, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The idea of solitary unit burst generators reliant on recurrent connectivity disconnects rhythmogenesis from activity in other unit burst generators, which helps explain the flexible patterns of coordination necessary to effectively navigate through unpredictable environments. For example, simulations adjusting the synaptic coupling strength between segmental axial unit burst generators can explain changes in the speed and direction of swimming in lampreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kozlov et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, simulations altering the synaptic coupling between segmental limb unit burst generators can replicate different speeds and gaits of locomotion in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillner, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Another theory explaining speed-dependent changes in coordination stratifies ‘rhythm’ and ‘pattern’ control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perret and Cabelguen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koshland and Smith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kriellaars et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea, 2005</xref>), where populations of interneurons generating higher- or lower-frequency rhythms feed into separate populations coordinating distinct patterns of motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ausborn et al., 2019</xref>). In support, studies in zebrafish and mice suggest separate spinal populations are active at different locomotor speeds with distinct patterns of motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Picton et al., 2022</xref>). Critically, however, rhythmogenesis is presumed to originate from a common mechanism regardless of speed, reliant on cellular properties or synaptic drive or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guertin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ryczko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ziskind-Conhaim and Hochman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Manira, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have explored the origins of spinal rhythmogenesis at different speeds using the larval zebrafish model system, where it is possible to link the identity, physiology and connectivity of interneurons to their recruitment patterns at different speeds of locomotion. Like all fish, larval zebrafish generate two basic modes of forward swimming or ‘gaits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Santo et al., 2021</xref>). Anguilliform mode is typically reserved for escaping predators and uses higher-frequency/-amplitude oscillations of the trunk, while carangiform mode utilizes lower-frequency/-amplitude oscillations of the tail for exploration and pursuing prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budick and O’Malley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller and van Leeuwen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thorsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Swimming at different speeds is generated by axial motor neurons organized into fast, slow, and intermediate units distinguished by birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers et al., 1986</xref>), size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2007</xref>), relative innervation of fast and slow muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello-Rojas et al., 2019</xref>), and molecular signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D’Elia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallucchi et al., 2024</xref>).

To test this idea, we performed current- and voltage-clamp recordings from Chx10-labeled spinal V2a interneurons, which provide a major source of phasic premotor excitation during locomotion in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McLean and Dougherty, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We find that morphologically distinct V2a neurons sort into rhythm-generating and pattern-forming subtypes based on distinct cellular properties linked to distinct patterns of recruitment and synaptic drive. Critically, among descending V2a neurons that qualify as rhythm-generating, reciprocal inhibition originating from contralateral sources supports phasic firing patterns at fast speeds, while recurrent inhibition from ipsilateral sources supports phasic firing patterns at slow speeds. For bifurcating V2a neurons considered pattern-forming, the opposite is true – recurrent inhibition supports phasic firing at fast speeds and reciprocal inhibition at slow speeds. Ultimately, our findings reveal unexpected cell-type-specific and speed-dependent complexity in the mechanisms of spinal rhythmogenesis underlying locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying V2a neurons for recordings during ‘fictive’ escape swimming</title><p>From our previous work studying V2a neurons in larval zebrafish we know they are organized into: (1) fast and slow subtypes based on dorsoventral (DV) soma position and birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean and Fetcho, 2009</xref>), and (2) distinct subtypes that provide stronger direct versus indirect control of motor neuron recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>). Specifically, V2a neurons with descending axons (V2a-D) provide stronger inputs to other premotor interneurons, while V2a neurons with bifurcating axons (V2a-B) provide stronger inputs to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>), in line with differential rhythm and pattern control. However, we do not know if the same mechanisms of rhythmogenesis shape the phasic activation of distinct V2a types at different speeds.</p><p>To record from distinct types of V2a neurons, we targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive neurons located at midbody in the Tg(Chx10:GFP) line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>), since midbody neurons would be recruited during both fast anguilliform and slow carangiform modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller and van Leeuwen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thorsen et al., 2004</xref>). V2a-D and V2a-B neurons recruited at fast speeds can be distinguished by levels of Chx10 expression in transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>), as reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). To get a better sense of differences in the number and spatial distribution of distinct types, we split GFP-positive neurons into two categories based on a bimodal distribution of fluorescence intensity and normalized their soma positions to DV and mediolateral (ML) axes in the spinal cord. Larger, dimmer V2a neurons intermingled with smaller, brighter neurons along the DV axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), but occupied more lateral positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).

Notably, zebrafish swimming is episodic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McHenry and Lauder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soto and McHenry, 2020</xref>) and so it can continue intermittently after the initial escape swim episode. Subsequent episodes (Swim 2+) rarely exceeded peak firing frequencies observed in the first stimulus-evoked episode (&gt;60 Hz in Swim 1) and there was more variability in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). For purposes of analysis, we pooled data from the first (Swim 1) and subsequent (Swim 2+) episodes to capture as broad a frequency range as possible.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-94349-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>High-speed video of real escape swimming in a 5-day-old larva.</title><p>(A) Larva is touched near the head by a sharpened tungsten pin, which triggers a rapid escape bend, followed by high-frequency anguilliform swimming and then ending with low-frequency carangiform swimming.

In theory, neurons that are intrinsically rhythmogenic can create patterned outputs from unpatterned inputs. Thus, to explore the intrinsic rhythmicity of V2a neurons we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings from high and low GFP-positive V2a neurons and tested their firing responses to stable current steps. By including dye in our recording pipette, we confirmed post hoc that all high GFP neurons we targeted for recordings were V2a-Ds and all low GFP neurons were V2a-Bs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as we would expect based on our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>).

This is consistent with the proposed hierarchical organization of V2a neurons, with V2a-Ds occupying a position upstream of V2a-Bs, which is not as obvious based purely on spike distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). For fast V2a-Ds, phasic inhibition was also broadly distributed, with a dip that coincided with the peak distributions of both excitation and spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). For slow V2a-Ds, there were two clear peaks in phasic inhibition, one immediately trailing in-phase excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>bottom arrow</italic>) and one peaking anti-phase. Remarkably, for V2a-B neurons, we observed the opposite pattern for phasic inhibition. Fast V2a-Bs received peaks in- and anti-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>top arrow</italic>), while slow V2a-Bs received predominantly anti-phase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Notably, the presence of in-phase inhibition was also associated with a more coherent distribution of spikes in slow V2a-Ds and fast V2a-Bs (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Next, to get a better sense of how patterns of phasic excitation and inhibition ultimately shape phasic firing patterns within different types at different speeds, we binned the data by frequency as above and examined averages of normalized raw current traces. Among the V2a-Ds, fast subtypes exhibited reciprocal inhibition at all frequencies, with phasic peaks in excitation and inhibition most obvious at higher frequencies coincident with spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Among slow V2a-Ds, coherent peaks in reciprocal and recurrent inhibition were most obvious at slow speeds coincident with phasic excitation and spiking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Among the V2a-Bs, patterns of reciprocal and recurrent inhibition were consistent across all speed bins, with peaks in phasic excitation and dips in phasic inhibition coincident with spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Thus, despite differences in cellular rhythmogenic capacity, these observations suggest all types of V2a neurons rely on phasic excitation and inhibition to sculpt their rhythmic firing behavior during swimming. Peaks in phasic excitation arrive earlier among V2a-D neurons consistent with their hierarchical positioning upstream from V2a-B neurons, and the relative coherence of phasic excitatory and inhibitory drive at different frequencies is consistent with speed modularity in this population. Among V2a-B neurons, the coherence of phasic excitatory and inhibitory drive over the entire frequency range is consistent with a role integrating inputs from the different speed modules. Critically, these data also suggest reciprocal inhibition plays a key role in rhythmogenesis at fast speeds, while recurrent inhibition plays a more dominant role in rhythmogenesis at slow speeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Synaptic silencing of reciprocal inhibition has speed-dependent effects on rhythm versus pattern</title><p>Our data thus far suggest that reciprocal inhibition plays a key role in rhythmogenesis at fast speeds via V2a-D neurons, while it plays a more dominant role patterning output at slow speeds via V2a-B neurons.

Since dI6 neurons located more ventrally participate in faster swimming movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kishore et al., 2020</xref>), we expected the impact of synaptic silencing would be more obvious at higher frequencies.</p><p>Consistent with this idea, in dI6 BoTx-GFP fish we frequently observed synchronous bilateral activity at the beginning of swim episodes when frequency is typically highest (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which could transition to rhythmic, alternating activity nearer the end of the episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In control larvae, left–right phase values in the first and subsequent swim episodes had peak distributions that rarely deviated from 0.5, as you would expect for perfect alternation during locomotor rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). On the other hand, for BoTx-GFP fish, left–right phase values were more broadly distributed, especially at the beginning of the episode, which was more obvious in the initial swim episode compared to subsequent ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). This is also consistent with differences in peak frequencies observed near the beginning of swim episodes, where they are always higher in the episode immediately following the stimulation (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>The lack of coordinated rhythmogenic output across the body at fast speeds was also apparent when comparing ventral rootlet burst frequencies. In dI6-GFP fish, higher-frequency activity overlapping higher-frequency activity in controls was observed at the beginning of swim episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, black dots), however this was rarely associated with higher-frequency activity in the corresponding cycle on the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In controls, cyclical frequencies on the left and right sides were symmetrical, with most of the datapoints falling along unity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Spinal motor neurons exhibit a range of rhythmogenic cellular properties themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menelaou and McLean, 2012</xref>), which likely contribute to the higher-frequency bursts observed unilaterally. Thus, the disorganized unilateral bursting during bilaterally synchronous output at the onset of swimming in dI6 BoTx-GFP fish is consistent with the selective disruption of rhythmogenesis at fast speeds.</p><p>Finally, we turned our attention to lower-frequency swimming observed nearer the end of swimming, which was less impacted by BoTx expression. For purposes of analysis, we divided the dataset into the initial (Swim 1) and subsequent (Swim 2+) swim episodes, and focused on ventral rootlet burst frequencies below 35 Hz. A comparison of burst frequency and phase revealed no significant differences between dI6 BoTx-GFP and control fish, consistent with a lack of impact on timing and rhythm generation at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H</xref>). However, we did observe an increase in burst duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), which increased the percentage of the swim cycle occupied by motor output, or duty cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). These effects on were most obvious in the initial swim episode, where duty cycles could reach 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Normally, duty cycles must not exceed 50% of the cycle period to avoid synchronous bilateral contractions during swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 1974</xref>). Thus, at slow speeds the dominant impact of synaptic silencing of dI6 neurons is on motor output, not rhythmogenesis. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the idea that reciprocal inhibition plays a more dominant role in rhythm generation at fast speeds and a more dominant role in pattern formation at slow speeds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work was motivated by the opaque origins of spinal rhythmicity at different locomotor speeds and the potential for zebrafish to clarify this fundamental issue.

In larval zebrafish, there are two ‘gaits’ during forward swimming as defined by limb coordination – slow carangiform mode which involves cyclical abduction/adduction of pectoral fins that alternates across the body and fast anguilliform mode which involves bilateral fin adduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thorsen et al., 2004</xref>). The transition in fin coordination occurs abruptly between tail beat frequencies of 30–40 Hz in larvae, with graded increases in the cyclical frequency and intensity of body bends leading to increased yaw displacement of the head at faster speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thorsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLean et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Earlier studies of larval zebrafish found that V2a neurons active at slow speeds are inhibited as V2a neurons active at fast speeds are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLean et al., 2008</xref>).

For swimming, faster speeds require not only higher-frequency oscillations, but also larger amplitude body bends that propagate more quickly to generate reactive thrust against the water column for effective propulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 1974</xref>). Among descending V2a neurons, those recruited at faster speeds have longer intersegmental axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>) and form stronger connections with other V2a neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>). Among bifurcating V2a neurons, intersegmental axon projection distances are more homogeneous, membrane time constants and axon conduction velocities are faster, and connections to motor neurons are stronger and more reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menelaou et al., 2022</xref>).

From our recordings of spinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menelaou and McLean, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>), we were expecting that cellular properties are more important for rhythmogenesis at slow speeds, while synaptic drive dominates at fast speeds, which could also vary based on V2a type. Our recordings revealed that all V2a neurons demonstrate some form of rhythmicity in response to current steps. The idea that different types of V2a interneurons exhibit different firing properties is not unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty and Kiehn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Song et al., 2020</xref>). However, thanks to our ability to link cellular properties to natural recruitment patterns we reveal V2a-Ds alone would qualify as ‘pacemakers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>), with speed-dependent differences in intrinsic firing mode within V2a-Ds. Specifically, V2a-D neurons recruited at swim frequencies below ~40 Hz during carangiform swimming generate intrinsic bursting at those frequencies, with higher-frequency spikes riding atop lower-frequency membrane oscillations. Intrinsic oscillations are more sensitive to levels of current injection than spike rates, so increases in tonic excitatory drive would lead to increased burst frequency and thus swim frequency. V2a-D neurons recruited at frequencies above ~40 Hz during anguilliform swimming generate tonic spiking at those frequencies, so increases in tonic excitatory drive would lead to increases in firing frequency and thus swim frequency. In V2a-B neurons, chattering and bursting properties in response to current steps do not reflect their natural firing patterns during swimming, and so we expected they would rely more on pacemaking inputs from V2a-Ds to shape their rhythmicity.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, despite clear differences in cellular properties appropriate to generate swimming rhythms, phasic firing in both V2a-Ds and V2a-Bs is best explained by phasic patterns of synaptic excitation and inhibition. Since phasic excitatory input is not tonic and already rhythmic by the time it arrives, this suggests rhythms are generated by more rostral V2a-Ds. Optogenetic stimulation of V2a neurons and spinal lesion studies support a rostral bias in spinal rhythmicity in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wiggin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with studies of spinal locomotor networks in lampreys and tadpoles, where neurons nearer the hindbrain/spinal cord boundary have a higher capacity for rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchanan, 2018</xref>). Our synaptic silencing of dI6 neurons also supports this idea. Previous work using diphtheria toxin to kill dI6 neurons employed an elegant Hox-based strategy to limit expression to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satou et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to our observations, zebrafish larvae with ablated spinal dI6 neurons can still generate fast swimming. Notwithstanding differences in cellular ablation versus synaptic silencing approaches and their relative sensitivity to potential compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schnerwitzki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Del Pozo et al., 2020</xref>), our strategy also included dI6 neurons that extended into the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>arrow</italic>). By subtractive reasoning, this argues that reciprocal inhibition nearer the hindbrain/spinal cord is essential for generating high-frequency rhythms.</p><p>Regardless, while all midbody V2a neurons rely on synaptic drive to fire rhythmically at all speeds, the patterns of synaptic excitation and inhibition responsible for rhythmogenesis varies in a cell-type- and speed-dependent manner. Our results combined with prior work allow us to put together a potential model explaining the cellular and synaptic origins of rhythmogenesis at different speeds of swimming. In zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>), V2a neurons have been categorized into descending (I) and bifurcating (II) subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Our data only strengthen cross-species links by demonstrating that type I and II V2a neurons in larval zebrafish not only differ in axon trajectories, rostro-caudal distribution, size, Chx10 levels, and connectivity, but also in their ML distribution in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary diagrams of cell-type-specific origins of locomotor rhythmicity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the major spinal interneuron types that provide excitation (top) and inhibition (bottom) during locomotion.

In zebrafish, as in mice, there are at least two potential sources of ipsilateral inhibition, V1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Higashijima et al., 2004</xref>) and V2b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Callahan et al., 2019</xref>), and two potential sources of commissural inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satou et al., 2020</xref>), dI6 neurons and V0d neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). In our model, we include the two specific types of V2a neurons and single generic sources of recurrent and reciprocal inhibition, each of which has the potential to form connections with the other types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sengupta and Bagnall, 2023</xref>). We do not include conserved sources of commissural excitation here (e.g., V0v and V3 neurons), but these will be important to include in any future models exploring intersegmental coordination and signal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wiggin et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the operational definition of reciprocal versus recurrent inhibition would be flipped for commissural excitatory populations, with feedforward inhibition via ipsilateral interneurons and feedback inhibition via commissural interneurons.</p><p>The simplest scenario is that the wiring diagrams for slow and fast modules are mirror duplications distinguished only by the inclusion of slow or fast motor pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with this idea, our cell-attached and voltage-clamp data support distinct slow and fast type I V2a-Ds defined by selective within module connectivity. These neurons in turn converge on slow and fast type II V2a-Bs, which relay integrated frequency information to their respective motor pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In the fast module, rhythmogenesis orchestrated by type I V2a neurons relies on reciprocal inhibition. This is consistent with cell-type-specific optical ablation and silencing studies in adult lampreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchanan and McPherson, 1995</xref>) and embryonic frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moult et al., 2013</xref>) that suggest reciprocal inhibition is essential for rhythmogenesis during anguilliform swimming. Rhythmic activity can also be generated in surgically isolated hemi-cords and surgically divided spinal cords of lampreys and frog embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahn and Roberts, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soffe, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cangiano and Grillner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cangiano and Grillner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, the functional relevance of these rhythms and the impact of lesion-induced plasticity on excitability and connectivity are still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Messina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cangiano and Grillner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClellan, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the fast module, recurrent inhibition helps limit motor output via type II V2a-Bs. Type II V2a-Bs have relatively strong connections to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menelaou and McLean, 2019</xref>), so limiting their firing would ensure that motor output does not exceed 50% of the duty cycle and risk bilateral co-contraction as the interval between cyclical bursts decreases with increased speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner, 1974</xref>). On the other hand, the cell-type-dependent dominance of reciprocal versus recurrent inhibition is flipped when considering the slow module. Instead, recurrent inhibition is more obvious in type I V2a-D neurons, while type II V2a-B neurons rely exclusively on reciprocal inhibition to pattern their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Until now recurrent inhibition was linked to limiting motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hultborn et al., 1979</xref>), not to rhythmogenesis (see, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindén and Berg, 2021</xref>).</p><p>It remains to be seen why reciprocal inhibition would be favored for rhythmogenesis at fast speeds and recurrent inhibition at slow speeds. One possibility is that feedforward inhibition is necessary to properly coordinate bilateral rhythmogenesis among type I V2a-D neurons with longer-range intersegmental connectivity. On the other hand, feedback inhibition among shorter-range type I V2a-D neurons provides an opportunity for local segmental rhythms that rely less on contralateral activity. Since slow type II V2a-B neurons lack feedback inhibition, their recruitment patterns rely exclusively on feedforward inhibition from the opposite side. This means stronger activity on one side should limit output on the other side without impacting timing and vice versa. In support, we recently explored the contribution of spinal V2a neurons to biased swimming during optomotor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jay et al., 2023</xref>). We found that type I V2a-D neurons are direction-agnostic, but type II V2a-B neurons are direction-sensitive, with higher recruitment probabilities on the turning side associated with weaker motor output on the opposite side.</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to low recruitment probabilities observed for type I V2a-D neurons during swimming evoked by somatosensory stimulation here (&lt;50%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), for swimming during optomotor responses V2a-D neurons are recruited with much higher probabilities (&gt;75%). This is not speed related since swim frequencies during optomotor responses rarely exceeded 35 Hz. Notably, the phase distribution of V2a-D spikes during optomotor responses (Figure 5H in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jay et al., 2023</xref>) better aligns with the phase distribution of EPSCs reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>), meaning that type I V2a-Ds fire well in advance of type II V2a-Bs during optomotor responses. Thus, it appears that during somatosensory-evoked swimming, where intensity and frequency are coupled over a broad range of speeds, type I and II V2a neurons fire more synchronously than during visually evoked swimming, where intensity and frequency are uncoupled over a more narrow speed range. While this highlights the modular nature of timing (rhythm) and intensity (pattern) control within the spinal V2a population, future experiments testing this idea will rely on identifying molecular markers that distinguish slow and fast type I and II V2a neurons. Fortunately, recent work has identified promising candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallucchi et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Another open question is what role differences in cellular properties play during rhythmogenesis. First, our recordings were performed at midbody. It could be that rhythmogenic bursting and spiking properties are a general feature of type I V2a-D neurons, so more rostral neurons have identical cellular properties and rely less on phasic synaptic drive for fast and slow rhythmogenesis. Future recordings from V2a neurons in rostral spinal cord should help resolve this issue, however our dI6 synaptic silencing experiments suggest that reciprocal inhibition will be critical for rostral rhythmogenesis, at least at fast speeds. On the other hand, bursting properties could serve as a source of amplification for synaptic inputs to ensure reliable recruitment of rhythmogenic neurons or provide redundant sources of rhythmogenesis in cases where synaptic drive fails or the spinal cord is damaged. In this sense, cellular properties and synaptic drive would provide synergistic roles amplifying and sharpening rhythmic signals as they propagate segmentally.</p><p>In juvenile/adult zebrafish, V2a and motor neurons have been grouped into slow, intermediate, fast, and escape modules based on patterns of recruitment and phasic synaptic drive during fictive swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Manira, 2023</xref>). In larvae, we also observe recruitment patterns among V2a neurons that would qualify as slow, intermediate, fast and escape based on their criteria (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, we also find that recruitment probability varies based on morphological type, with V2a-D neurons always firing more sparsely than V2a-B neurons, regardless of speed. Thus, low firing probability recorded at slow speeds does not necessarily predict high firing probability at fast speeds. Collectively, these observations suggest that increases in speed in juveniles/adults and larvae are initially accomplished via more reliable V2a neuron recruitment, as also reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>). This fits studies of motor neurons, where relatively low initial forces rely on recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enoka and Duchateau, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jay et al., 2023</xref>), while higher forces are achieved by increasing firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enoka and Duchateau, 2017</xref>), in addition to silencing more easily recruited neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kyriakatos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menelaou and McLean, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In sum, our findings suggest that cell-type-specific modes of spinal rhythmogenesis are responsible for different speeds, which means a common mechanism of rhythmogenesis is insufficient to explain the full operational range of locomotion. Experiments combining computational modeling with acute segmental perturbations of distinct interneuron types are now needed to explore the functional impact of stratified spinal locomotor circuits with cell-type-specific feedforward and feedback inhibitory motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry</title><p>Tg[Chx10:GFP] fish (ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-061204-2) were used to target V2a neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>), and compound Tg[Dmrt3a:Gal4;UAS:pTagRFP] fish (ZFIN IDs: ZDB-FISH-150901-3557; ZDB-TGCONSTRUCT-210826-11) crossed with Tg[UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP] fish (ZFIN ID: ZDB-FISH-160816-31) were used to express botulinum-toxin light chain fused with GFP in commissural inhibitory dI6 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Satou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sternberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kishore et al., 2020</xref>).

Because 4–5 dpf larvae have not yet developed secondary sexual characteristics, their sex cannot be easily determined. Therefore, experiments were performed on larvae of either sex. All experimental protocols conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal experimentation and were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IS00019359 and IS00019319).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiology and analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were acquired using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices), a Digidata series 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices), and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). The intrinsic firing patterns of V2a neurons were assessed by performing 500ms long current steps at 1–2x rheobase in current-clamp mode. To compare the intrinsic firing properties of V2a neurons to their recruitment profiles during ‘fictive’ escape swimming, we performed simultaneous whole-cell current-clamp recordings of V2a neurons and extracellular recordings of the peripheral ventral rootlet. Synaptic currents during fictive swimming were assessed in dual whole voltage-clamp and extracellular rootlet recordings. Swimming was evoked by applying a mild and brief electrical shock (2–10 V; 0.1–0.4 ms) using a bipolar tungsten electrode placed over the tail fin.</p><p>For recordings larvae were first paralyzed using alpha-bungarotoxin (1 mg/ml in extracellular solution containing 134 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl)-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 mM glucose, and 2.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, adjusted to pH 7.8 with NaOH), immersed in extracellular solution containing anesthetic (MS-222), and secured left side up on a Sylgard lined glass bottom dish using custom etched tungsten pins through the notochord. To record the activity of the peripheral ventral rootlets, the skin over the muscle tissue at the midbody was removed using fine forceps. For access to spinal V2a neurons, the muscle tissue over one spinal segment was dissected away using a tool fashioned from sharpened tungsten wire. After the dissection, the preparation was rinsed and immersed in anesthetic-free extracellular solution. For cell-attached and whole-cell recordings, standard-wall (1 mm outer diameter) borosilicate capillaries (Sutter Instrument) were pulled to resistances between 5 and 16 MΩ using a micropipette puller (Flaming/Brown; Sutter Instrument). For peripheral motor nerve recordings, electrodes were made by pulling a patch electrode, breaking the tip, and then heat polishing and bending it using a microforge (MF-830; Narishige) to offset the approach angle for better contact between the electrode and muscle tissue. Peripheral motor nerve recordings were made no more than two segments caudal to the site of cellular recording.</p><p>For current-clamp recordings, patch electrodes were filled with intracellular solution containing (125–130 mM K-gluconate, 2–4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2–10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH). For voltage-clamp recordings, the intracellular solution consisted of 122 mM CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1–1 mM QX314-Cl, 1 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, and 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP. CsMeSO<sub>3</sub> and QX-314 Cl were included in the solution to block voltage-dependent channels. Alexa Fluor 568 hydrazide (50 μmol/l) was also added to the intracellular solution for the post hoc confirmation of cell identity. Only neurons whose morphologies could be positively identified were included in this study.</p><p>V2a neurons were targeted on an epifluorescent microscope (Axio Examiner) under a ×40/1.0 NA water-immersion objective (W Plan-Apochromat; Zeiss) using a CCD camera (Rolera-XR; QImaging). The electrode was positioned using a motorized micromanipulator (MP-225; Sutter Instrument or Patchstar, Scientifica), while positive pressure was maintained using a pneumatic transducer (Model DPM-1B; Bio-Tek Instruments) to prevent the tip from clogging as the neuron was approached. The neuron was held at −65 mV during GΩ seal formation. Once the seal was achieved, for voltage-clamp experiments cell-attached recordings were performed to obtain the recruitment patterns of V2a neurons during fictive escape swimming before breaking into the neuron to record synaptic currents. A 5-mV hyperpolarizing pulse was then administered at a holding potential of −65 mV, and the steady-state current injected during the pulse was used to compute input resistance according to Ohm’s law.</p><p>Excitatory currents were clamped at the reversal potential for inhibition calculated from our solutions, which is −75 mV and inhibitory currents were clamped at the reversal potential for excitation, which is +10 mV. These values were corrected for a calculated junction potential of −11 mV. Thus, neurons were alternately held at the corrected potentials of −64 mV for EPSCs and 21 mV for IPSCs. To monitor series resistance throughout the experiment, recordings were alternately performed without and with 60% series resistance compensation. Standard corrections for bridge balance and electrode capacitance were applied for current-clamp recordings. Whole-cell electrical signals were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 100 kHz at a gain of 10 (feedback resistor, 500 MΩ). Extracellular signals from the peripheral motor nerves were amplified at a gain of 1000 and digitized with low- and high-frequency cutoffs set at 300 and 5000 Hz, respectively.</p><p>Whole-cell and extracellular recordings were annotated in Dataview to label individual spikes, ventral rootlet bursts, and swimming episodes. The onset and duration of spikes, ventral root bursts and swimming episodes were then batch exported into text files, which were then read into MATLAB (Mathworks) for further analysis. Instantaneous spike frequencies are the inverse of the period between two successive action potentials. The recruitment patterns of V2a neurons were quantified by computing the probability of observing spikes for all cycles present within each 5 Hz ventral root burst frequency bin from 10 to 65 Hz. The recruitment probability was then plotted as a function of ventral root burst frequency. The V2a neurons with an upward sloping recruitment reliability plot were classified as fast and those with a downward sloping plot were categorized as slow (cf., trendlines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Maximum excitatory and inhibitory currents reflect the maximum current received at any ventral root burst frequency. To compare frequency-dependent changes in synaptic currents across neuron types, they were normalized against the maximum synaptic current the neuron received. Normalized currents were then averaged in four discrete frequency bins spanning carangiform and anguilliform swimming modes (15–25, 25–35, 35–45, and 45+ Hz). To analyze the phasic timing of spiking and synaptic currents, they were normalized to the period of the corresponding cycle, such that the centers of successive motor bursts marked phases 0 and 1. Synaptic currents arriving between 0.75 and 0.25 were considered in-phase and those between 0.25 and 0.75 considered anti-phase. To analyze the relative timing of excitation and inhibition, we normalized amplitudes to the maximum current received in each cycle, such that the final values of normalized current ranged between 0 and 1. Currents were then averaged for all cycles present within the four frequency bins.</p><p>To quantify peaks in synaptic currents corresponding to the phasic inputs received during a swim cycle, current traces were low pass filtered at the cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz using the butterworth (second order) and zero phase digital filters in MATLAB. The latter was used to prevent the raw current values from undergoing a phase shift. Peaks were detected using the findpeaks() function in MATLAB. Counts of V2a spikes, EPSC’s and IPSC’s were plotted on a circular axis from phase 0 to 1. Data visualization and statistical analysis were performed in R.</p><p>To quantify left–right alternation in control and botulinum-toxin expressing dI6 neurons, dual ventral rootlet recordings were rectified and annotated in DataView. Owing to the highly irregular nature of the ventral rootlet activity in the dI6-silenced fish, automatic event detection parameters used to distinguish motor bursts in control conditions were unable to accurately demarcate the boundaries of motor bursts in BoTx-GFP fish. Therefore, all annotations for controls and BoTx-GFP were performed manually. Ventral root bursts at frequencies above a 100 Hz were excluded from analysis since this is the upper bound of their natural swimming range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller and van Leeuwen, 2004</xref>). Stimulus, burst, and bout onset and offset times for all recordings were batch exported into text files. Custom written MATLAB code was then used to classify Swim 1 and Swim 2+ episodes and identify corresponding bursts in the dual ventral rootlet recordings to compute phase values. Phase values were calculated from the center of the ventral rootlet motor burst.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging and analysis</title><p>After each electrophysiological recording, a series of epifluorescent and differential interference contrast images were captured using a CCD camera (Rolera-XR) and QCapture Suite imaging software (QImaging) to track the axonal trajectories of V2a neurons and confirm their morphology.

The positions of the somata were then, respectively, normalized against the positions of the DV and ML boundaries to get the final DV and ML positions. V2a somata were classified into two groups based on the intensity of GFP expression. The GFP fluorescence intensity of V2a somata was exported from Imaris, and its density distribution was plotted in R. Because the density distribution of GFP fluorescence intensity was bimodal, the minimum between the two modes of the distribution was used as a cutoff to split V2a neurons into classes of low and high GFP expression. DV positions of dI6 neurons in compound Tg[Dmrt3a:Gal4;UAS:pTagRFP] × Tg[UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP] larvae were calculated using the relevant positional coordinates from confocal images in Imaris and normalizing them to the dorsal and ventral boundaries of spinal cord determined using differential contrast images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>High-speed filming</title><p>To illustrate the differences in body shape and frequency with time, we include a video of a freely swimming 5-day-old larva captured at 2000 frames/s using a FASTCAM Mini AX50 (Photron), evoked using a sharpened tungsten pin to stimulate somatosensory afferents (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data were first tested for normality to select the appropriate statistical test.

The same holds true for measured parameters in current-clamp recordings, where soma size, DV position, input resistance, rheobase, spike rates, and recruitment order in the same neurons were not always possible.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental protocols conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal experimentation and were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol numbers IS00019359 and IS00019319).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94349-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Using single cell fills they show that one cell type has a descending axon (&quot;descending V2as&quot;), while the other cell type has both a descending axon and an ascending axon (&quot;bifurcating V2as&quot;). In the Chx10:GFP line, descending V2as display strong GFP labeling, while bifurcating V2as display weak GFP labeling. The bifurcating V2as are located more laterally in the spinal cord. These two cell types have different electrophysiological properties as revealed by patch-clamp recordings. Positive current steps indicated that descending V2as comprise tonic spiking or bursting neurons. Bifurcating V2as comprise chattering or bursting neurons. The two types of V2a neurons display different recruitment patterns as a function of speed. Descending tonic and bifurcating chattering neurons are recruited at the beginning of the swimming bout, at fast speeds (swimming frequency above 30 Hz). Descending bursting neurons were preferentially recruited at the end of swimming bouts, at low speeds (swimming frequency below 30 Hz), while bifurcating bursting neurons were recruited for a broader swimming frequency range. The two types of V2a neurons receive distinct patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs during fictive locomotion. In descending V2as, when speed increases: (i) excitatory conductances increase in fast neurons and decreases in slow neurons; (ii) inhibitory conductances increase in fast neurons and increases in slow neurons. In bifurcating V2as, when speed increases: (i) excitatory conductances increase in fast neurons but does not change in slow neurons; (ii) inhibitory conductances increase in fast neurons and does not change in slow neurons. The timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was then studied. In descending V2as, fast neurons receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are in anti-phase with low contrast in amplitude and are both broadly distributed over the phase. The slow neurons receive two peaks of inhibition, one in anti-phase with the excitatory inputs and another just after the excitation. In bifurcating V2as, fast neurons receive two peaks of inhibition, while the slow ones receive anti-phase inhibition. They also show that silencing Dmrt3-labeled dI6 interneurons disrupted rhythm generation selectively at high speed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study focuses on the diversity of V2a neurons in zebrafish, an interesting cell population playing important roles in locomotor control and beyond, from fish to mammal.

This is shown in Figure 6, however, the authors do not show any statistical tests for this claim. The authors also do not show any conclusive evidence that reciprocal inhibition is required for rhythmogenesis at fast speeds and vice versa for slow speeds. Additional experiments or modeling studies that conclusively show the necessity of these different inhibitory sources to the generation of different rhythms would be needed to strengthen this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new loss-of-function experiments as requested to strengthen the claim that reciprocal inhibition is critical for rhythmogenesis at fast speeds, but dispensable at slow. Specifically, we use botulinum toxin selectively expressed in Dmrt3-labeled dI6 interneurons, which play a role in reciprocal inhibition at a variety of speeds (new Figure 7). These experiments demonstrate a selective impact on rhythmic burst generation and alternation during periods of swimming where the highest frequency motor activity occurs. During lower frequency activity, rhythm generation is preserved, however motor output is selectively altered, consistent with the idea that reciprocal inhibition plays an important role in patterning at slow speeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do a great job of teasing out cellular and synaptic properties in the different V2a subsets, however, it is not clear if or how these match the final output. For example, V2aD neurons are tonic or bursting for fast and slow speeds respectively but it is not intuitive how these cellular properties would influence phasic excitation and inhibition these neurons receive.</p></disp-quote><p>This question gets at the heart of what we are trying to illustrate in Figure 6. Specifically, in the new Figure 6E,F we have aligned the cumulative distribution of spikes recorded in cell-attached mode with phasic excitatory and inhibitory currents to reveal how well cellular properties versus patterns of synaptic drive match the final output (spikes). Our expectation was if intrinsic cellular properties where ultimately generating phasic spiking patterns, then patterns of excitatory and inhibitory drive need not be phasic. Instead, we see that synaptic drive is phasic with spiking occurring between peaks in excitation and troughs in inhibition. Since post-synaptic cellular properties should not impact the pre-synaptic excitation they receive, this suggests that phasic spiking in all V2a neurons regardless of the capacity for cellular rhythmogenesis is a result of phasic input. In response to this concern, we have elaborated our discussion of what cellular properties may contribute and the impact on output in the Discussion (L502-511).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear from the discussion why having different mechanisms of rhythm generation at different speeds could be an important circuit design. The authors use anguilliform and carangiform modes of swimming to denote fast and slow speeds but there are differences in these movements other than speed, like rostrocaudal coordination. The frequency and pattern of these movements are linked and warrant more discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to elaborate on this point more in the Discussion. In particular, we have added more text to clarify differences in movement related to both pattern-formation and rhythm-generation (L373-398) and to also suggest potential reasons for differences in mechanisms of rhythm generation (L478-488).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Agha et al. explores mechanisms of rhythmicity in V2a neurons in larval zebrafish.

The overall conclusions are well supported by the data. Weaknesses are relatively minor and were largely related to terminology for some of the secondary conclusions.</p><p>(1) The assumption is made that all in-phase inhibition is recurrent and out-of-phase inhibition is reciprocal. The latter is likely true but the definition of recurrent may be a bit loose as could be multisegmental feed-forward inhibition as well.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, which was also raised by Reviewer 1. We have now added references that justify this assertion (L281-283). We also add a new figure with schematics (Figure 8) to make it clearer how we are defining sources of recurrent versus reciprocal inhibition, as based on the anatomical constraints of the circuit. We agree that multi-segmental inputs could contribute to inhibition, but they will likely be more broadly distributed based on rostro-caudal location and contribute to tonic sources of drive. We now clarify this (L285-286).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2). In a few places, it is mentioned that the properties of the V2a-D neurons are consistent with pacemakers. This could be true of both the V2a-D and -B neurons that burst in response to depolarizing steps but the properties of the remaining (fast) V2a-D neurons do not seem to be consistent with pacemakers, based on the properties shown. Tonic firing at a frequency related to the locomotor speed the neuron is active during and strong antiphase inhibition may instead suggest a stronger network component driving the rhythmicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been purposefully agnostic regarding the relative contribution of pacemaking to rhythm generation in the paper. Our measurements of bursting overlap with swim frequencies only in the V2a-D subtype. Similarly, the spike rates of V2a-D neurons alone overlap with their swim frequencies (Fig 2D,G,I). Since both respond to tonic input (current injection) by spiking in a pattern that resembles their natural spiking behavior, we have treated these cellular properties both as pacemaking. Although the bursting behavior is more consistent with what is normally considered pacemaking in rhythmic motor circuits, in the basal ganglia field tonic firing of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is referred to as pacemaking. Since the tonic firing pattern overlaps with swimming frequency in the same way the bursting pattern does, we are less inclined to discount its possible contribution to rhythmogenesis based on the fact they do not burst. We have made modifications to the document to make this point clearer (L409-416). Regardless, our data argue that pacemaking is unlikely to be a major contributor to phasic firing in V2a neurons, at least at midbody, so we agree with you on this last point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I only have very minor suggestions.</p><p>(1) It would be useful to add a table or a figure summarizing the main results (integration of anatomy, electrophysiological properties, synaptic inputs, firing, swimming speed).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added a figure panel summarizing the main results (new Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Some statistics to possibly add (only suggestions): Do bifurcating V2as display significantly weaker GFP labeling than descending V2as? Do descending V2as have a significantly smaller soma size? Do descending V2as have a significantly lower rheobase and significantly higher resistance? Are tonic descending neurons and chattering bifurcating neurons located significantly more dorsally than the bursting descending and bifurcating neurons? Is there a way to show that bifurcating bursting neurons are recruited statistically on a broader swimming frequency range than other cell types (e.g. SD, coefficient of variation, cumulative distribution function with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)?</p></disp-quote><p>For the first question, in all cases when we targeted more dimly labeled neurons they were bifurcating. We now clarify this in the text (L119, L129-132). However, this is difficult to quantify, since absolute levels of fluorescence will vary from preparation to preparation based on the dissection and intensity of epifluorescence illumination. In addition, we did not always take images prior to recording and levels of GFP after recording will vary depending on relative state of dialysis. So, unfortunately, we cannot provide a rigorous statistical analysis beyond the qualitative statement we provide.</p><p>For the remainder of the questions, we now provide statistical analysis for soma size, position, rheobase, and resistance for the data in Figure 2. Please note, we have reported all our statistical analyses in the figure legends. We also provide analysis of the density distributions of swimming frequencies for slow bursting bifurcating neurons and slow bursting descending neurons as requested, which are significantly different following a K-S test (L162).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some details to possibly add (only suggestions): proportion of neurons in which single cell fills were done/checked anatomically? Proportions of bursting/chattering/tonic/bursting neurons? In Figure 1, maybe define visually bifurcating vs descending neurons. In Figure 2I, the recruitment of bifurcating chattering neurons is not plotted. Is that normal? Figures 6D, E, maybe specify more clearly which neurons are the fast and slow ones. In Figure 3C, the X-axis name is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>For the first question, the proportion is 100%, since the morphology of all neurons was confirmed post recording, which we now clarify in the Methods section (L573). For the second question, the numbers of bursting/chattering/tonic/bursting neurons are now reported in legend of Figure 2, in addition to the total number of V2a-D and V2a-B types, so it is clear what proportion of the recording population this represents. For the third question, in Figure 1 we cannot define V2a neurons as bifurcating or descending yet, this was only possible to confirm after the recording (Figure 2), and was done for every neuron (as mentioned above). For the fourth question, for Figure 2I the chattering response was too variable to be meaningful in terms of averaging and plotting, which we now mention in the text (L169-171). The standard deviations are ridiculous. For the fifth question, we have modified Figures 6D, E to more clearly label fast and slow V2a neurons. Finally, we have included the X-axis label in Figure 3C, thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Some text to possibly modulate (only suggestions):</p><p>A possible role for these V2a subtypes in the rhythm generation and pattern formation layer is an interesting idea but this may not be completely solved by the present experiments. Maybe the authors could suggest future experiments in the discussion that would establish how to tackle this important question (double bursts, deletions, etc...)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to raise future experiments that could help further tease apart their contribution to rhythm and pattern and have now added potential experiments to the Discussion (L498-501; L527-529), which include more precise molecular identification, spatial perturbation, and computational modeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to cite the references in which the rhythm/pattern CPG concept was proposed initially (lines 49-50 and elsewhere, Cf.

Maybe adjust the introduction?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have clarified our meaning in the introduction (L55-58). Several mechanisms exist, but the likelihood that different mechanisms operate at different speeds has not been considered. Either cellular properties are tuned to different speeds (i.e., bursting is faster in neurons recruited at faster speeds) or network properties can explain different speeds (i.e., different frequencies and patterns emerge from the connectivity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>About the convention that in fish in-phase currents originate from the ipsilateral and out-of-phase currents originate from the contralateral side (lines 271-275), is there any reference for this assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we now provide references (L281-283).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 338-345 stating that reciprocal inhibition is important for rhythm generation as predicted by the half-center model can sound surprising to some authors considering that many studies showed that inhibition is not needed for rhythm generation, including lamprey hemicords stimulated electrically (Cangiano and Grillner 2003 J Neurophysiol; 2005 J Neurosci, Cangiano et al. 2012 Neuroscience), salamander hemicords or hemisegments stimulated chemically (Ryczko et al. 2010, 2015 J Neurophysiol), or rhythm activity evoked on each side of the cord using optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic neurons (Hägglund et al. 2013 PNAS) etc. To demonstrate the importance of inhibition in rhythmogenesis, one would need to activate and/or deactivate the ipsilateral versus contralateral inhibitory neurons. It would be nice to maybe add citations to such studies if available in the zebrafish literature. Overall I would simply suggest modulating this section to be a bit more balanced conceptually.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the above referenced studies for lampreys and added ones for tadpoles (L464-468), to stick with undulatory swimmers.

This is not conclusively shown. Rayleigh's z-test can be used to test the significance of the directionality of circular data. Including more data from experiments or computational models to show the necessity of reciprocal or recurrent inhibition for timed spiking of V2a neurons would address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified Figure 6 so we can directly compare differences in reciprocal and recurrent inhibition between V2a types. We now report statistical analysis in the figure legends using a Watson’s Two Test for Homogeneity to test differences in the circular data.

These experiments demonstrate a selective impact on rhythmic burst generation and alternation during periods of swimming where the highest frequency motor activity occurs. During lower frequency activity, rhythm generation is preserved, however motor output is selectively altered, consistent with the idea that reciprocal inhibition plays an important role in patterning at slow speeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4D, the authors show that V2a neurons, both subtypes, spike in advance of the center of the motor burst. Recent studies (Jay et al., 2023) have shown differences in the timing of V2aD and V2aB neurons. Are there differences in the methods or selection of cells that would reflect differences in results?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and we appreciate the opportunity to reconcile our observations here with those in Jay et al., 2023. In the Jay et al paper, we used drifting visual stimuli to evoke fictive swimming. These experiments allow you to uncouple rhythm generation (forward propulsion) and pattern formation (lateral direction). Notably, fictive swim frequencies during so called optomotor responses are below 35Hz, meaning that we are sampling exclusively from V2a neurons recruited during carangiform swim mode. In these experiments, slow V2a-D neurons fire well in advance of slow V2a-B neurons, compared to what we see here which is relatively synchronous. Critically, however, the phase-advanced firing pattern revealed in the Jay et al paper for V2a-D neurons aligns with the phase-advanced excitatory input reported here. In addition, the recruitment probabilities of slow V2a-D neurons are higher in the Jay et al paper than what we report here. Collectively these observations suggest either more effective excitation during optomotor responses (Jay et al) or more potent inhibition during escape responses (Agha et al). Ultimately, differences in the relative synchrony of firing among slow V2a-D and slow V2a-B neurons appears to depend on the nature of the stimulus and range of swim frequencies, where in one case frequency and amplitude modulation are coupled over a broad range of frequencies (somatosensory stimuli delivered here), while in the other case frequency and amplitude modulation are uncoupled over a narrow range of frequencies (visual stimuli in Jay at al). We now elaborate on this point in the Discussion (L485-498).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the conserved nature of spinal circuits across vertebrates, it is also important to discuss these findings in the context of limbed animals. In tetrapods, changes in locomotor speed also involve pattern/gait changes, however, it is not known if or how these changes in frequency and pattern are linked. This study, by suggesting that different speeds are implemented not only by different neurons but possibly by different neuronal mechanisms, provides important cues for the missing link and would strengthen the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have made substantial edits to the beginning Discussion to provide better context for the impact of our work (L373-398).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Line 122: of needs to be replaced by or.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected, thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B Top panel: What is the grey bar?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been removed for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B bottom panel is not referenced in the main text at all.</p></disp-quote><p>Now referenced (L187, L189)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 260: 2nd inhibition needs to be replaced with excitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>- Figure 2 panel ordering is visually appealing but tough to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and tried reconfigurations, but they just looked too kludgy.

This could also be (and likely is) synaptically/network-driven rhythmicity, although the firing frequencies match up well with the swim frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Fast/tonic V2a-Ds were tested with somatic current injection as with all other neurons, which we assume primarily reflects intrinsic cellular properties. The spike rates we observe in fast/tonic V2a-Ds overlap with spike rates observed during fictive swimming, so they are positioned as well as bursting neurons to contribute to pacemaking. We also elaborate on this point in response to Major Comment #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 189-192: The patterning neurons receive excitatory drive before rhythm-generating neurons. The time constant explanation makes sense for why two neurons with a common drive would fire at different times but this does not support the proposed hierarchical arrangement or being consistent with V2a-Bs being downstream as mentioned in lines 49-56 and 218-219.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this point, we have modified Figure 6 so we can directly compare the timing of presynaptic excitatory inputs between the types. Here it can be seen clearly that phasic excitatory inputs to both fast and slow V2a-Ds are phase-advanced relative to fast and slow V2a-Ds (Figure 6B,C). As the reviewer mentions, it is likely a combination of time constants and the relative balance of excitation and inhibition that ultimately lead to synchronous spiking despite differences in the timing of inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 338-339: It is not shown that the rhythm relies on inhibition during slow.</p></disp-quote><p>This line has been removed in the revision process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Consistent with the importance of reciprocal (contralateral) inhibition in fast locomotion here, rodent fictive locomotion is slower in hemisect than in the full cord. However, the Rybak and O'Donovan groups suggest that this is due to loss of drive to ipsilateral inhibitory neurons by excitatory contralateral projections, rather than contralateral inhibitory interneurons (see Falgairolle and O'Donovan 2019, 2021, and Shevtsova et al 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that highlights how we are defining reciprocal versus recurrent inhibition. In this example, although ipsilaterally-projecting interneurons are responsible for inhibition, since they are excited by commissurally-projecting excitatory interneurons, we would classify this as feedforward (reciprocal) not feedback (recurrent) inhibition. So reciprocal (feedforward) inhibition is still important to get higher frequency rhythms, it is di-synaptic in this case. We have added a new figure (Figure 8) to clarify what we mean by reciprocal (feedforward) and recurrent (feedback) based on the ipsilateral projection patterns of V2a neurons, and point out the definitions would be flipped for excitatory interneurons in the Discussion (L452-455).</p></body></sub-article></article>
