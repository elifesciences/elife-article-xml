However, the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis need further exploration. RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a transcription factor, is essential for osteogenesis. <italic>RUNX2</italic> has two types of transcripts produced by two alternative promoters. In the present study, we surprisingly find that RUNX2 isoform II is a novel ferroptosis and apoptosis suppressor. RUNX2 isoform II can bind to the promoter of peroxiredoxin-2 (<italic>PRDX2</italic>), a ferroptosis inhibitor, and activate its expression. Knockdown of RUNX2 isoform II suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Interestingly, homeobox A10 (HOXA10), an upstream positive regulator of RUNX2 isoform II, is required for the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis through the RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway. Consistently, RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed in OSCC, and associated with OSCC progression and poor prognosis. Collectively, OSCC cancer cells can upregulate RUNX2 isoform II to inhibit ferroptosis and apoptosis and facilitate tumorigenesis through the novel HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most tumors in the jaw, mouth, and face are caused by a type of cancer known oral squamous cell carcinoma (or OSCC for short). However, current therapies for OSCC are limited and new approaches are desperately needed.</p><p>One promising therapeutic target is the protein RUNX2, which has been shown to promote the progression of cancers, including OSCC. Most cells produce two slightly different versions of the RUNX2 protein, known as isoform I and isoform II.

Isoform II enhances cell proliferation by triggering the production of another protein called PRDX2, which blocks two carefully regulated programs of cell death: apoptosis and ferroptosis.

Ferroptosis has sparked great interest as targeting ferroptosis might provide new therapeutic opportunities in treating cancers. Emerging evidence indicates that ferroptosis may function as a potent tumor suppressor in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2022</xref>), including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, triggering ferroptosis can overcome OSCC-acquired drug resistance such as cisplatin-induced resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the induction of ferroptosis is an attractive strategy for OSCC therapy. Multiple extrinsic or intrinsic pathways regulate the ferroptotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang and Kroemer, 2020</xref>). The extrinsic pathways are initiated by the inhibition of cell membrane transporters such as the cystine/glutamate transporter system xc<sup>-</sup> or by the activation of the iron transporters transferrin (TF) and lactotransferrin (LTF). The intrinsic pathway is activated by the blockade of intracellular antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Although the principal regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis have been explored in the past few years, other potential molecular mechanisms remain to be uncovered.</p><p>The RUNT-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a member of the RUNT-related transcription factor family, is critical for osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruderer et al., 2014</xref>) and has been extensively studied in the development of bone and tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ziros et al., 2008</xref>). Previous studies revealed that RUNX2 promotes cancer metastasis and invasion in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sancisi et al., 2012</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akech et al., 2010</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herreño et al., 2019</xref>), and HNSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the potential roles of RUNX2 in other aspects of tumorigenesis remain largely unclear. <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene is composed of two promoters that in turn generate two types of isoforms, isoform II derived from promoter 1 (P1) and isoform I from promoter 2 (P2). These isoforms contain distinct N-terminal sequences. Whether these isoforms play distinct roles in tumorigenesis remains unknown.</p><p>OSCC is one of the most common malignant cancers in the world, especially in areas with low Human Development Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). The treatment of OSCC has progressed over time from surgery alone to comprehensive series of therapies, including radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Despite a lot of advances in treatment modalities, the 5-year overall survival rate is around 50–60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jäwert et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is still challenging to improve the therapy of OSCC.</p><p>In this study, to have a well-defined understanding of the relationship between RUNX2 isoform II and ferroptosis, we examined the effects of isoform II-knockdown or -overexpression on total ROS levels and lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, and the effects of isoform II-knockdown on mitochondrial morphology in OSCC cells. And mechanically, peroxiredoxin-2 (<italic>PRDX2</italic>), a ferroptosis suppressor, was identified to be a target gene of RUNX2 isoform II. Meanwhile, we analyzed the effect of RUNX2 isoform II overexpression or knockdown on OSCC cell ferroptosis or apoptosis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in OSCC</title><p>Given that the expression levels as well as the functions of RUNX2 isoforms (isoform I and II) produced by two alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in tumors are unclear, we explored their expression and roles in OSCC in this study.

Ferroptosis is an important form of programmed cell death and plays an important role in the suppression of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ouyang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). We found that OSCC tissues had positive 4-hydroxynonenalince (4-HNE, a metabolite of lipid peroxidation) staining in variant levels, suggesting that ferroptosis might be present in OSCC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation and ROS. We found that isoform II-knockdown significantly enhanced total ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and lipid peroxidation accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells. Consistently, isoform II overexpression suppressed ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) in these cells. In addition, we found that isoform II-knockdown induced shrunken mitochondria with vanished cristae with transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This phenomenon, along with the above results of ROS production and lipid peroxidation accumulation assays, suggests that RUNX2 isoform II may suppress ferroptosis. We also found that isoform II-knockdown cells showed more elongated mitochondria than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which may be related to the suppression of <italic>FIS1</italic> (Fission, Mitochondrial 1) expression by RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). And the elongated mitochondria may be caused by the deficiency of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). The oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were lower in isoform II-knockdown OSCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). To further figure out whether isoform II could promote cell proliferation by inhibiting cell death, especially ferroptosis, and apoptosis, we performed the rescue experiments with some inhibitors of cell death including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor), Z-VAD (an apoptosis inhibitor), and necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, a necroptosis inhibitor) upon isoform II-knockdown. As expected, Fer-1 treatment partially rescued the reduction of cell proliferation caused by isoform II-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We also found that Z-VAD and Nec-1 could partially rescue the reduction of cell proliferation caused by isoform II-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and Z-VAD also could partially decrease apoptosis induced by isoform II-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), which suggested that both apoptosis and necroptosis also contribute to the retardation of cell proliferation cause by isoform II-knockdown. In addition, we found that the combination of Fer-1 and Z-VAD was more effective in rescuing cell proliferation than Fer-1 or Z-VAD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Fer-1 treatment reduced the increased levels of ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) caused by isoform II-knockdown. RSL3, a ferroptosis activator, could cause cell death in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>), and increase the production of cellular ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7B</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C</xref>). Isoform II overexpression could elevate the IC<sub>50</sub> values of RSL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A</xref>); in contrast, isoform II-knockdown decreased the IC<sub>50</sub> values of RSL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8B</xref>). As expected, overexpression of isoform II could partially reduce the increased levels of ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>) caused by RSL3. Consistently, tumors formed by CAL 27 cells with isoform II-knockdown showed a significantly increased staining of 4-HNE compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

Firstly, we found that RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown or overexpression could downregulate or upregulate the expression of <italic>GPX4</italic> mRNA and protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In addition to the GPX4, we found that <italic>PRDX2</italic> is the most significantly downregulated gene upon isoform II-knockdown in CAL 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, both mRNA and protein expression levels of PRDX2 were reduced in CAL 27 and SCC-9 cells with isoform II-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Consistently, tumors formed by CAL 27 cells with isoform II-knockdown also showed a significantly reduced expression of PRDX2 compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Isoform II overexpression increased <italic>PRDX2</italic> mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Whereas isoform I overexpression has no significant effect on PRDX2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).

These results indicated that PRDX2 was a target of RUNX2 isoform II. One of the important characteristics of ferroptosis is the imbalance in iron homeostasis, and iron transporter transferrin receptor (TFRC) has an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis. We found that RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown in OSCC cells had no obvious effect on the expression of TFRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).

Emerging evidence has proved that ferroptosis contributes to the suppression of tumor progression. p53 could suppress the transcription of amino acid antiporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLCA711) to sensitize cells to ferroptosis, which may contribute to the anti-tumor role of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Tumor inhibition by BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) could be achieved in part by inhibiting SLC7A11 and thereby promoting ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In HNSCC, Inhibition of xCT could suppress cell proliferation by inducing ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). In addition, caveolin-1 (CAV-1) also could promote HNSCC progression through inhibiting ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, enhancing ferroptosis could be an attractive strategy for OSCC treatment. In this study, we discovered a novel ferroptosis suppressor, RUNX2 isoform II, in OSCC. Isoform II overexpression or knockdown inhibited or promoted OSCC cell ferroptosis by decreasing or increasing total ROS levels and lipid peroxidation, respectively. One of the characteristics of ferroptosis is elevated cellular ROS levels, thus ferroptosis can be modulated by antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). For example, peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) is a negative regulator of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we identified a new target gene for isoform II, the ferroptosis suppressor <italic>PRDX2</italic>. PRDX2 is a typical 2-Cys antioxidant enzyme belonging to the peroxiredoxin family and plays an important role in scavenging ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Franceschi et al., 2011</xref>) through consuming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). We found that isoform II overexpression or knockdown promoted or suppressed PRDX2 expression, respectively. We found that isoform II knockdown also could induce apoptosis in OSCC cells, and PRDX2 overexpression could also reduce the elevated apoptosis induced by isoform II-knockdown. Moreover, isoform II could specifically bind to the promoter of <italic>PRDX2</italic> and then transactivate the PRDX2 expression, thereby inhibiting OSCC cell ferroptosis.</p><p>In this study, we also found that RUNX2 isoform II was overexpressed in OSCC tissues and was associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In the past, it has been reported that RUNX2 was overexpressed in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akech et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hong et al., 2020</xref>). Chang et al. demonstrated that RUNX2 was overexpressed in HNSCC samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) and could serve as a poor prognostic marker in HNSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, only a few articles have addressed the expression levels of isoforms. For example, isoform I is the major variant in papillary thyroid carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sancisi et al., 2012</xref>), and isoform II is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herreño et al., 2019</xref>). However, the expression levels of isoforms in OSCC are unknown. Surprisingly, our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in expression levels of total RUNX2 between OSCC patients and normal controls from the TCGA database. Interestingly, we discovered that the expression levels of isoform I were lower in TCGA OSCC patients than in normal tissues, while the expression levels of isoform II were overexpressed in TCGA OSCC tissues. Furthermore, we proved with clinical samples that the relative expression levels of isoform II were higher in OSCC tissues than those in normal tissues.</p><p>Next, we uncovered the underlying mechanisms of RUNX2 isoform II to improve proliferation in OSCC cell lines. In the past, it has been reported that overexpression or knockdown of total RUNX2 in HNSCC cell lines could promote or inhibit cell proliferation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that isoform II overexpression or specific isoform II-knockdown could promote or suppress OSCC cell proliferation, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrated that isoform II was required for in vivo OSCC tumorigenesis.</p><p>Subsequently, we discovered that HOXA10 knockdown inhibited the expression of <italic>RUNX2</italic> isoform II and led to ferroptosis and apoptosis. HOXA10, a transcription factor, plays an important role in tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Song et al., 2019</xref>). HOXA10 was reported to transactivate <italic>Runx2</italic> P1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hassan et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, we found that the relative expression levels of HOXA10 were positively associated with the expression levels of isoform II in OSCC patients from TCGA and HOXA10 knockdown led to the downregulation of isoform II in OSCC cells. It has been demonstrated that HOXA10 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in Fadu cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). We found that HOXA10 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cellular apoptosis in CAL 27 and SCC-9 through suppressing RUNX2 isoform II expression. Interestingly, we discovered that HOXA10 knockdown induced ferroptosis through suppressing RUNX2 isoform II and PRDX2 expression, which suggested a new regulatory pathway of anti-ferroptosis.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified RUNX2 isoform II as a novel ferroptosis and apoptosis inhibitor in OSCC cells by transactivating PRDX2 expression. RUNX2 isoform II plays oncogenic roles in OSCC. Moreover, we also found that HOXA10 is an upstream regulator of RUNX2 isoform II and is required for suppressing ferroptosis and apoptosis through RUNX2 isoform II and PRDX2. Our results suggest a new regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis through HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) and may provide the novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for OSCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human tissues</title><p>The human OSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from the Hospital of Stomatology in Wuhan University.

The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the mean differences of RUNX2 exon 1.1 (isoform II) or exon 2.1 (isoform I) in COAD and PRAD from TCGA, the mean difference of isoform II expression levels (isoform II/<italic>GAPDH</italic>) or <italic>HOXA10</italic> expression levels in our clinical samples, the weight and volume of mouse tumors (shisoform II), the H score of 4-HNE staining of mouse tumors, and the expression levels of HOXA10 in TCGA OSCC patients. All remaining two-group comparisons of means were analyzed by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the tumor growth in nude mice between nonspecific control and shPRDX2. Survival analysis was performed with a log-rank test, and survival curve was produced using the Kaplan–Meier method in the GraphPad Prism software. The correlation of RUNX2 exon 1.1 (isoform II) and HOXA10 was calculated with the Spearman rank method. The quantification of RT-PCR was realized using ImageJ software. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

We agree that these figures do show that isoform II-knockdown or HOXA10-knockdown could induce apoptosis. We have adapted the title and abstract as follow:</p><p>Title: “RUNX2 Isoform II Protects Cancer Cells from Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by Promoting PRDX2 Expression in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma”.</p><p>Abstract: “In the present study, we surprisingly find that RUNX2 isoform II is a novel ferroptosis and apoptosis suppressor. RUNX2 isoform II can bind to the promoter of peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), a ferroptosis inhibitor, and activate its expression. Knockdown of RUNX2 isoform II suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Interestingly, homeobox A10 (HOXA10), an upstream positive regulator of RUNX2 isoform II, is required for the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis through the RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway. Consistently, RUNX2 isoform II is overexpressed in OSCC, and associated with OSCC progression and poor prognosis. Collectively, OSCC cancer cells can up-regulate RUNX2 isoform II to inhibit ferroptosis and apoptosis, and facilitate tumorigenesis through the novel HOXA10/RUNX2 isoform II/PRDX2 pathway.”</p><p>In addition, we have performed the rescue experiment showing that PRDX2 overexpression rescues the apoptosis induced by isoform II-knockdown (Figure 4-figure supplement 4) or HOXA10-knockdown (Figure 7-figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have added the description about these experiments in result “RUNX2 isoform II promotes the expression of PRDX2” and “HOXA10 inhibits ferroptosis and apoptosis through RUNX2 isoform II” as follow: “In addition, we found that PRDX2 overexpression could partially reduce the increased apoptosis caused by isoform II-knockdown. (Figure 4-figure supplement 4).” “PRDX2 overexpression also could rescue the increased cellular apoptosis caused by HOXA10 knockdown (Figure 7-figure supplement 2).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments:</p><p>In the description of the result section related to Figure 3E, the author wrote &quot;In addition, we found that isoform II-knockdown induced shrunken mitochondria with vanished cristae with transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3E). These results suggest that RUNX2 isoform II may suppress ferroptosis.&quot; The interpretation provided here is not clear to the reviewer. How shrunken mitochondria and vanished cristae can be linked to ferroptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inaccurate description. Ferroptotic cells usually exhibit shrunken mitochondria, reduced or absent cristae, and increased membrane dentistry (Dixon et al., 2012). However, the presence of shrunken mitochondria or vanished cristae does not guarantee that ferroptosis has occurred in the cells. Other evidences, such as the increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation accumulation in cells with RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown must be evaluated as we are showing in Figure 3A and 3B. Furthermore, isoform II overexpression suppressed ROS production (Figure 3C) and lipid peroxidation (Figure 3D). We have revised our interpretation as follow: “In addition, we found that isoform II-knockdown induced shrunken mitochondria with vanished cristae with transmission electron microscopy (Figure 3E). This phenomenon along with the above results of ROS production and lipid peroxidation accumulation assays suggests that RUNX2 isoform II may suppress ferroptosis.”.</p><p>Dixon, S. J., Lemberg, K.

The mitochondria undergo cycles of fission and fusion, known as mitochondrial dynamics, which in turn leads to changes in mitochondrial length. Through examining factors related to mitochondrial dynamics, we find that isoform II knockdown could decrease the expression levels of FIS1 (Fission, Mitochondrial 1) (Figure 3-figure supplement 2B) which mediates the fission of mitochondria. Therefore, we speculate that the elongated mitochondria in the isoform II-knockdown cells may be due to the decrease in mitochondrial fission through inhibiting FIS1 expression.</p><p>In addition, we have tried our best to perform the fluorescent staining of mitochondrial to observe mitochondrial morphology. However, due to the quality of probes and fluorescent microscope, our images of mitochondrial fluorescence were not satisfactory. So, we re-capture more electron microscopy images, measure the length of mitochondria, and perform statistical analyses. We find that isoform II-knockdown cells show significantly more mitochondrial elongation than the control cells (Author response image 1 and Figure 3-figure supplement 2A). Therefore, we believe that isoform II knockdown promotes mitochondrial elongation to be relatively reliable.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The new electron microscopy images in RUNX2 isoform II-knockdown cells.</title><p>RSL3 (a ferroptosis activator) served as a positive control.

We have performed wound-healing assay and transwell assay to analyze the migration or invasion capacity of cells with RUNX2 isoform II or isoform I overexpression. We find that isoform II overexpression has no effect on the migration and invasion in OSCC cells (Figure 2-figure supplement 2). This phenomenon suggests that further increasing isoform II cannot improve the migration or invasion capacity of OSCC cells. However, isoform I overexpression suppresses the migration and invasion of cancer cells (Figure 2-figure supplement 2), indicating that the upregulation of isoform I, which is downregulated in OSCC cells, may inhibit tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that the expression level of isoform I was lower in TCGA OSCC patients than that in normal controls (Figure 1D), and patients with higher isoform I showed longer overall survival (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). These results support that isoform I may inhibit tumorigenesis in OSCC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The in vivo study shows 50% reduction in primary tumor growth after RUNX2 inhibition by shRNA in CAL 27 xenografts, but only one shRNA is shown.

This is absolutely essential for the authors hypothesis and should be tested using shRNA in cells and xenografted tumours.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We agree that the overexpression of isoform I is much stronger than isoform II in CAL 27 cells in Fig. 2A-B. We have done another repeat experiment which shows the similar overexpression of isoform II and I in Figure 2A-figure supplement 1. This repeat experiment also shows that overexpression of FLAG tagged isoform II significantly promoted the proliferation of OSCC cells. We tried our best to knockdown isoform I. However, the specific sequence of isoform I is 317 nt. We designed four anti-isoform I siRNAs, and unfortunately found that none of these siRNAs could knockdown isoform I efficiently. Please see following Author response image 2. Therefore, currently we cannot knockdown isoform I. However, we have tried the overexpression of isoform I. We find that isoform I overexpression inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells (Figure 2- figure supplement 2). In addition, we have shown that isoform II overexpression showed enhanced cell proliferation compared with isoform I overexpression in OSCC cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, we consider that isoform I is not essential for OSCC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.

To support this idea, the authors use the inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 (Fer -1). While Fer-1 typically does not lead to a 100% rescue, here the effect is only marginal and as shown in Figures 3F and G only marginally better than Z-VAD or Necrostatin 1. These data do not support the idea that the major cause of cell death is ferroptosis. Instead. Iso II silencing leads to cell death through different pathways.
