Innovation can occur through larger rearrangements, but here experimental data is extremely limited. Integron integrases innovated from double-strand- toward single-strand-DNA recombination through the acquisition of the I2 α-helix. To investigate how this transition was possible, we have evolved integrase IntI1 to what should correspond to an early innovation state by selecting for its ancestral activity. Using synonymous alleles to enlarge sequence space exploration, we have retrieved 13 mutations affecting both I2 and the multimerization domains of IntI1. We circumvented epistasis constraints among them using a combinatorial library that revealed their individual and collective fitness effects. We obtained up to 10<sup>4</sup>-fold increases in ancestral activity with various asymmetrical trade-offs in single-strand-DNA recombination. We show that high levels of primary and promiscuous functions could have initially coexisted following I2 acquisition, paving the way for a gradual evolution toward innovation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>integron</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>innovation</kwd><kwd>integrase</kwd><kwd>domain

Integrons can stockpile arrays of usually promoter-less cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loot et al., 2017</xref>), and modulate their expression through shuffling events, providing a low-cost adaptive memory for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lacotte et al., 2017</xref>). Although originally located on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mazel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rowe-Magnus et al., 2001</xref>), some integrons have been mobilized onto conjugative plasmids and have reached our hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escudero and Mazel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowe-Magnus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghaly et al., 2017</xref>) where they currently play a major role in the ecology of multidrug resistance among Gram negative pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">González-Zorn and Escudero, 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Introduction and outline of this work.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of an integron. The stable platform of integrons contains the integrase-coding gene (<italic>intI</italic>), the promoters dedicated to the expression of the integrase and the cassettes (P<sub>int</sub> and P<sub>c</sub>, respectively), and the <italic>attI</italic> site (blue triangle). The variable part is composed of cassettes, encoding genes of different functions (arrows facing right) and their cognate <italic>attC</italic> sites (red and turquoise triangles). Recombining different sites, integrases can incorporate (<italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attC</italic>), excise (<italic>attC</italic> x <italic>attC</italic>), and reshuffle cassettes (excision followed by integration reactions) within the platform. (<bold>b</bold>) Recombination reactions in integrons can follow two distinct pathways: a replicative one when at least one substrate is an <italic>attC</italic> site -this is the <italic>modern</italic> activity of integrases-; or the classical pathway with a second strand exchange when recombining exclusively <italic>attI</italic> sites. This classical pathway is considered the <italic>ancestral</italic> activity of integrases for its resemblance with that of other Y-recombinases.

Phylogenetic studies show that integrases belong to the family of tyrosine (Y)-recombinases, but form a discrete cluster within it, that evolved recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunes-Düby et al., 1998</xref>). Y-recombinases are a large family of DNA-recombinases. They typically recognize specific sequences on double stranded (ds-) DNA substrates and recombine them following an archetypical pathway of two sequential strand exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>). Integrases have become a new paradigm in the field of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>) for structural and functional peculiarities that differentiate them from the rest of Y-recombinases. The most relevant one is that integrases perform asymmetric recombination reactions between double and single stranded sites. Indeed, when cassettes are integrated, their sites (<italic>attC</italic>) are recombined as single stranded (ss) hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansson et al., 2004</xref>) while the site in the integron platform (<italic>attI</italic>) is canonically double stranded (ds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Recombination of ss- and ds-DNA is unique to integrases and is crucial from an evolutionary standpoint because these reactions are semiconservative. This allows for a bet-hedging strategy that minimizes the risk of incorporating cassettes to the array. Yet, it also poses many structural constraints to the recombination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nivina et al., 2016</xref>) such as rendering the typical second strand exchange of Y-recombinases deleterious, because it would linearize the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loot et al., 2012</xref>). These constraints are solved in integrons through the acquisition of an extra α-helix (I2) within the catalytic core of the integrase protein (IntI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Messier and Roy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Crystallographic data have shown that the I2 helix has a specific biological function: it recognizes and docks a set of nucleotides that protrude from <italic>attC</italic> sites (the extra-helical bases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>) causing a conformational change that impedes the second strand exchange, so that the junction is solved through an alternative pathway involving a replication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>Compelling examples of evolutionary innovation include the emergence of enzymatic activity de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaltenbach et al., 2018</xref>), the evolution of regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2012</xref>), or the subcellular relocalization of enzymes through gene fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farr et al., 2017</xref>). Still, good experimental models are not abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farr et al., 2017</xref>) and a large wealth of evidence in the field comes from a few highly informative ones, such as antibiotic resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novais et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salverda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figliuzzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacquier et al., 2013</xref>). Here, functional innovation results from changes in substrate specificity toward a new antibiotic molecule – a trait that can be strongly selected for in the laboratory – but the reaction is, overall, conserved. These models show that innovation often results from single mutations located at flexible regions in the periphery of the catalytic core of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tokuriki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">San Millan et al., 2016</xref>). Such flexibility enhances evolvability because mutations can give rise to novel activities while having little impact on the main function of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petrie et al., 2018</xref>). Examples of innovation through larger rearrangements, such as the insertion or deletion of entire polypeptide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pries et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2014</xref>), or in other proteins such as RAG DNA-recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) exist, but are very limited. Whether structural plasticity allows for the coexistence of novel and ancestral functions in these cases, deserves – in our opinion – to be investigated in more depth, and is the aim of this work. Integrases have expanded the type of substrate recombined (ds- and ss-DNA), the recognition pattern (structure and sequence) and changed the recombination pathway (double and single strand exchange). They are therefore an appealing molecular model to study evolutionary innovation in DNA processing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The I2 domain of integrases is necessary for the cassette capture activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Messier and Roy, 2001</xref>), confers ss- recombination capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>) and has not been found in any other protein in the databases. Hence, the most parsimonious explanation on how integron integrases have evolved, is that the acquisition of I2 in a Y-recombinase-like ancestor paved the way to the innovation of IntIs. Grafting of a 20-residue-long domain could, presumably, have entailed a strong destabilizing effect. Nevertheless, we recently proved that <italic>bona fide</italic> ancestral activity of integrases -including the second strand exchange resolution- is conserved on ds-DNA at low rates. This bi-functional state, and the lack of known function for the ancestral activity in contemporary integrons, strongly suggests that innovation of integrases was a smooth evolutionary process in which modern and ancestral activities were initially compatible to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent optimization events would have then turned the novel activity into the main one, in detriment of the ancestral activity.</p><p>Integrases are therefore a good experimental model to investigate if novel and ancestral functions can coexist when novelty emerges from large rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tawfik, 2006</xref>). To explore this, in this work we have evolved the modern integrase IntI1 toward its ancestral function, the recombination of ds-substrates. With a succession of in vitro evolution experiments, using synonymous genes to extend the range of explored mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cambray and Mazel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escudero et al., 2018</xref>), we have identified 13 mutations increasing the ancestral function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). A combinatorial library allowed to filter out negative interactions and to obtain a combination of mutations with a 10,000-fold increase in recombination activity on ds-DNA. This increase came with an asymmetric trade-off (100-fold decrease) on ss-DNA recombination. Deep sequencing of this library revealed the epistatic and mechanistic making up of innovation in integrases. We show that modern integrases encoding the I2 domain can reach high levels of ancestral activity, through only eight mutations, while retaining moderate levels of the modern one, strongly supporting that protein structural plasticity also fosters innovation through large rearrangements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recoding the integrase gene into two alternative sequences</title><p>To explore a broader sequence space of IntI1 and obtain a larger set of possible beneficial mutations, we have used the Evolutionary Landscape Painter (ELP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cambray and Mazel, 2008</xref>).

This phenomenon, named negative epistasis, could hamper our efforts to obtain hyperactive integrases. To assess the presence of such epistatic interactions, we have plotted the <italic>observed</italic> and <italic>expected</italic> gains in recombination frequency for a subset of mutants for which we have data for isolated and combined mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Observed recombination frequencies were clearly lower than expected (assuming a multiplicative model, typical of independent <italic>loci</italic>), suggesting pervasive negative epistasis in our experiments. As an example, the three mutations obtained with <italic>intI1</italic> in the first round of experiments (T118S, D161G, and G320D), conferring a 7.6-, 5.4-, and 7.2-fold increase in activity respectively, would lead in a non-epistatic scenario to a ≈300-fold activity increase. Instead, the gain in activity with the three mutations is approximately 10-fold and is actually slightly lower than the gain of double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The combination of these three mutations with all other mutations selected in the first round of experiments except G319E (for which we do not have individual data), would lead in a non-epistatic scenario to a 3.75·10<sup>4</sup>-fold increase in activity in a theoretical <italic>intI1<sub>7mut</sub></italic>, again very far from the observed 10<sup>2</sup>-fold gain obtained in the <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic> bearing all mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). We obtained statistical support for negative epistasis by computing error in epistasis estimation (σ<sub>ε</sub>) through error propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trindade et al., 2009</xref>) (see Materials and methods).

It is noteworthy that 20 haplotypes bore mutations in the 5’-UTR. These mutations do not change protein activity but may influence translation efficiency and hence bias our selection cycles. Here, the prevalence of 5’ UTR mutations is high enough to suspect that this region is non-optimal.

In order to reach our goal of obtaining IntI1 mutants with a similar efficiency on <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attI</italic> as that of WT IntI1 on <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> (modern integration reaction), we needed to obtain a four order of magnitude gain in activity. After two rounds of experiments some alleles showed increases of almost three orders of magnitude. Yet future experiments aiming to unravel structural aspects of integrase binding and processing of the <italic>attI</italic> site will need a highly active protein that is as close to the WT as possible. This, together with the negative epistasis observed, prompted us to avoid pooling together more mutations, but rather to try to obtain the minimal combination of mutations with the highest effect. To do so we established a library of mutants containing all possible combinations of 13 biologically relevant mutations. These are: E103K, T118S, D161G, H162Q, S173R, K219R, Y220N, D299E, V315A, G319E, G320D/N, A321G, and A329T. The rationale of this experiment is that by subjecting this library to our enrichment cycles we should be able to select the combination of mutations showing the highest levels of activity. Because of design constraints in regions with high variability (see Materials and methods) the theoretical number of different alleles in the library was 24,576. To maximize the chances of containing all alleles, we established a library of approximately five times this size. As a preliminary validation step, we sequenced 50 clones and observed a high level of heterogeneity of alleles, with an even distribution of WT and mutated sequences at each residue of interest. We also observed unintentional mutations in approximately 40% of the alleles. This was not completely unexpected, due to the number of rounds of PCR amplification performed to assemble all the fragments, and despite the use of low error rate polymerases (see Materials and methods). Once validated, we subjected this library to the new enrichment cycles to select for the best combination of mutations. An estimate of recombination rates was measured <italic>en masse</italic> at each step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Recombination activity increased 20-fold during the first four cycles and seemed to <italic>plateau</italic> from cycle five, leading us to stop the selection process at cycle 6. We sequenced 39 clones of the library at this stage. Among them we obtained 18 different haplotypes of which 13 were unique and five were found eight, eight, five, three, and two times each. All sequences found more than once were tested for recombination frequency, together with one of the sequences with a single representative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). All clones showed significant increases in recombination rates compared to <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic>, and three of them (Seq 3, Seq 5, and Seq 7) did so by combining a different subset of eight mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Importantly, sequences Seq 5, Seq 7, and Seq 19 show a 100-fold increase compared to <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic>, reaching our target of 10,000-fold increase compared to WT <italic>intI1</italic>. In these mutants, the activity levels for the <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attI</italic> reaction are similar to those of the modern <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> activity in the wild type integrase. All alleles were specifically tested for second strand exchange activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>) and showed a variety of gains, with some reaching almost 2000 fold increase compared to WT <italic>intI1,</italic> confirming the increase in <italic>bona fide</italic> ancestral activity in some -but not all- cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>) (see discussion).

Recombination activity was normalized to that of IntI1 and compared to the <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The asymmetry of trade-offs is in some cases remarkable.

This change in relative frequency is used as a proxy for fitness along our cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), and fitness is itself a proxy for recombination frequency. Mutations at three loci introduced a potential source of bias due to uneven linkage with mutations at the other <italic>loci</italic> of interest, and so had to be removed from the epistasis analysis: A234V (the mutation that appeared unintentionally) and all mutations at positions 319 and 320, which are especially complex (three and four possible residues respectively).</p><p>Despite these technical limitations (see materials and methods), our analysis reveals interesting epistatic interactions among mutations. All mutations but three (D161G, D299E, and A321G) are generally associated with a gain of fitness across all backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), and only A321G is not associated with a fitness gain in double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We can examine the pairwise epistatic tendencies of one particular mutation by computing the distribution of its fitness effects when paired with all other focal mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Some mutations have narrow distributions, and therefore generally little pairwise epistasis with other focal mutations, while others show greater variance. An extreme case is V315A, which is beneficial when paired with all mutations except A321G, where it becomes deleterious. This is a case of sign epistasis, meaning that the V315A switches from beneficial to deleterious depending on the other mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Both mutations are located in the C-terminal domain of the protein: V315A in the M helix and A321G between M and N helices. A321G that appeared in the 8mut background, is deleterious by itself and when paired with all other focal mutations but one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>), although to highly varying extents. Interestingly, it shows positive epistasis with mutation T118S, located close to the F helix of the protein. Structural data from the <italic>attC</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> synaptic complex, showed that helix N buries one face in a hydrophobic pocket close to the F helix of the adjacent integrase monomer. This allows for the multimerization and stabilization of the synapse, providing a structural basis for this epistasis.</p><p>Mutations S173R and K219R also show strong positive epistasis. S173R is located in between the catalytic residue K174 and the R168 residue in charge of stabilizing <italic>attC</italic> EHBs, while K219R is located within the I2 domain that also stabilizes EHBs. Positive epistasis between these mutations likely reflects the important constraints that the need to recognize EHBs imposes on ds-DNA recognition and the trade-off between both activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Innovation is a key evolutionary phenomenon for which experimental data is scarce. In most experimental models, the structural basis for innovation are single mutations that increase protein promiscuity toward non-canonical substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>) while affecting only mildly the main protein function. These mutations are often located in the periphery of active sites, on surface loops that have great conformational flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tokuriki et al., 2008</xref>). Integron integrases (IntIs) belong to the Y-recombinase family of ds-DNA processing enzymes but have innovated toward a dual ss- ds-DNA recombination paradigm. This seems to have occurred through the acquisition of the 20 residue-long I2 domain within the core of the protein. A direct proof of causality between ss-recombination and the acquisition of I2 is not available, because its deletion leads to the complete loss of function of IntI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Messier and Roy, 2001</xref>). Yet, it has been clearly established that this domain has the distinct biological function of recognizing ss-DNA hairpins to avoid the deleterious second strand exchange on these substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). This, together with the fact that both I2 and ss-DNA recombination are exclusively present in integron integrases, make the assumption that I2 allows for ss-DNA recombination the most parsimonious one. The fact that I2 has a distinct biological function contrasts with other examples of insertions within a protein catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2014</xref>), so it is non-trivial whether it was possible for its acquisition to provide substrate ambiguity, without impacting negatively the main activity of the ancestor. Our mutants show that it is indeed possible, because the presence of I2 is compatible with high rates of ancestral and low rates of modern activity. Furthermore, a plot of modern and ancestral activity levels of our Seq5 and Seq7 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) shows that modern activity does not clearly drop despite the lack of selection for it during our cycles. Instead, some sequences (Seq5, Seq7, or the T118S+D161G double mutant) are good representatives of an evolutionary path fostering innovation, in which trade-offs between functions are asymmetric and proteins show substrate promiscuity. Hence, we show that innovation -whether resulting from single mutations or whole domain acquisitions- can follow the path of producing protein promiscuity without disrupting its main activity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mutant levels of ancestral and modern activities.</title><p>Recombination frequency for <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attI</italic> and <italic>attC</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> of mutants.

Mutations found here help understand the structural constraints of the ancestral reaction, and therefore the changes that integrases might have undergone during natural evolution. We find two significant regions where mutations accumulated: (i) the C-terminal domain where a high number of mutations mapped between the M and N helices. Helix N serves as an <italic>anchor</italic>, burying one face in a hydrophobic pocket of the adjacent integrase monomer in the synaptic complex. It is necessary for the multimerization and stabilization of the tetrameric synapse.

Both parameters are key for the formation of crystals, so we are currently using these mutants to obtain the long-awaited <italic>attI</italic>-IntI crystal structure. Interestingly, a general ability to deliver the second strand exchange seems to be independently selectable too. Indeed, we have obtained several alleles with approximately 10,000-fold increases in <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attI</italic> activity (Seq 5, 7, and 19), but with large differences in double-strand exchange activity. No single mutation is clearly responsible for these differences, but the presence of Y220N (within the I2 domain) seems to correlate with higher activity levels.</p><p>It is also of note that we did not select any mutation in the first four α-helixes in the N-terminal part of the protein, which form one side of the U-shaped clamp around the DNA target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>).

This highlights the limits of directed evolution experiments, since the asparagine (N) was not reachable from any of the three initial codons and required a previous non-synonymous mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). It therefore vindicates our efforts to explore a larger sequence space while showing the limitations of doing so through synonymous mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epistasis purification</title><p>Our combinatorial library of 13 mutations has proven to be an efficient method to avoid the constraints caused by negative epistatic interactions and improve protein activity, as demonstrated by the 100-fold increase in activity obtained while keeping the total number of mutations equal. The study of the behavior of mutations using deep sequencing has yielded interesting results despite strong technical limitations. For instance, the sign epistasis observed between V315A and A321G justifies by itself the need for a combinatorial approach to avoid those mutation combinations with detrimental epistatic effects. It is very likely that, had we not done this, the increase in recombination would have been mild due to sign epistasis between these mutations.</p><p>We studied epistasis systematically for pairs of mutations in our library, but could only detect it in a minority of cases (11/55, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). When detected, epistasis was more often negative (nine cases with significant negative epistasis versus two with positive epistasis), suggesting that when there are interactions between pairs of mutations, the double mutant performs usually less well than expected. However, we did not clearly recover the classical global epistasis pattern of diminishing returns associated to fitness improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>). Usually, beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects on fitter backgrounds. This absence could be the consequence of mutations acting on the different aspects of recombination activity (binding, multimerization, DNA-cleavage or rejoining…). Alternatively, it could also be due to our measure of fitness of single and double mutants, that is averaged across multiple genetic backgrounds. However, models predict that epistasis between pairs of mutations is limited when the adaptive process is initiated far from the optimum, as it is the case here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanquart et al., 2014</xref>). In these conditions, epistatic interactions are barely detectable whether mutations are co-selected in an adaptive walk or selected independently and combined. However, when fitness gets closer to optimality, much more complex patterns of epistatic interactions are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanquart et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, the combination of more than two mutations suggests stronger epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) including some positive interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Positive epistasis is the likely explanation to why S173R does not appear in the first round of experiments, despite the strong effect it has in the 8mut background; or why the generally deleterious A321G mutation appears in a background containing T118S.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and other considerations</title><p>In this work, we have shown that we could shed some light on integrase innovation using a backward evolution approach, in which a modern protein is evolved toward its ancestral function. This has to be contrasted with the ancestral sequence resurrection strategy in which a putative ancestral sequence is inferred phylogenetically, synthesized and evolved toward a new function. Here, the process of ancestral sequence resurrection would be highly questionable because of long evolutionary time scales, the small number of IntI sequences available, and the lack of intermediates. Also, resurrection of an ancestral sequence and de novo insertion of residues is not always successful, because additional mutations elsewhere can be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2014</xref>). In this situation, the use of experimental selection in the laboratory starting from a partially accurate resurrected ancestor (or from a close canonical tyrosine-recombinase relative) may be beyond reach. The strategy we used proved to be an efficient alternative that could be applied to other important switches in gene function that have occurred long ago. By strongly selecting for double-strand recombination, we have managed to show that I2 is compatible with high rates of ancestral activity and that a route through functional intermediates exists between integrases in an early innovative state and modern integrases. Still, lacking an ancestor sequence inferred phylogenetically, it is beyond our reach to determine whether this was the route naturally followed by integrases (in opposite direction), or the impact that I2 had on the ancestor’s activity. Also, we cannot rule out that the rise of new functions in IntIs actually occurred through gene duplications. Indeed, a plethora of accessory genetic elements in bacteria, such as plasmids, transposons or phage (integrated in tandem repeats), are naturally in a multicopy state that promotes the evolvability of their cargo genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">San Millan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Possible scenario for the emergence of integron integrases</title><p>Y-recombinases are abundant in phages, fomenting speculations about a viral (or partly viral) origin of integrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the CTX phage of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is integrated as a ss-DNA hairpin, but it differs from integron recombination in that it is mechanistically identical to ds-recombination. Indeed, the genome of CTXϕ mimics a ds-DNA molecule encoding a <italic>dif</italic> site to hijack the activity of the host’s XerCD chromosome dimer resolvases -something done by many other elements dubbed IMEXs (integrative mobile elements exploiting Xer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2013</xref>). Xer proteins are the closest relatives to IntIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazel, 2006</xref>), but do not contain an I2 domain to recognize ss- substrates and avoid the second strand exchange that would result in a lethal linearization of the chromosome. To integrate safely, CTXϕ activates exclusively XerC, avoiding the deleterious cleavage of XerD. It is therefore possible that the acquisition of I2 occurred in an ancestor with Xer-like activity, and that it served initially to maintain the integrity of the chromosome when hijacked by ss-IMEXs that had not developed mechanisms to avoid the second strand exchange. In this scenario, a mildly negative impact of I2 on the main activity of the ancestor could have been compensated by the safer integration of such ss-IMEXs, that would otherwise linearize the chromosome and kill the host. Our results show that the ancestral integrase bearing I2 could have evolved without impairing the ancestral function up to a quite high activity on ss-DNA. From that detectable activity, natural selection could easily drive the specialization toward the new function, even at the cost of impairing the ancestral function as our data show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Concluding remark</title><p>The acquisition of an entire domain that is associated with a new function makes integrases an excellent experimental model for studying the evolution of novelty. Our results suggest that such a seemingly disruptive mutational event is compatible with a high ancestral activity, presumably thanks to the well-known robustness of the Y-recombinase fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tóth-Petróczy and Tawfik, 2014</xref>). We further showed -see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>- that an integrase with ancestral levels of ds-recombination activity and containing the I2 domain, could have detectable levels of activity on ss-DNA upon which selection can act. Using the <italic>adaptive landscape</italic> metaphor -in which genotype space is plotted on the x and y axis and fitness on the z vertical axis- our data suggest that the peaks representing the ancestral and modern functions are connected by some form of ridge that may facilitate the transition from one to the other, fostering innovation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Designation</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Source or reference</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Identifiers</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">DH5a</td><td align="center" valign="middle">Lab strain</td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">supE44 DlacU169 (F80lacZ’ DM15) DargF hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">UB5120</td><td align="center" valign="middle">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2157593/">2157593</ext-link></td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">F-pro met recA56 gyrA [NalR]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">β2163</td><td align="center" valign="middle">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15748991/">15748991</ext-link></td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">MG1655:: DdapA::(erm-pir)RP4-2-T c::Mu [KmR]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">B36</td><td align="center" valign="middle">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26961432/">26961432</ext-link></td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">MG1655 ΔdapA recA269::Tn10 attB::attI1WT-attI1STOP-dapA [SpR]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">4137</td><td align="center" valign="middle">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16341091/">16341091</ext-link></td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">β2163/pSW23T::attCaadA7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">2714</td><td align="center" valign="middle">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15748991/">15748991</ext-link></td><td align="center" valign="middle"/><td align="center" valign="middle">β2163/pSW23T::attI1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="middle">H203</td><td align="center" valign="middle">Strain from this work.

Colonies of recombinants were then pooled and used to extract plasmid content of this cycle that was electroporated into B36 again, starting the next cycle. This new setup was extremely rapid and efficient and hence, was used for the rest of the enrichment cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recombination activity tests</title><p>In order to quantify the recombination activity of each allele we used two types of setups. First we used a suicide conjugation assay previously developed in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biskri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3a</xref>) and implemented in several occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nivina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouvier et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, an <italic>attI</italic> site is provided by conjugation carried on a suicide vector from the R6K- based pSW family that is known to use the Pir protein to initiate its own replication. This plasmid also contains an RP4 origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>RP4). The donor strain β2163 carries the transfer functions in its chromosome, requires DAP to grow in rich medium and can sustain pSW replication through the expression of a chromosomally integrated <italic>pir</italic> gene. The DH5α recipient strains, which contain a pBAD plasmid [Ap<sup>R</sup>] containing the allele to be tested and the resident plasmid pSU38Δ::<italic>attI1</italic> [Sp<sup>R</sup>] carrying the <italic>attI1</italic> site, lacks the <italic>pir</italic> gene and therefore cannot sustain replication of the incoming <italic>attI</italic>-containing pSW vector. The only way for this vector to be maintained in the recipient cell is to form a cointegrate by <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attI</italic> recombination (or <italic>attI x attC</italic> where applicable). The recombination frequency is calculated as the ratio of transconjugants expressing the pSW marker [Cm<sup>R</sup>] to the total number of recipient clones [Ap<sup>R</sup>, Sp<sup>R</sup>]. Recombination frequencies correspond to the average of at least three independent trials. In the <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> tests performed to measure the trade-off between functions, plasmid pSU38Δ::<italic>attI1</italic> was substituted for plasmid pSU38Δ::<italic>attC<sub>aadA7</sub>.</italic> For the <italic>attC</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> reaction, a suicide pSW plasmid containing the <italic>pir</italic> gene interrupted by two <italic>attC</italic> sites is conjugated into a recipient strain containing the pBAD plasmid with the integrase allele to test. Recombination between both sites leads to the reconstitution of <italic>pir</italic> so that the plasmid can sustain its own replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouvier et al., 2009</xref>). Recombination frequency is calculated as above.</p><p>After the first round of enrichment cycles that yielded the eight mutations that combined provided a 100-fold gain in recombination activity, we needed to enlarge the dynamic range of this test to be capable of measuring recombination frequencies of mutants to come. To do so, we used the same recombination system used for the new enrichment cycles in which integrase-mediated recombination of two chromosomal <italic>attI1</italic> sites reconstitutes <italic>dapA</italic> and produces a selectable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escudero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3a</xref>). Integrase-coding alleles were expressed from a pBAD promoter for three hours using arabinose 0.2% before plating in media with and without DAP. The ratio between the number of colonies growing without DAP (recombinants) and those growing in DAP-containing media (total) gives the recombination frequency of that allele. In this new setup, recombination rates are 100-fold lower than in conjugation experiments, and we also have one more logarithm of dynamic range since conjugation is no longer limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mutant selection</title><p>We selected mutants following an evolutionary rationale to the interpretation of our results, and considered to be relevant those mutations that appear many times in the same or in different codes, alone or in combination with others, despite producing increases in recombination activity that were sometimes not statistically significant (for instance V315A).</p><p>Mutations in untranslated regions do not influence the intrinsic activity of the protein and are therefore not relevant for the evolution of the integrase. Yet, they can influence translation rates and hence play a role in the selection cycles. We therefore tested some to assess their influence in the recombination frequency of the allele obtained (as we have done for <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>)). Notably, in the second round of enrichment cycles, the number of <italic>alt2<sub>8mut</sub></italic> alleles bearing mutations in the 5’UTR of the gene is high enough to be potentially interpreted as if this region was non-optimal. We hence explored the possibility that the 5’ folding of the transcript was interfering with transcription of the <italic>alt2<sub>8mut</sub></italic> gene (as we saw in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escudero et al., 2018</xref>), but folding energies were identical between WT and mutated 5’ UTRs (−6.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> in all cases). Here, using the evolutionary rationale, and on the basis of frequency of appearance, UTR mutations can most often be considered hitchhike events (and neglected) i.e.: UTR mutations are not present in other mutants from <italic>intI1<sub>8mut</sub></italic> or <italic>alt1<sub>8mut</sub></italic>, and when they appear in <italic>alt2<sub>8mut</sub></italic> they are combined with mutations that are prevalent in the other codes. Hence, such parallel evolution events are considered as biologically relevant and help guide our choice of relevant mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calculation of epistasis error</title><p>Error in epistasis (σ<sub>ε</sub>) was calculated through the error propagation method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trindade et al., 2009</xref>. The expected minus the observed fold increases in recombination frequencies (the epistasis) were 41.9; 2.9·10<sup>2</sup> and 5.24·10<sup>3</sup> for the double, triple and quintuple mutants respectively. Error values were 18.4, 41.1, and 108.1, respectively, proving that epistasis was significative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Epistasis purification library</title><p>To construct a library with all possible combinations of our 13 mutations we designed oligonucleotides containing a mixture of bases at each position of interest. Several fragments bearing the mutations were amplified and assembled in an approach that combined SOE-PCR splicing through overlap extension PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heckman and Pease, 2007</xref>) and Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). Design constraints were found in more variable regions that introduced more variants. For instance, in position 319, in order to obtain WT (glycine) and mutated (glutamate) alleles we used primers with the codon GRM, that can indeed lead to the residues glycine (GGA, and GGC) and glutamate (GAA), but also to the unintended aspartate (GAC). Also, in the case of the re-evolved G320(D,N) residue, we used primers with an RRT codon that leads to all three residues (glycine: GGT; aspartate: GAT; asparagine: AAT) but also to a serine (AGT). These constraints rendered the library more complex and raised the theoretical number of different alleles in it to 24.576.</p><p>Despite the use of high fidelity polymerases at all stages, the several rounds of PCR amplification needed along the process meant that we could not rule out a certain degree of randomization in the final library.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sequencing</title><p>Deep sequencing was performed using PacBio SMRTbell technology (The Genome Analysis Centre, Norwich, UK). PacBio technology produces long sequencing reads with albeit with high error rates (10%). The inclusion of single stranded loops at the edges of PCR-amplified alleles, yields long reads with several copies of a unique allele. This technology strongly decreases the error rate per allele. In our sequencing runs error rates were roughly estimated to be around 0.3%. Although the fidelity was significantly higher, this rate still implies an average of three mutations per allele (1014pb), precluding the use of complete allele sequences for the study. In an effort to capture the diversity of the initial library we dedicated eight SMRT Cells (theoretical number of reads: 4 × 10<sup>5</sup>) for time 0. To observe the evolution of the alleles along the different cycles we dedicated two SMRT cells for each time point (cycles one, three, and six. Theoretical number of reads per time point: 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>). Sequencing results underwent a curation process. First, reads that were too short to contain all mutations were discarded. Then reads were aligned to <italic>intI1</italic> revealing a high abundance of indels in our reads. This was also the case for reads from cycle six, where inactive integrases are extremely unlikely to be found, suggesting that indels were rather a technical artifact than a biologically relevant phenomenon. Hence, indels were artificially corrected in our reads. The combination of residues encoded in positions of interest (those in which we had inserted a mutation) was extracted for each allele, conforming a 13-letter string defining that allele: the alleleID. The total amount of usable alleleIDs after curation of our sequencing data was of 67179 reads for the initial library, and 21622, 31694, and 18907 for cycles one, three, and six. The risk of using allele-IDs, is underestimating the effect of mutations in positions other than the 13 <italic>loci</italic> of interest, that could have appeared during the process of construction of the library, and that could have been non-neutral. To address this, we analyzed the number of mutations found at each position in cycle six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7A</xref>). Mutations clearly clustered in the 13 <italic>loci</italic> of interest and were distributed homogeneously along the rest of the gene at a lower frequency, except for an unexpected accumulation of mutations leading to a A234V substitution, that was initially included in our analysis.</p><p>The current trade-off in sequencing technologies between long reads and coverage has meant that despite our effort to establish fully-defined alleles by phasing all mutations, coverage is too low to perform statistically robust analysis on the level of these complete alleles. We hence examined the effect of mutations by comparing the change over time in frequency of all alleles containing a particular <italic>focal</italic> mutation at a given <italic>locus</italic> of interest, relative to all those containing the WT residue at that <italic>locus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7D</xref>). This change in relative frequency is used as a proxy for fitness along our enrichment cycles, and fitness is itself a proxy for recombination frequency. This analysis, in which the effect of a mutation is effectively measured as its average effect over all genetic backgrounds (albeit weighted according to the precise composition of the initial library), provides an interesting measure of mutation effects from both an evolutionary and engineering perspective. It is justified by the fact that the profile of the genetic background in the initial library is very similar for all focal mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>To find epistatic interactions between mutations, we focused on the first two time-points because the profile of the genetic background for each mutation changes with time, influencing the apparent fitness of mutations and precluding proper analysis. To assess the significance of our epistasis estimates in the face of the counting noise inherent in deep-sequencing experiments, we simulated our experiment by starting with the observed genotype counts from the initial library and using the fitness estimates obtained for single mutations to compute genotype counts after cycle one, assuming independent mutation effects (no epistasis). The new counts were computed by Poisson sampling, using the observed total counts for cycle one, and apparent epistasis was calculated from this simulated data as for the real data. The results from multiple no-epistasis simulations could then be confronted with our real epistasis estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d and e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data processing</title><p>In order to analyze epistatic interactions between mutations we removed all sequences that were not WT at positions 319 and 320, and all sequences that were not WT or the expected mutant at all other positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fitness estimation</title><p>The limited read coverage of mutant sequences constrained us to measuring the fitness effects of focal mutations averaged over all backgrounds present in the library, rather than specifically in the WT background. Thus, the relative fitness effect of a particular mutation (or mutation pair) is defined as the collective fitness of all sequences carrying the mutation (or mutation pair) relative to the fitness of all sequences who are WT at the relevant position(s). This in fact provides a more general measure of fitness which takes into account a mutation’s average epistasis with the genetic background of our library, rather than just focusing on its effect in a single background (<italic>ie</italic>. the WT background). This approach is permitted by the common profile of the genetic background for all single mutations and mutation pairs at t<sub>0</sub>, as well as for their respective WT-containing reference sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), and by the sufficient read coverage at this level of diversity (for single mutations: 910x at t<sub>0</sub> and 127x at t<sub>1</sub>; for double mutations: 182x at t<sub>0</sub> and 25x at t<sub>1</sub>). However, only t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> could be used for the approach to be valid, as the profile of the genetic background of each focal mutation can change differently over time, due indeed principally to epistasis between focal mutations and the genetic background.</p><p>As only a single selection cycle is taken into account, the relative fitness effect, <italic>w</italic>, of a focal mutation, <italic>i</italic>, is computed as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>here <italic>mut<sub>i</sub><sup>t0</sup></italic> and <italic>mut<sub>i</sub><sup>t1</sup></italic> are the ratio of mutant <italic>i</italic> counts to the relevant WT reference counts (those sequences with a WT residue at position <italic>i</italic>) at t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>1</sub>, respectively.

The main source of noise was assumed to be sampling noise arising from the limited sequencing read coverage (any sampling noise arising from the selection-enrichment protocol itself was neglected, due to the maintenance of a large population size relative to mutant diversity). Other sources of noise, such as off-target mutations, are outside of our reach, and so the epistasis confidence estimates derived here serve as an upper bound.</p><p>Simulations were initiated with the real count data for t<sub>0</sub>, and every genotype was assigned a relative fitness, <italic>w,</italic> based on the real fitness estimates for single focal mutations and the assumption of no epistasis between mutations (unlike above, <italic>w</italic> is defined here on a linear, rather than ln, scale).

Briefly, a randomized library of integrase encoding genes cloned in a pBAD plasmid (<bold>A</bold>) is established in a toxin-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain containing a pSU plasmid that encodes an <italic>attI</italic> site and a toxin (1). This strain acts as receptor in the conjugation of an <italic>attI</italic>-bearing suicide plasmid (2). Mutagenized integrases deliver the <italic>attI x attI</italic> recombination reaction allowing the formation of a selectable cointegrate (3). pBAD plasmids are then purified in two steps: the plasmid preparation from recombinants (4) is digested to specifically degrade cointegrates (5) and then transformed in a toxin sensitive strain (6). Plasmid extraction from this strain yields very pure pBAD plasmids containing a variety of integrase-coding genes of high activity (<bold>B</bold>). Higher selective pressure is applied by subjecting these plasmids to further cycles. b: Novel enrichment cycles used for the evolution of the rest of alleles. Briefly: the library of integrase mutants cloned in a pBAD plasmid (<bold>A</bold>) is established in a <italic>dap- E. coli</italic> that contains a <italic>dapA</italic> gene in the chromosome interrupted by two <italic>attI</italic> sites (1). Expression of the integrase leads to the recombination of both sites and the reconstitution of <italic>dapA</italic>, allowing recombinants to grow in media not supplemented with DAP (2). Plasmid preparations from recombinants (3) yields pure pBAD plasmids containing a mixture of hyperactive-integrase-coding genes (<bold>B</bold>) that can be further used in subsequent cycles.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58061-app1-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recombination activity for the <italic>attI</italic> x <italic>attC</italic> reaction of evolved alleles from alternative codes, relative to their parental <italic>alt</italic> allele.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58061-app1-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Methods used for evaluating the efficiency of integrase alleles.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) scheme of conjugative and chromosomal tests. In both cases the recombination between <italic>attI</italic> sites produces a selectable phenotype. The dynamic range of each assay is different and so are the results for a given integrase allele.

The work contains some interesting methodological innovations, such as a method to purge the confounding effects of epistasis from the outcome. Using experimental evolution to recapitulate historical events is a powerful approach. The stated evolutionary implications are that new functions can arise without compromising ancestral functions, and that large insertions can be part of neofunctionalization. This should be of interested to biochemists and evolutionary biologists, although similar conclusions have been reached in several previous studies from other labs</p><p>In general terms all reviewers are satisfied that the paper is experimentally sound and addresses a topic of importance and of general interest. However concerns exist, particularly over interpretation of the data, which falls short of supporting the more substantive claims of the manuscript. The data do not show that the insertion contributed to a new function, nor does the data decisively show that the insertion occurred on the background of the ancestral function (rather than occurring after the derived function was acquired by other means). Additionally, the experiments do not show that the historical trajectory was “smooth”. Only that a somewhat smooth trajectory can be obtained in the reverse direction under conditions of strong laboratory selection. The major issues are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction is very difficult to follow, out of kilter with the findings, overlooks relevant work, and makes statements about the evolution of innovation that are not warranted. For example, it is stated that proteins that evolve a new function that replaces the old function have to go through an adaptive valley. This is certainly not true in general. Gene duplications can free one of the duplicates to evolve new functions whilst completely losing the ancestral function. Even if no duplications happen, new functions can evolve without preservation of the ancestral function, as long as the fitness gain of the new function outweighs the loss of the ancestral one. In general, this section gives the impression that we have no worked-out examples of the evolution of novelty. This is not the case. Examples include new protein-protein interactions (Anderson et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016, Baker et al., 2012), the evolution of new substrate specificities (Voordeckers et al., PLOS Biology, 2012), and de novo evolution of enzyme catalysis (Clifton et al., 2018, Kaltenbach et al., 2018), spontaneous domain fusions (Farr et al., 2017). Many of these innovations involved discrete transitions to new functions, without promiscuous intermediates. Nonetheless, we agree that the recombinases described in this work are an impressive example of innovation, and that they are a great model system.</p><p>2) The authors imply that the 20 amino acid insertion is causally responsible for the new function, and that this study aims to understand how such a drastic change could contribute to innovation. No evidence seems to exist to support this claim and this needs to be rectified. The present study establishes that the insertion is compatible with the ancestral function, not that it was causal or necessary for the new one. Further, an active site insertion involved in neo-functionalization has been described in detail at least once before (Boucher et al., 2014).</p><p>3) Use of an experimental evolution strategy to examine historical transitions is interesting, but it is not clear what is gained by re-evolving ancestral phenotypes from an evolutionary standpoint. Showing that this is possible establishes that the evolution of the new function is reversible in a broad sense, under conditions of strong selection. But specifically the questions the authors pose in their Introduction would seem more adequately addressed by evolving the ancestral function towards the new one. The authors need to elaborate on why the “reverse evolution” approach is superior or equal to other approaches in this context.</p><p>4) Results show that it was possible for an integrase to accommodate the I2 domain insertion and keep ancestral activity, but it is necessary to include discussion of the link between this finding and what can really be inferred concerning the ancestral protein (which was presumably quite different from the one relevant at the time of the original insertion), and the constraints relevant at that original time. Discovery that it is possible that the insertion containing the integrase can be selected to a high level of ancestral activity doesn't, by itself, allow a claim that the original insertion didn't compromise that activity. Unclear is how to interpret this potential to the actual changes in activity likely to have been relevant to the evolution of the integrase.</p><p>5) Interpretations concerning patterns of epistasis, particularly apparent lack of tendency toward diminishing-returns, need to be re-assessed in light of the experimental findings. In naturally evolving systems, a successful lineage accumulates mutations that have been selected through successive events. As the authors recognise, this is expected to lead to a different pattern of epistasis than for mutations that are assembled without selection (or, even with only purifying selection, which sorts on available combinations, but wasn't designed to facilitate new mutation origination) (e.g., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2015;112: E3226-E3235). Necessary is some discussion of how the (mostly) “assembled” vs. “co-selected” mutation selection regimes might be expected to affect patterns of epistasis relevant to the focal integrase functions. It is surprising not to have seen diminishing-returns, or even more common sign epistasis. What this boils down to is concern over the relevance of the data presented and inferences on the nature of historical evolutionary innovation, which, from the Introduction, is the main motivator for the work. The data here do not convincingly show that the selected path was “smooth” (interpreted as meaning with monotonically increasing activity of the selected function), let alone that this was the case for the historical selection of the ss substrate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Primary and promiscuous functions coexist during evolutionary innovation through whole protein domain acquisitions&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, there remain significant concerns over how the work is motivated and presented, particularly regarding the evolutionary framework.</p><p>Part of the problem seems to stem from presenting the work in in a framework that just doesn't fit. Maybe it’s worth taking a step back and starting with what you have done and what it shows, without the higher level context. In essence, what you have done is used a directed evolution strategy based on a powerful screen for enzyme function to generate variants of the extant sequence that have ancestral activity. These mutants and the mutations they harbour were then subject to further analysis to look at interactions among individual mutations. Therein lie some interesting discoveries and possibility to draw certain inferences on the ancestral state. But as the reviewers below point out you state that the ancestral state lacks the I2 α helix, so you really haven't recreated what you believe to be the ancestral sequence.</p><p>Additionally, the directed evolution approach can certainly reveal functional states, but as to whether such states were accessible in the context of organism fitness is another matter.</p><p>I encourage you to take a look at Dean and Thornton 2007 Nature Genetics, or more recently Hochberg and Thornton 2017 Annu Rev Biophysics, two reviews that place directed evolution experiments in context of what they can and can't say. Both reviews also deal with ancestral reconstruction experiments.</p><p>I include below the full set of comments from the reviewers in the hope that these provide further assistance.<italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The authors have made changes that generally address my previous comments. Two are outstanding.</p><p>I still find it hard to follow the overall presentation of the Introduction. Several points, some discussed at length, seem to have limited relevance to the work presented. For example, the constraint placed by a need to continually perform an original function on evolution of a new function, which I don't think this work is well placed to address. Other points seem more relevant but are discussed briefly. For example, it would be helpful to unpack the contrast between the “new view” of protein genotype-function mapping that allows point mutations to create new functionality without compromising original functionality, with the difficulty in applying this view to “large” mutations.</p><p>My main reservation is the overall interpretation that innovation follows (at least, can follow?) a “new model” whereby ancestral function is retained for the majority of the evolutionary steps along the way to a new function. The authors point to data summarized in Figure 7 to support this view. To me, this figure is clearly more consistent with the presented “old view” that the original function quickly declines as a new function evolves. I'm sure that a curve fit with an old view (decreasing concave up) function would fit the data a lot better than a curve fit with a new view (decreasing concave down) function. That said, one characterized allele – Seq7 – is clearly an outlier to the old view, retaining the original function while having a high level of the new function. Does this support that the new view is possible? To me, the answer is far from conclusive – the Seq7 allele has eight amino acid changes relative to the original allele, so that it is not clear it falls along a selectable path connecting original and new integrases-in other words, it is not clear it is a reachable, let alone actual, functional intermediate. I know the authors realize this, but, without that knowledge, I don't see how the observation usefully informs the focal question concerning the pattern of functional changes as a new innovation evolves.<italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>I think the Introduction and Discussion still contain very unusual renditions of foundational evolutionary concepts that I find hard to agree with. The authors for example describe a “dated” view, in which all adaptive peaks are narrow because proteins are specialized. I think this view, if it ever has been main-stream, has been thoroughly out fashion for over a decade. Neutral networks are known to connect different protein functions. I would point the authors to any of a number of Andreas Wagner's papers. In general, I get the sense of a somewhat false dichotomy between the “new” and whatever is referred to as the “old” view (which very few people hold or have held). Figure 1 A I think is not very helpful in explaining what the authors mean, because it misses the fitness dimension (unless the authors are directly equating activity with fitness, which would be a mistake in many cases).</p><p>In their rebuttal and their Discussion, the authors argue that ancestral sequence reconstruction would not be practical here, and so the reverse evolution approach is the most sensible. While this seems to contradict the statement earlier in the paper that the innovation in question happened recently, I did not mean to imply ASR should be used in this case. I meant to ask why the reverse evolution approach is better than evolving the ancestral function (in an extant enzyme!) towards the derived one. This question is important, because it is still not clear to me, how experimental evolution in the reverse direction proves anything about historical evolution the forward direction (especially about smoothness). I am open to the idea that it does, but the arguments levelled in the paper unfortunately did not clarify it for me.</p><p>I am also not sure I understand the parsimony arguments about how the insertion must be causal. Parsimony can only assign states to internal nodes (and correspondingly state changes to branches). It is unclear to me how parsimony could ever be used to select among a set of changes along some particular branch the subset of changes that caused a functional change. I think what the authors mean is that the insertion is the most biochemically plausible change to have caused the shift in function. That unfortunately does not seem a very strong argument in the absence of a decisive experiment to me.</p><p>I want to re-iterate that the experimental is good, I simply take issue with some of the high-level motivation and interpretation of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58061.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction is very difficult to follow, out of kilter with the findings, overlooks relevant work, and makes statements about the evolution of innovation that are not warranted.

We also acknowledge the different expectations on the prevalence of epistasis in the “far from optimal” scenario for both co-selected or combined mutations.

This mutant is the closest representative in our experiments to a hypothetical “early innovative state” of an integrase that would have recently acquired the I2 domain. It is of note that Seq5 already has detectable modern activity (in our very sensitive assays), but we do not assume that this would have been necessarily the case initially. Comparing Seq5 to Seq7, mutants that are only 3 mutations away (not eight), shows that an integrase in an early innovative state can increase its modern activity 100x without a trade off in ancestral activity, supporting the general message that coexistence of functions (promiscuity) is also possible in proteins suffering large rearrangements ant that it fosters innovation.</p><p>It is of note that we do not aim to impose the view that any of these pathways was the real one, but rather that they are possible.

Spontaneous insertions of long domains are rare enough in the lab to make this approach extremely risky, especially if they have to bring a novel function, and not simply change the protein’s conformation locally. Additionally, designing the whole experiment to detect unequivocally single strand DNA recombination would be extremely complex. Hypothetically, one would use as a starting point, Xer recombinases (the closest relatives to integrases), which in most species -and certainly the ones we use as models in the lab- act as heterodimers of XerC and XerD. These enzymes recognize a canonical ds-DNA site called <italic>dif</italic>. We would hence need to modify the <italic>dif</italic> site to try to convert it into an <italic>attC</italic>-like site, including the EHBs. We would need to develop a selection method to detect single strand recombination (avoiding any noise with ds-recombination) on this site, to use as selective pressure in the lab to obtain insertions in Xer conferring ss-recombination capabilities. This, assuming our new <italic>dif</italic> site will behave as we expect, which we cannot test previously. If we managed to retrieve such events, we would then need to verify that mutations found in any of the Xer proteins really lead to the recognition of the new <italic>dif</italic> site as a single strand, and specifically for the EHBs. This is crucial because mutated Xer proteins (or WT, for that matter) could simply recognize the folded site as a double strand, which is what happens with the CTX phage in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and all our setup would be in vain. To do so we would need to obtain the structure of the mutant bound to the site through crystallography, as was done for <italic>V. cholerae’s</italic> integron integrase (but has never been obtained for any other integrase despite years of effort). Even then, one might be prudent enough to suggest that mutations are not necessarily causal to ss-DNA recognition, so we would have to prove that the ancestral Xer protein does not bind the ss-dif sites in the same way. This would be really hard, because it is even more unlikely that we would obtain such structure. So altogether it seems that the only viable approach to study the phenomenon is the way we have done it, given the luck of having both activities in an extant enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also not sure I understand the parsimony arguments about how the insertion must be causal. Parsimony can only assign states to internal nodes (and correspondingly state changes to branches). It is unclear to me how parsimony could ever be used to select among a set of changes along some particular branch the subset of changes that caused a functional change. I think what the authors mean is that the insertion is the most biochemically plausible change to have caused the shift in function. That unfortunately does not seem a very strong argument in the absence of a decisive experiment to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Our use of parsimony humbly refers to the simplest explanation. Our rationale is that if there is a domain that does not exist in any other recombinase; no other recombinase does ss/ds-DNA recombination, and the crystal structure shows that the domain is responsible for ss-recognition in integrases. We hence think that the simplest explanation is that the domain brought the function. One can argue that it didn’t and that the function came later, but that implies that the region where the I2 was initially inserted is flexible enough to accommodate function-less insertions without being deleterious for the protein function. This does not seem to be the case, because there are no such insertions in the same region of 105 members of the Y-recombinase family (Nunes-Duby et al., 1998). Again, proving this experimentally is unfortunately beyond our current reach, so we hope to have clearly stated that these are assumptions and to have toned them down enough to make them reasonable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
