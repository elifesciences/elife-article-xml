The key regulatory function of the network is highlighted by its deregulation leading to human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), and the evolutionary conservation across organisms including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katewa and Kapahi, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the major tumor suppressors of this network are phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins Tsc1 and Tsc2. Pten counteracts the function of PI3K by dephosphorylating the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klippel et al., 1997</xref>), thereby inhibiting Akt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goberdhan et al., 1999</xref>). The TSC complex inactivates mTORC1 downstream of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potter et al., 2002</xref>) via its GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saucedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stocker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Another major downstream target of Akt is the transcription factor Forkhead box O (FoxO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jünger et al., 2003</xref>). However, the role of FoxO as a bona fide tumor suppressor is not established since it can also function as tumor-promoting depending on the biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Doeselaar and Burgering, 2018</xref>). This underscores the importance of understanding the regulation of FoxO and the downstream signaling in a particular context of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Webb, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using an early tumorigenesis model in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have shown that the loss of Tsc1 leads to an enhanced overgrowth of eye imaginal discs in larvae raised under nutrient restriction (NR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowak et al., 2018</xref>). This overgrowth is primarily hypertrophic in nature. Loss of Tsc1 induces hyperactivation of mTORC1 and an S6K-dependent negative feedback to insulin signaling. This causes downregulation of Akt and an increased nuclear localization of FoxO, resulting in growth inhibition. Suppression of FoxO function in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells results in massively overgrown tissues that show ectopic differentiation, demonstrating a role of FoxO in regulating proliferation and differentiation of these hyperactive mTORC1 cells. However, the specific FoxO targets crucial for growth regulation remained elusive.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye imaginal disc is composed of different populations of mitotically active and differentiating cells. Given the context and cell-type specificity of FoxO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Webb et al., 2016</xref>), investigation for its targets is required to be performed in specific cells under conditions being studied. The laser capture microdissection (LCM) technique has emerged as a useful tool for isolation of distinct cells of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iyer and Cox, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vicidomini et al., 2010</xref>) but a comprehensive analytical study has not been described previously in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here, we use transcriptome profiling of single mutant clones isolated using LCM from larval eye imaginal discs. Our results identify downregulation of ER stress as a key mechanism downstream of FoxO to inhibit <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant overgrowth under NR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomics analysis to identify FoxO targets in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells under NR</title><p>FoxO restricts the growth of tissues with high mTORC1 activity under NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowak et al., 2018</xref>). To identify FoxO targets essential for this growth regulation, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome profiling of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells, with or without <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown, using our previously described model of early tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval eye imaginal discs. The mutant cells were isolated in a spatially and temporally controlled manner to address the context specificity and high number of FoxO targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Webb et al., 2016</xref>). To profile strictly the mitotically active cells and to avoid false-positive FoxO targets from different cell types, the LCM technique was used to isolate single clones from the mitotically active part anterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc (spatial control) of wandering third instar larvae (temporal control). The MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>) and Gal80<sup>ts</sup> systems were combined to gain a temporal control on the expression of <italic>foxo-RNAi</italic> specifically in mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Analysis was done on 29 samples that passed quality control. Clustering on normalized gene counts showed high variability among the biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This can be explained by the small starting material for library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhargava et al., 2015</xref>) and an absence of pooling of multiple samples to average the individual organismal differences. Interestingly, a reduction in <italic>foxo</italic> transcripts was not observed in the knockdown samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar partial loss of transcripts accompanied by a significant loss of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was observed in Kc167 cells, suggesting the presence of a transcriptionally-activating feedback upon <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown or a direct effect on the translational capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doench et al., 2003</xref>).

In cells with loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> function, it suppresses cellular growth and proliferation. In this study, we performed RNA-seq transcriptomics analysis on single mutant clones isolated by LCM to identify critical regulators of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant tissue growth upon loss of FoxO. Earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauthner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spletter et al., 2007</xref>) have described the use of LCM for RNA isolation from optimal cutting temperature compound-embedded tissues, but this is the first report, to our knowledge, illustrating the use of this technique with living imaginal disc cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that was not based on pooling of multiple biological samples.</p><p>The majority of the genes differentially upregulated in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells upon <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown consisted of snoRNAs and snRNAs. snoRNAs are single-stranded non-coding RNAs that function primarily in the posttranscriptional modification of ribosomal RNAs and snRNAs to regulate ribosome biogenesis and function, RNA editing, gene silencing, and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bratkovič and Rogelj, 2011</xref>). snoRNA genes were shown to be directly bound and activated by Myc in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herter et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of <italic>myc</italic> is suppressed by FoxO, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>). The same study reported that mTORC1 regulates Myc activity by controlling the amount of protein bound to promoters of target genes. A similar mechanism might be at play in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells of the eye imaginal discs. Upon knockdown of <italic>foxo</italic>, the inhibition of <italic>myc</italic> expression by FoxO is alleviated under NR, and Myc gets activated downstream of hyperactive mTORC1. This can lead to a subsequent upregulation of snoRNAs, which helps in biomass production in these rapidly growing cells. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests a correlation between snoRNAs and sustained proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>From among the downregulated genes, ER stress response pathway components were validated as essential regulators of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant overgrowth. There is a significant interplay between the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling network and ER stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appenzeller-Herzog and Hall, 2012</xref>). Induction of ER stress results in the suppression of insulin receptor signaling linking ER stress to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, PEK-driven regulation of FoxO contributes to this resistance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In a study on cardiac dysfunction, uncontrolled activation of Akt repressed ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). Hyperactivation of mTORC1 activity, particularly via loss of the TSC complex function, leads to increased ER stress and UPR pathway upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozcan et al., 2008</xref>). In turn, ER stress inhibits Akt and mTORC1 activity to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Our identification of putative ERAD components governing <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant tissue growth adds another interaction node to this pathway crosstalk. The absence of canonical ERAD components in the transcriptomics data prompted us to consider the possibility of an independent mechanism for the degradation of misfolded proteins, as shown previously in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Safra et al., 2014</xref>). However, enhancement of the <italic>Tsc1</italic> loss-of-function overgrowth upon downregulation of the core ERAD components implies an important role of the Hrd3-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in this growth process.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate a critical function of FoxO in limiting ER stress to restrain <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant overgrowth under NR. Given that FoxO restricts <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant tissue growth at the level of proliferation, a lack of known proliferation-affecting genes among the differentially regulated genes is intriguing. This suggests that the inhibitory effect on proliferation by FoxO might be indirect, possibly via ER stress response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vandewynckel et al., 2013</xref>). PERK reduces oxidative DNA damage and checkpoint activation to increase proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bobrovnikova-Marjon et al., 2010</xref>). A role for the ER chaperone GRP78 in regulating tumor cell proliferation by various means has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2014</xref>). IRE1α has been shown to promote cell proliferation by regulating expression of cyclin A1 through XBP-1 splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thorpe and Schwarze, 2010</xref>). Our results indeed demonstrate a heightened expression of <italic>Hsc-70–3</italic> and spliced-<italic>Xbp1</italic> in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells upon <italic>foxo</italic> loss under NR, hinting at a possible approach to reinforce proliferation in these cells. PEK might also be regulated at a level other than transcription. The exact molecular mechanisms of this regulation remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Aberrant ER stress activation has also been recorded during various aspects of cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avril et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). Considerable efforts have been made to develop therapeutic strategies to target the dependency of tumor cells on ER stress response pathways, or to substantially upregulate stress to cause cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, in the case of loss of <italic>Tsc1/2</italic> function, use of ER stress-inducing agents has displayed sensitization of mutant cells to individual treatments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2011</xref>), or combination treatments in a mouse xenograft tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Since the ER stress response can have both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma and Hendershot, 2004</xref>), it is crucial to characterize the signaling landscape of individual tumors before therapeutic intervention. For instance, our results demonstrate that increasing ER stress led to an enhancement of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant overgrowth. A similar overgrowth mechanism can be proposed for <italic>Tsc1 foxo</italic> mutant cells. Suppression of <italic>foxo</italic> represses the ERAD pathway activation, which combined with the augmented protein synthesis in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells results in a state of high ER stress. This new adaptive state is beneficial for proliferation and confers a growth advantage to <italic>Tsc1 foxo</italic> mutant cells. The exploitation of this process in tumors with escalated mTORC1 activity that exhibit loss of FoxOs can extend the repertoire of available treatment options and needs further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly food and fly lines</title><p>All crosses were maintained at 25°C on normal fly food unless otherwise stated.

a <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor model. This builds on previous work showing that when <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are raised under nutrient restrictive conditions, simultaneous loss of both <italic>Tsc1</italic> and FoxO results in an overgrowth phenotype. Data are provided here that in a <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant background, FoxO limits cell proliferation to restrict mutant overgrowth. The study also finds down-regulation of genes associated with the ER stress response pathway in FoxO deficient cells and knockdown of putative FoxO target genes in Tsc1-deficient cells also induces ectopic growth. This leads to the conclusion that the ER stress response pathway is a key FoxO-regulated pathway that impacts growth control downstream of Tsc1.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;FoxO suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit growth of Tsc1-deficient tissues under nutrient restriction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The manuscript has some issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. As you will see from the reviewer comments, all found the work to be interesting, but also raised some points that we felt would be straight forward to address in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study by Gupta and Stocker uses a transcriptomics approach to examine the genetic interaction between <italic>Tsc1</italic> and FoxO in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor model. Previous studies in the fly demonstrated that when <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are raised under nutrient restrictive conditions, simultaneous loss of both <italic>Tsc1</italic> and FoxO in the eye imaginal disc results in an overgrowth phenotype. In an effort to identify the FoxO target genes that contribute to this phenotype, they use laser capture microdissection combined with RNAseq to identify those genes that are differentially regulated in cells lacking FoxO. The resulting analysis reveals a significant down-regulation of genes associated with the ER stress response pathway in FoxO deficient cells. Moreover, these genes appear to be important for the FoxO/<italic>Tsc1</italic> phenotype because RNAi of these putative FoxO target genes in Tsc1-deficient cells also induced ectopic growth. Similarly, the use of small molecules to induce ER stress enhanced the size of eyes lacking Tsc1.</p><p>Overall, I found this to be a short, but potentially interesting manuscript. The use of mosaic analysis combined with laser capture microdissection for conducting RNA-seq is a powerful approach. In addition, I was impressed by the fact that down-regulation of the ER stress response enhance the <italic>Tsc1</italic> overgrowth phenotype, suggesting that this is a key FoxO-regulated pathway in the context of growth control. However, I have a few criticisms that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The text repeatedly refers genes mis-regulated in the RNAseq analysis as FoxO targets. However, there is no FoxO binding analysis to prove such an assertion and the text should be modified accordingly.</p><p>2) Several of the genes that are classified as being part of the ER stress response have not been characterized in flies (e.g., CG6766). The authors should verify that RNAi-depletion of these candidate genes induce ER stress using either the Cnx99a antibody or by examining expression of spliced Xbp1 transcripts.</p><p>3) In paragraph two of the Results you speculate about the reason why snoRNAs are up-regulated in the RNAseq data. Since there are no experiments examining why snoRNAs are mis-regulated in the dataset, most of this text should be moved to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper follows on from a previous report from the Stocker lab showing that <italic>foxo</italic> normally functions to limit <italic>tsc1</italic> mutant epithelial cell clone growth and when <italic>foxo</italic> is removed, these clones show massive overgrowth. The interpretation from this work was that, in a <italic>tsc1</italic> mutant background, <italic>foxo</italic> may be functioning to limit cell proliferation to restrict <italic>tsc1</italic> mutant overgrowth. In this paper, Gupta and Stocker now use transcriptomics to identify FoxO regulated genes that may explain this function of FoxO.</p><p>They use a very nice LCM technique to isolate cell clones, which presumably removes potential caveats and confounds in expression data associated with tissue disruption/FACS sorting, which is often used as a way to isolate pure populations of cell clones from imaginal discs. In addition, the finding that alteration in ERAD genes may explain the effects of FoxO on growth and proliferation of <italic>tsc1</italic> mutant cells is a novel finding that will be of broad interest to researchers in the field of cell growth and proliferation (not just in flies).</p><p>1) Results, paragraph one: It's strange that the RNA-seq showed no FoxO knockdown. The conclusion is that the lack of detection of FoxO knockdown is due to biological variability. And the authors show an example of partial mRNA knockdown achieving strong protein knockdown in Kc167 cells. However, the eye disc data show no knockdown at all. Is it possible that the LCM technique may not be accurately just isolating the knockdown clones? Based on the schematic in Figure 1, can the authors use presence/absence of GFP transcripts to clearly delineate that have isolated purely the clonal cells?</p><p>2) The discovery that regulation of ER stress and ERAD genes may explain the effects of FoxO is interesting. These finding would certainly be in line with the known links between Tsc1, FoxO and the control of ER stress. One thing I thought was missing was a little more investigation and explanation of how the ER stress genes are interacting with Tsc1 to control cell proliferation – the data in Figures 2, 3 do show changes in eye size, but is it clear that these effects are on cell proliferation (vs. growth, death)? And if they are, what might be the mechanism? As it stands the paper reads as an initial (but still very nice) functional validation of RNA-seq data rather than an in-depth mechanistic investigation into how FoxO and Tsc1 function to control tissue growth.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is a huge technical achievement, applying cutting edge clonal techniques to identify FoxO target genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The results reveal regulation of the ER stress response by FoxO along with other targets. The model system used is excellent, because it enables full FoxO activation in growing clones of cells in the eye, which is achieved by mutating TSC to activate a TOR negative feedback loop to suppress Akt, thereby activating FoxO. This roundabout method is essential because simply blocking Akt or over activating FoxO normally kills cells. Overall, I found the results robust, important and of interest to the field.</p><p>1) Title could be shorter. No need to mention TSC.</p><p>2) Introduction ought to more carefully and fully explain the TOR negative feedback loop on Akt that means full FoxO activation upon loss of TSC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53159.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] However, I have a few criticisms that should be addressed:</p><p>1) The text repeatedly refers genes mis-regulated in the RNA-seq analysis as FoxO targets.

We used a mutant allele carrying a piggyBac insertion with a splice-acceptor site and stop codons in all frames in the first intron of the gene (Schuldiner et al., 2008; line 140290 from Kyoto <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Resource Center). Calnexin staining of homozygous mutant clones showed similar staining pattern compared to the surrounding wild-type tissue and the isogenic control clones (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). We then examined the expression levels of spliced-<italic>Xbp1</italic> and <italic>Hsc-70-3</italic> to observe the effect on the upregulation of ER stress response. Control or <italic>CG6766</italic> knockdowns were generated in wild-type, weak <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockdown and strong <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockdown backgrounds. qRT-PCR analysis on eye imaginal discs revealed no change in the expression levels of spliced-<italic>Xbp1</italic> or <italic>Hsc-70-3</italic> in the wild-type background upon knockdown of <italic>CG6766</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and B'). By contrast, the expression levels of both ER stress reporters were increased in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockdown backgrounds, indicating that CG6766 is limiting to maintain ER homeostasis in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells.</p><p>The lack of an ER stress response in cells mutant for CG6766 suggests a (partially) redundant function.

In addition to the biological variability, we suspect the presence of a transcriptionally-activating feedback upon <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown as mentioned in the manuscript. An effect on translational capacity could also explain the loss of FoxO protein (Figure 1B and 1B’) with no effect on the transcript levels (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>The reviewer is concerned that contamination with non-clonal tissue could account for the high <italic>foxo</italic> mRNA levels. We don’t think that contamination is a major issue in our experiments. The most straightforward test for a contamination of the clonal tissues would be to measure the GFP expression levels (as suggested by the reviewer). Unfortunately, a direct comparison is not possible because, in order to maximize the number of biological replicates, we did not sequence GFP-positive clones. However, we compared the <italic>GFP</italic> expression levels in cells with and without <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown. As an example, the expression level in <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant clones isolated from normal feeding conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. As no major differences were observed, the contamination from GFP-positive cells, if any, is similar in all conditions. Additionally, representative images of isolated <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant clones with and without <italic>foxo</italic> knockdown are presented to support that the isolated cell populations were negative for GFP (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). This is further substantiated by the presence of 100% mutant transcripts (<italic>Tsc1<sup>Q87X</sup></italic> where <bold>C</bold>AG at position 3R:24,130,984 is substituted by <bold>T</bold>AG) in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant clones (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B).

Since the loss of Tsc1 does not disrupt ommatidial architecture (Nowak et al., 2018), the density of ommatidia reflects the cellular density in the adult eyes. This density remains unchanged between <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Tsc1 foxo</italic> knockdown eyes but is slightly reduced upon knockdown of <italic>CG6766</italic> and <italic>CG8860</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), indicating that at least a part of the enhanced overgrowth of the adult eyes is due to an increase in cell size. However, the small reduction in density (10% for <italic>CG6766</italic> and 7% for <italic>CG8860</italic>, respectively) cannot fully account for the observed overgrowth (Figure 2B, 23% average increase for <italic>CG6766</italic> knockdown and 11% average increase for <italic>CG8860</italic> knockdown). We therefore conclude that the overgrowth is in part caused by more cells.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53159-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the Discussion, we speculate about the mechanisms of how ER stress response pathways can regulate proliferation.
