Here, we developed an allele-specific gene-editing therapeutic drug to selectively target the human T17M <italic>RHO</italic> mutant allele while leaving the wild-type <italic>RHO</italic> allele intact for the first time. We identified a <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Cas9 (SaCas9) guide RNA that was highly active and specific to the human T17M <italic>RHO</italic> allele. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using HEK293T cells and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) demonstrated active nuclease activity and high specificity. Subretinal delivery of a single adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 packaging SaCas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to the retinas of the <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mice showed that this therapeutic drug targeted the mutant allele selectively, thereby downregulating the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> mRNA expression. Administration of this therapeutic drug resulted in a long-term (up to 11 months after treatment) improvement of retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in the heterozygous mutant humanized mice. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unwanted off-target effects were not observed at the whole-genome sequencing level. Our study provides strong support for the further development of this effective therapeutic drug to treat <italic>RHO</italic>-T17M-associated adRP, also offers a generalizable framework for developing gene-editing medicine. Furthermore, our success in restoring the vision loss in the suffering <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mice verifies the feasibility of allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based medicines for other autosomal dominant inherited retinal dystrophies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>retinitis pigmentosa</kwd><kwd>humanzied mice</kwd><kwd>iPSCs</kwd><kwd>adeno-associated virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Nonhuman primate</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19JCZDJC64000(Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The allele-specific gene-editing drug is expected to make <italic>RHO-</italic>T17M-associated retinitis pigmentosa therapy a reality.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP [MIM:268000]), a subtype of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs), is one of the most common causes of blindness in industrialized countries, with an incidence of 1 in 1000 in North China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). However, there are currently no reliable therapies available to cure or delay the disease progression of RP. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Luxturna, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy drug for <italic>RPE65</italic>-associated Leberâs Congenital Amaurosis (<italic>RPE65</italic>-LCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smalley, 2017</xref>), which marked the start of gene therapy for IRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in the human rhodopsin (<italic>RHO</italic>) gene are the most prominent genetic causes of autosomal dominant RP (adRP), accounting for about 30% of adRP cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iannaccone et al., 2006</xref>). However, different from the <italic>RPE65</italic>-LCA, which is caused by a loss-of-function mutation, <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP is mainly caused by a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendes et al., 2005</xref>), thereby restricting the application of gene replacement therapy.</p><p>Many studies have been conducted regarding the treatment technique for <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP, such as allele-independent gene ablation. This technique includes silencing the expression of both the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> allele and its wild-type (WT) counterpart and simultaneously adding an exogenous WT <italic>RHO</italic> gene beyond the regulation of the retina <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cideciyan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). Although these methods are applicable to <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP, many risks remain with the disruption of the WT allele. Recently, allele-specific methods have been used extensively to treat adRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). With the aim of allele-specific <italic>RHO</italic> gene downregulation at the RNA level using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), short hairpin RNA, or RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meng et al., 2020</xref>) can be achieved, some of which have been translated into clinical trials. However, repeated treatments, especially for subretinal injections, are bound to hamper therapeutic effectiveness. In comparison, allele-specific mutant DNA targeting approaches, specifically with the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ran et al., 2015</xref>), which leads to permanent DNA modification, may be more promising. In fact, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used extensively to treat adRP caused by <italic>RHO</italic>-P23H, S334ter, P347S mutations, <italic>etc</italic>. This resulted in the delay in photoreceptor degeneration and rescue of retinal function in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Latella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giannelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patrizi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakondi et al., 2016</xref>). However, these proof-of-concept studies are not suitable for direct translation into clinical practice. Therefore, there is currently no approved treatment for adRP.</p><p>The P23H mutation is the most common <italic>RHO</italic> mutation in North America, accounting for 10% of adRP cases due to a founder effect, while it has not been reported elsewhere, including Europe and Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). Data gathered from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) showed that some Chinese adRP patients carried <italic>RHO</italic>-T17M mutation. Several studies and data from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php">http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php</ext-link>) also prove that T17M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sheffield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krebs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rakoczy et al., 2011</xref>) is one of the most common <italic>RHO</italic> mutations.</p><p>Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that if the disease-causing allele has unique protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences that are not present in the WT allele, or when the mutations are within the spacer region of the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) target site, the disease-causing allele may be discriminated from its WT counterpart. Therefore, the aim of selectively inactivating the mutant allele while leaving the WT ones functionally intact can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giannelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patrizi et al., 2021</xref>). Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the primary mechanism for double-strand breaks in terminally differentiated rod cells, whereas homologous recombination commonly occurs in mitotic cells such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or HEK293T (293T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2011</xref><italic>).</italic> This difference in rod cells from mitotic cells emphasizes the significance and necessity of performing experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially in humanized animal models. Unfortunately, allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9 experiments have not been performed in humanized animal models.</p><p>Hence, we developed an allele-specific gene-editing therapy to selectively target the human T17M (c. 50C&gt;T) <italic>RHO</italic> mutant allele while leaving the WT <italic>RHO</italic> allele intact for the first time. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments using 293T cells and patient-specific iPSCs demonstrated high nuclease specificity. Furthermore, a human <italic>RHO</italic>-knock-in (<italic>RHO</italic> humanized) mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) generated previously can simulate pathological changes in <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP, the retinal degeneration might be caused by any one of the five variants (T17M, G51D, G114R, R135W, and P171R, <italic>RHO</italic>-5m). Using this mouse model, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated specific inactivation of the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> allele and a delay in photoreceptor degeneration for up to 11 months after treatment. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unwanted off-target effects were not observed. Thus, our study clearly provides strong evidence to support further development of this therapeutic drug for patients with <italic>RHO-</italic>T17M<italic>-</italic>adRP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of allele-specific sgRNAs for the <italic>RHO</italic>-T17M allele</title><p>Our objective was to delete the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> allele using an allele-specific sgRNA against mutational sites with NNGRR PAMs when using SaCas9, thereby tethering the SaCas9 protein to the mutant but not the WT allele. The mutant allele, including the T17M mutation, did not generate unique PAM sequences. Allele-specific sgRNAs for T17M were designed to be within the spacer region of the SaCas9/SgRNA target site.

Notably, RHO17 cells that were not transfected assayed with T7E1 nuclease only resulted in full-length amplicon (760 bp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, T7E1 assay for RHO<italic>wt</italic> cells transfected with 17-Sg1 or -Sg2 plasmid resulted in full-length amplicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We chose AAV2/8 as the vector for the drug development because of its superior infectivity to photoreceptor cells. As the first step, we tested if the shortend elongation factor alpha (EFS) promoter was an appropriate promoter to drive strong gene expression in the mouse retina using GFP as a reporter. We constructed AAV2/8-EFS-EGFP (AAV-EGFP) and subretinally injected it into both eyes of the WT (<italic>Rho<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic>) mice at either high (3Ã10<sup>9</sup> vg per eye, 1 Î¼L) or low (1Ã10<sup>9</sup> vg per eye, 1 Î¼L) dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Analysis of the treated retinas clearly showed its long-term therapeutic effect (up to 11 mpi) including retinal function improvement and photoreceptor preservation in the heterozygous mutant humanized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, there was no unwanted off-target activities observed. Thus, our study makes a significant step toward the development of an effective drug for <italic>RHO-</italic>adRP.</p><p>Compared with allele-specific gene-editing therapy, allele-independent gene ablation and replacement approaches are more cost-effective and efficient. However, there are potential risks with the gene ablation and replacement strategy. First, prior studies show that there is a fine balance between insufficiency and toxicity of rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewin et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in the rhodopsin level (either suppression of rhodopsin expression or overexpression) may alter the morphology of rod OS (ROS) and discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wen et al., 2009</xref><italic>).</italic> It is difficult for the ablation and replacement approach to strike such a balance <italic>in vivo</italic>. Second, previous studies have indicated that <italic>Rho<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice lose all of their rod photoreceptors extremely rapidly (approximately 3 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Humphries et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hobson et al., 2000</xref>), implying that disruption of both WT and mutant <italic>RHO</italic> alleles may aggravate the disease, when the exogenous augmentation of WT cannot rescue this disruption. Allele-specific silencing of mutant rhodopsin at the RNA or DNA levels can avoid the above problems. Although rhodopsin function is thought to be essential for the formation of ROS and phototransduction initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gunkel et al., 2015</xref>), heterozygous rhodopsin-knockout mice showed little retinal degeneration, indicating that one copy of this gene is sufficient for normal retinal development and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lem et al., 1999</xref>). In this respect, maximal therapeutic benefit is expected when the mutant allele is completely ablated, while the normal allele is functionally intact. However, many factors may affect therapeutic effects. For instance, ASO can deregulate mutant rhodopsin levels transcriptionally, but the degree to which the toxic protein must be reduced to eliminate any disease-causing effect is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun Wan, 2016</xref>). The presence of gain-of-function mutations and repeated subretinal injection may diminish the effectiveness of treatment. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing strategy in mammalian cells can provide a means to delete or correct disease-causing mutations while leaving the gene under the control of its endogenous regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnight et al., 2018</xref>), making this approach also promising for the treatment of inherited diseases.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing therapy is currently being advanced as the treatment of human IRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnight et al., 2018</xref>). A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2019</xref>, shows that one of the complexities of drug development for gene editing is that it is human genome-specific. Herein, we used human cells and the <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mice to demonstrate that SaCas9/17-Sg2 could reach efficient and allele-specific gene editing, thereby improving the retinal functions and delaying photoreceptor cells loss. We also proved that SaCas9/17-Sg2 did not result in off-target activity using WGS. <italic>In vitro</italic> patient-derived iPSCs generated in this study offered as an ideal research material to validate gene-editing specificity and cutting efficiency at the DNA level. Moreover, 3D retinal organoids or rod cell precursors derived from iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capowski et al., 2019</xref>) have the potential to be used to mimic disease phenotypes or for autologous transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assawachananont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nozie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos-Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>) after gene editing. However, we must emphasize that the transfection and gene-editing efficiency in iPSCs are evidently lower than those of some commonly used cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2014</xref>), which may be due to the significant cell death that probably results from an overwhelming cytosolic dsDNA-induced innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), implying that the on-target and off-target effects in iPSCs might be underestimated.</p><p>The first factor that may raise safety concerns for allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9 drug development is the specificity of SaCas9/SgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2019</xref>). This study demonstrated that SaCas9/17-Sg2 did not disrupt human WT <italic>RHO</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, a large number of allele-specific sgRNAs can be designed for disease-causing mutations in <italic>RHO</italic> (over 200 mutations, HGMD), such as the three sgRNAs for T17M. However, not all of them work well. A previous study proves theoretically and practically that the specificity of sgRNA depends on its seed sequence, which is a stretch of 8â14 nucleotide (nt) immediately upstream of the PAM. Even point mutations within the seed sequence can abolish cleavage by SpCas9 nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semenova et al., 2011</xref>), and spCas9 nuclease tolerates single-base mismatches in the PAM-distal region to a greater extent than in the PAM proximal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). Herein, the specificity of 17-Sg1 and -Sg2 are better than that of 17-Sg3, may due to the fact that the point mismatch (c.50C&gt;T) is within the seed sequence of 17-Sg1 and -Sg2 but not within that of 17-Sg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), showing that the targeting specificity of SaCas9/SgRNA is also dependent on the seed sequence. Previous studies have indicated that T17M rhodopsin proteins fail to fold correctly, are retained in the ER, and cannot easily reconstitute with 11-cis-retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnen et al., 2018</xref>). Our experiments in Hela cells and 293T cells indicates that rhodopsin protein with T17M and five variants are retained in cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Another factor which may raise safety concerns is that indels created by gene editing possibly result in new rhodopsin variants which may also exert toxic effect or dominant-negative on WT rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patrizi et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> analysis and detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments indicate that <italic>RHO</italic>-5m mRNA with these most frequent indels generated by gene editing near the N-terminal of <italic>RHO</italic> gene can be degraded due to the effect of NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Work conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2021</xref>, suggested that most of the truncated variants involving upstream of K296 are likely benign, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>, all frameshift indels created by AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 are upstream of K296, thereby the truncated products after gene editing are benign. Experiments in 293T cells show that this insertion can lead to NMD of the <italic>RHO</italic>-5m mRNA, consisting with the above theory. These results support the potential safety of gene editing of the N-terminal domain of rhodopsin. Additionally, the preclinical results in NHP further confirmed the safety of the gene-editing drug.</p><p>Currently, there are few available animal models compared to the number of known <italic>RHO</italic> mutations (over 200). Animals with human gene knock-in allow us to study and model disease, and permit testing of the therapeutic effect of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, without putting humans at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hosur et al., 2017</xref>). The shortage of humanized animal models may hamper the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies from animals toward patients. In the past, several <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mouse models were bred to express mutant human rhodopsin in a heterozygous knockout mouse rhodopsin (<italic>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) or WT background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lem et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsson et al., 1992</xref>) by introducing human <italic>RHO</italic> genomic fragments that encompassed the entire transcriptional unit as well as its upstream and downstream flanking sequences. In contrast, our humanized models are generated by replacing the mouse <italic>Rho</italic> gene with the human <italic>RHO</italic> gene, but not interrupting the flaking sequencing of this gene. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) and data from HGMD have reported that each of the five heterozygous mutations in <italic>RHO</italic> can cause adRP. Our study indicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) that the typical adRP phenotypes of Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice result from the <italic>RHO</italic>-5m allele, and the slow disease progression offers us the opportunity to observe therapeutic effects after treatment. Importantly, mice with different genotypes can be obtained from the intercross of these models according to our needs, thereby facilitating our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The humanized mouse models combined with our strategy to selectively target the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> allele faithfully demonstrate their application prospects as well.</p><p>Recently, AAV has been considered an ideal choice for therapeutic gene delivery in the retina and has been confirmed to be promising for the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El Refaey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Besides Luxturna, many gene therapy clinical trials based on AAVs are ongoing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>), indicating the feasibility and safety of AAVs. However, AAVs have a relatively small packaging capacity (~4.7 kb), which limits the size and number of sequences that can be incorporated into a single virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnight et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ran et al., 2015</xref>). To put all components into one AAV vector, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer promoter is replaced by the EFS promoter, and SaCas9, which is much smaller than SpCas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ran et al., 2015</xref>), is chosen and packed in an AAV vector with its sgRNA. As long as 9 mpi, no detectable toxic effects in mouse retinas are identified at three different doses when comparing the retinal structures of treated and untreated mice. Gene-editing efficiencies herein are dose-dependent, yet the specificity of AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 is not affected by increasing AAV dose. However, indel analysis by Sanger sequencing in mouse retinas after treatment showed that a 49 bp insertion from the AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequence occurs at the cut site at a dose of 3Ã10<sup>9</sup>. Previous studies confirm that the majority of AAV genome insertions consist of an ITR sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarrett et al., 2017</xref>), which might be due to the combined properties of AAV ITR and its interaction with NHEJ host-cell machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCullough et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young and Samulski, 2001</xref>). In this study, no AAV ITR insertions in treated retinas were detected in the 5Ã10<sup>8</sup> and 1Ã10<sup>9</sup> dose groups. We consider whether AAV dose will influence the possibility of insertions in question, and more research should be conducted to validate this hypothesis. At either DNA or RNA levels, the therapeutic effect in the retina at the 3Ã10<sup>9</sup> dose was better than that at the 1Ã10<sup>9</sup> dose. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>, at 3 mpi, the retinal functions of untreated WT and Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice were significantly better than that of SaCas9/17-Sg2- and SaCas9/CTRL-treated mice, while the remarkable long-term therapeutic effect in SaCas9/17-Sg2-treated mice was detected, implying that: (a) compared to NHP and human eyes, the eye volume of mouse is relatively small, subretinal injection which is an invasive operation will result in retinal detachment, certainly leading to a damage to retinal functions. However, as times go on, retinal detachment will recover, exerting less effect on the retinal functions, indicating that the long-term therapeutic effect of drug should be observed. (b) In preclinical experiments or even clinical trials, one variable between treated group and control group (gene-editing drug with 17-Sg2 or not) is essential, to ensure the statistical results reliable. For instance, between untreated Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice and treated ones, there were two variables: (a) subretinal injection, which is an invasive operation, (b) the gene-editing drug including AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 or not. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahfouz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>) have indicated that enzymatic specificity and activity strength are often highly dependent on reaction conditions, high enzyme concentration will amplify off-target activity, and one potential strategy for minimizing nonspecific cleavage is to limit the enzyme concentration. Therefore, the balance between therapeutic efficiency and AAV dose of subretinal injection <italic>in vivo</italic> must be weighted. Since approximately 10% of functional foveal cone photoreceptors are sufficient for near-normal visual acuity, researchers hypothesize that correction of the <italic>CEP290</italic> IVS26 mutation in at least 10% of foveal cones will lead to clinical benefit in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2019</xref>). The average cutting efficiencies in GFP+ retinas at 1Ã10<sup>9</sup> or 3Ã10<sup>9</sup> doses are more than 10%, and the long-term therapeutic effect in more treated mice should be evaluated to obtain more unbiased results.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of our allele-specific gene-editing therapy <italic>in vitro</italic> and in humanized mouse models, thereby offering a generalizable framework for the preclinical development of gene-editing medicine and future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Approval was obtained from the Peking University Health Science Center Ethics Committee for Experimental Animal Research (Research License LA20200473).

GFP+ and GFP- areas of the treated retinas were cut for further analysis, including gDNA, RNA, and protein isolation. At 92 dpi, NHP were sacrificed and their retinas were obtained. The gDNA was extracted from retinas or cells and isolated using a DNA isolation kit (DC102, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). RNA was extracted and isolated from retinas or cells using RNA isolation (RC101, Vazyme, Nanjing, China).

For T7EI analysis, 500 ng of purified PCR products (D2500, Gel Extraction Kit, OMEGA, USA) were denatured and reannealed in NEB buffer 2 (M0302S, NEB, USA): 95Â°C, 2 min; 95â85Â°C at â2Â°C/s; 85â25Â°C at â0.1Â°C/s. Upon reannealing, 10 U of T7EI (M0302S, NEB, USA) was added and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min. Afterward, the product was analyzed on 2.5% agarose gels using a Gel Doc imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA). The amplicons obtained previously were also subjected to clone sequencing for identification of on-target indels. This consisted of cloning the PCR products using the ZTOPO BLUNT/TA with the Zero Background cloning kit following the manufacturerâs instructions (ZC211-2, ZOMANBIO, Beijing, China). In addition, PCR products for targeted deep sequencing were prepared as described in the Hi-TOM Kit19 (Novogene, Beijing, China).

Your revised article has been evaluated by Lois Smith (Senior Editor) and Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The current study identified SaCas9 guide RNA that is highly active and specific to human T17M RHO allele, evidenced in HEK293T cells and iPSCs in vitro, as well as RHO humanized mice. This therapeutic approach was supported with solid in vitro data and showed long-term beneficial effects with improved retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in mutant humanized heterozygous mice. However, some of the key concerns raised in the previous review need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Editing efficiency in photoreceptors at cellular level in vivo. Please check the DNA or RNA of rods in situ, report the percentage of rods which were successfully edited by the vector.</p><p>2. Clarification of the choice of mouse mutants (RHO humanized mice instead of Rho-T17M mice). The authors need to include the following information regarding RHO humanized mice in the Introduction session: please change &quot;humanized mice&quot; to &quot;hRho-knock-in&quot;. Please include the following statement &quot;the retinal degeneration might be caused by any one of the five variants (T17M, G51D, G114R, R135W and P171R).&quot; Please discuss and refer to the literature if each of the five mutations is pathogenic in heterozygous status. Also please include the following reviewer comment &quot;as the five variants are in cis on one allele, gene editing on T17M alone would erase the effect of other four variants because such editing creates frameshift variants at the N-terminal region before the other four&quot;.</p><p>3. Please edit the language to tone down any overstatement. For example, in the sentence &quot;Humanized animals are revolutionizing our ability to study and model disease and permit testing of the therapeutic effect of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical in vivo systems without putting humans at risk&quot;, the authors may consider revising as &quot;Animals with human gene knock-in allow us to study and model disease and permit testing of the therapeutic effect of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical in vivo systems&quot;. The authors are encouraged to check through and edit the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84065.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are several concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1.

Presently, there are several websites (CHOPCHOP, Benchling, E-CRISP, etc.) which can be used to design sgRNA easily, herein, sgRNA were designed based on the Benchling website (https://www.benchling.com/). Every sgRNA design website will provide off-target data, these data will help us to evaluate the off-target sites of sgRNA. Herein, Off-target sites were obtained from the Benchlingâs CRISPR Tool. For more detailed assessment of off target, off-target sites were identified using the Cas-OFFinder online tool (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder), the detailed method is listed in ref. 1.

Knockdown efficiency in photoreceptors at the cellular level <italic>in vivo.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. Thanks to the fact that <italic>RHO</italic> gene expressed in rods specially in retina, the mutant human rhodopsin mRNA levels could be evaluated using sequencing. The aim of allele-specific gene-editing treatment was to attenuate or ablate the expression of the mutant allele. Herein, we then determined whether the indels created by SaCas9/17-Sg2 at the DNA level could result in decreased mRNA levels of the <italic>RHO</italic>-5m allele. AAV-EGFP and AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 (1:1 mixture) were co-delivered into both eyes of the <italic>Rho<sup>hum/m-hum</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Rho<sup>hum/m-hum</sup></italic> mouse, a humanized mouse model carried a human <italic>RHO</italic>-WT allele and <italic>RHO</italic>-5m allele. Truncated cleaved products treated with T7E1 nuclease were observed in treated <italic>Rho<sup>hum/m-hum</sup></italic> retinas (Figure 7). We also employed Hi-Tom sequencing, Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR products to compare the amount of mRNA transcripts of <italic>RHO</italic>-WT and <italic>RHO</italic>-5m in <italic>Rho<sup>hum/m-hum</sup></italic> retinas at 3 mpi. The results indicated that the percentage of WT transcripts was statistically higher in treated retinas than that in untreated retinas (67.47 % vs. 48.51% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) and 60.32 % vs. 42.66% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), respectively), and the mutant transcript was statistically lower in treated retinas than that in untreated retinas (32.53 % vs. 51.49% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) and 39.68 % vs. 57.34% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), respectively, Figure 7C-7D), indicating the mRNA expression of <italic>RHO</italic>-5m decreased by 36.82% after treatment (Hi-Tom sequencing).

Clarification of the choice of mouse mutants (RHO humanized mice instead of Rho-T17M mice).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p><p>1) Mutant <italic>RHO</italic> proteins cause disease via either a dominant negative or a toxic gain-of-function effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether can effectively treat human <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP by gene-editing knockout of the mutant protein. Humanized mice permitted permit testing of the therapeutic effect of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, without putting humans at risk. See Figure 5A and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C, there was 8 mismatches between 17-Sg2 and the corresponding mouse <italic>Rho</italic> sequence, if we want to design sgRNA to target human mutant <italic>RHO</italic> gDNA, humanized mice were needed.</p><p>2) Available <italic>RHO</italic> humanized models are few compared to the number of known <italic>RHO</italic> mutations (more than 200), but it is time-consuming and costly to build humanized mice for each mutation. We want to develop a humanized mouse model having several mutations simultaneously to investigate the therapeutic effect of CRISPR/Cas9 for <italic>RHO</italic>-mediated adRP in preclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> systems. These five mutations in the humanized mouse model occur in the same human <italic>RHO</italic> allele, our study indicated the majority of indels created by the activity of SaCas9/17-Sg2 around T17M DNA sequence in Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice could lead to attenuation or ablation of the <italic>RHO</italic>-5m allele. Thereby, before the gene-editing treatment experiments, we custom designed and generated the humanized mouse models.</p><p>3) Our previous study (ref. 2) demonstrated that the pattern of retinal degeneration caused by mutant human rhodopsin was a typical rod-cone decay, thereby Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice were affected with adRP, mimicking human adRP phenotypes. In conclusion, at DNA level, this mouse model could be used to analyze gene-editing efficiency, at RNA level, it could be used to analyze whether the mutant human rhodopsin was knocked down, and it could be employed to evaluate whether its adRP phenotypes were rescued after treatment.</p><p>ref. 2: Liu X, Jia R, Meng X, Li Y, Yang L.

Inclusion of two more controls (wild-type mice and untreated mutant mice).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We added these two control groups, see Figure 8âfigure supplement 1.

However, as times went on, retinal detachment would recover, exerting less effect on the retinal functions, indicating that the long-term therapeutic effect of drug should be observed. (b) In preclinical experiments or even clinical trials, one variable between treated group and control group (gene-editing drug with 17-Sg2 or not) was essential, to ensure the statistical results was reliable. For instance, between untreated Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice and treated ones, there were two variables: (a) subretinal injection, which is an invasive operation, (b) the gene-editing drug including AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 or not (the Discussion on Page 27-28 Line 555 to 568).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether can effectively treat human <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP by gene-editing knockout of the mutant protein. These five mutations in the humanized mouse model occur in the same human <italic>RHO</italic> allele, once the mutant allele around the T17M DNA sequence was cut by Cas9/sgRNA, the downstream sequence of the cut site would be abolished due the DNA NHEJ repair. Our results herein confirmed the above theory (Figure 6-7). Thatâs no doubt that our humanized models could be used gene-editing efficiency at DNA level. In addition, the previous study (ref. 5) has established a transgenic mouse that expresses both normal and mutant murine rhodopsin in rods, the mutant rhodopsin contains 3 amino acids substitutions (V20G, P23H and P27L) simultaneously and results in a slowly progressing rods and cones degeneration. The structural and functional defects of P23H mice closely mimic those in patients carrying the same mutation. Several previous studies (ref. 6-7) indicated that rhodopsin with T17M, P23H, etc. could result in late onset adRP in transgenic mouse models. Our previous study (ref. 2) demonstrated that the pattern of retinal degeneration caused by mutant human rhodopsin was a typical rod-cone decay, thereby Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice were affected with adRP, mimicking human adRP phenotypes. In conclusion, Mut-<italic>Rho<sup>wt/hum</sup></italic> mice can be used to evaluate the gene-editing efficiency, retinal functions improvement and photoreceptor preservation after gene-editing treatment. Administration of this therapeutic drug resulted in a long-term (up to 11 months after treatment) improvement of retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in the mutant humanized heterozygous mice. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect in vivo.</p><p>ref. 2: Liu X, Jia R, Meng X, Li Y, Yang L.

This therapeutic approach was supported with solid in vitro data and showed long-term beneficial effects with improved retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in mutant humanized heterozygous mice. However, some of the key concerns raised in the previous review need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Editing efficiency in photoreceptors at cellular level in vivo. Please check the DNA or RNA of rods in situ, report the percentage of rods which were successfully edited by the vector.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p><p>As we know, CRISPR/Cas9 system can lead to permanent DNA modification because of endonuclease properties of Cas9, thereby it is essential to calculate the gene-editing efficiency at DNA level. While the aim of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is to alter gene expression transcriptionally and translationally. Mutant <italic>RHO</italic> proteins cause disease via either a dominant negative or a toxic gain-of-function effect. So, it is ideal and promising to treat human <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP by gene-editing knockout of the mutant protein, thereby to increase WT and mutant <italic>RHO</italic> protein ratio. That is the core idea of this study.</p><p>1) Initially, to test the editing efficiency of rods at the cellular level <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tried to use Fluorescence activated Cell Sorting (FACS) technique to sort AAV-infected rods by labeling the cells with specific marker, then to calculate the gene editing efficiency. However, in practice, we have encountered a lot of problems, for instance, during FACS experiments, it was difficult to a) digest the entire retinal tissue into single cells, b) prevent excessive rods loss, and we could not obtain abundant gDNA from few sorted cells. Previously, several articles reported that under a fluorescent dissection microscope, GFP+ retinal areas which represented AAV-infected areas could be obtained (<italic>ref. 1~2</italic>). Herein, AAV-EGFP and AAV-SaCas9/17-Sg2 (1:1 mixture) were co-delivered into both eyes of the humanized mouse models. IF analysis indicated that GFP was expressed in the OS/IS and ONL of photoreceptor cells (Figure 4D, Figure 9A, Figure 9âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 9âfigure supplement 4), showing that SaCas9 and 17-Sg2 were also expressed in OS/IS and ONL, therefore, the gDNA of rods and cones in ONL would be edited.</p><p>Neural retina consists of nine layers as illustrated in ref.3. In this study, AAV infected in OS/IS and ONL mainly. Under a fluorescent dissection microscope, we flattened the neural retina (Figure 4C), the GFP+ areas were dissected and gene-editing efficiency in these areas were focused. While in fact, we collected all types of cells apart from rods and cones, including those cells without infection in other retinal layers. So, compared to the gene-editing efficiency in all types of cells (we calculated in this study), actual gene-editing efficiency in rods was expected to be higher.</p><p>2) As we said above, the aim of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is to alter gene expression transcriptionally and translationally. To treat <italic>RHO</italic>-adRP, it is promising and important to increase the WT RHO mRNA level and decrease the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> mRNA level. Thanks to the fact that <italic>RHO</italic> gene only expressed in rods both transcriptionally and translationally, its encoding protein rhodopsin is the marker of rods and embedded at high density in the membrane of the rods outer segment (ROS) disks. At DNA level, gene-editing could occur in all types of AAV-infected retinal cells, while at mRNA and protein level, <italic>RHO</italic> expression could be attenuated or ablated only in rods. Fortunately, Hi-Tom sequencing result of RT-PCR products indicated that the mRNA expression of <italic>RHO</italic>-5m decreased by 36.82% after treatment. That is the editing efficiency or in rods (the targeted cell type) in situ at mRNA level in vivo.</p><p>3) Our previous study (ref. 4) reported that the mouse <italic>Rho</italic> gene contains 5 exons and shares a high homology at coding sequence (88.3% homology, Supplementary Figure S1) and amino acids sequence (94.8% homology, Supplementary Figure S2) with human <italic>RHO</italic> gene. That is a prerequisite for successful construction of our humanized mice (ref. 4).</p><p>Previously, we tried to use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique to discriminate mouse and human <italic>RHO</italic> gene, or WT and mutant <italic>RHO</italic> gene after treatment. However, we could not obtain any appropriate probe due to their high homology at coding sequence. Most importantly, if the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> gene was not edited (control groups), the rods would die ultimately, the <italic>RHO</italic> expression would decrease, while the <italic>RHO</italic> expression decreased due to allele-specific gene-editing (SaCas9/17-Sg2-treated-groups, Figure 7C-E). Such decreased expression cannot be detected by FISH or WB, so the difference of gene ablation expression in control and treated groups cannot be counted effectively. Fortunately, Sequencing of RT-PCR products could help us to reach this target. And a previous reference (ref. 1) also used RT-PCR product sequencing to evaluate the mutant and WT RHO allele ratio after allele-specific gene-editing therapy.</p><p>4) Presently, commercial primary antibodies for rhodopsin are 4D2 antibody (antibody recognizing N-terminal of rhodopsin protein) and 1D4 antibody (antibody recognizing C-terminal nine amino acids of rhodopsin). However, both cannot discriminate mouse and human rhodopsin due to the high homology at amino acids sequence (94.8% homology). Our previous study (ref. 4) showed that in mutant humanized mice, mutant rhodopsin localized to RIS and cell bodies while WT rhodopsin should correctly be trafficked to ROS. The aim of allele-specific gene-editing treatment was to attenuate or ablate the expression of the mutant <italic>RHO</italic>. âAs showed in Figure 9âfigure supplement 1A and C, compared to CTRL groups, mutant rhodopsin in RIS and rods bodies (4D2, red) decreased significantly in SaCas9/17-Sg2-treated mouse retinas, indicating the mutant rhodopsin was ablated in rods (the targeted cell type), similar results were also detected at 9 mpi and 11 mpi (Figure 9âfigure supplement 3)â.
