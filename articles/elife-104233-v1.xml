The reassembly of a nucleus after mitosis requires the reformation of the nuclear envelope around a single mass of chromosomes. This process requires Ankle2 (also known as LEM4 in humans) which interacts with PP2A and promotes the function of the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF). Upon dephosphorylation, BAF dimers cross-bridge chromosomes and bind lamins and transmembrane proteins of the reassembling nuclear envelope. How Ankle2 functions in mitosis is incompletely understood. Using a combination of approaches in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, along with structural modeling, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, explaining how it promotes BAF dephosphorylation. In addition, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein Vap33, which is required for Ankle2 localization at the reassembling nuclear envelope during telophase. We identified the interaction sites of PP2A and Vap33 on Ankle2. Through genetic rescue experiments, we show that the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for the function of Ankle2 in nuclear reassembly and that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction also promotes this process. Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is not merely a source of membranes in the process, but also provides localized enzymatic activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>ankle2</kwd><kwd>BAF</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Archambault</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jingjing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>288558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmeing</surname><given-names>T Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ankle2 functions as a regulatory subunit of PP2A and interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein Vap33 to promote the dephosphorylation of BAF as part of nuclear reassembly after mitosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In animal cells, the disassembly of the nucleus during mitosis allows the segregation of the genetic material via the spindle apparatus, composed of cytoplasmic microtubules and centrosomes. However, this process of open mitosis complicates the transition from mitosis to interphase, as a new nucleus must reassemble around each set of segregated chromosomes. The mechanisms of nuclear reassembly after mitosis remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hampoelz and Baumbach, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kono and Shimi, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double membrane that is topologically continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>). The NE is associated with multiple structural proteins that connect it to chromatin and cytoskeleton. Lamins form a semi-rigid cage-like network between chromatin and the inner nuclear membrane while the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) interacts with DNA, Lamins, and transmembrane LEM-Domain proteins within the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sears and Roux, 2020</xref>). Nuclear pore complexes composed of multiple nucleoporins ensure transport across the NE and also interact with structural cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petrovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shevelyov, 2023</xref>). In addition, the LINC complex spans the entire NE to connect chromatin to the cytoskeleton and relay mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hieda, 2019</xref>). During mitotic entry, the phosphorylation of many of these proteins disrupts their interactions, resulting in nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>). BAF is phosphorylated by Vaccinia-Related Kinases (VRKs, NHK-1/Ballchen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) at its N-terminus, which impedes its binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lancaster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, CDK1, PKC, and PLK1 phosphorylate Lamins A/C and B, disrupting their polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu and Ikegami, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Velez-Aguilera et al., 2020</xref>). As a result of NEB, NE membranes retract into the ER during mitosis.</p><p>Correct reassembly of the nucleus after mitosis is critical for cell viability and physiology. During this process, segregated chromosomes gather together and ER membranes are recruited around chromosomes to rebuild the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>). Failure to group chromosomes into a single nucleus results in micronuclei that are prone to rupture and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). The timely reformation of the nuclear envelope is essential for reestablishing nucleocytoplasmic transport that is needed for the entire gene and protein expression process, including transcription, mRNA export, and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberts et al., 2015</xref>). Protein Phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2 A (PP2A) dephosphorylate several proteins to promote their interactions and reassociation with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huguet et al., 2019</xref>). How the activities of the enzymes are coordinated in time and space is incompletely understood.</p><p>BAF plays a central role in nuclear reassembly. It forms a dimer that binds DNA after anaphase, thereby cross-linking chromosomes into a single cohesive mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). BAF also promotes the recruitment of ER membranes through its interactions with LEM-Domain proteins, and aids in the reassembly of the Lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haraguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). The dephosphorylation of BAF is required for its recruitment to segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sears and Roux, 2020</xref>). The B55 regulatory subunit of PP2A promotes this regulation in various animals, including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens,</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the PP2A-interacting, ER-localized protein Ankle2 (also known as LEM4 and LEM-4L in humans and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, respectively) is also required for the recruitment of BAF to segregated chromosomes in the same three organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, Ankle2/LEM4 contains Ankyrin repeats, a LEM domain, a transmembrane domain, and other predicted structured and unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which Ankle2 functions in nuclear reassembly are unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>ANKLE2</italic> function is crucial for the development of the central nervous system as mutations in this gene are associated with microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). Targeting of Ankle2 by the Zika virus also causes microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Ankle2 is required for asymmetric divisions in larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Link et al., 2019</xref>). While Ankle2 impacts the asymmetric division protein machinery, it remains unclear whether the loss of its function in nuclear reassembly also contributes to microcephaly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ankle2 interacts with Protein Phosphatases 2A (PP2A) through its Ankyrin repeats region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ankle2 functions with PP2A to allow the dephosphorylation of Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) and its recruitment to segregated chromosomes.

We found that Ankle2 forms a complex with the PP2A structural and catalytic subunits, in a mutually exclusive manner with other known regulatory subunits. Our phosphoproteomic analysis validates that BAF dephosphorylation depends on Ankle2. We also identified and characterized a novel interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, a VAP family protein that promotes Ankle2 localization to the ER during both nuclear reassembly and interphase. We show that the interactions of Ankle2 with PP2A and Vap33 promote BAF recruitment to chromosomes after anaphase. Moreover, the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and development in vivo. We propose that Ankle2 functions as a novel PP2A regulatory subunit required for BAF dephosphorylation, and that Vap33-dependent anchoring of Ankle2 to the ER promotes this function in a localized manner during post-mitotic nuclear reassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ankle2 interacts with PP2A through its Ankyrin domain</title><p>To investigate the molecular functions of Ankle2, we sought to identify its interaction partners. First, we generated D-Mel (D.mel2) stable cell lines expressing GFP-fused Ankle2 (N or C terminal). We performed GFP affinity purifications on the lysate of these cells and identified co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry. Cells expressing Flag-GFP were used as controls. We found that PP2A-29B (PP2A-A, structural) and Microtubule Star (Mts, PP2A-C, catalytic) were specifically co-purified with both GFP-Ankle2 and Ankle2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). To test if this association occurs in vivo, we generated transgenic flies for the expression and purification of Ankle2-GFP in early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The maternal driver matα4-GAL-VP16 was used to activate the expression of UASp-Ankle2-GFP in late oocytes and syncytial embryos. Embryos expressing GFP alone were used as controls. Again, we found PP2A-29B and Mts specifically co-purified with Ankle2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Reciprocally, endogenous Ankle2 was co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP from cells in culture and embryos, along with the regulatory subunits Tws, Wdb, and Wrd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). Thus, the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A is conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To map the region of Ankle2 that binds PP2A, we used a GST pulldown assay. We produced GST-fused fragments of Ankle2 covering its entire sequence in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tested their ability to pulldown PP2A-29B (with GFP-fused to either end) and Mts from D-Mel cells. We initially found that a fragment comprising amino acid (a.a.) residues 275–450 was sufficient to strongly associate with PP2A-29B and Mts, while fragments 1–274, 451–909, or 910–1174 showed no or very weak association with these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). The 275–450 region comprises most of the Ankyrin domain. This domain was recently proposed to span a.a. residues 229–399 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>), and our inspection of a structural model generated by AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>) suggested a.a. residues 227–400. We found that the Ankyrin domain (a.a. 227–400 tested) was sufficient for association with PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To test if the Ankyrin domain region is required for the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A, we used a co-purification assay in D-Mel cells. Ankle2-GFP WT or with a deletion of the Ankyrin domain were purified and the presence of co-purified PP2A-29B-Myc and Mts was probed by western blot. In this assay, we deleted a region comprising the predicted Ankyrin domain plus a few additional downstream residues showing conservation with human Ankle2 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lem-4L; (ΔANK: residues 232–415 deleted; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We found that PP2A-29B-Myc and Mts were co-purified with Ankle2<sup>WT</sup>-GFP but not with Ankle2<sup>ΔΑΝΚ</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

To identify sites that become hyperphosphorylated in the absence of Ankle2 at a proteome-wide level, we used a phosphoproteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emond-Fraser et al., 2023</xref>). We transfected D-Mel cells with dsRNA against Ankle2 or dsRNA Non-Target (NT). Four days later, cells were lysed, proteins were digested with trypsin, and phosphopeptides were enriched, and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Among hyperphosphorylated peptides upon Ankle2 depletion, we found the expected BAF peptide phosphorylated at Thr4 and Ser5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Phosphorylation at the orthologous sites in human BAF was shown to negatively regulate its ability to interact with DNA, and possibly with LEM-Domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>). Our observation of these Ankle2-dependent sites in BAF validates our approach since BAF is the only reported protein whose phosphorylation state depends on Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, BAF could be the only obligatory substrate of Ankle2-dependent dephosphorylation for cell proliferation as lowering the dose of the BAF kinase NHK-1/Ballchen or expression of an unphosphorylatable mutant form of BAF rescues wing development defects caused by the partial depletion of Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>).

Interestingly, the structural (PP2A-29B) and catalytic (Mts) subunits of PP2A were detected in complex with Ankle2, while none of the known regulatory subunits of PP2A were detected (Tws, Wdb, Wrd, or PR72) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). To test if Ankle2 interacts with PP2A as a regulatory subunit, we used a competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We co-transfected cells with Ankle2-Myc and PP2A-29B-GFP or FLAG-GFP. We then proceeded to GFP affinity purifications. As expected, Ankle2-Myc was co-purified specifically with PP2A-29B-GFP. The PP2A regulatory subunit Tws was also co-purified specifically with PP2A-29B-GFP. To test if Tws and Ankle2 are mutually exclusive in the PP2A complex, we co-transfected increasing amounts of Myc-Tws plasmid along with Ankle2-Myc and PP2A-29B-GFP. As a result, increasing amounts of Myc-Tws were co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP. Conversely, decreasing amounts of Ankle2-Myc were co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP as the amount of Myc-Tws increased. These results suggest that Tws competes with Ankle2 for binding within the PP2A holoenzyme and reinforce the idea that Ankle2 functions as a <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory subunit of PP2A.</p><p>To contextualize and interpret our results, we generated structural predictions of relevant co-complexes using AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>). In models of a complex of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2, PP2A-29B, and Mts, the Ankyrin domain consistently directly interacts with Mts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows a representative model), consistent with our pulldown results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, these models also predict that additional regions of Ankle2 engage in interactions with PP2A. A region previously referred to as the Caulimovirus Domain (CD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and proposed to mediate an interaction between human Ankle2 and PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>) is indeed predicted to interact with Mts in our models, on the other side from where the Ankyrin domain binds. Moreover, the modeling shows an adjacent uncharacterized domain (UNC) that is in direct contact with PP2A-29B. However, no interaction with Mts or PP2A-29B was experimentally detected for our GST-fused fragments comprising these regions alone in pulldown assays. It is possible that the UNC and CD domains interact with the PP2A subunits with low affinity. It is also possible that the fragment tested requires additional components to fold into a form that is competent for PP2A binding; in particular, AlphaFold3 predictions show that the complete UNC domain may be made of several segments distal in primary sequence (a.a. residues ~401–467 + 601–682 + 987–1050). In any case, the deletion of the Ankyrin domain of Ankle2 strongly abrogated its formation of a complex with Mts and PP2A-29B, indicating that it plays a predominant role in the formation of the complex. Importantly, these models display Ankle2 occupying an overlapping position to that of Tws in an analogous PP2A-Tws model which itself consistent with a crystal structure of human PP2A-B55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). These models account for the mutually exclusive binding of Ankle2 or Tws to the PP2A-29B/Mts complex, and are consistent with the function of Ankle2 as a regulatory subunit of PP2A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ankle2 interacts with Vap33 and they colocalize at the endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>Besides PP2A, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with Vap33, an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a member of the VAP family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Mass spectrometry data suggested that Vap33 was co-purified at the highest levels among Ankle2 interactors. Ankle2 was previously reported to localize at the ER and the NE in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Link et al., 2019</xref>). We found that Ankle2-RFP co-localizes with GFP-Vap33 in D-Mel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This co-localization is clearest during mitosis, where both proteins are enriched around the presumed spindle in metaphase and around segregated chromosomes in late anaphase/telophase, when NE reassembly takes place. To examine the localization of Ankle2 relative to Vap33 in vivo, we generated transgenic flies for the inducible expression of Ankle2-GFP and RFP-Vap33. We expressed the fusion proteins in syncytial embryos and studied their localization. We found that both proteins co-localized throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In interphase, they localized to the NE and ER membranes. During mitosis, Ankle2-GFP and RFP-Vap33 became enriched on the spindle envelope until they wrapped around newly forming nuclei in telophase. In addition, both proteins were also enriched at the midbody of the central spindle, consistent with the recruitment of ER membranes at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobinnec et al., 2003</xref>). We were unable to examine the localization of endogenous Ankle2 because the antibodies that we generated failed to reliably detect Ankle2 in immunofluorescence. For the remainder of our study, we used overexpressed Ankle2-GFP, which may not perfectly reflect the localization and function of endogenous Ankle2. However, Ankle2-GFP is functional as it can rescue the phenotypes observed when endogenous Ankle2 is depleted (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ankle2 co-localizes with Vap33.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Video images of a D-Mel cell co-expressing Ankle2-RFP and GFP-Vap33 through different stages of cell division.

We found that endogenous Ankle2 was specifically co-purified with GFP-Vap33 or Vap33-GFP from D-Mel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To identify the region of Ankle2 responsible for its interaction with Vap33, we used the GST pulldown described above, probing for the interaction of Vap33-Myc with GST-fused fragments of Ankle2. We found that the C-terminal region of Ankle2 (residues 910–1174) is sufficient to interact with Vap33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The VAP family of proteins is anchored to the ER via a transmembrane domain and exposes a globular MSP domain to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamemura and Chihara, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murphy and Levine, 2016</xref>). The MSP domain interacts with proteins that contain FFAT motifs (2 phenylalanines in an acidic tract) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>). To test if the Vap33 interacts with Ankle2 in this manner, we introduced mutations in the MSP of Vap33 domain predicted to disrupt its ability to bind FFAT motifs based on results with human VAP (K89D, M91D in Vap33) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaiser et al., 2005</xref>). We found that this mutant form of Vap33-Myc was unable to interact with GST-Ankle2<sup>910-1174</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then searched for FFAT motifs in Ankle2 using published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Slee and Levine, 2019</xref>) and identified three candidate motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). One of them was a particularly good fit. Mutation of this FFAT motif (Fm) abolished the interaction of the Ankle2 C-terminal fragment with Vap33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). To test if the interaction occurs in the same way between proteins expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we used a co-purification assay. We transfected different forms of Ankle2-GFP along with Vap33-Myc and proceeded to GFP affinity purifications followed by western blot for Myc. In this assay, mutation of the first FFAT motif in Ankle2 diminished but did not abolish its interaction with Vap33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We, therefore, tested the contributions of two other additional FFAT-like motifs (FL1 and FL2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Mutation of FL1 (FL1m) also diminished but did not abolish the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, while mutation of FL2 (FL2m) did not perturb the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction. Finally, we found that the combined mutation of the FFAT and FL1 motifs in Ankle2 (Fm +FL1 m) abolished its interaction with Vap33. Thus, we conclude that Vap33, via its MSP domain, can interact with Ankle2 through two redundant FFAT motifs. Interestingly, subsequent modeling using AlphaFold3 predicted that Vap33 interacts with Ankle2 preferentially through a contact between the MSP domain of Vap33 and the FL1 motif of Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ankle2 interacts with Vap33 through FFAT motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were transfected with the indicated proteins and used in GFP affinity purifications.

Nevertheless, we attempted to knock down Vap33 by RNAi in the female germline to examine the effects on Ankle2-GFP localization in embryos. Unsurprisingly, we found that those females were sterile and, therefore, we could not examine embryos. However, we examined ovaries. In control flies, we observed that Ankle2-GFP was weakly localized to nuclear envelopes and strongly localized to the plasma membrane and to ring canals in nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, in Vap33 RNAi ovaries, we found that Ankle2-GFP was largely delocalized from these structures. Whether distinct pools of Ankle2 serve specific functions is a question that remains open. Nevertheless, these results suggested that the localization of Ankle2 depends on Vap33.</p><p>To test if Ankle2 requires its interaction with Vap33 for its localization, we generated transgenic flies for the expression of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP. We then examined its localization in embryos co-expressing RFP-Vap33.

Surprisingly, as nuclei entered mitosis, Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP became strongly localized to the nuclear/spindle envelope, similarly to Ankle2-GFP. However, while Ankle2-GFP was retained at those membranous structures in telophase, Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP disappeared from them, returning to a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization. We conclude that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33 is required for the localization of Ankle2 to the ER in interphase, and for its retention at membranes during NE reassembly in telophase.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-104233-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP and RFP-Vap33 during the cell cycle in a syncytial embryo.</title><p>A single plane is shown.

In this way, PP2A could dephosphorylate BAF (and potentially other substrates) locally to promote its recruitment near the reforming NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For this model to be valid, Ankle2 should be able to interact with Vap33 and PP2A simultaneously. We used AlphaFold3 to generate structural models of a complex between Vap33, Ankle2, PP2A-29B, and Mts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The most probable models show that Ankle2 can simultaneously interact with Vap33, PP2A-29B and Mts without steric clash. Our attempts to detect a complex containing Vap33 and PP2A by simple co-IP and Westerns in D-Mel cells gave variable and inconclusive results. However, we detected Vap33 in complex with PP2A-29B-GFP purified from embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), despite the fact that PP2A-29B-GFP did not appear clearly enriched at the nuclear/spindle envelope in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To test if we could promote the formation of the complex, we overexpressed Ankle2-RFP in cells expressing PP2A-29B-GFP and Vap33-Myc. We found that more Vap33-Myc was co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP under these conditions, compared with cells without Ankle2-RFP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This co-purification reflected the specific interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33-Myc because it was abrogated with Vap33<sup>DD</sup>-Myc. Consistent with this result, we found that PP2A-29B-GFP became visibly enriched at the NE upon overexpression of Ankle2-RFP in D-Mel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results suggest that a Vap33-Ankle2-PP2A complex can mediate the recruitment of a pool of PP2A at the NE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Requirements of Ankle2 interactions and motifs for nuclear reassembly</title><p>To test the requirements of Ankle2 for its functions in mitosis, we used a rescue assay in D-Mel cells in culture. We depleted endogenous Ankle2 by RNAi and expressed different forms of RNAi-insensitive Ankle2-GFP under the copper-inducible metallothionein promotor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Depletion of Ankle2 alone resulted in nuclear defects including dispersed or aggregated Lamin, fragmented nuclei, DNA devoid of Lamin, and hypercondensed DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). We previously documented these cellular phenotypes, which we showed to occur as a result of defective BAF recruitment to chromosomes and BAF-dependent nuclear reassembly after mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, western blotting using Phos-tag revealed that BAF became hyperphosphorylated upon Ankle2 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>). We verified that the expression of Ankle2-GFP rescued the nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). When examining cellular phenotypes, we scored only GFP-positive cells. The incomplete restoration of unphosphorylated BAF levels upon expression of Ankle2-GFP (WT and Fm +FL1 m) in Ankle2-depleted cells is likely due to the inefficient expression of the GFP-tagged protein in a fraction of the cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ankle2 interaction with Protein Phosphatases 2A (PP2A) but not with Vap33 is required for nuclear reassembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNAi depletion of endogenous Ankle2 and simultaneous expression of RNAi-insensitive Ankle2-GFP.

We found that both truncated proteins were unable to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that each half of Ankle2 contains at least one essential region for its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The N-terminal half of Ankle2 contains the Ankyrin domain region necessary and sufficient for Ankle2 interaction with PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP was unable to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). These results indicate that the Ankyrin domain is required for the essential function of Ankle2 in BAF dephosphorylation and nuclear reassembly, and suggest that the ability of Ankle2 to interact with PP2A is necessary for this function.</p><p>To map more precisely the C-terminal region(s) of Ankle2 required for its function, we made smaller truncations and deletions in Ankle2-GFP, guided in part by sequence conservation between species. We found that deletion of a.a. residues 607–680, 681–937, 938–997, 992–1040, or 1041–1174 partially or completely abrogated the ability of Ankle2-GFP to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). The 938–997 segment of Ankle2 contains the FFAT motifs required for the interaction with Vap33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, we found that the expression of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP rescued nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, while it is required for Ankle2 localization to the reassembling NE in embryos, is dispensable for Ankle2 function in BAF dephosphorylation and nuclear reassembly in D-Mel cells in culture.</p><p>Disruption of the interaction with Vap33 prevented the localization of Ankle2 at the ER and the reassembling of NE in telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>); however, it did not abolish the localization of Ankle2 at the nuclear/spindle envelope at the early stages of mitosis. We looked for another motif that could contribute to the membrane localization of Ankle2. Human Ankle2 contains a predicted trans-membrane (TM) domain in its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>). Although online prediction tools failed to predict a TM domain in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2, we noticed a highly hydrophobic segment in its N-terminus (a.a. 14–31). To test if it contributes to the membrane localization of Ankle2, we combined a deletion of the N-terminal 50 a.a. residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) with the FFAT mutations. The resulting Ankle2<sup>51-1174&amp;Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP was recruited to the NE during prophase, similarly to Ankle2-GFP and Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Ankle2<sup>51-1174&amp;Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP also largely rescued nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation, although less efficiently than Ankle2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among various truncated and deleted forms of Ankle2-GFP, only those that lacked C-terminal a.a. residues 938–1174 (Ankle2-GFP 1–587, 1–692 and 1–937) failed to be recruited to the NE during prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This region comprises the 3 candidate FFAT motifs identified. These results suggest that Ankle2 relies on its C-terminus for its NE recruitment during prophase, although the FFAT motifs are not strictly required for this recruitment. We do not know how Ankle2 localizes to the nuclear/spindle envelope independently from Vap33 during the early stages of mitosis, or the importance of this localization.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that in addition to its N-terminal PP2A-interacting Ankyrin domain, Ankle2 requires the integrity of its C-terminal portion for its essential function in nuclear reassembly. The C-terminus of Ankle2 mediates its interaction with Vap33, which is crucial for the localization of Ankle2 to the reassembling of NE in telophase. However, our results suggest that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction is not strictly required for Ankle2’s function in D-Mel cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Interactions of Ankle2 with PP2A and Vap33 promote BAF recruitment to chromosomes during nuclear reassembly</title><p>To test the requirements of Ankle2 interactions in vivo, we expressed Ankle2-GFP transgenes in the female germline and early embryos and simultaneously knocked down endogenous Ankle2 using the maternal matα4-GAL-VP16 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the expression of Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup> -GFP resulted in no rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A but not with Vap33 is essential for its function during cell proliferation in imaginal wing discs.

BAF has emerged as a central player required for connections between chromosomes in telophase, for the adhesion of membranes to chromatin through LEM-Domain proteins, and for lamina reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haraguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). The recruitment of BAF hinges on its dephosphorylation by PP2A, a process dependent on Ankle2 in various animal species including humans, flies, and roundworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). Our study leveraged <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to elucidate how Ankle2 functions in this process.</p><p>Here, we provide several lines of evidence suggesting that Ankle2 functions as a regulatory subunit of PP2A. We found that Ankle2 uses its Ankyrin domain to interact with PP2A. Ankyrin repeats are known to mediate protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>). AlphaFold3 predicts an interaction of this domain with PP2A that would position Ankle2 as a regulatory subunit. Indeed, the presence of Ankle2 in the PP2A complex would be mutually exclusive with the presence of known regulatory subunits including B55 (Tws in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and B56, a hypothesis further supported by our results showing that Tws competes with Ankle2 for binding to PP2A. In addition, Ankle2 co-purified PP2A-29B and Mts without any known PP2A regulatory subunits. Previous work indicated that human Ankle2 uses a similar region to interact with PP2A, comprising part of the Ankyrin domain and a segment immediately preceding it, termed the Caulimovirus Domain (CD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). Although the latter region is poorly conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, our modeling suggests that it may participate in the formation of the PP2A-Ankle2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Experimental structural determination of the PP2A-Ankle2 is required to reveal the detailed structure of the complex.</p><p>Our unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed that BAF dephosphorylation depends on Ankle2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>). While this dependence has not been directly tested in human cells, BAF recruitment to segregated chromosomes after anaphase, which is known to require BAF dephosphorylation, requires Ankle2 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sears and Roux, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). A LEM domain in human Ankle2 mediates an interaction with BAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, we did not detect an interaction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2 and BAF, consistent with the absence of a LEM domain in the former, as for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, while human Ankle2 was shown to bind and inhibit the BAF counteracting kinase VRK1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>), we detected no interaction between Ankle2 and NHK-1/Ballchen (VRK1 ortholog) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While a putative interaction between Ankle2 and NHK-1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could occur transiently, thereby escaping detection, the simplest interpretation of our results is that the loss of Ankle2 causes BAF hyperphosphorylation by preventing its PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation rather than by preventing inhibition of NHK-1. Our previous genetic analysis in the developing wing suggests that BAF is the most critical substrate of PP2A-Ankle2 during cell proliferation. Indeed, wing developmental defects upon Ankle2 depletion are rescued by lowering the dose of NHK-1 or by expressing an unphosphorylatable mutant form of BAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Ankle2 may enable PP2A to dephosphorylate BAF through a transient interaction independently from the LEM domain and/or by targeting PP2A to a subcellular location that is favorable to the reaction (discussed below). Interestingly, we identified several additional potential substrates of PP2A-Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We were so far unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the PP2A-Ankle2 complex to conduct robust in vitro phosphatase assays with phosphorylated BAF or other candidate substrates.</p><p>We also discovered a novel interaction between Ankle2 and the ER protein Vap33. We show that FFAT motifs in Ankle2 interact with the MSP domain of Vap33. This interaction is required for the localization of Ankle2 to the reassembling NE in telophase, and to the NE and ER in interphase. The recent identification of putative FFAT motifs in human Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neefjes and Cabukusta, 2021</xref>) suggests that the interaction between Ankle2 and VAP family proteins of the ER may be conserved.</p><p>These findings led us to propose a model where Vap33 targets the PP2A-Ankle2 holoenzyme to ER membranes, promoting BAF dephosphorylation and recruitment in a localized manner during nuclear reassembly. Supporting this model, we detected a complex comprising Vap33, Ankle2, PP2A-29B, and Mts. Our results using cells in culture, embryos and developing wings strongly suggest that the Ankle2-PP2A interaction is essential for BAF dephosphorylation and recruitment to nascent nuclei in telophase, as well as for nuclear reassembly and animal development. However, it remains formally possible that the deletion of Ankyrin repeats used to disrupt the Ankle2-PP2A interaction abrogated another, unknown aspect of Ankle2 function. Similarly, we found that the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction, while being less critical, also promotes BAF recruitment during nuclear reassembly in embryos. Conceptually, the novel mechanism we propose implies that the ER is more than a passive source of membranes in nuclear reassembly; it implicates the ER as a carrier of localized enzymatic activity needed for the process.</p><p>Future work should examine the functions of other protein interactions and potential substrates of PP2A-Ankle2 that we identified, which could implicate this holoenzyme in the regulation of various cellular processes. Particularly intriguing are the interactions we identified between Ankle2 and Cyclin-CDK subunits. The possibility that Ankle2, while functioning as a PP2A subunit, may also impact Cyclin-CDK functions warrants further investigation. Conversely, Cyclin-CDKs may also contribute to the regulation of PP2A-Ankle2 in the cell cycle, an area that remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and mutagenesis</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> cells expression vectors were generated using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen).

After conditioning with 1 mL of 100% ACN/0.1% TFA and washing with 0.1% TFA in water, the sample was loaded, washed with 0.1% TFA in water, then eluted with 1 mL of 70% ACN (0.1% TFA) prior to evaporation on a SpeedVac. The extracted peptide samples were dried down and solubilized in 5% ACN-0.2% FA. The samples were loaded on an Optimize Technologies C<sub>4</sub> precolumn (0.3 mm i.d. by 5 mm) connected directly to the switching valve. They were separated on a home-made reversed-phase column (150 μm i.d. by 150 mm Phenomenex Jupiter C18 stationary phase) with a 120 min gradient from 10 to 30% ACN-0.2% FA and a 600 nL/min flow rate on an Easy nLC-1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) connected to an Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Each full MS spectrum was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and followed by tandem-MS (MS-MS) spectra acquisition for 3 s on the most abundant multiply charged precursor ions. Tandem-MS experiments were performed using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy of 27%. The data were processed using PEAKS X Pro (Bioinformatics Solutions, Waterloo, ON) and a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> unreviewed Uniprot database. Mass tolerances on precursor and fragment ions were 10 ppm and 0.01 Da, respectively. Variable selected posttranslational modifications were carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), acetyl (N-term), and phosphorylation (STY). The data were visualized with Scaffold 5.0 (protein threshold, 99%, with at least two peptides identified and a false-discovery rate [FDR] of 1% for peptides).</p><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD059738 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6019/PXD059738">https://doi.org/10.6019/PXD059738</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting and immunofluorescence</title><p>Protein lysates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% of milk solution for 1 hr to prevent non-specific binding. Subsequently, the membrane was probed with primary antibodies for 3 hr at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-GFP from rabbit (1:5000, Torrey Pine Biolabs), anti-Myc 9E10 from mouse (1:2000, #sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2 from mouse (1:2000, #F1804, Sigma), anti-tubulin DM1A from mouse (1:5000, #T6199, Sigma), anti-Ankle2 from rabbit (1:1000, custom-made by Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Mts from mouse (1:1000, #610555, BD Biosciences), anti-Tws from rabbit (1:2000, custom-made by Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 3 washes of 10 min with PBS containing 0,1% Tween (PBST, 0,1%), the membrane was probed with a secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse from goat (1:5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. The membrane being washed 3 times in PBST, 0,1% was then incubated with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (# 170–5061, Bio-Rad) and subsequently imaged using ChemiDoc MP Imaging system.</p><p>To evaluate the phosphorylation level of the protein of interest, protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of the Phos-tag (Fujifilm WAKO Chemical), following the manufacturer’s instructions. One wash of the acrylamide gel with the transfer buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and subsequent second wash with only the transfer buffer were performed before the electrotransfer.</p><p>For Immunofluorescence, cells were first fixed with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 25 min. After three washes of 10 min with PBS containing 0,2% Triton X-100(PBST), cells were permeabilized and blocked in PBST containing 1% BSA for 1 hr. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature, washed three times with PBST, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1 hr avoiding light. Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-Lamin from mouse (1:200, DSHB Hybridoma Product ADL84.12), and anti-GFP from rabbits (1:1000, Torrey Pine Biolabs). Secondary antibodies from mouse and rabbit were respectively coupled to Alexa-647(1:200, Invitrogen) and Alexa-488 (1:200, Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos were collected, dechorionated in 50% bleach, and washed three times in 0,7% NaCl, and 0,05% Triton-100.

Acquired images of cells were subsequently processed with the Lightning system. Live imaging of cells and embryos was performed by a spinning disk confocal system (Yokogawa CSU-X1 5000) mounted on a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1). Cells were cultured on a LabTek II chambered coverglass (#155409, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at least 2 hr before time-lapse imaging. For live analysis of embryos, 0–2 hr embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach and then aligned on a coverslip (#P35G-1.5–14 C, MatTek) and covered with halocarbon oil. Films of embryos were taken every 10 s with six confocal sections of about 3 μm. To monitor Ankle2-GFP (WT and mutants) and RFP-BAF levels, respectively, the mean intensity of GFP and RFP fluorescence in the region of interest were measured directly with Zen software (Zeiss) at different time points. For each point, the mean intensity of GFP and RFP was normalized by subtraction of mean intensity at anaphase onset (T0) in the core region. Images of adult flies were acquired by stereomicroscope with a camera (Canon). Developing wings of adult flies were dissected and quantified using Fiji software (National Institute of Health).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Structure predictions</title><p>Prediction of co-complexes was performed using the AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>) AlphaFold Server (Beta) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafoldserver.com">https://alphafoldserver.com</ext-link>), with default seed auto-generation and with seed provided, yielding sets of 5 models.

Other published manuscripts, including those from the authors, show without a doubt that Ankle2 plays a role in this critical process. However, the mechanism by which Ankle2 functions was unclear. Previous work using worms and humans (Asencio et al., 2012) established that human ANKLE2 could bind endogenous PP2A subunits. The binding was direct and was mediated through a region before and including the first ankyrin repeat in human ANKLE2. In addition to its interaction with PP2A, Asencio et al., 2012 also show that ANKLE2 regulates VRK1 kinase activity. Together PP2A and VRK1 regulate BAF phosphorylation for proper nuclear envelope reformation. Here, the authors provide more evidence for interaction with PP2A by also mapping the domain of interaction to the ankyrin repeat in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, the ankyrin repeat is essential for nuclear envelope reformation after division. They show that Ankle2 can bind in a PP2A complex without other known regulatory subunits of PP2A. The authors also identify a novel interaction with ER protein Vap33, but functional relevance for this interaction in nuclear envelope reformation is not provided in the manuscript, which the authors explicitly state. This manuscript does not comment on the activity of Ballchen/VRK1 in relation to Ankle2 loss and BAF phosphorylation or nuclear envelope reformation, even though links were previously shown by multiple studies (Asencio et al., Link et al., Apridita Sebastian et al.,). Nuclear envelope defects were rescued by the reduction of VRK1 in two of these manuscripts. It is possible that BAF phosphorylation phenotypes can be contributed by both PP2A inactivity and VRK1 overactivity due to the loss of Ankle2.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript is a useful finding linking Ankle2 function during nuclear envelope reformation to the PP2A complex. The authors present solid data showing that Ankle2 can form a complex with PP2A‐29B and Mts and generate a phosphoproteomic resource that is fundamentally important to understanding Ankle2 biology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, the main findings/conclusions about subcellular localization might be incomplete since they are drawn from overexpression experiments. In addition, throughout the text, some conclusions are overstated or are not supported by data.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that all experiments studying subcellular localization were done with tagged proteins overexpressed in flies and cell culture. Nevertheless, we show that Ankle2‐GFP is functional since it rescues phenotypes resulting from the loss of endogenous Ankle2 in both flies and cultured cells. The antibodies we generated against Ankle2 were unable to reliably detect the endogenous protein by immunofluorescence. We have now stated this caveat in our manuscript. Regarding the validity of our conclusions in relation to our data, we address each point raised by the reviewer under the Recommendations for the authors. In some cases, we have adjusted our conclusions and in other cases, we have provided additional clarification or justification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>There are a few experimental issues that should be addressed, specific comments are listed below:</p><p>(1) Figure 1F: In this experiment, the authors immunoprecipitate GFP‐PP2A‐29B or PP2A‐B29BGFP and Western blot for Ankle2 and Mts to demonstrate that both are co‐immunoprecipitated. To demonstrate that these interactions are specific, the authors should also blot for a protein that is expected to definitely NOT co‐immunoprecipitate with PP2A‐B29; e.g. tubulin.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion that GFP‐PP2A‐29B and PP2A‐29B‐GFP specifically interact with Ankle2 and Mts is also based on mass spectrometry analysis of the purification products from embryos and cells in culture, comparing with products of purification of GFP alone (Fig 1E‐F, S1C‐D and Tables S2, S3). The lists of identified proteins reveal that most proteins (including tubulins) are not enriched with GFP‐PP2A‐29B or PP2A‐29B‐GFP like Ankle2 and Mts are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2A: The colour coding of the dots is not explained in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2B: The competition experiment is a good idea. Do the authors get the same results when they conduct the experiment the other way round, i.e. keep the concentration of Tws the same but increase the concentration of Ankle2?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried this reverse experiment but saw little effect. The failure to observe displacement of Tws by Ankle2 in this context could be due to a higher affinity of Tws than Ankle2 in the PP2A complex, or to lower expression levels achieved for Ankle2 (a larger protein) relative to Tws.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 5D: The hyperphosphorylation of BAF is very difficult to see, and it is impossible to tell whether the hyperphosphorylation has been rescued or not by the different Ankle2 constructs. Can the phosphorylated and the hyperphosphorylated bands be separated better? This panel needs significant improvements to support the claims in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, the hyperphosphorylated (upper band) and unphosphorylated (lower band) forms of BAF are well resolved and readily distinguishable. The fainter band in the middle could correspond to a partially phosphorylated form of BAF but we do not venture to speculate on its precise identity nor do we need it to draw our conclusions. The important information from this blot is that the level of unphosphorylated BAF after Ankle2 RNAi increases when Ankle2WT‐GFP and Ankle2Fm+FL1‐GFP are expressed but not when Flag‐GFP or Ankle2ΔANK‐GFP are expressed. In these experiments, the rescue of unphosphorylated BAF is incomplete because not all cells express the GFP‐tagged protein in our non‐clonal stable cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The alphafold models need to be labelled as such better on the figures, to distinguish them from X‐ray crystallography structures. Alphafold will always propose a solution but it is not necessarily correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the note “MODEL” directly in Figures 2C, 2D, 4F and S3B, in addition to the information already provided in the text and figure legends specifying that these are models generated by AlphaFold3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 F.

T‐tests cannot be used for comparing multiple groups, as this favors error propagation.</p></disp-quote><p>All of our t‐tests compare only two groups at a time, as indicated. In this regard, our labeling in Fig 5C may have been misleading. We have now changed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Close‐ups of ring canal in Figure S2. In Figure S2, there seem to be lots of GFP‐Ankle2 vesicles in the cytoplasm of the oocyte.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the image showing Ankle2‐GFP alone in the RNAi Vap33 condition suggested a cytoplasmic granular localization of unknown nature. However, upon examination, we realized that this image did not correspond to the same z‐step as the matching merged image (which also included DNA staining). We have now replaced the image with the correct one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Be more accurate about what conclusions can be made from reported data, particularly from overexpression and deletion studies.</p><p>(1) The domain analysis for physical interaction is quite thorough. However, localization information is taken from overexpressed constructs. While these data show what could happen, the authors are not using endogenous levels of Ankle2 in cells or tissues that are known to require Ankle2. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether localization results are biologically meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text at the end of the third Results section:</p><p>“We were unable to examine the localization of endogenous Ankle2 because the antibodies that we generated gave inconclusive results in immunofluorescence. For the remainder of our study, we relied on the overexpression of Ankle2‐GFP, which may not perfectly reflect the localization and function of endogenous Ankle2. However, Ankle2‐GFP is functional as it can rescue phenotypes observed when endogenous Ankle2 is depleted (see below).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data showing that Ankle2 is a regulator unit of the PP2A complex also relies on in vitro binding assays in an over‐expression context. Data certainly show Ankle2 can bind proteins in the PP2A complex when overexpressed. However, the authors could not isolate enough of the complex from the animal to test function, so Ankle2 acting as a regulatory subunit isn't functionally shown. There are other possibilities, such as Ankle2 acts as a scaffold for complex assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>The competition experiments shown in Fig 2 are based on complexes assembling in cells and are not in vitro binding assays. We show 4 lines of evidence supporting the idea that Ankle2 functions as a regulatory subunit of PP2A: (1) Ankle2 interacts with the structural (PP2A‐29B) and catalytic (Mts) subunits of PP2A without any known regulatory subunit of PP2A. (2) Depletion of Ankle2 leads to the hyperphosphorylation of the known PP2A substrate BAF. (3) The PP2A regulatory subunit Tws/B55 competes with Ankle2 for formation of a complex with PP2A. (4) AlphaFold3 predicts that Ankle2 engages in a complex with PP2A at a position similar to that of known regulatory subunits of PP2A including Tws/B55, and consistent with their mutually exclusive presence in PP2A complexes. If Ankle2 acted as a scaffold for the formation of a PP2A complex containing other regulatory subunits, we would expect to detect Ankle2 and another regulatory subunit in the same complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Throughout the text, some conclusions are overstated or are not supported by data. Examples are below:</p><p>a. Page 1: &quot;we show for the first time that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A&quot; The authors show binding and changes in BAF phosphorylation levels, but changes in PP2A activity with modulation of Ankle2 weren't shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced this phrase with this one:</p><p>“…we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Page 3: &quot;The requirement for Ankle2 in the development of the central nervous system was initially discovered through its targeting by the microcephaly‐causing Zika virus (Shah et al., 2018).&quot;</p><p>This is not the first paper showing ANKLE2 plays a role in the development of the CNS. Yamamoto et al., 2014 identified mutants in Ankle2 with defects in CNS development in flies and humans, establishing it as a human microcephaly‐causing gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this oversight. We have now cited this important work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Page 6: &quot;Moreover, BAF appears to be the only obligatory substrate of Ankle2‐dependent dephosphorylation for cell proliferation as lowering the dose of the BAF kinase NHK‐1/Ballchen rescues wing development defects caused by the partial depletion of Ankle2 (Li et al., 2024).&quot; It is unclear why the authors conclude this since Ballchen/VRK1 can phosphorylate many things besides BAF.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the conclusion cannot be drawn categorically, it seems to be by far the most likely scenario. However, we agree that in principle, other mechanisms could also account for these genetic observations, such as the dephosphorylation of another, still unidentified obligatory substrate of PP2A‐Ankle2 that would also be phosphorylated by NHK‐1/Ballchen. However, we have also shown that expression of an unphosphorylatable mutant form of BAF rescues phenotypes observed upon loss of Ankle2 function (Li et al, 2024). We have changed our sentence as follows:</p><p>&quot;Moreover, BAF could be the only obligatory substrate of Ankle2‐dependent dephosphorylation for cell proliferation as lowering the dose of the BAF kinase NHK‐1/Ballchen or expression of an unphosphorylatable mutant form of BAF rescues wing development defects caused by the partial depletion of Ankle2 (Li et al., 2024).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Page 10: &quot;These results suggest that a Vap33‐Ankle2‐PP2A complex can mediate the recruitment of a pool of PP2A at the NE.&quot;</p><p>There is insufficient evidence to indicate that Vap33‐Ankle2‐PP2A exists in a stable state in the cell and that this complex mediates recruitment of PP2A at the NE. The images do not include Vap33, showing no evidence it is present when PP2A is at the NE and the complex could only be detected with overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this caveat and recognize the need to be cautious when proposing our model. In this regard, we feel that our wording is reasonable and appropriate, using “suggest” rather than “prove”, “show” or “indicate”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

It does not say PP2A interaction with Ankle2 is necessary because other things could bind the domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the segments of the text mentioned, taking the reviewer’s legitimate concerns into consideration. We have also added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“However, it remains formally possible that the deletion of Ankyrin repeats used to disrupt the Ankle2‐PP2A interaction abrogated another, unknown aspect of Ankle2 function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Page 12: &quot;Overall, we conclude that in addition to its N‐terminal PP2A‐interacting Ankyrin domain, Ankle2 requires the integrity of its C‐terminal portion for its essential function in nuclear reassembly.&quot;</p><p>No data was shown for differences in nuclear reassembly, only the ability for ANKLE2 truncation mutants to localize to the nuclear envelope. It isn't clear whether the nuclear envelope reformation is normal in Figure S6 which the authors refer to. Lamin staining could help determine and conclude the C‐terminal region is important for nuclear envelope reformation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion is drawn from the results shown in Figures S4 and S5 (described in the same section), where a rescue assay in cells was performed to assess the functionality of different variants of Ankle2‐GFP when endogenous Ankle2 was depleted. In this assay, Lamin and DNA staining were used to examine nuclear reassembly (as in Figure 5). Figure S6 shows the localizations of the different variants of Ankle2‐GFP, but endogenous Ankle2 is not depleted in these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. Page 13: &quot;We conclude that the ability of Ankle2 to interact with PP2A is required for the timely recruitment of BAF at reassembling nuclei and ensuing NE reassembly.&quot;</p><p>It's possible the Ankyrin domain in ANKLE2 is interacting with proteins other than PP2A to recruit BAF at reassembling nuclei, especially since ANKLE2 is found to regulate VRK1 (Link 2019) which has been found to phosphorylate BAF during the cell cycle (Molitor 2014). Additionally, the images in Figure 6A appear to show fully reassembled nuclear envelopes in all mutants by 180s.</p></disp-quote><p>This point relates to point e, raised above by this reviewer. We have re‐written the sentence as follows:</p><p>“We conclude that the Ankyrin domain, required for the ability of Ankle2 to interact with PP2A, is necessary for the timely recruitment of BAF at reassembling nuclei and ensuing NE reassembly.”</p><p>Please note that in this paragraph, we discuss a delay in RFP‐BAF recruitment, rather than the complete elimination of this recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. Page 16: &quot;Our unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed that BAF dephosphorylation depends on Ankle2, despite the absence of a detectable interaction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2 and BAF, which may be due to the lack of a LEM domain in the former (Fishburn et al., 2024). Moreover, while Ankle2 was shown to bind and inhibit the BAF counteracting kinase VRK1 in humans (Asencio et al., 2012), we detected no interaction between Ankle2 and NHK‐1/Ballchen (VRK1 ortholog) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This suggests that the loss of Ankle2 causes BAF hyperphosphorylation by preventing PP2A‐dependent dephosphorylation rather than by preventing inhibition of NHK‐1&quot;</p><p>There could be transient binding between Ankle2 and Ballchen/VRK1/NHK‐1 or activity can be indirect, but that doesn't mean there is not a contribution of BAF phosphorylation by Ballchen/VRK1/NHK‐1. Genetic evidence from three model systems, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indicates there is a strong genetic interaction between Ankle2 and Ballchen/VRK1/NHK‐1 that includes rescue of lethality.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have re‐written in this way:</p><p>“While a putative interaction between Ankle2 and NHK‐1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could occur transiently, thereby escaping detection, the simplest interpretation of our results is that the loss of Ankle2 causes BAF hyperphosphorylation by preventing PP2A‐dependent dephosphorylation rather than by preventing inhibition of NHK‐1.”</p><p>We do not question the fact that Ballchen/VRK1/NHK‐1 phosphorylates BAF and genetically interacts with Ankle2. The antagonistic relationship between Ballchen/VRK1/NHK‐1 and Ankle2 observed genetically can be explained by the fact that the kinase phosphorylates BAF while PP2AAnkle2 dephosphorylates it, without the need to invoke an additional inhibition of the kinase by Ankle2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
