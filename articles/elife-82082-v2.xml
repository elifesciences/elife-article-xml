APP and sAPP were reported to bind to the extracellular sushi domain 1 (SD1) of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GBRs). A 17 amino acid peptide (APP17) derived from APP was sufficient for SD1 binding and shown to mimic the inhibitory effect of sAPP on neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity. The functional effects of APP17 and sAPP were similar to those of the GBR agonist baclofen and blocked by a GBR antagonist. These experiments led to the proposal that sAPP activates GBRs to exert its neuronal effects. However, whether APP17 and sAPP influence classical GBR signaling pathways in heterologous cells was not analyzed. Here, we confirm that APP17 binds to GBRs with nanomolar affinity. However, biochemical and electrophysiological experiments indicate that APP17 does not influence GBR activity in heterologous cells. Moreover, APP17 did not regulate synaptic GBR localization, GBR-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents, neurotransmitter release, or neuronal activity in vitro or in vivo. Our results show that APP17 is not a functional GBR ligand and indicate that sAPP exerts its neuronal effects through receptors other than GBRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GABA<sub>B</sub></kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptors</kwd><kwd>soluble amyloid-β precursor protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-152970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bettler</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinartz</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinartz</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>439189341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>446245862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>239283807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Soluble amyloid-β precursor peptide has no functional effects at recombinant and native GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP or A4 protein) is a transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic processing by secretases. The amyloidogenic pathway generates amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) that are key etiological agents of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The competing non-amyloidogenic pathway generates secreted APP (sAPP) variants that modulate spine density, synaptic transmission, plasticity processes, and rescue synaptic deficits in <italic>App</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass and Willem, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang, 2019</xref>). It is assumed that cell surface receptors mediate the synaptic effects of sAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass and Willem, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet and Mulle, 2020</xref>). It was recently proposed that sAPP acts at G protein-coupled GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GBRs) to modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass and Willem, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korte, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet and Mulle, 2020</xref>). GBRs are good candidates for mediating the functional effects of sAPP because they regulate neurotransmitter release, neuronal inhibition, and synaptic plasticity processes by reducing cAMP levels and gating Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lüscher and Slesinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gassmann and Bettler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet and Mulle, 2020</xref>).</p><p>GBRs are composed of a GB1a or GB1b subunit with a GB2 subunit, which generates heterodimeric GB1a/2 and GB1b/2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>). GB1a differs from GB1b by the presence of two N-terminal sushi domains (SD1/2). GB1a/2 and GB1b/2 receptors predominantly localize to pre- and postsynaptic sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vigot et al., 2006</xref>). APP and sAPP bind to SD1 of GB1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwenk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). Synthetic APP peptides of 9 or 17 amino acid residues, termed APP9 and APP17, are sufficient for binding and inducing a stable conformation in SD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). APP, sAPP, and APP17 bind to recombinant SD1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 183, 431, and 810 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). APP17 and sAPP reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in brain slices, thus mimicking the activity of the orthosteric GBR agonist baclofen at presynaptic GB1a/2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). The antagonist CGP55845 reduced the inhibitory effect of APP17 on the mEPSC frequency, in further support of APP17 activating GBRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, APP17 inhibited neuronal activity in the hippocampus of anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with a GBR-mediated inhibition of glutamate release and/or activation of postsynaptic K<sup>+</sup> currents. Based on these experiments, Rice and colleagues proposed that APP17 and sAPP are functional GBR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). However, they presented no evidence that APP17 or sAPP activate classical GBR-activated G protein signaling pathways, which is necessary to demonstrate a direct action at GBRs. In separate studies, the binding of APP to GB1a/2 receptors in cis was shown to mediate receptor transport to presynaptic sites and to stabilize receptors at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>App</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a 75% decrease of axonal GBRs in hippocampal neurons, which significantly reduced GBR-mediated presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>), as already shown in earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seabrook et al., 1999</xref>). However, recombinant sAPP had no effect on GBR-mediated G protein activation in transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it remains controversial whether APP17 and sAPP are functional ligands at GBRs or not.</p><p>The reported effects of APP17 on synaptic release and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that APP17 acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) or ago-PAM (PAM with agonistic properties) at GBRs. APP17 could also increase constitutive activity of GBRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grünewald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rajalu et al., 2015</xref>) by binding to SD1. To clarify whether APP17 influences GBR activity, we studied the effects of APP17 on classical GBR signaling pathways in transfected HEK293T cells, cultured neurons, acute hippocampal slices, and in anesthetized mice. Our experiments confirm that APP17 binds with nanomolar affinity to purified recombinant SD1/2 protein and to GB1a/2 receptors expressed in HEK293T cells. However, in our hands, APP17 neither induced conformational changes at GBRs consistent with receptor activation nor influenced GBR-mediated G protein activity, cAMP inhibition or Kir3-type K<sup>+</sup> currents. APP17 also failed to modulate constitutive GBR activity in the absence or presence of APP expressed in cis or in trans. Likewise, APP17 did not influence K<sup>+</sup> currents or mEPSC frequencies in cultured hippocampal neurons, reduce the amplitude of evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) in hippocampal slices, or modulate neuronal activity in living mice. Thus, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that receptors other than GBRs mediate the synaptic effects of sAPP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>APP17 binds to purified recombinant SD1/2 protein and GB1a/2 receptors expressed in HEK293T cells</title><p>We purchased APP17 and scrambled sc-APP17 peptides from the same commercial provider as Rice and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For displacement experiments, we additionally synthesized fluorescent APP17-TMR and sc-APP17-TMR peptides labeled with TAMRA (5 (6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ESI-LC-MS and RP-UPLC analysis revealed that all peptides had the expected molecular weight and purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that APP17 interacts with purified recombinant SD1/2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwenk et al., 2016</xref>) in solution with an ~1:1 stoichiometry and a K<sub>D</sub> of 543 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based conformational sensor in transfected HEK293T cells to analyze whether APP17 induces the inter-subunit rearrangement associated with GBR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecat-Guillet et al., 2017</xref>). The FRET sensor is based on GB1a and GB2 subunits fused with ACP and SNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), respectively. These tags are enzymatically modified with time-resolved FRET compatible fluorophores (HA-GB1a-ACP with CoA-Lumi4-TB [Donor], Flag-SNAP-GB2 with SNAP-RED [Acceptor]). This FRET sensor discriminates between GBR agonists with different efficacies and between PAMs with distinct modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecat-Guillet et al., 2017</xref>). For FRET experiments, we used APP17 and sc-APP17 at 1 and 10 μM. These concentrations are above the K<sub>D</sub> of APP17 at SD1 and comparable to those used in previous functional experiments (25 nM to 5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, GABA decreased FRET in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). APP17 at 10 μM, when applied alone (basal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), significantly increased instead of decreased FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). This FRET increase can be rationalized in two ways. First, since GBRs exhibit constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grünewald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rajalu et al., 2015</xref>), there is an equilibrium between active and inactive states of the receptor. Constitutive activity decreases basal FRET because a fraction of receptors is in the active state. Ligands stabilizing the inactive conformation will increase basal FRET. Therefore, APP17 is potentially an inverse agonist of GBRs. However, since all our other functional experiments reveal no inverse agonistic properties (see below), APP17 binding to SD1 likely influences the positioning of the SNAP-tag located on top of GB2, thereby decreasing the mean distance between the fluorophores and increasing FRET efficacy. Of note, APP17 lacks allosteric properties as it did not significantly alter GABA potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In summary, the FRET conformational sensor provides no evidence for agonistic or PAM activity of APP17.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>APP17 does not induce the active state of GB1a/2 receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assay measuring inter-subunit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorophore labeled ACP and SNAP tags in the GB1a and GB2 subunits, respectively.

Nanomolar concentrations of sAPP were shown to have PAM activity at heterologously expressed α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, suggesting that nicotinic receptors mediate some of the effects of sAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2018</xref>). Recent experiments identified GB1a/2 receptors as receptors for sAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). GB1a/2 receptors are predominantly expressed at presynaptic sites, where they regulate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vigot et al., 2006</xref>). It was shown that sAPP and APP17, a peptide of 17 amino acids corresponding to the SD1 binding site of APP, reduce the frequency of mEPSCs and inhibit neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). While these findings received much attention and are consistent with activation of GBRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass and Willem, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korte, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yates, 2019</xref>), fundamental questions remained. For example, it is unclear how a conformational change in SD1, induced by sAPP or APP17 binding, increases GBR activity. High-resolution structures of the GBR heterodimer in the apo, antagonist-bound, agonist-bound and agonist- and PAM-bound states in complex with the G protein are available and provide detailed insights into the activation mechanism of GBRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). These structures show that the N-terminal SD1 is neither part of the binding sites for orthosteric or allosteric ligands, nor alters pharmacological receptor properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaupmann et al., 1998</xref>) or participates in receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evenseth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaye et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, there is no straightforward explanation for potential functional effects of sAPP or APP17 at GBRs. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>, did not analyze whether sAPP or APP17 regulate GB1a/2 receptors in heterologous cells, which is important to demonstrate a direct action at the receptor. In fact, in an earlier report showing interaction of native GBRs with APP, we found no evidence for recombinant sAPP regulating GB1a/2 receptors expressed in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>). However, native GBRs form receptor complexes with additional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwenk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettler and Fakler, 2017</xref>) and these proteins could be necessary for the observed effects of APP17 on receptor activity.</p><p>The aim of this study was to clarify whether APP17 can activate recombinant and/or native GBRs. We were able to confirm that APP17 binds to purified recombinant SD1/2 protein with a K<sub>D</sub> of 543 nM, which is similar to the K<sub>D</sub> determined earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). For functional experiments in HEK293T cells, we used a range of established cell-based GBR assays reporting (1) conformational changes associated with receptor activation, (2) G protein activation, (3) cAMP inhibition, and (4) Kir3 channel activation. In all these assays, APP17 had no agonistic, PAM, or antagonistic properties at GB1/2 receptors. APP17 also did not influence constitutive GBR activity in the presence or absence of APP695, which competes with APP17 for binding at SD1. It is well established that GBRs normally signal through Gαo/i-type G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>). However, Gαq signaling was proposed as an alternative signaling mode of GBRs in select neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karls and Mynlieff, 2015</xref>). We therefore considered the possibility that APP17 acts as a biased ligand favoring Gαq over Gαo/i signaling. However, we found no evidence that APP17 mobilizes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transfected HEK293T cells expressing GB1a/2. APP17 also did not regulate native GBRs in experiments assessing (1) G protein activation in brain membranes, (2) activation of K<sup>+</sup> currents in cultured neurons, (3) mEPSC frequency in cultured neurons, (4) eEPSC amplitude modulation in acute hippocampal slices, and (5) neuronal activity in anesthetized mice. Consistent with a lack of APP17 effects on GBRs, we found no evidence that prolonged application of APP17 alters synaptic GBR levels. Thus, our findings are consistent with a lack of functional effects of APP17 at GB1a/2 receptors, confirming our earlier data with sAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of functional effects is not due to a faulty APP17 peptide, since the APP17 peptide used in functional experiments was validated for binding recombinant SD1/2 protein and GB1a/2 receptors expressed in HEK293T cells. In all our experiments, we used GABA or baclofen to control for receptor activity. It therefore appears that sAPP mediates its neuronal effects through receptors other than GBRs. APP binding to GBRs probably mainly evolved to control receptor trafficking in axons and stabilize APP and GB1a/2 receptors at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>). As a final remark it is important to note that the concentration of the abundant sAPPα variant in the interstitial fluid reaches ~1 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobrowolska et al., 2014</xref>). Considering a K<sub>D</sub> of 183 nM for the APP interaction with GB1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>), it is unlikely that endogenous levels of sAPP would reach concentrations high enough to directly activate the receptor or displace APP from GB1a/2 receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and reagents</title><p>The following plasmids were used: Flag-GB1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelfinger et al., 2014</xref>); Flag-GB2, APP695 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>); mGlu5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Werthmann et al., 2021</xref>), Gαo-RLuc, Venus-Gγ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayoub et al., 2009</xref>); Flag-Gβ<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rajalu et al., 2015</xref>); Myc-GB1a, HA-GB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pagano et al., 2001</xref>); Kir3.1/Kir3.2 concatamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wischmeyer et al., 1997</xref>); PKA-R-RLuc-N, PKA-C-RLuc-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2007</xref>); and SRE-FLuc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>).

Cells were suspended in dissection medium (MEM Eagle [Sigma-Aldrich]; 0.5% D(+)glucose; 10% horse serum [Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific]; 0.1% Pen-Strep [Sigma-Aldrich]) to block trypsin activity. Cells were plated on 13 mm cell culture coverslips coated with 0.01 mg/ml poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 50,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Two hr after dissection, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal Medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B-27 (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primary hippocampal neurons were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>APP17-TMR binding experiments</title><p>Transfected HEK293T cells expressing Flag-GB1a and Flag-GB2 were seeded into 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) at 50,000 cells/well. After 18 hr, peptides were mixed with conditioned medium at the following final concentrations: APP17-TMR (1 µM) with either APP17 (10 µM), sc-APP17 (10 µM), or PBS (vehicle); sc-APP17-TMR (1 µM) in PBS was used as a negative control. After removal of medium, peptide mixes were added to the wells and cells incubated in the dark for 1 hr at room temperature. After removal of the peptides, PBS with MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the wells. TMR fluorescence was monitored with a Spark microplate reader (Tecan Group, Männerdorf, Switzerland) using a monochromator (Excitation 544 nM, 20 nM bandwidth; detection 594 nM, 25 nm bandwidth).

TR-FRET measurements were performed in Greiner black 96-well plates, using a PHERAstar FS microplate reader. After excitation with a laser at 337 nm (40 flashes per well), the fluorescence was collected at 620 nm (donor signal) and 665 nm (sensitized acceptor signal). The acceptor ratio was calculated using the sensitized acceptor signal integrated over the time window (50–100 µs), divided by the sensitized acceptor signal integrated over the time window (900–1150 µs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>BRET measurements</title><p>BRET experiments were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivankova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinamarca et al., 2019</xref>).

Luminescence and fluorescence signals were alternatively recorded for a total of 845 s using a Spark microplate reader. Peptide, GABA, or CGP54626 were injected with the Spark microplate reader injection system at either 146 or 457 s. The BRET ratio was calculated as the ratio of the light emitted by Venus-Gγ<sub>2</sub> (530–570 nm) over the light emitted by Gαo-RLuc (370–470 nm).

Transfected cells were distributed into 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One) at a density of 80,000 cells/well. After 24 hr, the culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM-GlutaMAX. Peptides were incubated in Opti-MEM-GlutaMAX for 1 hr. In presence of peptide, GB1a/2 receptors were activated with various concentrations of GABA for 15 hr. FLuc activity in lysed cells was measured using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) using a Spark microplate reader. Luminescence signals were adjusted by subtracting the luminescence obtained when expressing SRE-FLuc fusion proteins alone. Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization experiments were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Werthmann et al., 2021</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were detected using a Spark microplate reader at 0.85 Hz and normalized to baseline fluorescence. A monochromator was used for excitation and fluorescence collection at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The peak of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization was determined by the mean of four data points 3.5 s after application of 1 or 10 µM APP17, sc-APP17, GABA, or (S)-3,5-DHPG. GB1a/2 receptor expression in HEK293T cells was validated using immunocytochemistry. HEK293T cells were fixed with 4% PFA (Sigma) + 4% sucrose (Sigma) in PBS (Life Technologies) and permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) + 10% normal donkey serum (Abcam). After washing the cells with PBS, either primary mouse anti-GB1 (Abcam) or guinea pig anti-GB2 (Synaptic Systems) antibody was incubated overnight in the dark at 4°C.

Neurons were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 10% normal donkey serum (Abcam). Primary guinea pig anti-GB2 (Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-vGluT1 (Synaptic Systems), and mouse anti-PSD-95 (Synaptic Systems) antibodies were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. For GBR quantification, we used a GB2 antibody because the available GB1a antibody may compete with APP17 for binding to SD1. Neurons were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies), and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) antibodies for 45 min in the dark. Neurons were washed with PBS, air-dried, and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM-700 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/NA 1.40 oil DIC, using Zen 2010 software. Fiji (ImageJ, version 1.53t) was used for image analysis. Images were z-stacked using maximum intensity. A binary mask was created for vGluT1 and PSD-95 overlap detection. Particles that contained both vGluT1 and PSD-95 were considered synapses. The GB2 fluorescence in z-stacked (maximum intensity) images was quantified at these synapses.

Briefly, 8-week-old male C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier Labs, France) were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia (animal license number 1897_31476, approved by the Veterinary Office of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland). The brains were removed, washed in ice-cold PBS, and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose, containing 4 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA, using a glass-teflon homogenizer. Debris was removed at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and membranes were centrifuged at 26,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min.

The suspension was centrifuged at 38,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min and re-suspended in a threefold volume of H<sub>2</sub>O. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20°C for 48 hr. After thawing at room temperature, a sevenfold volume of Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer (pH 7.4) was added, containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 118 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM glucose, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>.

The final pellet was re-suspended in a fivefold volume of KH buffer. Aliquots of 2 ml were frozen and stored at −80°C until the day of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, frozen membranes were thawed, homogenized in 10 ml ice-cold assay buffer I containing 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7); 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, and centrifuged at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min.

Nine- to 12-week-old male mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5–2.5% surgery, 1% optical imaging); 3.2 mg/kg dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally 48, 24, and 1 hr prior to surgery to prevent brain swelling. Bupivacaine/lidocaine (0.01/0.04 mg) was injected subcutaneously for analgesia. An imaging chamber was created with cement above right auditory cortex (rACx) and a post fixed on the skull of the left hemisphere. A craniotomy (1.5×1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>) above rACx was carefully opened and duratomy was performed. For optical imaging, the post was stably fixed on a stage and the head tilted 30° for optimal access to the rACx. The imaging chamber was perfused at 1 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. All solutions were kept at 37°C for 1 hr prior to perfusion. Two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging periods (5 min each) started 45 min after the first ACSF perfusion, 60 min after sc-APP17, second ACSF, APP17 and third ACSF perfusion and 15 min after baclofen perfusion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of neuronal cell bodies in the upper layers of rACx (focal depth: 150–250 µm) were recorded with a two-photon microscope (INSS) equipped with an 8 kHz resonant scanner. Images were acquired with a PXI-1073-based data acquisition system (NI) through a Nikon 16× objective (0.8 NA), at 30 Hz within a 500×500 μm<sup>2</sup> field of view (512×512 pixels).

Automated detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was with an adapted algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sorensen et al., 2017</xref>). First, the fluorescence signal was corrected by the median filtered data removing slow trends. The detection threshold was set to 2.5 times the standard deviation and a minimum peak width of 3 data points above threshold to remove fast artifacts. ΔF/F was calculated as (F−F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the mean fluorescence across all detected neurons in a given condition.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shiva K. Tyagarajan (Reviewer #1); Christophe Mulle (Reviewer #2). We apologize for the extremely lengthy review process of your manuscript. A long delay in obtaining a review held up the process.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We appreciate your understanding of the editorial process. Thank you for your patience in the review of your study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The two reviewers both agreed the study of sAPP and GABA receptors had considerable merit and importance for the fields of GABA biology and Alzheimer's research. The referees felt the study could be strengthened with further attention to sAPP on GABAB receptors, such as the effect 0f APP17 on mEPSC frequency in primary hippocampal neurons. This was brought up by reviewer #2 and endorsed by the first reviewer. Therefore we wish to ask for a revised manuscript to address this recommendation. Several revisions to look at ca<sup>2+</sup>, lipid signaling, and the role of microglia were also suggested, but are of lower priority depending on the likelihood of meaningful results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would recommend that authors test some ideas to identify the biological relevance of APP interaction with GABABR with such high affinity. My suggested experiments would be as follows:</p><p>1. In 2018 Nicholson et al., reported that prolonged exposure to benzodiazepine activates GPCR PLC δ /calcineurin pathway leading to GABAAR internalization from synaptic sites. It will be worthwhile to measure how the surface/synaptic expression of GABABRs is influenced by APP17 binding.</p><p>2. Is lipid signalling from the plasma membrane facilitating downstream effects after APP17 binding to GB1a?</p><p>3. What happens to intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> levels after APP17 binding to GABABRs? the GCaMP in vivo measurements might not be sensitive to measure internal ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In HEK293T cells, authors can measure internal changes in ca<sup>2+</sup> using a calcium-sensitive dye after APP17 application.</p><p>4. GABAB receptor function on microglia facilitates synapse pruning during development (Favuzzi et al., 2021), we reported GABA action on microglia regulates its activation status (Cramer et al., 2022). Is sAPP binding to GABAB receptor influencing microglia and not neuronal function? This can be tested using the microglia cell line BV2 or primary microglia.</p><p>Cannabinoid pathway activation in microglia/neurons could provide a link to lipid signalling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provide an extensive range of techniques used to invalidate in a well-controlled manner the claim that sAPP has an agonistic (or PAM) activity on GABAB receptors.</p><p>It is therefore unclear why the authors do not attempt to replicate precisely some of the electrophysiological experiments reported in the Rice et al. paper. This is particularly the case for the test of APP17 on mEPSC frequency in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, which is a straightforward experiment. Either the results differ from that of the Rice paper, or the authors find indeed a decrease in mEPSC frequency, and this may relate to a mechanism independent of sAPP binding to GABAB receptors. This would be important information and related discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82082.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would recommend that authors test some ideas to identify the biological relevance of APP interaction with GABABR with such high affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>Binding of APP to GABAB receptors is important for axonal trafficking and surface stability of GABAB receptors (Dinamarca et al., 2019), which provides a biological function for the APP/GABAB receptor interaction. Our analysis shows that binding of APP17 or sAPP to GABAB receptors is without functional consequences in a comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo assays.

Exposure of cultured hippocampal neurons to 5 μM APP17 or sc-APP17 for one hour did not result in a significant difference in GB2 protein levels at glutamatergic synapses, which were identified by vGluT1 and PSD95 immunostaining (Figure 6).

Primary guinea pig anti-GB2 (Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-vGluT1 (Synaptic Systems) and mouse anti-PSD-95 (Synaptic Systems) antibodies were incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. For GBR quantification we used a GB2 antibody because the available GB1a antibody may compete with APP17 for binding to SD1.

However, it has been proposed that GABAB receptors couple to Gαq and increase intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> in some neuronal populations (Karls and Mynlieff, 2015). In response to the reviewer’s comment we tested whether APP17 biases GABAB receptor signaling towards Gαq and studied a possible increase in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to APP17 (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). Our results show that APP17 does not increase intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> in HEK293T cells expressing GABAB receptors.</p><p>P8. “APP17 does not bias GB1a/2 signaling towards Gαq</p><p>GBRs are classical Gαo/i-coupled receptors that normally lack the ability to mobilize intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> (Pin and Bettler, 2016). However, it has been proposed that in some neurons GBRs increase intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> by activating Gαq and phospholipase C (Karls and Mynlieff, 2015). It is possible that APP17 is a biased ligand preferentially stabilizing a conformational state of GBRs that elicits signaling through Gαq (Slosky et al., 2021). APP17 did not activate PLC in the SRE-luciferase assay (Figure 5). However, high levels of exogenous Gαqi in this assay may interfere with signaling through endogenous Gαq. We therefore analyzed APP17 activity at GB1a/2 receptors in a ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization assay (Werthmann et al., 2021). HEK293T cells expressing GB1a/2 or control mGlu5 receptors were loaded with the ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Calcium 6 and stimulated with 1 or 10 μM APP17, GABA or (S)-3,5-DHPG (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). Application of APP17 or GABA did not induce significant ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells expressing GB1a/2 receptors (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A,B). Expression of GB1a/2 receptors in HEK2093T cells was confirmed by immunostaining for GB1 and GB2 (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2C). Application of the selective group I mGlu receptor agonist DHPG to cells expressing mGlu5 receptors induced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A,B), as expected (Werthmann et al., 2021).

GABAB receptor function on microglia facilitates synapse pruning during development (Favuzzi et al., 2021), we reported GABA action on microglia regulates its activation status (Cramer et al., 2022).

(2021) describes an effect of GABAB receptors in a subset of microglia on a long-term developmental wiring process, which cannot be studied in a microglia cell line or primary microglia. The work by Cramer et al. (2022) does not directly implicate GABAB receptors in the regulation of microglia activation. Most importantly, however, neither the above studies nor other studies suggest a non-canonical GABAB receptor signaling in microglia. Therefore, there is no rationale for why APP17 should specifically activate a non-canonical GABAB receptor signaling in microglia. Moreover, APP17 effects on non-neuronal cells would likely influence neuronal activity in anesthetized mice, which we show remains unchanged in the presence of APP17 (Figure 10).
