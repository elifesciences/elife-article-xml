TEAD, together with its coactivator YAP/TAZ, is a key transcriptional modulator of the Hippo pathway. Activation of TEAD transcription by YAP has been implicated in a number of malignancies, and this complex represents a promising target for drug discovery. However, both YAP and its extensive binding interfaces to TEAD have been difficult to address using small molecules, mainly due to a lack of druggable pockets. TEAD is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation that targets a conserved cysteine at a central pocket, which provides an opportunity to develop cysteine-directed covalent small molecules for TEAD inhibition. Here, we employed covalent fragment screening approach followed by structure-based design to develop an irreversible TEAD inhibitor MYF-03–69. Using a range of in vitro and cell-based assays we demonstrated that through a covalent binding with TEAD palmitate pocket, MYF-03–69 disrupts YAP-TEAD association, suppresses TEAD transcriptional activity and inhibits cell growth of Hippo signaling defective malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Further, a cell viability screening with a panel of 903 cancer cell lines indicated a high correlation between TEAD-YAP dependency and the sensitivity to MYF-03–69. Transcription profiling identified the upregulation of proapoptotic <italic>BMF</italic> gene in cancer cells that are sensitive to TEAD inhibition. Further optimization of MYF-03–69 led to an in vivo compatible compound MYF-03–176, which shows strong antitumor efficacy in MPM mouse xenograft model via oral administration. Taken together, we disclosed a story of the development of covalent TEAD inhibitors and its high therapeutic potential for clinic treatment for the cancers that are driven by TEAD-YAP alteration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>TEAD</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>covalent ligand</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>mesothelioma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Epiphanes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Tinghu</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Nathanael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hale Family Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mancias</surname><given-names>Joseph D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Gray lab has sponsored research agreement for TEAD inhibitor project with Epiphanes.

Critical components of Hippo signaling pathway are TEAD transcription factors, that are present as a family of four highly homologous members (TEAD1-4) in mammals. Importantly, TEADs alone show minimal transcriptional activity and require binding with a coactivator YAP/TAZ to initiate efficient gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>. YAP has been well characterized as an oncoprotein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref> and its tumorigenesis role is mostly associated with TEAD mediated YAP-dependent gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stein et al., 2015</xref>. Tissue-specific deletion of the upstream regulators or overexpression of YAP itself results in hyperplasia, organ overgrowth and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>. Tumor suppressor Merlin, encoded by <italic>NF2</italic> gene, and kinase LATS1/2 are known upstream regulators that cooperatively promote phosphorylation of YAP and hence induce its retention and degradation in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrilli and Fernández-Valle, 2016</xref>. However, loss of function mutations in <italic>NF2</italic> or <italic>LATS1/2</italic>, which occurs in &gt;70% mesothelioma, promote YAP nuclear entry and binding with TEAD to drive oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bueno et al., 2016</xref>. In addition to mesothelioma, high level of nuclear YAP has been associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC)<sup>3a</sup>. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that activation of the YAP-TEAD transcriptional program can be involved with drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen and Yi, 2019</xref>. For example, <italic>ALK</italic>-rearranged lung cancer cells were shown to survive the treatment of ALK inhibitor alectinib through YAP1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsuji et al., 2020</xref>. In EGFR-mutant lung cancers, YAP-TEAD was observed to promote cell survival and induce a dormant state upon EGFR signaling blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurppa et al., 2020</xref>. Taken together, targeting YAP-TEAD has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.</p><p>Over the decades, efforts to directly target YAP/TAZ-TEAD have focused on either designing peptide-mimicking agents that bind in the interface between YAP and TEAD and disrupt this interaction or using phenotypic screening to identify small molecules that inhibit YAP-dependent signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santucci et al., 2015</xref>. For example, a cyclic YAP-like peptide has been developed as a potent disruptor of YAP-TEAD complex in cell lysates but failed to exert effects in cells due to poor cellular permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>. Recently, TEAD stability and the association with YAP protein was shown to be regulated by <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, a post-translational modification on a conserved cysteine located within the palmitate binding pocket (PBP) on YAP binding domain (YBD) of TEAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noland et al., 2016</xref>. This finding led to the discovery of several small molecules: flufenamic acid (FA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pobbati et al., 2015</xref>, MGH-CP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2020</xref>, compound 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holden et al., 2020</xref> and VT101~107 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2021</xref>, that reversibly bind TEAD PBP. Additionally, inspired by thioester formation of the conserved cysteine with palmitate, covalent TEAD inhibitors TED-347 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bum-Erdene et al., 2019</xref>, DC-TEADin02 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2019</xref> and K-975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) have also been designed. TED-347 and DC-TEADin02 covalently bind with TEAD using a highly electrophilic chloromethyl ketone and vinyl sulfonamide warhead. In comparison, a less electrophilic arylamide warhead is used in the design of K-975, which shows a potent cellular and in vivo activity in mouse tumor models albeit employing a high dose. Although these compounds have adequately demonstrated that the palmitoylated cysteine is targetable, none of them are optimized compounds and the structure-activity study for each of these scaffolds has not been disclosed. We have previously reported MYF-01–37 which possesses a less electrophilic warhead compared to K-975 as a covalent TEAD inhibitor and demonstrated its utility to blunt the transcriptional adaptation in mutant EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurppa et al., 2020</xref>. However, MYF-01–37 is a sub-optimal chemical probe which requires micromolar concentrations in cellular assays and displays poor pharmacokinetic properties.</p><p>Development of covalent chemical probes and drugs has experienced a revival in recent years resulting in a deluge of new modality targeting a range of cancer-relevant targets, such as KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, EGFR, BTK, JAK3 and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>. The conventional approach to develop a covalent inhibitor is using a structure-guided design to equip a pre-existing reversible binder with an electrophile to target a nucleophilic residue on the target protein, most typically a cysteine. Alternatively, a recently developed approach involves screening a library of low molecular weight electrophilic fragments followed by medicinal chemical optimization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Resnick et al., 2019</xref>. Here, we used such screening approach to identify the lead covalent fragment MYF-01–37. Subsequent structure-based design to engage a side pocket resulted in development of a more potent covalent TEAD inhibitor MYF-03–69, which inhibits the palmitoylation process of all four TEAD paralogs in vitro by occupying the Y-shaped pocket, disassociates the endogenous YAP-TEAD complex, downregulates YAP-dependent target gene expression, and preferentially impairs the proliferation of mesothelioma cells that exhibit defects in Hippo signaling.

Given that the site of covalent modification is located at the opening of the palmitate binding pocket, we analyzed the TEAD palmitate pockets from multiple crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pobbati et al., 2015</xref>. All the structures aligned well, indicating a conserved and relatively inflexible pocket. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, docking of MYF-01–37 and TEAD2 revealed that MYF-01–37 binds in a tunnel formed by side chains of hydrophobic residues F233, F251, V252, V329, V347, M379, L383, L387, F406, and F428. We also identified a side pocket lined with hydrophilic side chains contributed by S331, S345, S377, and Q410. We hypothesized that we could improve potency and selectivity for our covalent ligands by introducing polar interactions and shape complementarity to this side pocket. Therefore, we predicted that the optimized binding pocket is Y-shaped with the targeted cysteine at one end, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic pockets at the other two ends. We envisioned that occupying the hydrophilic side pocket will also provide chance to incorporate polar moiety, leading to reduced global hydrophobicity and more druglike molecules. With this rationale, a variety of hydrophilic groups were introduced to the pyrrolidine ring at <italic>trans</italic>-position relative to the trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety, leading to synthesis of a focused library of Y-shaped molecules, with representatives shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>. We employed an in vitro palmitoylation assay that uses an alkyne-tagged palmitoyl CoA as the lipidation substrate and clickable biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), to screen this series of compounds for their ability to inhibit palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We observed that the <italic>para</italic> substituted trifluoromethyl benzyl is superior to <italic>meta</italic> substituted trifluoromethyl benzyl (MYF-02–111 vs. MYF-03–42). We then replaced pyrazole by a substituted triazole to explore the hydrophilic pocket (MYF-03–135, MYF-03–162, MYF-03–138, MYF-03–146, MYF-03–69), and observed a sensitivity to various substitutions at C4 position of the triazole ring. For example, tetrahydropyran and pyridine enhanced the activities, whereas piperidine and pyridone were much less favored. In addition, we noticed that extending the hydrophobic tail of MYF-01–37 allowed more complete occupancy of the hydrophobic channel. Further modifications of the groups occupying the hydrophobic tunnel did not yield further improvement on the potency compared to trifluoromethyl benzyl (MYF-03–137, MYF-03–139), implicating restrict requirement for a hydrophobic moiety. Amongst this series of compounds, we identified MYF-03–69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) as the most potent compound. The preferred stereochemistry on pyrrolidine ring was predicted by pocket analysis and docking results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To validate this, we compared the inhibitory activity of MYF-03–69 with its enantiomer MYF-03-69E in TEAD2 palmitoylation assay. The results indicated that compared with MYF-03–69, the enantiomer significantly lost activity at 2.5 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Recombinant TEAD2 YBD was incubated with MYF-03–69, followed by mass spectrometry. Incubation with 10-fold molar excess of MYF-03–69 at room temperature for 1 hr led to 100% labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and follow-up trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis confirmed C380 as the modified residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This covalent bond formation and the exact binding mode was further validated by obtaining a high-resolution co-crystal structure of TEAD1 YBD in complex with MYF-03–69 (1.68 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unambiguous electron density of a covalent bond was observed between TEAD1 C359 (analogous to C380 in TEAD2) and the acrylamide warhead of MYF-03–69 with the remaining part of the molecule adopting a Y-shape and establishing specific interactions with the hydrophobic pocket and hydrophilic patch as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). MYF-03–69 was completely buried in the lipid pocket with the <italic>para</italic>-trifluoromethyl benzyl group extended along a lipid trajectory, forming extensive hydrophobic interactions with side chains of A223, F239, V240, A292, I366, and F407. The 3-pyridinyl group occupied the side pocket, forming a favorable water-bridged hydrogen bond network with adjacent S310 and Y312 via pyridinyl nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Overall, high-resolution structural analysis confirms that MYF-03–69 forms covalent attachment with the TEAD cysteine that is the site of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, and that the elaborated molecule forms specific interactions via both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions surrounding the targeted cysteine which differs from the reported covalent TEAD inhibitor K-975 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MYF-03–69 binds in TEAD palmitate pocket covalently through the conserved cysteine.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The mass labeling of intact TEAD2 protein by MYF-03–69.

Preincubation of all recombinant TEAD1-4 YBDs with MYF-03–69 potently inhibited palmitoylation with similar IC<sub>50</sub> values at submicromolar concentrations, indicating that MYF-03–69 is a pan-TEAD inhibitor.

In order to investigate whether MYF-03–69 impairs YAP-TEAD interaction, we conducted an endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment to monitor YAP-TEAD interactions in the presence of the compound. Notably, 24 hr treatment of NCI-H226 cells with MYF-03–69 significantly decreased endogenous YAP co-immunoprecipitation with a pan-TEAD antibody, whereas this treatment had minimal effect on TEAD protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In parallel, we also evaluated MYF-03–69-NC and observed no effect on YAP-TEAD association in cells.

In the DMSO control group, although DBIA mapped 12,498 cysteines in total, the TEAD PBP cysteines were not detected. Among 12,498 mapped cysteines, only 7 cysteines were significantly labeled (i.e. exhibited &gt;50% conjugation or CR &gt;2) by 25 µM of MYF-03–69, and all these sites exhibited dose-dependent engagement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The missing TEAD cysteines might be due to low TEAD1-4 protein abundance and/or inability of the PBP cysteines to be labeled by DBIA. DBIA probe can only be applied in cell lysate context, which might also result in the missing labeling on TEAD. To our knowledge, all the proteins with meaningful labeling efficiency (CR &gt;2) cysteine sites are not known to be involved in the YAP/TAZ-TEAD signaling pathway.

These include YAP/TEAD co-dependent cells (red dots), YAP-dependent cells (blue dots), and TEAD-dependent cells (yellow dots). Next, to verify the antiproliferative activity, we chose three sensitive cell lines (94T778, SKHEP-1 and HuCCT1) and three insensitive cell lines (93T449, MIA PaCa-2 and MM.1S) indicated by PRISM screening, as well as two additional cell lines (PC9, HEK293T) that were not included in PRISM screening panel to test in 5-day antiproliferation assay.

We used a stably transfected TEAD luciferase reporter system in NCI-H226 cells to profile transcriptional effect of TEAD inhibitors. Consistently with the results of mCherry reporter system, MYF-03–69 inhibited the transcription of reporter gene at IC<sub>50</sub> of 45 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and interestingly MYF-03–176 was 3-fold more potent with IC<sub>50</sub> of 11 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

The antiproliferative effect of MYF-03–176 in NCI-H226 cells was similar to VT-103 and K-975 but even stronger than MYF-03–69 and compound 2. Although K-975 displayed similar activities in the anti-proliferation assay, it has extremely short half-life compared with MYF-03–176 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

The tumor-bearing mice were randomized and orally administrated MYF-03–176 twice daily for 28 days. Significant antitumor activity with tumor regressions was observed at both 30 mg/kg (average tumor regression of 54%) and 75 mg/kg (average tumor regression of 68%). The anti-tumor activity at the two doses was comparable (p=0.23, 2-way ANOVA). The 30 mg/kg dose was well tolerated with an average body weight gain comparable to vehicle control (data not shown), while at the 75 mg/kg dose, an average wight loss of 5% was observed. However, at this 75 mg/kg dose, three of eight animals demonstrated 12–14% body weight loss.

However, the unstructured nature of YAP/TAZ proteins renders them difficult to target by conventional occupancy-based small molecules. Therefore, the majority of compounds that are known to inhibit YAP activity are targeted at upstream stimulators of YAP/TAZ. In this context, TEADs, key components of Hippo signaling pathway that depend on YAP/TAZ binding for activation of transcriptional activity, have attracted attention. Here, the presence of a well-defined palmitate binding pocket (PBP) on TEADs suggested opportunity for small molecule inhibitor development. However, recent studies have not fully resolved the question of whether occupying TEAD PBP disrupts or stabilizes YAP-TEAD interaction. Chan et al. suggested that palmitoylation of TEAD stabilizes YAP-TEAD interaction<sup>13b</sup>. Holden et al. reported the reversible PBP binder compound 2 had minimal to no disruptive effect on YAP-TEAD interaction biochemically but transformed TEAD into a dominant-negative transcriptional repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holden et al., 2020</xref>. VT series compounds reported by Tang et al. dissociated endogenous YAP-TEAD according to co-IP experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang et al., 2021</xref>, which is consistent with our result of MYF-03–69. Other data from MGH-CP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2020</xref> and covalent binder K-975 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref> pointed to the same conclusion while the experiments were performed with exogenous YAP or TEAD. K-975 and TED-347 were reported to disrupt protein-protein interaction between TEAD and YAP peptide in biochemical assay. However, their co-crystal structures indicated no conformation change compared with palmitoylated TEAD. Similarly, superimposition of co-crystal structures of TEADs with MGH-CP1, compound 2, VT105, MYF-03–69 and their corresponding palmitoylated TEADs did not reveal any obvious conformation change or side chain move that might affect YAP binding. Taken all these together, the transcriptional inhibitory effect of these TEAD PBP binders might result from disruption of certain dynamic process of TEAD lifecycle. Recently, several reports elaborated that YAP/TAZ and TEAD undergo lipid-lipid phase separation (LLPS) during transcription process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2019</xref>. One hypothesis is the alkyl chain of palmitoyl might escape from TEAD PBP and expose to outside when forming such functional transcription compartment. The hydrophobic nature of the lipid chain may play a role in organizing the disordered and hydrophobic region of YAP. Thus, replacement of palmitate by these PBP binders leads to incapability of TEAD to organize into transcription machinery, although the direct binding to YAP peptide may not being affected in vitro. The underlying mechanism is remained to be uncovered in the future.</p><p>MYF-03–69 is a covalent compound that we designed to target the conserved cysteine on TEAD, the site of palmitoylation. The starting point for MYF-03–69 was a fragment hit that we identified through screening of a biased covalent fragment library and further optimized using structure-based strategy. Unlike screening reversible fragments which often require significant follow-up efforts to determine binding site, the MS-guided covalent tethering method gives unambiguous information of labeling site in a cost and time efficient way. Unlike previously reported compounds that engage only the hydrophobic PBP, our optimized inhibitor was developed to exploit interactions with not only the PBP but a hydrophilic binding pocket that we have identified during this study. Thus, our optimized inhibitor MYF-03–69 is a Y-shaped molecule which efficiently occupies two pockets, as well as covalently binds the conserved cysteine, which contributed significantly to both potency and specificity. Therefore, we speculated that MYF-03–69 may be employed as a useful tool to interrogate the process of how PBP binder affect TEAD homeostasis. We also propose that further optimization of the basic Y-shaped molecule reported here may yield paralog-selective TEAD inhibitors.</p><p>Aberrant regulation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ-TEAD signaling axis has been recognized as driver for genesis and development of multiple cancers, especially in mesothelioma. Besides the Hippo pathway, diverse signaling pathways such as Wnt, TGF-β, EGFR and Hedgehog pathways can also potentiate the activation of YAP/TAZ. Given such essentiality, it is important to ascertain what portion of these YAP/TAZ activated cancers are vulnerable to TEAD inhibition. The pan-TEAD selective nature of MYF-03–69 allowed us to examine this question at the TEAD family level using a panel of more than 900 cancel cell lines. Our results demonstrated that MYF-03–69 exhibited selective antiproliferative effect on YAP or TEAD dependent cancer cells from different lineages including mesothelioma, liver cancer, liposarcoma, and lung cancer. Strong antitumor efficacy in human mesothelioma NCI-H226 CDX model has been achieved with an orally bioavailable compound MYF-03–176 in the same scaffold, which is ready to be tested in various cancer models.

Improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. It is well documented that as a covalent warhead, an aliphatic acrylamide, such as the one we employed in MYF-03-176, is less electrophilic than an aromatic acrylamide (the one found in K-975), and, therefore, more resistant to GSH conjugation and more metabolically stable (J. Med. Chem. 2014, 57, 10072–10079; Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2018, 160, 94–107). Furthermore, to improve pharmacokinetic properties even further, we introduced a fluoride atom to the acrylamide warhead, which further reduced the risk of GSH conjugation as has also recently been reported for the covalent G12C KRAS inhibitor MRTX series (J. Med. Chem. 2020, 63, 6679–6693). Our mouse liver microsome stability and hepatocyte stability results confirm the improved stability of MYF-03-176 over K-975. As evidenced below, K-975 has an extremely short half-life. Across the board, MYF-03-176 exhibits more favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, suggesting that MYF-03-176 is a superior candidate for further drug discovery and development, and an improved pharmacological probe compound. We have included this data in the revised manuscript (Supplementary File 6).</p><p>2. Improved selectivity. We present evidence that MYF-03-69 occupies a new pocket, which provides a better chance to incorporate additional specificity features in addition to determinants of binding to the central palmitate binding pocket. MYF-03-69 design takes advantage of this opportunity and the molecule forms much more extensive contacts with the target (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3 for the superimposition of cocrystal structures of MYF-03-69 [magenta] and K-975 [green] in TEAD1 [PDB code: 7LI5 and 7CMM], respectively). K-975 only occupies the palmitate pocket, which explains why K-975 needs to primarily be hydrophobic. In comparison, MYF-03-69 has a polar group which extends into the side pocket which improves its ‘drug-like’ property and improves its selectivity. We now stress this point more strongly in the text.</p><p>3. Decreased off-target effects. Given the relatively small size, the potency of K-975 might be driven by the high reactivity of its electrophilic warhead, which raises concerns about promiscurity and non-specific cell toxicity. While there is no standard chemo-protemic protocal to evaluate the selectivity of cross labeling on other protein targets, we tested antiproliferative effect of MYF-03-176 and K-975 in NCI-H2452 (mesothelioma cells with intact Hippo signaling). We found that K-975 inhibited cell proliferation much more potently than MY-03-176 (at 30 mM), which suggests that K-975 may have non-specific cell toxicity at high concentration probably due to its reactive covalent warhead.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78810-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>4. Improved in vivo efficacy. In terms of in vivo efficacy, when NCI-H226 cells derived xenograft mice were dosed with 30 mg/kg K-975 twice daily, the tumors kept growing and reach more than 1.5-fold volume on 14<sup>th</sup> day. While with the same dosage, MYF-03-176 showed a significant tumor regression. K-975 did not reach such efficacy even with 100 or 300 mg/kg twice daily, either in NCI-H226 or MSTO-211H CDX mouse model according to the paper (Keneda et al. 2020 Am J Cancer Res 10:4399).Therefore, due to the improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as improved specificity, decreased off-target effects, and improved efficacy MYF-03-176 represents a significant advancement over K-975. We expect that MYF-03-176 will become a pharmacological tool compound of choice for studying TEAD1 biology, as well as offer opportunities for further drug development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting report on a new chemical probe as well as its functional characterization in mesothelioma.

We currently don’t know what caused this behavior, and we can only speculate that this may be due to renal toxicity, given that this effect has been reported in the work describing K-975. In that work, the authors observed proteinuria in rats and monkeys after a two-week treatment, which they linked to potential renal toxicity. Going forward, renal toxicity should be carefully monitored as it might be a likely liability for these compounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Our hope is that MYF-03-176, due to its improved properties over the existing compounds in this space, will become a ‘tool’ compound for the community, thus enabling us and others to discover novel aspects of TEAD- related biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
