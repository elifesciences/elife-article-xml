However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in α-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ancestral protein reconstruction</kwd><kwd>two-component signaling</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32GM126765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nocedal</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laub</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ancestral reconstruction of a signaling pathway reveals the mutations responsible for producing specificity of the two paralogous pathways produced by a duplication event.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein-protein interactions are critical for most cellular functions, including signal transduction pathways. Notably, many protein interaction domains in signaling proteins are members of large paralogous families. For example, in mammals there are dozens of SH2, SH3, and PDZ domains that each mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pawson, 2004</xref>). These paralogous proteins arise through a process of gene or domain duplication, which enables organisms, on an evolutionary timescale, to rapidly expand their signaling repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corrochano et al., 2016</xref>). However, the use of paralogous proteins and domains comes at a cost, requiring cells to avoid deleterious crosstalk between highly similar proteins and domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradley and Beltrao, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siryaporn and Goulian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zarrinpar et al., 2003</xref>). How the process of duplication and divergence unfolds at a molecular level to ensure the specificity of paralogous signaling proteins is not clear.</p><p>The precise mutations required to produce highly specific protein-protein interactions upon duplication is largely unexplored, in part because the underlying duplication events that produced most extant paralogs were ancient events. One approach to tackling this problem involves ancestral protein reconstruction, which uses the phylogenies of extant proteins to infer the sequences of ancient proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hochberg and Thornton, 2017</xref>). This approach has been powerfully applied to examine the evolution of protein-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>), such as steroid hormones and their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>), transcription factor-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Starr et al., 2017</xref>), and protein-drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>). There have been fewer studies applying ancestral protein reconstruction to protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laursen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wheeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wheeler and Harms, 2021</xref>), with most focusing on resurrecting the mutations that impact protein oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hochberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pillai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We sought to understand how paralogous protein-protein interactions arise through duplication and divergence, focusing on bacterial two-component signaling pathways. Two-component signaling systems typically consist of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) that autophosphorylates upon signal recognition, and then transfers a phosphoryl group to a cognate response regulator (RR) that can trigger an intracellular response, frequently through changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschiazzo and Trajtenberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capra and Laub, 2012</xref>). Most bacteria encode dozens of these systems, with each system usually insulated from every other paralogous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galperin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koretke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skerker et al., 2005</xref>). Crosstalk between systems appears relatively rare, and has been shown to produce fitness defects when introduced artificially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capra et al., 2012</xref>), likely due to the decreased ability of a given HK to activate a given RR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rowland and Deeds, 2014</xref>). The specificity of the HK-RR interaction is determined primarily through molecular recognition, with a relatively small number of amino acids in both the histidine kinase and response regulator promoting the cognate interaction and preventing unwanted crosstalk with non-cognate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EnvZ-OmpR duplication and divergence in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two-component signal transduction.

While previous work demonstrated how extant proteins can be rewired to recognize different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>), it is unclear whether duplicated systems resolve crosstalk in a similar way. In particular, it is not known how many of the four proteins involved must acquire mutations to insulate the two protein-protein interfaces. In principle, there are two general models for how interacting proteins could evolve specificity after a duplication event (note that HK-RR systems are typically co-operonic and likely duplicate as an operon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the first model, mutations could occur in both proteins of one system to retain their compatibility with each other while rendering them incompatible with proteins in the other system, leading to insulated pathways. This model is akin to neofunctionalization, in which a new, unique interface evolves in one paralogous system. In the second model, changes in all four proteins, perhaps each of smaller magnitude, could be required to insulate these systems. This model could represent neofunctionalization of both systems or subfunctionalization, where the functions of an ancestral protein are divided between paralogs.</p><p>Here, we use ancestral protein reconstruction to resurrect extinct HK and RR proteins that existed prior to a two-component system duplication event. By characterizing these ancestors, as well as mutational intermediates that descended from them, we elucidate the likely mutational trajectories taken by these proteins that resulted in the insulation of their protein-protein interfaces. We find that just three mutations can largely account for the establishment of specificity in the two pathways. Unexpectedly, these three mutations occur in the HK of one system and the RR of the other. The mutations that arise in one of the HKs serve mainly to prevent crosstalk to the RR of the other system whereas the mutation that arises in the RR serves both to prevent crosstalk and promote interaction with its cognate HK, suggesting that the HK-RR system that existed pre-duplication had the potential for faster phosphotransfer. By exploiting this latent ability to improve the interaction, along with the emergence of mutations that directly block crosstalk, these two HK-RR systems evolved specificity. Thus, our results reveal the likely mutational trajectory responsible for the rapid establishment of specificity in paralogous proteins immediately post-duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EnvZ/OmpR has undergone duplication and diversification in α-proteobacteria</title><p>EnvZ-OmpR is a widespread two-component signaling system that has been best characterized in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Inouye, 2002</xref>). Many, though not all, α-proteobacteria contain two paralogous EnvZ-OmpR systems that appear to descend from a duplication that occurred in a basal α-proteobacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> these two systems are CC1181-1182 and CC2932-2931, which we hereafter refer to as EnvZ1-OmpR1 and EnvZ2-OmpR2. These systems share less than 50% sequence identity, with particularly high divergence in the sensory domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The duplication of EnvZ-OmpR in α-proteobacteria correlates with an absence of the related two-component signaling systems RstAB and CpxAR, which are highly conserved in the γ-proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To determine the specificity of the EnvZ1-OmpR1 and EnvZ2-OmpR2 systems at the level of phosphotransfer, we used biochemical assays with purified proteins in vitro. For EnvZ1 and EnvZ2, we purified the cytoplasmic, catalytic domains (DHp and CA) of each kinase fused to an N-terminal MBP-His<sub>6</sub> tag. For OmpR1 and OmpR2, we purified each full-length response regulator harboring an N-terminal Trx-His<sub>6</sub> domain. To assess phosphotransfer, a given histidine kinase was first incubated with [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP to drive autophosphorylation and then mixed at a 1:4 molar ratio with a response regulator of interest. Samples taken at various time points were examined by SDS-PAGE. At t=0, before adding a response regulator, there was a single band corresponding to the autophosphorylated kinase. At subsequent time points, a second band appeared as the kinase transferred its phosphoryl group to the response regulator; efficient transfer eventually led to depletion of the autophosphorylated kinase. Histidine kinases are typically bifunctional, such that when not autophosphorylated they can drive the dephosphorylation of a response regulator. This activity usually occurs on a slower timescale than phosphotransfer, and explains why the bands corresponding to phosphorylated response regulator often decreased at later time points in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Using these in vitro phosphotransfer assays, we first tested the specificity of each paralogous system from <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. EnvZ1 transferred rapidly to OmpR1, its cognate response regulator, with phosphorylated OmpR1 detected after 10 s and autophosphorylated EnvZ depleted by 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top left). Autophosphorylated EnvZ1 also transferred to OmpR2, but less efficiently as indicated by the slower accumulation of phosphorylated OmpR2 and slower depletion of autophosphorylated EnvZ1, with nearly full depletion occurring only by 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top right). Similar patterns were observed for EnvZ2, which transferred very rapidly to OmpR2, but quite slowly to OmpR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To compare the rates of transfer from different histidine kinases, we quantified the level of autophosphorylated kinase in each phosphotransfer reaction over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The rate at which the autophosphorylated kinase decreases is a proxy for the rate of phosphotransfer. (Each histidine kinase is stably phosphorylated over 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>)). By this measure, each EnvZ paralog exhibited a clear preference for its cognate response regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although EnvZ1 shows a weaker preference for its cognate response regulator in these assays than does EnvZ2, EnvZ1 showed a strong preference for OmpR1 in an in vitro competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and even modest substrate preferences in vitro can result in significant in vivo insulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClune et al., 2019</xref>). We conclude that each histidine kinase has a preference for its cognate, co-operonic response regulator compared to the paralogous response regulator. Further, these results indicated that since the duplication event that created the EnvZ-OmpR paralogs in α-proteobacteria, each protein-protein interaction has diverged to generate paralog specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ancestral protein reconstruction reveals early acquisition of paralog specificity</title><p>To determine the evolutionary trajectory that resulted in the diversification and phosphotransfer insulation of the EnvZ-OmpR paralogs in α-proteobacteria, we used ancestral protein reconstruction to infer the sequences of the ancestral proteins. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred for 200 matched pairs of cognate histidine kinase-response regulators from the EnvZ-OmpR family and other closely related two-component signaling system families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; full phylogeny in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This matched HK-RR phylogeny was found to be largely concordant with phylogenies based on HK or RR sequences alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on the matched HK-RR phylogeny, we identified the maximum a posteriori EnvZ (catalytic domains only) and OmpR sequences immediately prior to the duplication, and immediately after the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>; full alignments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). This duplication event was quite ancient, having occurred near the origin of the α-proteobacteria ~1900 million years (Ma) ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Luo, 2021</xref>), and these ancestral sequences share only ~50% identity with the extant proteins in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

We then compared the ability of ancestral histidine kinases pre- and post-duplication to transfer to a given post-duplication response regulator. We found that transfer from either ancHK or ancHK1 to ancRR2 was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right), suggesting that ancHK1 did not acquire mutations to prevent crosstalk with ancRR2. In contrast, we found that ancHK2 transferred to ancRR1 much more slowly than did ancHK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left), suggesting that ancHK2 must have acquired mutations post-duplication that prevent crosstalk with ancRR1 (all transfers shown together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the ability of ancRR, ancRR1, and ancRR2 to be phosphorylated by ancHK1, finding that ancRR was not phosphorylated more rapidly than ancRR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left), indicating that ancRR2 did not acquire mutations that prevent crosstalk with ancHK1. We also compared the ability of ancRR, ancRR1, and ancRR2 to be phosphorylated by ancHK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). In this case, we find that ancRR1 was phosphorylated much more slowly than ancRR, indicating that ancRR1 must have acquired mutations that prevent crosstalk with ancHK2. These findings were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty, as we observed a similar pattern with the alternative ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>). We concluded that of the two response regulators produced by a duplication of ancRR only ancRR1 acquired mutations promoting insulation of the two paralogous pathways.</p><p>To quantify the change in specificity among ancestral proteins, we measured initial rates of phosphotransfer to estimate ratios of specificity constants. For a given histidine kinase, the ratio of specificity constants (k<sub>cat</sub>/k<sub>M</sub>) for two response regulators represents an approximate measure of substrate specificity, and likewise for a given response regulator the ratio of transfer from two different histidine kinases represents an approximate measure of specificity. Comparing the ratios of specificity constants of the ancestral histidine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we found that both ancHK and ancHK1 showed little kinetic preference, whereas ancHK2 showed an ~28-fold kinetic preference for ancRR2 relative to ancRR1, supporting the idea that the kinetic preference of ancHK1 did not change significantly post-duplication while that of ancHK2 did. For the response regulators, we observed the opposite pattern, with both ancRR and ancRR2 showing modest kinetic preferences for transfer from ancHK2 (~1.5 and 1.8-fold, respectively) and ancRR1 showing a strong preference for ancHK1 (~4.5 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken all together, our results indicate that just two of the four paralogs, ancHK2 and ancRR1, acquired mutations that significantly alter their protein-protein interaction specificity in order to prevent crosstalk between the paralogous systems.</p><p>Reconstructing ancestral proteins is inherently probabilistic, and there is a degree of uncertainty associated with any reconstructed protein. To ensure that our conclusions were robust to this uncertainty, we reconstructed ‘AltAll’ alternative sequences for the six pre- and post-duplication ancestors using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eick et al., 2017</xref>). In short, for every position at which multiple residues had posterior probabilities &gt;20%, the second most likely residue was included. These alternative ancestors were then tested for their ability to transfer to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Some of the alternative ancestors transferred more slowly than the primary ancestors. However, as with the primary ancestors, we found that just two of the alternative ancestors, ancHK2-alt and ancRR1-alt, showed significantly different transfer specificity when compared to the pre-duplication ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>).

We first introduced the substitutions R27Q and E29A separately and together into ancHK and measured phosphotransfer to ancRR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Relative to the parental protein, ancHK, both individual substitutions slowed transfer to ancRR1, with significantly less transfer observed at 2 min. When combined, these two substitutions decreased transfer to ancRR1 further, with a rate of transfer now comparable to that observed with ancHK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, H</xref>). These substitutions did not have a significant effect on transfer to ancRR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Thus, these two substitutions alone are sufficient to slow transfer from ancHK to ancRR1 and likely account for the major changes in ancHK2 that occurred post-duplication to help drive the insulation of the two paralogous pathways.</p><p>We then tested the effect of the substitution R11E in ancRR on transfer from ancHK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Together, these results demonstrate that just three mutations – two in ancHK and one in ancRR – are sufficient to confer specificity to these EnvZ-OmpR paralogs at the level of phosphotransfer. Further, these results indicate that changes in just two of the four proteins, ancHK2 and ancRR1, which are notably not cognate partners, were required to insulate these systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Identification of a mutation that enhances EnvZ-OmpR interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phosphotransfer from ancHK1 (left) and ancHK (right) to ancRR, ancRR + R11E, and ancRR1 at 0, 2, and 5-min timepoints.

Because there were no differences in the six strongly covarying residues between ancHK and ancHK1 or between ancRR and ancRR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we hypothesized that mutations in ancRR1 must have been responsible for this specificity change.

This result suggests that a single mutation in ancRR was sufficient to both improve the ancestral interaction and help prevent crosstalk with the new paralog ancHK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This finding further suggests that the ancestral ancHK-ancRR interaction was not optimized for the most rapid possible phosphotransfer, and that ancHK1 evolved a preference for ancRR1 by simply improving the ancHK1-ancRR1 interaction such that this transfer outcompetes crosstalk to ancRR2.</p><p>To better understand why the R11E mutation in ancRR might improve phosphotransfer from ancHK, we used AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) to predict the structure of the ancHK-ancRR and ancHK-ancRR1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These structures suggested that substituting an arginine at position 11 in ancRR with a glutamate enables ancRR1 to form a salt bridge with R27 in ancHK and ancHK1. The emergence of this salt bridge may explain why the R11E substitution improves the interaction of ancRR1 with ancHK and ancHK1.</p><p>Although we observed, and can largely account for, paralog specificity in the ancestors that arise shortly after the duplication event, the extant proteins in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> exhibit more paralog specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that subsequent mutations further insulated these paralogous protein interfaces.

But little has been done to investigate how gene duplication events impact protein-protein interactions. Here, we showed that this technique can be used to simultaneously reconstruct two interacting proteins, and we used these ancestors along with mutational intermediates to determine the evolutionary trajectory that allowed for the generation of new, insulated protein interaction interfaces.</p><p>In the case where a two-component signaling system, usually encoded as a bicistronic operon, is duplicated, two paralogous protein interaction interfaces are generated. If these two interaction interfaces are to ultimately support two separate signaling pathways, they must acquire mutations that somehow prevent detrimental crosstalk and ensure interaction specificity. For all two-component systems, and indeed for virtually all protein-protein interactions, the mutational trajectories responsible for establishing such specificity in paralogs post-duplication are unknown. Generally speaking, specificity can be generated via either (i) mutations in one of the paralogous systems such that the interacting proteins maintain their interaction while eliminating interaction with the paralogous system or (ii) mutations in proteins from both systems to generate specificity of both paralogous interfaces. In the case of the EnvZ/OmpR duplication in α-protebacteria, our results support the latter model that mutations in both paralogous systems were required to insulate these interfaces. Somewhat surprisingly, however, we found that changes in just two proteins (ancHK2 and ancRR1) were sufficient to establish specificity, rather than changes to all four proteins. This finding suggests that both protein interaction interfaces were impacted by the duplication event, and that a new two-component signaling system was not generated entirely via neofunctionalization of one system. Instead, proteins from both systems had to change to generate signaling specificity. It remains unclear if this mode of diversification represents the norm for duplicated two-component signaling systems, or duplicated interacting proteins more generally. Further characterization of ancestral interacting proteins will be required to determine whether this mechanism of insulation is commonplace.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A small set of substitutions was sufficient to generate insulated protein interfaces</title><p>Previous work has shown that a small number of historical substitutions can have significant consequences for the specificity of protein binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>), protein binding to small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>), and protein multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finnigan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pillai et al., 2020</xref>). For two-component signaling systems, substitutions in just a few key residues of the histidine kinase or response regulator can significantly alter the specificity of their interactions and generate new synthetic insulated protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClune et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>). However, it remained unclear if such small sets of mutations were sufficient to establish specificity upon a gene duplication event, and whether the ancestral mutations that drove paralog insulation involve the same residues involved in rewiring the specificities of extant two-component systems. We found that, for the EnvZ-OmpR paralogs in α-proteobacteria, just three key ancestral substitutions (R27Q and E29A in ancHK2, and R11E in ancRR1) were indeed sufficient to establish specificity upon duplication, with one additional subsequent mutation (L26F in ancHK1) sufficient to establish specificity that resembles the specificity observed in the extant <italic>C. crescentus</italic> systems. These findings indicate that new, insulated two-component signaling pathways can readily evolve via gene duplication and the subsequent accumulation of just a few key substitutions.</p><p>The insulation of the paralogous ancHK1-ancRR1 and ancHK2-ancRR2 interfaces was primarily accomplished by weakening the interaction between ancHK2 and ancRR1, as well as strengthening the interaction between ancHK1 and ancRR1. This evolutionary path relied on the fact that the ancestral interaction, ancHK-ancRR, was not fully optimized for rapid phosphotransfer. Although this interaction was likely fully functional prior to the duplication event, the ability of the R11E substitution in ancHK to increase the rate of transfer from ancHK (and ancHK1) allowed the diversification of these paralogous interfaces by strengthening one of the two cognate interactions. We speculate that other two-component signaling systems and other protein-protein interactions that are similarly non-optimal may be particularly well-suited to duplication and divergence. It is worth noting that we cannot rule out the possibility that the lack of optimality we see in the ancestral sequences may be due to errors in the ancestral sequence reconstruction. However, we believe this is unlikely as we have identified two independent mutations (R11E in ancRR and L26F in ancHK1) that improve the ancHK1-ancRR1 interface.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How novel protein-protein interactions evolve</title><p>Both selection and neutral drift are important in the generation of evolutionary novelty. For two-component signaling systems, it remains an open question whether the changes that result in insulation of these systems generally accumulate slowly over evolutionary time through drift, or whether strong selection drives insulation of these systems. In the case of α-proteobacterial EnvZ-OmpR systems, we found that after a gene duplication event there was a rapid change in just a few key residues that dictate protein interaction specificity. Subsequent to this burst of changes, there were many mutations that accumulated in these paralogous proteins, but these mutations do not seem to have made major contributions to the insulation of these systems. This sequence of events suggests that strong selection against crosstalk occurs immediately post-duplication followed by long periods of relative stasis in the key specificity-determining residues and neutral accumulation of changes elsewhere in these proteins.</p><p>We have determined the likely evolutionary trajectory that resulted in the diversification of the two paralogous EnvZ-OmpR paralogous systems in α-proteobacteria. In this case, a small set of mutations in two non-cognate proteins was largely sufficient to establish insulation of the two pathways. Whether similar trajectories have been followed to establish other paralogous two-component signaling pathways remains an open question, but it seems unlikely that a single model will account for the mechanism of divergence of these systems in general. Our work also focused entirely on the two systems that were produced by a duplication event. However, prior work has indicated that the avoidance of crosstalk with other, existing paralogs following a duplication event can also select for changes in specificity residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capra et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies of how paralogs emerge, using similar ancestral reconstruction methods as used here, promises to shed more light on the general principles and mechanisms by which two-component signaling pathways, and other protein-protein interactions found throughout biology, evolve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ancestral protein reconstructions</title><p>EnvZ and OmpR homologs from the ProGenomes database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mende et al., 2020</xref>) were identified using HMMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eddy, 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Karina B Xavier as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. In general, all four reviewers found the manuscript solid and the results exciting, and thus suitable for publication for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there is still a major point that needs additional clarification. Below is a list of essential revisions to help improve the clarity of the work. Additionally, you can also find at the end of this letter the separate &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; written by each of the reviewers which should help to improve the manuscript and to understand the rationale of each of the reviewers. We hope you will use this information to improve your manuscript, but you do not need to reply to each of the individual comments from the reviewers, you only need to reply the essential points summarized here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 3 raises concerns about the approach used in the present study for the ancestral sequence reconstruction and proposes an alternative approach. We recommend that the authors consider/discuss the approach proposed (see first weakness raised by reviewer #3). It is unclear if this approach will change the results significantly, and if so, if additional experiments would be needed. It is important that the authors clarify this point by responding to this letter, while preparing a revised submission. Depending on the results additional experiments might be needed. In the case that additional experiments are necessary, we invite you to respond with a proposed plan for the additional experiments required to revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found the paper clear and technically sound. I have no major recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors' propose (based on their data for EnvZ-OmpR) that &quot;strong selection against crosstalk occurs immediately post-duplication followed by long periods of relative stasis.&quot; I agree with this interpretation, but feel it would be bolstered by more biological context. It would be helpful to include a description of the biological role of EnvZ-OmpR, and some discussion regarding the possible fitness costs of cross-talk (or conversely, fitness benefits conferred by evolving a new paralogous pair).</p><p>2) The authors state that the extant EnvZ-OmpR pairs (EnvZ1-OmpR1 and EnvZ2-OmpR2) are only 50% identical to each other and that the ancestral sequences are only 50% identical to the extant sequences. However, I would appreciate more discussion of sequence identity early in the results section entitled 'Ancestral protein reconstruction reveals early acquisition of paralog specificity'. In particular, how identical are ancHK1-ancRR1 to ancHK2-ancRR2, and how identical are these two pairs to ancHK-ancRR?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a number of suggestions on the presentation:</p><p>1. I found myself flipping back and forth between Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig S5 a lot. It might make the overall patterns clearer to summarize the various specificities in a large HK x RR graphic. Maybe have ancHK, ancHK1, ancHK2, ancHK+R27Q/E29A on the left and ancRR, ancRR1, ancRR2, ancRR+R11E on the top? You could either show results with gels, or maybe with a heat map where intensity represents activity?</p><p>2. On Fig 3F and S4 the fold-preference color scale threw me off for a bit. I think this is because the mutation/arrow side of the graphic encodes HK/RR vertically and fold preference horizontally; the color bar encodes fold preference vertically. Maybe put color bar horizontal on the bottom?</p><p>3. You mentioned alternate reconstructions on p. 9, but didn't introduce those alternate reconstructions until p. 11. Maybe add a sentence about alternate reconstruction to the initial description of ASR?</p><p>4. The supports were illegible in Fig S2. In the main text, the &quot;*&quot; notation works for your aLRT. In the supplement, it would be helpful to see the raw values, at least for the main ancestors.</p><p>5. Related to #4, it would be helpful to report the mean posterior probabilities for the ancestors in the main text, rather than making readers dig through Fig S4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors used a rather outdated approach to building the bacterial species tree (Hug et al., 2016). A more robust, standardized bacterial taxonomy is available (DH Park et al., 2018 Nat Biotech), including download options (https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). This should not affect the overall results, given the fact that relationships on the class level (alphaproteobacteria) revealed by the two methods should be similar, but it might be worth checking.</p><p>2) Fig. 1C suggests that both paralogous systems are the subject to gene loss in a somewhat equal manner. However, in Fig. 2A (and Suppl. Fig. 2), the number of sequences in EnvZ2-OmpR2 cluster is twice smaller than in EnvZ1-OmpR1 cluster. How representative Cluster 2 is compared to Cluster 1? Was there a sporadic loss throughout alphaproteobacteria or is the system missing from a specific, rather large clade? The latter potentially might skew the comparison.</p><p>3) Suppl. Fig. 2: ancestors of EnvZ2-OmpR2 should be labeled as &quot;ancHK2-ancRR2&quot; (in green).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77346.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 3 raises concerns about the approach used in the present study for the ancestral sequence reconstruction and proposes an alternative approach.

It is important that the authors clarify this point by responding to this letter, while preparing a revised submission. Depending on the results additional experiments might be needed. In the case that additional experiments are necessary, we invite you to respond with a proposed plan for the additional experiments required to revise the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern and have added additional analysis to address it. To ensure the concatenated phylogenies do not contain artifacts, we have built independent phylogenies based on HK-only and RR-only alignments. We find that the trees are largely concordant, with no changes in the membership of the EnvZ1/OmpR1 and EnvZ2/OmpR2 clades studied here, and only subtle changes in the placement of some of the outgrouping sequences. This is now shown in a new supplemental figure (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2) and referenced in the Results (first paragraph of “Ancestral protein reconstruction reveals early acquisition of paralog specificity”).</p><p>Furthermore, we have computationally reconstructed ancestors based on these HK- and RR-only phylogenies and find them to be highly similar to those based on our concatenated alignment, with no changes in the key residues identified here as important in diversification. Importantly, many of the positions that vary between the matched and individual phylogenies have already been mutated in our “alt-all” alternative ancestors. Here are the exact numbers for each of the major ancestors in the paper:</p><p>ancHK: differs at 11 positions, 8 already tested in alt-all ancHK1: differs at 23 positions, 17 already tested in alt-all ancHK2: differs at 12 positions, 11 already tested in alt-all ancRR: differs at 26 positions, 16 already tested in alt-all ancRR1: differs at 28 positions, 14 already tested in alt-all ancRR2: differs at 17 positions, 13 already tested in alt-all</p><p>Given that our “alt-all” ancestors incorporated between 29 and 43 point mutations and still behaved similarly, we believe it is unlikely that the relatively small number of outstanding changes are likely to produce significantly different specificity. We have added two additional supplemental figures (Figure 2 —figure supplements 4 and 5) to show the alignments for these HK-only and RR-only ancestors compared to our matched ancestors and the alt-all ancestors and which positions differ between them. We have also added a sentence to the Results section discussing the similarity between the sequences produced from these different methods of analysis (end of paragraph 1 of “Ancestral protein reconstruction reveals early acquisition of paralog specificity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors' propose (based on their data for EnvZ-OmpR) that &quot;strong selection against crosstalk occurs immediately post-duplication followed by long periods of relative stasis.&quot; I agree with this interpretation, but feel it would be bolstered by more biological context. It would be helpful to include a description of the biological role of EnvZ-OmpR, and some discussion regarding the possible fitness costs of cross-talk (or conversely, fitness benefits conferred by evolving a new paralogous pair).</p></disp-quote><p>Added discussion of cross-talk to introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that the extant EnvZ-OmpR pairs (EnvZ1-OmpR1 and EnvZ2-OmpR2) are only 50% identical to each other and that the ancestral sequences are only 50% identical to the extant sequences. However, I would appreciate more discussion of sequence identity early in the results section entitled 'Ancestral protein reconstruction reveals early acquisition of paralog specificity'. In particular, how identical are ancHK1-ancRR1 to ancHK2-ancRR2, and how identical are these two pairs to ancHK-ancRR?</p></disp-quote><p>Added this to the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a number of suggestions on the presentation:</p><p>2. On Fig 3F and S4 the fold-preference color scale threw me off for a bit. I think this is because the mutation/arrow side of the graphic encodes HK/RR vertically and fold preference horizontally; the color bar encodes fold preference vertically. Maybe put color bar horizontal on the bottom?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have changed this in Figure 3 and S4 (now Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The supports were illegible in Fig S2. In the main text, the &quot;*&quot; notation works for your aLRT. In the supplement, it would be helpful to see the raw values, at least for the main ancestors.</p></disp-quote><p>The raw values have been added to Fig S2 (now Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Related to #4, it would be helpful to report the mean posterior probabilities for the ancestors in the main text, rather than making readers dig through Fig S4.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>2) Fig. 1C suggests that both paralogous systems are the subject to gene loss in a somewhat equal manner. However, in Fig. 2A (and Suppl. Fig. 2), the number of sequences in EnvZ2-OmpR2 cluster is twice smaller than in EnvZ1-OmpR1 cluster. How representative Cluster 2 is compared to Cluster 1? Was there a sporadic loss throughout alphaproteobacteria or is the system missing from a specific, rather large clade? The latter potentially might skew the comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>There was sporadic loss throughout the alpha-proteobacteria, with EnvZ2/OmpR2 lost more frequently than EnvZ1/OmpR1. The species shown in Figure 1C do not correspond 1:1 with the sequences used in Figure 2C, hence the discrepancy. However, highly similar sequences were removed from the phylogenetic analysis to ensure that the analysis was not skewed by oversampling of particular clades.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Suppl. Fig. 2: ancestors of EnvZ2-OmpR2 should be labeled as &quot;ancHK2-ancRR2&quot; (in green).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
