explored at the level of single neurons. Here, we investigated the identity, connectivity, and activity of identified claustrum neurons in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> to understand how the structureâs unique convergence of input and divergence of output support binding information streams. We found that neurons in the claustrum communicate with each other across efferent projection-defined modules which were differentially innervated by sensory and frontal cortical areas. Individual claustrum neurons were responsive to inputs from more than one cortical region in a cell-type and projection-specific manner, particularly between areas of frontal cortex. In vivo imaging of claustrum axons revealed responses to both unimodal and multimodal sensory stimuli. Finally, chronic claustrum silencing specifically reduced animalsâ sensitivity to multimodal stimuli. These findings support the view that the claustrum is a fundamentally integrative structure, consolidating information from around the cortex and redistributing it following local computations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>claustrum</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.35802/204651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Packer</surname><given-names>Adam Max</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/852765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Packer</surname><given-names>Adam Max</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014748</institution-id><institution>Clarendon Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shelton</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P003796/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>Simon JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Lesion and anatomical studies point to a multifunctional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilgan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edelstein and Denaro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Patru and Reser, 2015</xref>), with CLA reciprocally connected with large swaths of cortex in a projection pattern that has been previously described as a âcrown of thornsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>). Recent research has made it increasingly clear that this connectivity is not uniform, with CLA preferentially projecting to prefrontal and midline cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zingg et al., 2018</xref>). These projections appear to be organized into connectivity-defined modules within the CLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marriott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gattass et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remedios et al., 2010</xref>), leading to functional selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atlan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>). However, it has yet to be determined the extent to which this connectivity is specified and combined at the level of single CLA neurons. Here, we seek to address this deficit by providing a detailed analysis of CLA circuits and cell types from intraclaustral, corticoclaustral, and claustrocortical perspectives, thereby building a comprehensive platform for our future understanding of CLA function.</p><p>Despite the difficulties presented by the challenging anatomy and broad connectivity of the CLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zingg et al., 2018</xref>), progress in identifying CLA cell types and circuit motifs in vitro has illuminated some aspects of how CLA neurons are wired and the implications this may have for their computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>). For example, cortical projections to the CLA target efferent-defined modules and activate a dense network of feed-forward inhibition via local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ham and Augustine, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">LeVay and Sherk, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith and Alloway, 2010</xref>). Recently, it has been discovered that cell types in the CLA of mice are responsive to inputs from more than one cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). However, these findings specifically address the input of only one cortical area onto single CLA neurons at a time and do not address which CLA neurons may be summing inputs from different areas in the same experiment. Nor do they address whether any computations within the CLA itself can occur, given the reach and strength of local inhibitory networks and the apparent sparsity of excitatory-excitatory connectivity in the coronal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Orman, 2015</xref>). Although several studies have thoroughly documented the dense connectivity of the CLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ham and Augustine, 2022</xref>), the question of whether individual CLA neurons participate in a single, dedicated network or in potentially several networks remains unresolved and has broad implications for our further understanding of CLA function.</p><p>Here, we employed a retrograde labeling strategy to unequivocally identify a specific subpopulation of retrosplenial-projecting CLA neurons (CLA<sub>RSP</sub>) and characterize their intrinsic electrophysiological and morphological properties among other CLA neurons. We then leveraged our knowledge of this population to understand how projection- and electrophysiologically defined CLA cell types map onto CLA connectivity by investigating intraclaustral, corticoclaustral, and claustrocortical circuits. Finally, we measure the activity of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons in vivo and investigate how chronic CLA silencing affects behavior in a variety of assays. The results obtained through this investigation provide evidence of the CLA as an intrinsically multimodal structure, with single neurons being capable of combining and therefore integrating afferent and local input in a manner that is dependent on cell type and projection target.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomical delineation of CLA in mice via retrograde tracing</title><p>We first sought to define a specific subset of CLA neurons based on their efferent connectivity. To label CLA neurons in the adult mouse, we used a retrograde tracing strategy by injecting fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the retrosplenial cortex (RSP), which receives input specifically from the CLA and no CLA-adjacent structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zingg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marriott et al., 2021</xref>). To understand how CLA neurons differentially innervate RSP, we injected CTB488 (green), CTB555 (red), CTB647 (blue) into three separate rostrocaudal locations along the RSP (n=3 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Confocal microscopy imaging of 100 Î¼m-thick coronal sections revealed that each injection labeled spatially overlapping populations of CLA neurons, distinct from the surrounding, unlabeled tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison between injection sites of CTB labeling in CLA across mice showed that the caudal injection site reliably labeled the most cells overall, especially in caudal regions of CLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Further, this strategy consistently demonstrated that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons could be found along the whole CLA length, as defined by other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grimstvedt et al., 2023</xref>), irrespective of RSP injection location. Moreover, the level of overlap between CLA neurons projecting to different regions of RSP varied depending on the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We chose the caudal-most RSP injection site for the remainder of the study due to the dense and highly specific labeling of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interrogation of a projection-defined CLA neuronal subpopulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the injection strategy.

E1 and E2 neurons could be divided by spike amplitude adaptation normalized from the first action potential: E1 monophasically declined while E2 showed a biphasic pattern, initially declining sharply before recovering slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). E2 neurons could be further differentiated from E1 neurons by the presence of an afterdepolarization potential that led to a bursting spike doublet at higher current injections (ADP, 1.9Â±2.3 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Interneurons, by contrast, were readily categorized into four groups (high rheobase [HR], fast-spiking [FS], low threshold [LT], irregular [IR]) using unsupervised methods alone (average inhibitory silhouette score = 0.853, k=4 clusters; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Conversely, HR cells had a large rheobase and low input resistance with a significant delay to spike at threshold. Morphologically, HR interneurons were sparsely spiny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>) with a dense dendritic arbor similar to that reported for neurogliaform cells. Finally, IR cells fired irregularly and very infrequently compared to other types.

Qualitatively, CLA<sub>PL</sub> neurons occupied a larger area of the CLA and made up a larger share of CLA neurons overall compared to CLA<sub>RSP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). While fewer CLA<sub>PL</sub> neurons were CLA<sub>RSP</sub>-responsive than CLA<sub>RSP</sub>-unresponsive (presumably because some of these were also CLA<sub>RSP</sub> but not expressing opsin), they were not significantly more likely to be CLA<sub>RSP</sub>-responsive than non-CLA<sub>PL</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Taken together, these experiments point toward a complex intraclaustral circuitry that is predisposed toward inter-module connectivity, for example that CLA neurons receiving input from a given cortical area preferentially target CLA neurons projecting to a different area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). How this circuit logic influences intraclaustral computations has critical implications for the signals the CLA transmits downstream.</p><p>To address whether such connectivity exists in the rostrocaudal plane, we next turned to a horizontal slice preparation using fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD RH-795; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>, n=13 animals, 28 recordings) to examine potential l connectivity in vitro. Electrical stimulation of the rostral pole of the CLA resulted in a traveling wave of increased voltage that spread to caudal CLA over a period of 10â15ms. Blocking glutamate receptors by bath application of DNQX and APV abolished these responses, supporting a role for glutamatergic transmission within and along the rodent CLA. This transmission was bidirectional as electrical stimulation of caudal CLA elicited a wave of depolarization toward the rostral pole with similar temporal properties. These experiments collectively point to extensive and bidirectional intraclaustral connectivity, engaging both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a manner defined more by efferent target than electrophysiological type per se. This further supports the idea that CLA contains the necessary circuitry to join extraclaustral inputs with a complex and cross-modular internal CLA network.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Corticoclaustral inputs define a modular spatial organization</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the CLA contains topographic zones of input and output in mice, yet it remains uncertain how these zones are organized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2022</xref>.

However, there was variation in the percentage of responsive CLA neurons with stimulation of axons from frontal cortical areas â PL and ACAa having the highest probability of evoking a response in both CLA<sub>RSP</sub> and non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons. Stimulation of axons arising from sensorimotor areas such as AUDd and MOp had the lowest probability of evoking an EPSP with the notable exception of VISam. Further, CLA neurons were more likely to receive input from frontal cortical regions if they projected onward to RSP, that is were CTB+. This relationship was weaker or absent in areas, such as MOp and AUDd, suggesting differences in the input-output routes of these CLA neurons. Results from these experiments confirm the modularity of CLA inputs and how those inputs map onto its outputs but also raise questions regarding how the inputs may be combined onto single CLA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dual-color optogenetic mapping reveals integration of cortical inputs</title><p>One of the posited functions of CLA is to affect sensorimotor âbindingâ or information integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crick and Koch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edelstein and Denaro, 2004</xref>, defined here as single-cell responsiveness to more than one input pathway, for example being capable of combining and therefore integrating these inputs.

We found that a subset of CLA neurons receives inputs from more than one cortical area (66/259 of all tested cells, 42/174 for CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons). Similar to our single opsin observations, CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons were more likely to be responsive to inputs from frontal areas than they were from other areas, although at least some neurons were found to respond to both inputs in all examined pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Integration was most common between ACAa and ORB (60.7%) and lowest between VISam and AUDd (16.7%). Less integration was observed when only one or neither of the input cortices was located in the frontal cortex. The measured probability of integration, however, was slightly higher than expected (ratio of measured:expected = 1.26 +- 0.12) based on the probability of receiving inputs from each cortical area individually, indicating that integration among single CLA neurons in these experiments occurred at a likelihood greater than response probabilities to individual cortical inputs would imply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the electrophysiological identities of CLA neurons themselves, only E2 and FS types received input from every cortical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similarly, only ACA sent outputs to every CLA cell type, while AUDd sent outputs to just two (E2 and FS). IR cells were the only type found to receive input from only one area (ACA, n=6 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), although no IR neurons were recorded in experiments testing inputs from PL, MOp, AUDd, or VISam (sampling bias also affects the HR class, from which only 11 cells were recorded in optogenetic experiments). Overall, both excitatory classes were differentially innervated by the cortex. For example, 73% of all VISam inputs were to E2 neurons, while only 4% were allocated to E1 neurons. By contrast, 20% of MOp inputs and 25% of PL inputs were devoted to E1 neurons, while comparatively fewer CLA inhibitory types received inputs from these regions (10% and 11% in total to inhibitory neurons, respectively) than from ENTI (cumulatively 43% of inputs).</p><p>Integration of cortical inputs was more prevalent in certain cell types as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). 30.1% of E2 neurons and 47.6% of all recorded FS interneurons were found to integrate cortical input, irrespective of the combination of cortical input regions, congruent with their response probabilities to individual cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A large proportion (20.8%) of LT neurons were also found to integrate despite making up less than 10% of all neurons recorded. E1, HR, and IR types showed little to no propensity for more than one cortical input. We find that E2 neurons and FS interneurons are the most likely to integrate information from the cortex, while other excitatory and inhibitory cell types may participate in different circuits or have a dedicated and unitary region of input.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Claustrocortical outputs differentially innervate cortical layers in downstream targets</title><p>To explore how CLA influences the neocortex, we returned to our retro-Cre conditional expression of opsin in CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), focusing on outputs to ACA and RSP as CLA connectivity with these areas is particularly strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Axonal fluorescence from CLA neurons varied by cortical layer in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Cells in ACA or RSP were filled with biocytin during recording for post hoc analysis of their location within the cortical laminae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Optogenetic stimulation of CLA axons evoked both inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cortical neurons during voltage-clamp at holding potentials of 0 mV and â70 mV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly to other experiments, we considered monosynaptic excitatory connections to be those with latencies of 3â12ms, here confirmed with pharmacological controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâJ</xref>, n=9 cells). The longer latency to onset of IPSCs (7â15ms) suggests recruitment of feed-forward inhibition by CLA neurons in both cortical areas, although some short-latency IPSCs could be due to direct long-range inhibitory projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>). However, no direct IPSCs were found after application of TTX and 4AP in control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). PSCs could be evoked relatively evenly across most cortical layers of ACA (n=49 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). In RSP, we observed the highest response probability in L5, but responses in deep layers overall were reduced compared to ACA (n=43 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Finally, we found that excitation and inhibition latencies were statistically different in ACA but not RSP (ACA p=0.0003, RSP p=0.057, CochranâMantelâHaenszel test).

For unimodal stimulus presentations, somatosensory stimuli (whisker) were the most likely to elicit changes in fluorescence, followed by light and then sound (18.8% of recorded axons responded to whisker, 12.1% to light, 10.9% to sound). For pairs of stimuli, the combination of somatosensory and visual stimuli drove the largest changes in fluorescence (19.1%), followed by somatosensory and auditory (15.8%), then auditory and visual (14.1%). The combination of all three stimuli resulted in the largest proportion of activated axons (20.7%), while the blank period was associated with the fewest responsive axons (9.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). 85% of responsive axons were responsive to at least one or more multi-modal trial types.

Of sensory-responsive axons, only 4% of axons were found to display unisensory response patterns, while 96% displayed multisensory response patterns.

Patch-clamp recordings of RSP neurons revealed that TetTox reduced the frequency and magnitude of light-evoked currents in downstream cells, effectively silencing CLA<sub>RSP</sub> output (p=0.0003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CLA silencing reduces sensitivity to multimodal stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of retrograde injection and patching strategy for assessing silencing of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> terminals in cortex.

First, we compared animals injected bilaterally with AAV-retro-iCre-mCherry in RSP and AAV-FLEX-TetTox in CLA (TetTox group) with animals injected with equal volumes of PBS (sham group) during 24/7 home cage recordings using measures of activity, circadian behavior, and tests for anxiety. We found that silencing CLA<sub>RSP</sub> output did not significantly alter the behavior of TetTox animals compared to the sham group. Post hoc histology from these groups revealed increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the CLA and reduced mCherry expression, strongly suggesting full ablation of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons in these experiments.</p><p>We next tested whether the effects of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> axon silencing would be more apparent in a complex sensory or cognitive behavioral paradigm. We trained a cohort of mice with chronic and sham CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silencing on complex behavioral tasks: a multimodal conditioning task and a reversal learning task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7DâJ</xref>, see Materials and methods). In the reversal learning task, mice learned to choose between two nose-poke ports associated with different probabilities (85% and 15% chance, switched after learning the task to threshold). We identified no differences between CLA-silenced and sham groups across a number of metrics including response probability and latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The results from the reversal learning task provide no evidence that CLA silencing affects learning or cognitive flexibility.</p><p>Drawing from our calcium imaging results described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we further assessed how mice learned to link their actions to patterns of uni- and multimodal stimuli in their environment using a multimodal conditioning task. Water-restricted mice were presented with auditory, visual, and combined audiovisual stimuli. Each of the three stimuli was associated with reward delivery at a different nose-poke port, with the reward delivered in response to the first poke to the correct port following stimulus onset, irrespective of whether the animal had initially poked an incorrect port. While mice from both groups learned the structure of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5</xref>), two differences were detected between sham and CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silenced mice. First, we found that CLA<sub>RSP</sub>-silenced mice had significantly lower poke latencies across trial types and outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>). Second, a two-way ANOVA identified a significant interaction when comparing animalsâ sensitivity (the difference in the distributions of the hit rate and false alarm rate) to different trial types (F(2, 52)=5.53, p=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). After correcting for multiple comparisons (Sidak), we found that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silencing specifically impaired animalsâ sensitivity to multimodal stimuli (p=0.001). These results suggest that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silencing specifically reduced animalsâ sensitivity to multimodal stimuli without impacting their responses to unimodal stimuli.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest a nuanced and specific function for the CLA. We found no effect of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silencing on learning or cognitive flexibility in the reversal learning task. However, we observed that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> silencing decreased animalsâ poke latency and sensitivity to multimodal stimuli. This suggests that the integrative properties of the CLA described above may have functional relevance for detecting the coincidence or conjunction of two stimuli in the context of sensory-guided behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The extensive connectivity of the CLA suggests a multifaceted role within the brain. In this study, we exploited the specificity of CLA projections to RSP to explore the electrophysiological diversity of CLA neurons both within the CLA<sub>RSP</sub> module and broader CLA. Further, we used a range of optogenetic and imaging approaches to assess their role in corticoclaustral, intraclaustral, and claustrocortical circuits. Our results show that individual CLA neurons integrate diverse information from across the cortex, that is are responsive in vitro and in vivo to a broad spectrum of cortical input modalities, in a cell-type-specific manner. We find a robust intraclaustral network of excitatory neurons that are differentially responsive to combinations of cortical input based on cell type. In addition, we show that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons innervate the cortex in a region- and layer-specific manner and, when silenced, specifically impair behavioral performance during a multimodal conditioning task.</p><p>Our study builds on previous work to label a specific subset of CLA neurons by using a retrograde tracing strategy that co-opted the highly specific connectivity of the CLA with RSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zingg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marriott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erwin et al., 2021</xref>). RSP is uniquely positioned for use in this technique as it does not receive inputs from structures around the CLA but receives specifically dense innervation from the CLA itself. We found that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons span the rostrocaudal axis of the CLA and align with previously identified markers of the CLA âcoreâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Druga et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Real et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Real et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grimstvedt et al., 2022</xref>). For these reasons, we found this method to be favorable over transgenic or viral labeling used in other studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McBride et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ollerenshaw et al., 2021</xref>). Retrograde tracing from RSP offered a simple method for accurately assessing the anatomical and physiological features of CLA neurons in later experiments.</p><p>Retrograde labeling of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> proved useful for targeted investigations of CLA electrophysiology in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGarry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toledo-Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>). From our recordings across a large population of both CLA<sub>RSP</sub> and non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons, it was evident that a heterogeneous mix of spiny, excitatory neurons and aspiny, inhibitory neurons exists in the CLA, consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Druga, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Spahn and Braak, 1985</xref>). These broad categories could be divided into subgroups consisting of six total electrophysiological types, two excitatory and four inhibitory. Similar to adjacent neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>), excitatory neurons were homogenous from an unsupervised clustering perspective but could nevertheless be differentiated by their AP waveforms and variability in their tendency to project to RSP. Although direct comparisons are difficult, the E1, E2, FS, and LT subtypes closely matched excitatory and inhibitory cell types found in recent investigations of CLA intrinsic electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>). For example, E1 neurons share several characteristics with Type I neurons described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>, including monophasic AP amplitude adaptation, while E2 neurons strongly resemble Type II neurons, specifically in their tendency to fire a burst of strongly adapting spikes.</p><p>Inhibitory neurons, by contrast, were accurately distinguished using unsupervised methods and are similar to those observed in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we found multiple lines of evidence indicating the existence of a substantial subpopulation of inhibitory projection neurons, which have also been observed in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampal areas, entorhinal cortex, and the subplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Melzer and Monyer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MolnÃ¡r and Butler, 2002</xref>), with additional evidence of such cells indicated in previous studies of the CLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitanishi and Matsuo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atlan et al., 2018</xref>). These findings not only highlight the similarity of CLA to other forebrain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruguier et al., 2020</xref>) but also suggest previously unconsidered functional possibilities. The putative monosynaptic inhibitory inputs may provide another route by which CLA exerts a direct suppressive influence on the cortex.</p><p>Hypotheses that position the CLA as affecting cross-modal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calvert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ettlinger and Wilson, 1990</xref>), synchronization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Smythies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Smythies et al., 2014</xref>, or multimodal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crick and Koch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vidyasagar and Levichkina, 2019</xref>) implicitly rely on a substantive intraclaustral excitatory network to link projection neurons across its considerable length. Here, we used a dual-retrograde and conditional opsin expression strategy to understand whether such connections are present in the CLA, as has been debated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zingg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Orman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smith and Alloway, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">LeVay, 1986</xref>). Importantly, our optogenetic stimulation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>) allowed us to remain agnostic to the origin of presynaptic signals in the CLA â a key improvement over paired-patching, which is susceptible to slice-orientation artifacts (e.g. coronal vs. horizontal sectioning). We found that excitatory connections are quite common in the CLA and broadly target most CLA excitatory and inhibitory types. Additionally, we observed that this connectivity was less biased toward inhibitory types than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), but was influenced more by the output target of postsynaptic CLA neurons and the axis along which excitatory connectivity predominantly acts, that is rostrocaudally. Specifically, we observed a difference in the likelihood of excitatory signaling between CLA neurons that was dependent on whether neurons were retrogradely labeled by their projections to RSP or PL. CLA<sub>PL</sub> and non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons were both more likely to receive input from CLA<sub>RSP</sub> than CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons themselves. Combined with our later finding that PL preferentially targets CLA<sub>RSP</sub>, these results provide substantial evidence for cross-modular communication between corticoclaustral input streams.</p><p>Much like CLA efferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marriott et al., 2021</xref>), we found that cortical projections to CLA arrange into modules along the dorsoventral axis, a similar finding to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, certain cortices such as ORB and ACAa projected to CLA<sub>RSP</sub> both medially and laterally in addition to dorsally or ventrally. Physiological investigations of cortical input revealed that CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons are more likely to respond to frontal cortical regions than non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons. CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons were also more likely than non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons to respond to motor and association cortices, despite the stark regionalization of both cortical axons and post-synaptic responses in the CLA. Surprisingly, however, we found that CLA neurons, especially non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons, were far more likely to respond to secondary visual cortex input in vitro, more so than has been reported in primary sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White et al., 2018</xref>). However, we could not assess and compare the absolute response magnitudes to these inputs due to confounds presented by opsin-mediated presynaptic release â differential expression of opsin in presynaptic neurons or between animals could result in erroneous estimates of naturally evoked EPSP amplitudes. Despite this, these findings both confirm the deep ties between CLA and frontal areas associated with top-down cognitive functions and suggest higher responsiveness to more highly processed sensory information.</p><p>The patterning of cortical axons in the CLA of mice is simultaneously segmented, with identifiable dorsal, central, and ventral modules, while also forming an overlapping gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qadir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) that blends input streams to CLA neurons. From an anatomical perspective, we thought it very likely that CLA neurons in mice instantiate multimodal integration at the level of single cells given the overlap of cortical afferents within it, despite previous reports of unisensory modules in the CLA of cats and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remedios et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">LeVay and Sherk, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olson and Graybiel, 1980</xref>). To test whether this was the case, we used a dual-color optogenetic input mapping strategy to assess the responsiveness of CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons and non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> neurons to more than one cortical area in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). As a necessary constraint of our photostimulation paradigm, we did not assess the EPSP response magnitude to the conjunction of stimuli due to photosensitivity of ChrimsonR opsins to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that individual CLA neurons are frequently responsive to multiple different inputs. This was especially true for CLA<sub>RSP</sub> when the cortices in question were both frontal, while the balance of responsiveness shifted to non-CLA<sub>RSP</sub> when other cortical areas were involved. Specifically, we found the E2 and FS CLA cell types to be highly integrative, while other types were much less so. In addition, E2 excitatory neurons were the most likely to project to RSP. Given that RSP is strongly associated with contextual and spatial awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trask et al., 2021</xref>), it is possible that integration of inputs to the CLA by E2 neurons contributes to contextual processing in the RSP and may explain our multimodal conditioning results when these neurons were silenced. Overall, cell type identity, as defined by intrinsic electrophysiology and efferent projection target, influenced the likelihood that a neuron was dual-responsive to afferent input in the CLA in these experiments.</p><p>In vitro cortical optogenetic experiments sought to investigate regional and laminar differences in CLA innervation of the cortex. Recent in vivo electrophysiological evidence points toward differences in excitatory and inhibitory tone elicited by excitation of CLA cell bodies that varies by cortical area and layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atlan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McBride et al., 2023</xref>). Other studies in single cortical regions find more uniform responses to CLA inputs, generally inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atlan et al., 2018</xref>), although electrophysiological studies in cats have found more variable or bidirectional responses in visual cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cortimiglia et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsumoto and Suda, 1982</xref>). We chose to investigate CLA<sub>RSP</sub> connections to ACA and RSP in vitro and in vivo â ACA for the dense connectivity it shares with CLA (and CLA<sub>RSP</sub>) and RSP for the known properties of neurons that project there. We found that CLA axons innervate the cortical layers of ACA and RSP differently, confirming and expanding on results from recent works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McBride et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, ACA was innervated relatively evenly across layers and more so in deep layers than RSP for excitation and inhibition. It is possible, given this, that the cortex-dependent laminar innervation by CLA axons reflects differences in the types of information conveyed to the cortex by CLA neurons or, perhaps, the types of cortical neurons they form synapses with and the dendritic locations on which those synapses occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McBride et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our in vivo calcium imaging experiments identified a population of neurons within the CLA that showed stimulus-locked responses to presentations of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. A large proportion of responsive CLA axons were exclusively activated in trials where two or more stimuli were presented simultaneously. While axons responded inconsistently to the presentation of individual stimuli on a trial-to-trial basis, their responsivity remained consistent between stimuli and through time on average, implying that CLA may not be involved in habituation or adaptation of responses. While the observed responses coincide with sensory stimulation, they may not be sensory per se. We thought that these responses may instead be related to attention, salience, or motor processes occurring as a result of the sensory stimulation, motivating our use of somatosensory and auditory stimuli despite weak direct inputs from these cortices, documented elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remedios et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>). The large proportion of activated axons contrasts with recent studies in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ollerenshaw et al., 2021</xref> in which CLA neurons were infrequently responsive to sensory stimulation in vivo. The disparity between these results may be explained by methodological differences. Both studies used different methods of labeling and recording from CLA neurons: Ollerenshaw et al. used a transgenic line (Gnb4) and calcium imaging via a GRIN lens implant, while ChevÃ©e et al. optotagged neurons based on their projections to somatosensory cortex and recorded extracellular electrical activity. Both these approaches did not explicitly target the same neurons reported here (CLA<sub>RSP</sub>), making comparison difficult. Moreover, the implanted devices used for recording likely resulted in some damage to local circuitry, affecting CLA activity, thus introducing a confound that would further impede one-to-one statistical comparisons. These techniques are also inherently limited in the region of CLA that is recordable at any given time. While axon imaging theoretically permits recording of axons originating throughout CLA, extracellular electrophysiology and implanted optical devices are limited to neurons in the vicinity of the recording device. As a result, each of these studies likely offers a different and possibly non-overlapping account of CLA activity.</p><p>Chronic claustrum silencing specifically reduced animals' sensitivity to multimodal, but not unimodal, stimuli. Previous studies have assessed the effects of both chronic and acute CLA silencing on reversal learning with mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fodoulian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grasby and Talk, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reus-GarcÃ­a et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a nuanced role for the CLA in cognitive flexibility that can only be identified under specific behavioral constraints. Here, the mice tested on the reversal learning task were trained for 10 days, and as such, it is possible that we did not identify differences that might have occurred at later stages of learning. Importantly, the multimodal conditioning task did not force mice to learn an association between stimulus and port as the rewards were not contingent on choosing the correct port. The mice could have earned as many rewards by poking each port once per minute as they could through perfect task performance. Instead, this paradigm asked what information from the environment mice used to guide their behavior. The finding that sham mice could discriminate between unimodal and multimodal stimuli while CLA-silenced animals could not implies that CLA activity may be specifically related to responding to the conjunction of sensory stimuli. While this may provide evidence that the CLA is involved in detecting the coincidence of audiovisual stimuli, there is still debate about whether this constitutes multisensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crick and Koch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Remedios et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ollerenshaw et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, careful examination of CLA activity during multisensory-guided behavior will be necessary in future experiments.</p><p>It is possible that the integration of sensory inputs may take place upstream of the CLA rather than in the CLA itself. For example, the prefrontal cortex projects strongly onto CLA neurons and itself contains neurons responsive to sensory stimulation. Our in vitro results, which found few neurons responsive to the conjunction of sensory cortical input, may indicate that the appearance of sensory integration in vivo could occur elsewhere. In vitro experimentation also does not measure the sensory responsiveness of CLA neurons but rather reveals solely direct, monosynaptic connectivity. Additionally, sensory responsiveness may come from other characteristics of the sensory stimulus such as their salience. It is also important to consider that CLA neurons might be responsive to combinations of stimuli, including unrecorded variables such as the animalâs attentional or motivational states, that might affect their activity in vivo. Finally, different populations of CLA neurons not assessed here may be more responsive to and, therefore, responsible for the processing of direct sensory information in the CLA. Further work here is crucial to determine the nature of the sensory-related signals that the CLA routes to its cortical targets.</p><p>In summary, we find that CLA neurons are broadly capable of synthesizing a wide range of cortical inputs at the level of single neurons, a finding that supports the idea of CLA acting as a cortical network hub. The presence of a robust internal network of excitatory CLA neurons additionally supports the view that the CLA performs local computations. These computations then differentially influence downstream cortical processing in a regional- and layer-specific manner that may depend on the specific CLA output modules that are active at the time. Functionally, the fast monosynaptic connections investigated in this study could give rise to coincidence detection through these integrative and cross-modular CLA networks, providing all-or-none signals to the conjunction of stimuli as they arise in different sensory streams, as suggested elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). CLA neurons may alternatively be involved in yoking together different streams of input based on their temporal synchrony, increasing their activity in a graded manner in response to more synchronous inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruno, 2011</xref>). For example, the internal, cross-modular, and recurrent excitation within the CLA could also allow for a degree of temporal synchronization between its input cortices through reverberant cortico-claustral loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Smythies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vidyasagar and Levichkina, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the integrative properties of the CLA could act as a substrate for transforming the information content of its inputs (e.g. reducing trial-to-trial variability of responses to conjunctive stimuli and/or increasing conjunctive stimuli signal-to-noise). This would allow the CLA to flexibly modulate cortical activity, either through amplifying behaviorally relevant processes, diminishing irrelevant ones, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atlan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murray and Wallace, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The possible functions of CLA activity presented above point directly to and draw from its fundamentally integrative nature at the anatomical and functional levels. The findings shown here suggest that the CLA is involved in the highest levels of behavior, possessing the crucial neural substrates for a diverse and powerful effect on higher order brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal procedures were subject to local ethical approval under PPL #PE5B24716 and adhered to the United Kingdom Home Office (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized under 5% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame before intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg meloxicam and 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine. Animals were then maintained on 1.5% isoflurane and warmed on a heating pad at 37 Â°C for the duration of the procedure. The scalp was sterilized with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol (ChloraPrep). Local anesthetic (bupivacaine) was applied under the scalp two minutes before making the initial incision. The scalp was then incised along the midline and retracted to expose the skull, which was then manually leveled between bregma and lambda. Target regions were found using coordinates derived from the Paxinos &amp; Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas (3rd ed.) and marked onto the skull manually (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for coordinates). Craniotomies were performed using a dental drill (500 Î¼m tip) at 1â3 sites above the cortex. Craniotomies were made exclusively in the right hemisphere unless otherwise noted.

Pipettes were lowered to the surface of the pia at the center of the craniotomy and zeroed before being lowered into the brain. In the case of injections into the CLA, specifically, the coordinates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were intentionally offset in order to avoid the risk of damaging cells in that region with the pipette or by the injection of substances. The pipette was allowed to rest for 2 min before injection of substances, at which point injection took place at 5â10 nl/s. Pipettes were allowed to rest for ten minutes after injection. The incision was sutured with Vicryl sutures and sealed with Vetbond (3 M) after all craniotomies and injections had been made. Mice were then transferred to a fresh cage and allowed to recover. Mice were supplied with edible meloxicam jelly during post-op recovery for additional analgesia.</p><p>Mice to be implanted with cranial windows first received intracranial injections as described above. Once fully recovered from the injection surgery, mice were re-anesthetized for window implantation. Surgical preparation, anesthesia, analgesia, and recovery procedures were the same as for intracranial injection surgeries. Following sterilization of the scalp, a section was removed. The skull was then cleaned to remove the periosteum. An aluminum headplate with an imaging well centered on bregma was then secured in place with dental cement (Super-Bond C&amp;B, Sun-Medical). A 4 mm circular craniotomy centered on bregma was then drilled. After soaking in saline, the skull within the craniotomy was removed. The craniectomy was then flushed with sterile saline to clean any bleeding. A durotomy was then performed over the right hemisphere.

Finally, the slices were washed in 0.01 M PBS for 3x5 min, then mounted and coverslipped.</p><p>Once dry, whole-slice and CLA images were taken at Ã4 and Ã10 magnification (UPlanSApo, 0.16 and 0.4 NA) on an Olympus FV3000 laser scanning confocal microscope. For recovered morphologies, images were taken on the above microscope or a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope at Ã20 magnification and tiled across the z-axis, or on a custom 2 p microscope at Ã16 magnification (Coherent Vision-S laser, Bruker 2PPlus microscope, Nikon 16X0.8 NA objective). Images of post-hoc histology from calcium imaging animals were taken on a Ziess LSM710 at Ã10 magnification tiled across the z-axis, or a Leica epifluorescence microscope (1.6 X). Slices and morphologies were not corrected for tissue shrinkage as a result of fixation. Histological images from animals in the behavioral experiments were taken using a Zeiss Axioscan Z1 automated slide scanner with a 10 x objective.</p><p>GFAP expression was quantified using FIJI (ImageJ). First, ovoid ROIs were drawn surrounding the left and right ventral claustrum of each section. The ROI was drawn by hand using only the MBP image and without reference to the GFAP channel. Next, an ROI for the entire slice was drawn using the default algorithm of the thresholding tool. The mean fluorescence intensity was then recorded for all ROIs. The GFAP fluorescence was then averaged across the two claustrum ROIs on each slice and normalized against the fluorescence of the entire slice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Voltage-sensitive dye imaging</title><p>Slices were stained for 3 min with VSD RH-795 (R649, Invitrogen, 0.5% in ACSF) and imaged in a recording chamber positioned beneath a fluorescence microscope (Axio Examiner, Zeiss). The slices were excited with 535Â±25 nm light (bandpass), reflected by a dichroic mirror (half reflectance wavelength of 580 nm), and epifluorescence was detected using a long-wavelength pass filter (50% transmittance at 590 nm) with a CMOS camera (MiCAM Ultima, BrainVision, Japan; 100_100 pixel array). An electronically controlled shutter built into the light source (HL-151, Brain Vision) was set to open for 500ms before the optical recording was triggered, as a way of avoiding mechanical disturbance caused by the shutter system and rapid bleaching of the dye.</p><p>The optical baseline was allowed to stabilize for 50ms before the delivery of any stimulus. 512 frames at a rate of 1.0ms/frame were acquired in all experiments. Color-coded optical signals were superimposed on the brightfield image to represent the spread of neural activity. The fraction of the optical signal that exceeded the baseline noise was displayed as a heatmap. Baseline noise was reduced by averaging eight identical recordings acquired with a 3 s interval directly in the frame memory. The optical signals were analyzed using BrainVision analysis software. Changes in membrane potential were evaluated in a region of interest (ROI) as the fraction of change in fluorescence (dF/Fmax%), where Fmax equals the highest fluorescence value during the baseline condition of each stimulation. Based on visual inspection of the optical signal, the ROI was chosen as the region where the signal first entered the CLA. The stimulation electrode was a tungsten bipolar electrode with a tip separation of 150 Î¼m.</p><p>A total of 28 recordings were used in these experiments. Stimulations were either elicited at a rostral position of the CL with the signal propagating in the caudal direction or at a caudal position with the signal propagating in the rostral direction. In cases where a single pulse did not elicit measurable activation in the CLA, four or five repetitive stimulations (0.1â0.3 mA, 300 Î¼s, 40 Hz) were used. At least five stimulation cycles were repeated for all experiments to assess if activation had occurred. Latency was measured from the beginning of the stimulus artifact to the onset of the response in the CLA. In some experiments, the recording ACSF for VSD imaging contained a low dose of 25 ÂµM DNQX and 50 ÂµM APV. Electrodes and parameters, as well as analyses, were based on prior studies. Following the VSD experiments, slices were postfixed in 4% PFA for up to 1 week, before being transferred to a PBS solution with 30% sucrose. Then after at least 10 hr they were cut at 40â50 Î¼m thickness using a freezing microtome. Sections were then mounted and Nissl-stained with Cresyl Violet before coverslipping with Entellan. Images of the sections were combined with the optical imaging data to identify the ROIs from the recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Optical system for in vitro visualization/photostimulation</title><p>The optical system used for in vitro visualization and photostimulation combined blue (Thorlabs M470L4), orange (Thorlabs M595L3), and far-red (Thorlabs M625L3) LED paths. Briefly, orange and far-red LED paths were combined via a 50/50 beamsplitter (Thorlabs BSW10R), then passed through a blue/red combining dichroic mirror (Thorlabs DMLP505R). Light was then passed down onto the sample through either an RGB dichroic mirror (Laser2000 FF409/493/573/652-Di02â25x36) for epifluorescence visualization or a âcoldâ mirror (Thorlabs FM03R) for photostimulation. Tissue was visualized via 850 nm light transmitted through a condenser mounted beneath the slice chamber (Thorlabs M850L3). Incident and reflected light passed through excitation (Semrock FF01-378/474/554/635-25) and emission (Semrock FF01-432/515/595/730-25) filters while in RGB visualization mode.</p><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Optical system for in vivo visualization of CLA axons</title><p>All two-photon imaging was performed using a Bruker Ultima 2<italic>P</italic>+two-photon microscope controlled by Prairie View software, and a femtosecond-pulsed, dispersion-corrected laser (Chameleon, Coherent). Imaging was performed using a Nikon 16X0.8 NA water immersion lens. The lens was insulated from external light using a custom 3D printed cone connected to a flexible rubber sleeve. A wavelength of 920 nm and 50 mW power on the sample was used for visualizing GCaMP7b. An imaging rate of 30 Hz and a 512x512 pixel square field of view (FOV) were used for all recordings. FOVs were selected across the right side of the cranial window. The approximate coordinates of the center of the FOV relative to bregma ranged from: AP â1.2 to +1.3; ML +0.3 to+1.5; DV â0.03 to â0.3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In vivo sensory stimulation</title><p>Once mice had completely recovered from surgery, and after allowing sufficient time for viral expression (&gt;3 weeks), mice were assessed for GCaMP7b labeled axons in the cortex. Animals were first acclimated to head fixation under the microscope. Next, GCaMP7b expression levels were assessed by eye. Animals in which no GCaMP7b-labeled axons could be found in the cranial window were excluded from future experiments. Animals with GCaMP7b-labeled axons in the cortex were then used for multimodal stimulation experiments.</p><p>Sensory stimuli were delivered using a data acquisition card (National Instruments) and PackIO software. Briefly, custom MATLAB (MathWorks) code was used to generate voltage traces. These traces were then used by PackIO to output timed voltage from the data acquisition card to an LED (Thorlabs MNWHL4), a piezoelectric whisker stimulator (Physik Instrumente), and a speaker (Dell). Stimuli lasted 500ms. The light stimulus consisted of a flash of white light (~5.5 mW emitted ~20 cm to the right of the mouse), the auditory stimulus of an amplitude and frequency modulated complex tone with a 5 kHz carrier frequency, and the tactile stimulus of a paddle oscillating at , 20 Hz within the mouseâs right whiskers.</p><p>During each experiment, mice were first head-fixed under the microscope. Imaging was performed in an enclosed hood to minimize visual stimuli, and white noise was used to obscure extraneous sounds. The surface of the cranial window was leveled relative to the imaging plane using a tip-tilt stage (Thorlabs). During each imaging session, FOVs with visible axon expression were selected manually. In the unimodal-only cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), mice were presented with 60 randomly interleaved stimulus presentations separated by randomly generated 8â11 s intertrial intervals. These 60 stimuli were randomly drawn from 4 trial types: sound, light, whisker, and blank. In the uni- and multimodal cohort, mice were presented with 120 stimuli randomly drawn from 8 trial types: sound alone; light alone; whisker alone; sound and light; sound and whisker; light and whisker; sound, light, and whisker; and blank. During blank trials, no stimuli were delivered. The order and the precise number of each trial type were randomly generated each day. After all stimuli were delivered, a new FOV was then selected, and the sensory stimulation was repeated. Imaging FOVs were selected based on visible axon expression and were drawn from across the extent of the cranial window. Care was taken to avoid recording from the same axon twice on a given day. However, as axons were only visible when active, and given the contorted and branched shape, separate ROIs may have included the same axons.</p><p>The first round of unimodal data collection involved five mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> M1â4), of which one was excluded due to unrecoverable histology (not shown).

Briefly, animals aged p44âp48 received bilateral intracranial injections of either retro-iCre-mCherry in RSP and FLEX-TetTox in CLA (TetTox; n=16) or equivalent volumes of PBS (Sham; n=12). Animals were then given four weeks for recovery and viral expression. Mice were then water-restricted and trained on a multimodal conditioning task before a 1-week break from water restriction. Next, mice were again water-restricted for 2 days before being trained on a reversal learning task. Finally, mice were sacrificed, and brains were extracted for post-hoc histology. Both groups contained equal numbers of male and female mice.</p><p>Water restriction was used to provide task motivation. Mice were weighed twice daily during water restriction (before and after training) to ensure that their weight remained above 85% of baseline. On the first and second days of water regulation, mice were given access to their water bottle for 1 hr each day. Training commenced on the third day, after which most mice received all their water during the behavioral task. Mice who did not receive sufficient water during their training sessions or whose weight dropped below 85% of baseline were given additional water outside of training to maintain their body weight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-7"><title>Behavioral training setup</title><p>Training took place in 12x12 cm plastic boxes with nine nose-poke ports on the back wall arranged in a diamond shape (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pyControl/hardware/tree/master/Behaviour_box_small">https://github.com/pyControl/hardware/tree/master/Behaviour_box_small</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam, 2021</xref>). Removable plastic panels could be attached to the back wall to cover various combinations of nose poke ports. Each port contained an infrared beam to detect nose pokes. Solenoid valves could be used to deliver calibrated water rewards to each port. Each box was housed in a separate sound and light attenuating chamber. A speaker located above the nose poke ports was used to deliver auditory stimuli. Each port could be illuminated individually, and the entire chamber could be illuminated with an LED located above each box. Operant boxes were controlled and programmed using pyControl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akam et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-8"><title>Multimodal conditioning</title><p>Water-restricted mice were trained to associate uni- and multimodal sensory stimuli with water rewards. Mice were trained in two sessions per day for 11 days with only one session on the last day. Each session included 30 trials and lasted for ~50 min. Trials were separated by a random 1â2 min inter-trial interval. During each trial, mice were presented with either an auditory stimulus (A), a visual stimulus (V), or both stimuli at the same time (AV). Each stimulus was presented for 10 s. The A consisted of a stepped sine wave rising from 5 to 15 kHz. The frequency was increased in 20 steps, and the steps were cycled at 50 Hz, meaning that each step was played for 20ms. The V consisted of turning on the house lights in the behavior box. The AV consisted of the A and V presented simultaneously. Each stimulus was associated with reward availability at a different port, with the A stimulus indicating reward availability at the left port, the V at the right port, and the AV at the center port. Rewards were delivered following the first poke to the correct port following stimulus onset, regardless of whether the subject initially poked an incorrect port. Rewards available in a given port were not cumulative, that is subjects did not receive two rewards if they failed to collect the reward before the next presentation of the same stimulus type. Each water reward was 15 uÂµl. This was decreased to 12 Âµl for mice whose weight remained at or above 100% of baseline for two consecutive sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-9"><title>Reversal learning</title><p>Water-restricted mice learned to flexibly track probabilistic associations between action and reward across reversals in reward probability. Mice were trained in 2 sessions per day for 10 days. Each session lasted 45 min, during which time mice could complete trials to earn rewards.</p><p>Training took place in the same boxes as the multimodal conditioning. All poke ports used in the previous paradigm were covered, and an upside-down triangle of poke ports was uncovered. At the start of the training session, the house light was illuminated and remained illuminated throughout training. Trials were separated by a 1 s inter-trial interval. At the end of the inter-trial interval, the two top poke ports were illuminated. Mice could then make a choice by poking either the left- or right-hand poke port. A click was played after poking either port. After making a choice, the top two port lights were turned off and the bottom port was illuminated. Mice could then poke the bottom port for a chance to receive a water reward. Reward volumes were gradually decreased over the course of training to maintain motivation. At the start of the first session, the choice ports were randomly assigned as either the good or bad port. Poking the good port led to an 85% chance of receiving water from the reward port, while poking the bad port led to a 15% chance of receiving a reward. Each mouseâs performance was tracked throughout the session using an exponential moving average (tau = 12). A reversal in reward probabilities was triggered 5â10 trials after mice crossed a threshold of &gt;80% correct. The reward probabilities at the end of a session were used at the start of the next session. The number of trials and blocks completed and the number of rewards obtained in each session were therefore dependent on each mouseâs individual performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis and availability</title><p>All analyses were performed with custom routines using Python 3.7.9 or open source packages unless otherwise stated.

Automated classification involved a preprocessing step in which the electrophysiological dataset was standardized for every feature and cell. Principal component analysis (PCA, 53 features) was then used to reduce the dimensionality of the standardized dataset, producing a neurons x components matrix, the first three components of which accounted for greater than 85% of the explained variance in the dataset. All components were used in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), the data from which was plotted and clustered using k-means clustering. Clusters were compared via silhouette analysis, and the average silhouette score across samples was used as an indicator of how well unsupervised methods had identified which value of k best represented electrophysiological groups.</p><p>Due to poor separation among subclasses of excitatory neurons using the above method, we compared manually sorted groups of excitatory neurons using a select set of electrophysiological features.

Multisensory axons were those which either (a) responded to multiple sensory modalities (including those which only responded to multimodal trial types) or (b) whose response to a unimodal trial type was modulated by the addition of other modalities (ex. an axon which responded to the unimodal sound stimulus but did not respond to multimodal trial types that included the sound stimulus).</p><p>To understand the trial-to-trial diversity of axonal responses, we calculated the AUC for the dF/F in the second after stimulus onset for each axon. To measure the reliability of responses, we computed the response probability for each axon number of stimulus presentations evoking a response/total number of stimulus presentations. Stimulus presentations were deemed to evoke a response if the AUC was &gt;1 standard deviation above the mean AUC for all axons, baselined on a trial-by-trial basis to the second before stimulus onset. A non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was used to assess the impact of trial type and/or session on axonal response probability and magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-4"><title>Confocal image analysis</title><p>All images used for quantitative analysis in this study were imaged on a confocal microscope at Ã10 magnification (see Immunohistochemistry and imaging section above for details). Cell counts and cell coordinates were collected and analyzed using ImageJ and custom JavaScript macros. Inter-cell distances were calculated as the smallest Euclidean distance between cell somas. Comparisons between cell counts from injection sites were done using Mann-Whitney U tests, corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction.</p><p>Contours generated from confocal images of CTB +neurons in the CLA (n=3 mice) were made via morphological snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caselles et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kass et al., 1988</xref>) of average images. Briefly, confocal images of the CLA taken from 50-Î¼m-thick sections were thresholded using Otsuâs method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Otsu, 1979</xref>). A binary erosion algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gonzalez and Woods, 2008</xref>) was applied to thresholded images to remove noise from small, punctate autofluorescence above threshold in each image. Processed images were then multiplied by their original counterparts to create denoised, native fluorescence intensity images of CTB +CLA neurons. Images of the same slice across mice were grouped based on the Paxinos &amp; Franklin Brain Atlas and the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Each image in a group representing a single coronal plane was normalized and aligned to the center of mass (COM) of fluorescence before being averaged into a single image. After the generation of these average images for each AP plane, the border of the CLA as defined by CTB +neurons was found by initializing an ellipse about the COM of CLA fluorescence to act as a boundary for morphological snake active contours. These contours evolve in time and are pulled toward object boundaries until the energy functions reach their minimum. Area for each contour was calculated as the integral for the closed contour path.</p><p>Confocal images of cortical axons innervating the CLA were prepared as above and COM-aligned to the CTB signal in the CLA across mice for a given cortical injection (n=3 mice/injection site; analyzed image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref> from ~1.00 mm bregma). Axonal fluorescence from each image was normalized and averaged to 15 Î¼m x 15 Î¼m bins and displayed as a heatmap.</p><p>To determine the amount of dorsal/core/ventral fluorescence within the CLA of each injection experiment, the CLA contour at the AP position of the analyzed image was used as a mask for the core. Dorsal and ventral masks were taken as the regions in the image above and below the core, including medial and lateral regions above and below Â½ the core height. Image masks were multiplied to each processed and normalized image within an injection experiment set, and fluorescence from that region was averaged pixel-wise. Regional fluorescence was then averaged across mice to obtain a comparison of dorsal, core, and ventral axon fluorescence in the CLA from each cortical area. Values for each region were compared using independent t-test. Multiple comparisons correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate analysis with an alpha of 10%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-5"><title>Home cage activity tracking</title><p>The home cage monitoring study was divided into baseline and expression periods. To allow mice to acclimatize to their new environment, data for the baseline period was collected starting one week after mice were placed in the activity monitoring cages until they were removed for surgery. To balance the baseline period and allow adequate time for viral expression, data for the expression period was collected for 1 week starting 3 weeks after the last mouse in each group received their intracranial injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-6"><title>Home cage activity</title><p>Activity tracking data from the DVC system were preprocessed using the DVC Analytics platform (Techniplast) to extract locomotor activity data. Briefly, readouts from the capacitive plates are affected by the local electromagnetic environment. The presence of water-rich bodies â such as a mouse â near the sensor alters its readout. Alterations to the capacitive readings across the 12 sensors can be used to identify the location of a mouse within the cage. By tracking the change in the location of the mouse across readings, the system can track the distance traveled by the mouse within a given time window.</p><p>While the distance traveled metric reveals an important aspect of home cage behavior, it is insufficient to distinguish between a truly immobile mouse (ex. during sleep) and a mouse which is stationary but active (ex. grooming, nest building). To provide a more detailed picture of activity, the DVC platform also calculates an Animal Activity Index. Activity is detected by computing the change in electrode capacitance between adjacent readings. An electrode is considered activated if the difference between the readings is greater than a threshold chosen by the software to separate activity from noise. This measurement is therefore insensitive to long-term changes in capacitance (ex. due to the moisture level of the bedding) while providing a short-term readout of local activity. The density of activation across the electrode array over time can then be used as a general indicator of the animalsâ activity level. The so-called Animal Activity Index calculated by the DVC analytics platform is expressed in arbitrary units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-7"><title>Circadian parameters</title><p>Python, the pyActigraphy package, and the DVC analytics platform were used to compute circadian metrics from the DVC data. While the pyActigraphy toolbox was written to analyze data collected using devices such as smart watches, it was adapted here to import data produced by the DVC analytics platform. The pyActigraphy toolbox was then used to analyze animalsâ mean inter-daily stability (ISm) and mean intra-daily variability (IVm). The DVC data were further analyzed using custom Python code to calculate the relative amplitude (RA) of animalsâ daily activity. RA was calculated using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ3"><alternatives><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t3">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle RA+\frac{AI_{D}- AI_{L}}{AI_{D}+AI_{L}}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>where AI<sub>D</sub> refers to animalsâ mean activity index during their dark cycle and AI<sub>L</sub> refers to their mean activity in the light cycle. These metrics were calculated using the Animal Activity Index.</p><p>Finally, the DVC analytics platform was used to calculate the regularity disruption index (RDI) for all mice at baseline and after claustrum silencing. RDI is a novel biomarker based on sample entropy. It was developed for the DVC system to quantify irregularities in activity patterns. A highly regular pattern of activity would yield an RDI near zero, while highly disrupted activity would yield a high RDI. Notably, RDI values reflect the regularity of activity regardless of its magnitude. RDI was calculated separately for the light and dark cycle to delineate activity patterns in different behavioral states. Details on the above metrics can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Golini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GonÃ§alves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hammad et al., 2021</xref>.

Activity bouts are usually defined as periods of time when activity never falls below a specified threshold. However, there is variation between studies in the required length and threshold. The parameters of this analysis were selected to maximize the number of bouts detected. Bouts were detected using MATLAB code to identify periods where the Animal Locomotor Index did not fall below a threshold of 0.2 arbitrary units. Bouts had a minimum duration of 1 min with a minimum inter-bout interval of 1 min. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-9"><title>Anxiety tests</title><p>Video recordings of the elevated plus maze and aversive open field tests were analyzed by a blinded observer using Anymaze 7.3 (Stoelting) to extract the mouseâs location and movement within the behavioral apparatus. The mouse was deemed to be inside a given region when 85% of its body crossed into the zone. Video recordings of the light-dark box test were analyzed manually by a blinded observer to record time spent in the light zone of the apparatus. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-10"><title>Multimodal conditioning and reversal learning</title><p>Statistical tests were performed using Python and GraphPad Prism 9.</p><p>In the multimodal conditioning task, a d-prime (d') was calculated for each stimulus in an effort to compare animalsâ sensitivity to the different stimuli. To calculate each d', all trials had to be classified according to one of four outcomes: hit, miss, correct rejection, or false alarm. Classically, a hit is defined as a trial in which both the stimulus and response are present, while a miss is a trial where the stimulus is present, but the response is absent. A correct rejection is a trial in which both the stimulus and response are absent, while a false alarm is a trial in which the stimulus is absent, but the response is present. For this calculation, the response was defined as poking the correct port first, and within 10 s of stimulus onset. Using the auditory d' as an example, a hit would be a trial where a sound was present, and the mouse poked the auditory port first. A miss would be a trial where the auditory stimulus was present, but the mouse poked a non-auditory port first. An auditory false alarm would be a non-auditory trial (i.e. visual or audiovisual) where the mouse poked the auditory port first. Finally, a correct rejection would be a non-auditory trial (i.e. visual or audiovisual) where the mouse did not poke the auditory port first. In this way, each d' included the outcome for every trial of all stimulus types. The redundancy inherent in these outcomes is essential for assessing how animals behave when each stimulus was present and when it was absent.</p><p>Once all trials had been assigned an outcome, they were used to calculate a hit rate and a false alarm rate for each stimulus. These were calculated according to the following formulae: False Alarm Rate = ((# False Alarm) / (# False Alarm + # Correct Rejection)) and Hit Rate = ((# Hit) / (# Hit + # Miss)). The hit and false alarm rates could then be combined according to the formula:<disp-formula id="equ4"><alternatives><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>`</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="t4">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle d'=Z\left (HR\right)- Z\left \{FR\right)$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>where Z is the normal inverse cumulative distribution function, HR is the hit rate, and FR is the false-alarm rate.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Supervision, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal procedures were subject to local ethical approval under PPL #PE5B24716 and adhered to the United Kingdom Home Office (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.

First, they characterize the intrinsic properties of claustrum excitatory and inhibitory neurons and determine how these different claustrum neurons receive input from different cortical regions. Next, they perform in vitro patch clamp recordings to determine the extent of intraclaustrum connectivity between excitatory neurons. Following these experiments, in vivo axon imaging was performed to determine how claustrum-retrosplenial cortex neurons are modulated by different combinations of auditory, visual, and somatosensory input. Finally, the authors perform claustrum lesions to determine if claustrum neurons are required for performance on a multisensory discrimination task</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>An important potential contribution the authors provide is the demonstration of intra-claustrum excitation. In addition, this paper does provide the first experimental data where two cortical inputs are independently stimulated in the same experiment (using 2 different opsins). Overall, the in vitro patch clamp experiments and anatomical data provide confirmation that claustrum neurons receive convergent inputs from areas of frontal cortex. These experiments were conducted with rigor and are of high quality.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The title of the paper states that claustrum neurons integrate information from different cortical sources. However, the authors did not actually test or measure integration in the manuscript. They do show physiological convergence of inputs on claustrum neurons in the slice work. Testing integration through simultaneous activation of inputs was not performed. The convergence of cortical input has been recently shown by several other papers (Chia et al), and the current paper largely supports these previous conclusions. The in vivo work did test for integration, because simultaneous sensory stimulations were performed. However, integration was not measured at the single cell (axon) level because it was unclear how activity in a single claustrum ROI changes in response to (for example) visual, tactile, and visual-tactile stimulations. Reading the discussion, I also see the authors speculate that the sensory responses in the claustrum could arise from attentional or salience related inputs from an upstream source such as the PFC. In this case, claustrum cells would not integrate anything (but instead respond to PFC inputs).</p><p>The different experiments in different figures often do not inform each other. For example, the authors show in Figure 3 that claustrum-RSP cells (CTB cells) do not receive input from the auditory cortex. But then, in Figure 6 auditory stimuli are used. Not surprisingly, claustrum ROIs respond very little to auditory stimuli (the weakest of all sensory modalities). Then, in Figure 7 the authors use auditory stimuli in the multisensory task. It seems that these experiments were done independently and were not used to inform each other.</p><p>One novel aspect of the manuscript is the focus on intraclaustrum connectivity between excitatory cells (Figure 2). The authors used wide-field optogenetics to investigate connectivity. However, the use paired patch clamp recordings remains the ground truth technique for determining the rate of connectivity between cell types, and paired recordings were not performed here. It is difficult to understand and gain appreciation for intraclaustrum connectivity when only wide-field optogenetics is used.</p><p>In Figure 2, CLA-rsp cells express Chrimson, and the authors removed cells from the analysis with short latency responses (which reflect opsin expression). But wouldn't this also remove cells that express opsin and receive monosynaptic inputs from other opsin expressing cells, therefore underestimating the connectivity between these CLA-rsp neurons? I think this needs to be addressed.</p><p>In Figure 5J the lack of difference in the EPSC-IPSC timing in the RSP is likely due to 1 outlier EPSC at 30ms which is most likely reflecting polysynaptic communication. Therefore, I do not feel the argument being made here with differences in physiology is particularly striking.</p><p>In the text describing Figure 5, the authors state &quot;These experiments point to a complex interaction ....likely influenced by cell type of CLA projection and intraclaustral modules in which they participate&quot;. How does this slice experiment stimulating axons from one input relate to different CLA cell types or intra-claustrum circuits? I don't follow this argument.</p><p>In Figure 6G and H the blank condition yields a result similar to many of the sensory stimulus conditions. This blank condition (when no stimulus was presented) serves as a nice reference to compare the rest of the conditions. However, the remainder of the stimulation conditions were not adjusted relative to what would be expected by chance. For example, the response of each cell could be compared to a distribution of shuffled data, where time-series data are shuffled in time by randomly assigned intervals and a surrogate distribution of responses generated. This procedure is repeated 200-1000x to generate a distribution of shuffled responses. Then the original stimulus triggered response (1s post) could be compared to shuffled data. Currently, the authors just compare pre/post mean data using a Mann Whitney test from the mean overall response, which could be biased by a small number of trials. Therefore, I think a more conservative and statistically rigorous approach is warranted here, before making the claim of a 20% response probability or 50% overall response rate.</p><p>Regarding Figure 6, a more conventional way to show sensory responses is to display a heatmap of the z-scored responses across all ROIs, sorted by their post-stimulus response. This enables the reader to better visualize and understand the claims being made here, rather than relying on the overall mean which could be influenced by a few highly responsive ROIs.</p><p>For Figure 6 it would also help to display some raw data showing responses at the single ROI level and the population level. If these sensory stimulations are modulating claustrum neurons, then this will be observable on the mean population vector (averaged df/f across all ROIs as a function of time) within a given experiment and would add support to the conclusions being made.</p><p>As noted by the authors, there is substantial evidence in the literature showing that motor activity arises in mice during these types of sensory stimulation experiments. It is foreseeable that at least some of the responses measured here arise from motor activity. It would be important to identify to what extent this is the case.</p><p>All claims in the results for Figure 6 such as &quot;the proportion of responsive axons tended to be highest when stimuli were combined&quot; should be supported by statistics.</p><p>For Figure 7, the authors state that mice learned the structure of the task. How is this the case, when the number of misses are 5-6x greater than the number of hits on audiovisual trials (S Fig 19). I don't get the impression that mice perform this task correctly. As shown in Figure 7I, the hit rate is exceptionally low on the audiovisual port in controls. I just can't see how control and lesion mice can have the same hit rate and false alarm rate yet have different d'. Indeed, I might be missing something in the analysis. However, given that both groups of mice are not performing the task as designed, I fail to see how the authors claim regarding multisensory integration by the claustrum is supported. Even if there is some difference in the d' measure, what does that matter when the hits are the least likely trial outcome here for both groups.</p><p>In the discussion, it is stated that &quot;While axons responded inconsistently to individual stimulus presentations, their responsivity remained consistent between stimuli and through time on average...&quot;. I do not understand this part of the sentence. Does this mean axons are consistently inconsistent?</p><p>In the discussion the authors state their axon imaging results contrast with recent studies in mice. Why not actually do the same analysis that Ollerenshaw did, so this statement is supported by fact? As pointed out above, the criteria used to classify an axon as responsive to stimuli was very liberal in this current manuscript.</p><p>I find the discussion wildly speculative and broad. For example, &quot;the integrative properties of the CLA could act as a substrate for transforming the information content of its inputs (e.g. reducing trial to trial variability of responses to conjunctive stimuli...)&quot;. How would a claustrum neuron responding with a 10% reliability to a stimuli (or set of stimuli) provide any role in reducing trial to trial variability of sensory activity in the cortex?</p><p>Comments on the latest version: The authors have revised the manuscript, by adding 1 new supplementary figure, and some minor changes to the text. Overall, my comments regarding the manuscript were not sufficiently addressed. Here is one example:</p><p>The authors don't seem to be taking the comments regarding the statistical significance of the sensory responses seriously. If there is a response in 10% of the axons in the blank condition, and a 11 % response in the auditory stimulation, then that means that it is more accurate to say that 1% of axons actually respond to auditory stimulation. &quot;leaving to reader to make their own decisions&quot; as the authors suggest, but then having authors read text such as &quot;All modalities could evoke responses in at least some claustrum neurons&quot;, is misleading because no attempt was made to correct for a chance level of detection that is clearly observed in the blank condition. Another interpretation of the authors data would be that in the case of the auditory/visual/somatosensory combined stimuli resulted in 21%(observed) - 10% (blank) = 11% of axons. Therefore, a conclusion that more accurately reflects the data would be that 89% of claustrum axons do not respond, even when the mouse received multisensory stimuli. I tried to get the authors to run some basic stats to more accurately test the true degree of responsiveness, but these changes did not appear in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98002.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shelton et al. explore the organization of the Claustrum. To do so, they focus on a specific claustrum population, the one projecting to the retrosplenial cortex (CLA-RSP neurons). Using elegant technical approach, they first described electrophysiological properties of claustrum neurons, including the CLA-RSP ones. Further, they showed that CLA-RSP neurons (1) directly excite other CLA neurons, in a 'projection-specific' pattern, i.e. CLA-RSP neurons mainly excite claustrum neurons not projecting to the RSP and (2) received excitatory inputs from multiple cortical territories (mainly frontal ones). In an effort to confirm the 'integrative' property of claustrum networks, they then imaged claustrum axons in the cortex during single- or multi-sensory stimulations. Finally, they investigated the effect of CLA-RSP lesion on performance in a sensory detection task.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is a really good study, using state of the art technical approaches to probe the local/global organization of the Claustrum. The in-vitro part is impressive, and the results are compelling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One noteworthy concern arises from the terminology used throughout the study. The authors claimed that the claustrum is an integrative structure. Yet, integration has a specific meaning, i.e. the production of a specific response by a single neuron (or network) in response to a specific combination of several input signals. In this study, the authors showed compelling results in favor of convergence rather than integration. On a lighter note, the in-vivo data are less convincing, and do not entirely support the claim of &quot;integration&quot; made by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98002.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Public review:</p><p>The claustrum is one of the most enigmatic regions of the cerebral cortex, with a potential role in consciousness and integrating multisensory information. Despite extensive connections with almost all cortical areas, its functions and mechanisms are not well understood. In an attempt to unravel these complexities, Shelton et al. employed advanced circuit mapping technologies to examine specific neurons within the claustrum. They focused on how these neurons integrate incoming information and manage the output. Their findings suggest that claustrum neurons selectively communicate based on cortical projection targets and that their responsiveness to cortical inputs varies by cell type.</p><p>Imaging studies demonstrated that claustrum axons respond to both single and multiple sensory stimuli. Extended inhibition of the claustrum significantly reduced animals' responsiveness to multisensory stimuli, highlighting its critical role as an integrative hub in the cortex.</p><p>However, the study's conclusions at times rely on assumptions that may undermine their validity. For instance, the comparison between RSC projecting and non-RSC projecting neurons is problematic due to potential false negatives in the cell labeling process, which might not capture the entire neuron population projecting to a brain area. This issue casts doubt on the findings related to neuron interconnectivity and projections, suggesting that the results should be interpreted with caution. The study's approach to defining neuron types based on projection could benefit from a more critical evaluation or a broader methodological perspective.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study sets the stage for many promising future research directions. Future work could particularly focus on exploring the functional and molecular differences between E1 and E2 neurons and further assess the implications of the distinct responses of excitatory and inhibitory claustrum neurons for internal computations. Additionally, adopting a different behavioral paradigm that more directly tests the integration of sensory information for purposeful behavior could also prove valuable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98002.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

In this case, we sought to test pathways in vivo that were identified as being weak or absent in vitro to confirm and specifically rule out their influence on computations performed by claustrum. We agree with the reviewerâs assessment that it is not surprising that claustrum ROIs respond weakly to auditory stimuli. Not testing these connections in vivo because of their apparent sparsity in vitro would have represented a critical gap in our knowledge of claustrum responses during passive sensory stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One novel aspect of the manuscript is the focus on intraclaustrum connectivity between excitatory cells (Figure 2). The authors used wide-field optogenetics to investigate connectivity. However, the use of paired patch-clamp recordings remains the ground truth technique for determining the rate of connectivity between cell types, and paired recordings were not performed here. It is difficult to understand and gain appreciation for intraclaustrum connectivity when only wide-field optogenetics is used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the novelty of these experiments. We further acknowledge that paired patch-clamp recordings are the gold standard for assessing synaptic connectivity. Typically such experiments are performed in vitro, a necessity given the ventral location of claustrum precluding in vivo patching. In vitro slice preparations by their very nature sever connections and lead to an underestimate of connectivity as noted in our Discussion. Kim et al. (2016) have done this experiment in coronal slices with the understanding that excitatory-excitatory connectivity would be local (&lt;200 Î¼m) and therefore preserved. We used a variety of approaches that enabled us to explore connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the brain (the rostro-caudal, e.g. âlongâ axis of the claustrum), providing fresh insight into the circuitry embedded within this structure that would be challenging to examine using dual recordings. Further, our optogenetic method (CRACM, Petreanu et al., 2007), has been used successfully across a variety of brain structures to examine excitatory connectivity while circumventing artifacts arising from the slice axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, CLA-rsp cells express Chrimson, and the authors removed cells from the analysis with short latency responses (which reflect opsin expression). But wouldn't this also remove cells that express opsin and receive monosynaptic inputs from other opsin-expressing cells, therefore underestimating the connectivity between these CLA-rsp neurons? I think this needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The total number of opsin-expressing CLA neurons in our dataset is 4/46 tested neurons. Assuming all of these neurons project to RSP, they would have accounted for 4/32 CLARSP neurons. Given the rate of monosynaptic connectivity observed in this study, these neurons would only contribute 2-3 additional connected neurons. Therefore, the exclusion of these neurons does not significantly impact the overall statistical accuracy of our connectivity findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5J the lack of difference in the EPSC-IPSC timing in the RSP is likely due to 1 outlier EPSC at 30 ms which is most likely reflecting polysynaptic communication. Therefore, I do not feel the argument being made here with differences in physiology is particularly striking.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their attention to detail about this analysis. We have performed additional statistics and found that leaving this neuron out does not affect the significance of the results (new p-value = 0.158, original p-value = 0.314, Mann-Whitney U test). We have removed this datapoint from the figure and our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the text describing Figure 5, the authors state &quot;These experiments point to a complex interaction ....likely influenced by cell type of CLA projection and intraclaustral modules in which they participate&quot;. How does this slice experiment stimulating axons from one input relate to different CLA cell types or intra-claustrum circuits? I don't follow this argument.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this speculation from the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6G and H, the blank condition yields a result similar to many of the sensory stimulus conditions. This blank condition (when no stimulus was presented) serves as a nice reference to compare the rest of the conditions. However, the remainder of the stimulation conditions were not adjusted relative to what would be expected by chance. For example, the response of each cell could be compared to a distribution of shuffled data, where time-series data are shuffled in time by randomly assigned intervals and a surrogate distribution of responses generated. This procedure is repeated 200-1000x to generate a distribution of shuffled responses. Then the original stimulus-triggered response (1s post) could be compared to shuffled data. Currently, the authors just compare pre/post-mean data using a Mann-Whitney test from the mean overall response, which could be biased by a small number of trials. Therefore, I think a more conservative and statistically rigorous approach is warranted here, before making the claim of a 20% response probability or 50% overall response rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's thorough analysis and suggestion for a more conservative statistical approach. We acknowledge that responses on blank trials occur about 10% of the time, indicating that response probabilities around this level may not represent &quot;real&quot; responses. To address this, we will include the responses to the blank condition in the manuscript (lines 505-509). This will allow readers to make informed decisions based on the presented data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding Figure 6, a more conventional way to show sensory responses is to display a heatmap of the z-scored responses across all ROIs, sorted by their post-stimulus response. This enables the reader to better visualize and understand the claims being made here, rather than relying on the overall mean which could be influenced by a few highly responsive ROIs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewer that our data in this figure was challenging to interpret. We have included an additional supplemental figure (Supp. Fig. S15) that displays the requested information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 6, it would also help to display some raw data showing responses at the single ROI level and the population level. If these sensory stimulations are modulating claustrum neurons, then this will be observable on the mean population vector (averaged df/f across all ROIs as a function of time) within a given experiment and would add support to the conclusions being made.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs desire to see more raw data â we would have included this in the figure given more space. However, the average df/f across all ROIs is shown as a time series with 95% confidence intervals in Fig. 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As noted by the authors, there is substantial evidence in the literature showing that motor activity arises in mice during these types of sensory stimulation experiments. It is foreseeable that at least some of the responses measured here arise from motor activity. It would be important to identify to what extent this is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge that some responses may arise from motor-related activity, addressing this comprehensively is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the extensive number of trials and recorded axonal segments, we believe that motor-related activity is unlikely to significantly impact the average response across all trials. Future studies focusing specifically on motor activity during sensory stimulation experiments would be needed to elucidate this aspect in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All claims in the results for Figure 6 such as &quot;the proportion of responsive axons tended to be highest when stimuli were combined&quot; should be supported by statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional statistics in this section (lines 490-511) to address the reviewerâs comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, the authors state that mice learned the structure of the task. How is this the case, when the number of misses is 5-6x greater than the number of hits on audiovisual trials (S Figure 19). I don't get the impression that mice perform this task correctly. As shown in Figure 7I, the hit rate is exceptionally low on the audiovisual port in controls. I just can't see how control and lesion mice can have the same hit rate and false alarm rate yet have different d'. Indeed, I might be missing something in the analysis. However, given that both groups of mice are not performing the task as designed, I fail to see how the authors' claim regarding multisensory integration by the claustrum is supported. Even if there is some difference in the d' measure, what does that matter when the hits are the least likely trial outcome here for both groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and hope the following addresses their confusion about the performance of animals during our multimodal conditioning task.</p><p>Firstly, as pointed out by the reviewer, the hit-rate (HR) is lower than false-alarm-rate (FR) but crucially only when assessed explicitly within-condition (e.g. just auditory or just visual stimulation). Given the multimodal nature of the assay, HR and FR could also be evaluated across different trials, unimodal and multimodal, for both auditory and visual stimuli. Doing so resulted in a net positive d', as observed by the reviewer. From this perspective, and as documented in the Methods (Multimodal Conditioning and Reversal Learning) and Supplemental Figures, mice do indeed learn the conditioning task and perform at above-chance levels.</p><p>Secondly, as raised in the Discussion, an important caveat of this assay was that it was unnecessary for mice to learn the task structure explicitly but, rather, that they respond to environmental cues in a reward-seeking manner that indicated perception of a stimulus. &quot;Performance&quot; as it is quantified here demonstrates a perceptual difference between conditions that is observed through behavioral choice and timing, not necessarily the degree to which the mice have an understanding of the task per se.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, it is stated that &quot;While axons responded inconsistently to individual stimulus presentations, their responsivity remained consistent between stimuli and through time on average...&quot;. I do not understand this part of the sentence. Does this mean axons are consistently inconsistent?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewerâs interpretation is correct â although recorded axons tended to have a preferred stimulus or combination of stimuli, they displayed variability in their responses (response probability), though little or no variability in their likelihood to respond over time (on average).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the authors state their axon imaging results contrast with recent studies in mice. Why not actually do the same analysis that Ollerenshaw did, so this statement is supported by fact? As pointed out above, the criteria used to classify an axon as responsive to stimuli were very liberal in this current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate this comment from the reviewer, we feel that it was not necessary to perform similar analyses to those of Ollerenshaw et al in order to appreciate that methodological differences between these studies would have confounded any comparisons made, as we note in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find the discussion wildly speculative and broad. For example, &quot;the integrative properties of the CLA could act as a substrate for transforming the information content of its inputs (e.g. reducing trial-to-trial variability of responses to conjunctive stimuli...)&quot;. How would a claustrum neuron responding with a 10% reliability to a stimuli (or set of stimuli) provide any role in reducing trial-to-trial variability of sensory activity in the cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the speculative nature of our discussion. To address the specific point raised, while a neuron with a 10% reliability might appear limited in reducing trial-to-trial variability in sensory activity, it's possible that such neurons are responsive to a combination of stimuli or conditions not fully controlled or recorded in our current setup. For instance, variables like the animalâs attentional or motivational states could influence the responsiveness of claustrum neurons, thus integrating these inputs could theoretically modulate cortical processing. We have refined this section to clarify these points (now lines 810-813).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shelton et al. explore the organization of the Claustrum. To do so, they focus on a specific claustrum population, the one projecting to the retrosplenial cortex (CLA-RSP neurons). Using an elegant technical approach, they first described electrophysiological properties of claustrum neurons, including the CLA-RSP ones. Further, they showed that CLA-RSP neurons (1) directly excite other CLA neurons, in a 'projection-specific' pattern, i.e. CLA-RSP neurons mainly excite claustrum neurons not projecting to the RSP and (2) receive excitatory inputs from multiple cortical territories (mainly frontal ones). To confirm the 'integrative' property of claustrum networks, they then imaged claustrum axons in the cortex during singleor multi-sensory stimulations. Finally, they investigated the effect of CLA-RSP lesion on performance in a sensory detection task.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is a really good study, using state-of-the-art technical approaches to probe the local/global organization of the Claustrum. The in-vitro part is impressive, and the results are compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive appraisal of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One noteworthy concern arises from the terminology used throughout the study. The authors claimed that the claustrum is an integrative structure. Yet, integration has a specific meaning, i.e. the production of a specific response by a single neuron (or network) in response to a specific combination of several input signals. In this study, the authors showed compelling results in favor of convergence rather than integration. On a lighter note, the in-vivo data are less convincing, and do not entirely support the claim of &quot;integration&quot; made by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their clarity on this issue. We absolutely agree that without clear definition in the study, interpretation of our data could be misconstrued for one of several possible meanings. We have updated our Introduction, Results, and Discussion text to reflect the definition of âintegrationâ we used in the interpretation of our work and hope this clarifies our intent to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The claustrum is one of the most enigmatic regions of the cerebral cortex, with a potential role in consciousness and integrating multisensory information. Despite extensive connections with almost all cortical areas, its functions and mechanisms are not well understood. In an attempt to unravel these complexities, Shelton et al. employed advanced circuit mapping technologies to examine specific neurons within the claustrum. They focused on how these neurons integrate incoming information and manage the output. Their findings suggest that claustrum neurons selectively communicate based on cortical projection targets and that their responsiveness to cortical inputs varies by cell type.</p><p>Imaging studies demonstrated that claustrum axons respond to both single and multiple sensory stimuli. Extended inhibition of the claustrum significantly reduced animals' responsiveness to multisensory stimuli, highlighting its critical role as an integrative hub in the cortex.</p><p>However, the study's conclusions at times rely on assumptions that may undermine their validity. For instance, the comparison between RSC-projecting and non-RSC-projecting neurons is problematic due to potential false negatives in the cell labeling process, which might not capture the entire neuron population projecting to a brain area. This issue casts doubt on the findings related to neuron interconnectivity and projections, suggesting that the results should be interpreted with caution. The study's approach to defining neuron types based on projection could benefit from a more critical evaluation or a broader methodological perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their attention to the methods used in our study. We acknowledge that there is an inherent bias introduced by false-negatives as a result of incomplete labeling but contend that this is true of most modern tracing experiments in neuroscience, irrespective of the method used. Moreover, if false-negative biases are affecting our results, then they likely do so in the direction of supporting our findings â perfect knowledge of claustrum connectivity would likely enhance the effects seen by increasing the pool of neurons for which we find an effect. For example, our cortico-claustal connectivity findings in Figure 3 likely would have shown even larger effects should false-negative CLARSP neurons have been positively identified.</p><p>Where appropriate we have provided estimates of variability and certainty in our experimental findings and do not claim any definitive knowledge of the true rate and scope of claustrum connectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, the study sets the stage for many promising future research directions. Future work could particularly focus on exploring the functional and molecular differences between E1 and E2 neurons and further assess the implications of the distinct responses of excitatory and inhibitory claustrum neurons for internal computations. Additionally, adopting a different behavioral paradigm that more directly tests the integration of sensory information for purposeful behavior could also prove valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their outlook on the future directions of our work. These avenues for study, we believe, would be very fruitful in uncovering the cell-type-specific computations performed by claustrum neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>The editor recommends addressing the issues raised by the reviewers about the statistical significance of sensory response with respect to blank stimuli, and solving the issue generated by the exclusion of monosynaptically connected neurons in the connectivity study, to raise the assessment strength of evidence from incomplete to solid. Moreover, as the reported result stands, the behavioral task does not seem to be learned by the animals as the animals are above chance for visual and auditory but largely below chance level for multisensory. It seems that the animals do not perform a multisensory task. The authors should clarify this.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Several references were missing from the manuscript, where mouse CLA-retrosplenial or CLA-frontal neurons were investigated and would be highly relevant to both the discussion of claustrum function and the context of the methodologies used here. (Wang et al., 2023 Nat Comm; Nair et al., 2023 PNAS, Marriott et al. 2024 Cell Reports ; Faig et al., 2024 Current Biology).</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Let me be clear, this is an excellent study, using state-of-the-art technical approaches to probe the local/global organization of the Claustrum. However, the study is somehow disconnected, with a fantastic in-vitro part, and, in my opinion, a less convincing in-vivo one.</p><p>As stated in the public review, I'm concerned about the use of the term &quot;integration&quot;, as, in my opinion, the data presented in this study (which I repeat are of excellent level) do not support that claim.</p><p>Below are my main points regarding the article:</p><p>(1) My main comment relates to the use of the term 'integration'. It might be a semantic debate, but I think that this is an important one. In my opinion, neural integration is the &quot;summing of several neural input signals by a single neuron to produce an output signal that is some function of those inputs&quot;. As the authors state in the discussion, they were not able to &quot;assess the EPSP response magnitude to the conjunction of stimuli due to photosensitivity of ChrimsonR opsins to blue light&quot;. Therefore, the authors did not specifically prove integration, but rather input convergence. This does not mean that the results presented are not important or of excellent quality, but I encourage the authors to either tone down the part on integration or to give a clear definition of what they call integration.</p><p>(2) The in vivo imaging data are somehow confusing. First, the authors image two claustral populations simultaneously (the CLA-RSP and the CLA-ACA axons). I may be missing the information, but there is no evidence that these cells overlap in the CLA (no data in the supplement and existing literature only support partial overlap). Second, in the results part, the authors claim that 96% of the sensory-responsive axons displayed multisensory response. This, combined with the 47% of axons responsive to at least one stimulus should lead to a global response of around 45% of the axons in multisensory trials. Yet, in Figures 6F-G, one can see that the response probability is actually low (closer to 20%). To be honest, I cannot really understand how to make sense of these results. At first, I thought that most of the multisensory responsive axons show no response during multisensory stimulus (but one in the unimodal stimulus). This hypothesis is however unlikely, as response AUC is biased toward positivity in Figure 6H. Overall, I'm not totally convinced by the imaging data, and I think that the authors should be more cautious about interpreting their results (as they are in the discussion part, but less in the results part).</p><p>(3) The TetTox approach used in the study ablates all neurons expressing the CRE in the CLA. If the hypothesis proposed by the authors is true, then ablating one subpopulation should not impact that much the functioning of the whole CLA, as other neurons will likely &quot;integrate&quot; information coming from multiple cortices (Figures 3 and 4), the local divergence (Figure 1) will then allow the broadcasting of this information back to multiples cortices. Do the authors think that such an approach deeply modified intra-claustral network connectivity? If this is not the case, shouldn't we expect less effect after lesioning a specific sub-population of CLA neurons?</p><p>(4) The behavioral protocol is also confusing. If I understand correctly, the aim of the task was to probe the D-Prime factor, as all trials, whatever the response of the animal are rewarded. From the Figure 7I, one can see that the mice cannot properly answer to the audiovisual cues, clearly indicating that both groups show impaired response to this type of trial. The whole conclusion of the authors is therefore drawn from the D-Prime calculation. However, even if D-Prime should represent a measure of sensitivity (i.e. is unaffected by response bias), two assumptions need to be met: (1) the signal and noise distributions should be both normal, and (2) the signal and noise distributions should have the same standard deviation. However, these assumptions cannot be tested in the task used by the authors (one would need rating tasks). The authors might want to use nonparametric measures of sensitivity such as A' (see Pollack and Norman 1964).</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While the study is comprehensive, some of its conclusions are based on assumptions that potentially weaken their validity. A significant issue arises in the comparison between neurons that project to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and those that do not. This differentiation is based on retrograde labeling from a single part of the RSC. However, CTB labeling, the technique used, does not capture 100% of the neurons projecting to a brain area. The study itself demonstrates this by showing that injecting the dye into three sections of the RSC results in three overlapping populations of neurons in the claustrum. Therefore, limiting the injection to just one of these areas inevitably leads to many false negatives-neurons that project to the RSC but are not marked by the CTB. This issue recurs in the analysis of neurons projecting to both the RSC and the prelimbic cortex (PL), where assumptions about interconnectivity are made without a thorough examination of overlap between these populations. The incomplete labeling complicates the interpretation of the data and draws firm conclusions from it.</p><p>Minor.</p><p>There is a reference to Figure 1D where claustrum-&gt;cortical connections are described.
