preoptic area GABA neurons are involved in the preovulatory surge mechanism necessary for ovulation. In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to achieve a 60–70% knockdown in estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression by GABA neurons located within the regions of the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) and medial preoptic nuclei (MPN) in adult female mice. Mice exhibited variable reproductive phenotypes with the only significant finding being mice with bilateral ESR1 deletion in RP3V GABA neurons having reduced cFos expression in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons at the time of the surge. One sub-population of RP3V GABA neurons expresses kisspeptin. Re-grouping ESR1-edited mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression revealed a highly consistent phenotype; mice with a near-complete loss of kisspeptin immunoreactivity displayed constant estrus and failed to exhibit surge activation but retained pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. These observations demonstrate that ESR1-expressing GABA-kisspeptin neurons in the RP3V are essential for the murine preovulatory LH surge mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>preoptic area</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-UOO-201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/212242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Studies in genetic mouse models have clearly identified that estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is the key receptor underlying both estrogen-positive and -negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Couse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbison, 2015</xref>). Despite significant progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moenter et al., 2020</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kauffman, 2022</xref>), defining the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms through which ESR1 ultimately modulates GnRH secretion remains a significant challenge. This is particularly intriguing given that the final output neuron of the network, the GnRH neuron, expresses ESR2 but not ESR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herbison and Pape, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Recent experiments using live cell imaging and in vivo CRISPR gene editing have demonstrated that estradiol acts directly at ESR1-expressing kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus to suppress the activity of the GnRH pulse generator and bring about estrogen-negative feedback at the level of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>). This same level of definition has not yet been possible for the positive feedback mechanism where only the general location of estradiol action is known with certainty. Viral retrograde labeling demonstrated that ESR1-expressing afferents to the GnRH neuron cell bodies are concentrated in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and preoptic periventricular (PVpo) nuclei of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wintermantel et al., 2006</xref>); collectively termed the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2008</xref>). As the selective knockdown of ESR1 in the RP3V results in acyclic mice with an absent luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Porteous and Herbison, 2019</xref>), it seems very likely that the RP3V is the area within which estradiol acts to enable the surge mechanism in mice.</p><p>The identity of the key ESR1-expressing populations within the RP3V mediating the estrogen-positive feedback mechanism has not been defined conclusively. Most evidence supports a role for the RP3V kisspeptin neurons. These cells express ESR1, are activated at the time of the surge, and have their kisspeptin synthesis strongly upregulated by estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2008</xref>). Further, RP3V kisspeptin neurons project directly to GnRH neuron cell bodies where they provide a strong and lasting excitatory influence while the selective activation of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in vivo evokes a surge-like increment in LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Piet et al., 2018</xref>). Given these findings, it was surprising to find that selective in vivo CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in AVPV kisspeptin neurons blunted the amplitude of the LH surge but had no impact on estrous cyclicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). This suggested that kisspeptin neurons may not be the key or sole phenotype in the RP3V responsible for positive feedback in mice.</p><p>There is a long-standing evidence implicating GABAergic inputs to the GnRH neuron cell bodies in the rodent-positive feedback mechanism. This ranges from studies showing alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor transmission at GnRH neurons around the time of the daily LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Christian and Moenter, 2007</xref>) to in vivo studies demonstrating a functionally significant fall in GABA release within the preoptic area just prior to the LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herbison and Dyer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarry et al., 1992</xref>). More recently, the genetic deletion of ESR1 in all GABA neurons was found to result in failure of the positive feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present study was designed to test directly whether ESR1 GABA neurons located in the medial preoptic area are critical for the positive feedback mechanism. We employed in vivo CRISPR gene editing to knock down ESR1 in the RP3V and adjacent medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and evaluated estrous cyclicity alongside pulsatile and surge patterns of LH secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in preoptic area GABA neurons</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Design and testing of gRNA</title><p>The design and characterization of guide RNAs for <italic>Esr1</italic> (NM_007956) have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, gRNA directed at both the sense and antisense strands around exon 3 were tested for efficacy using an ESR1-expressing hypothalamic cell line mHypo-CLU189-A genetically modified to stably express Cas9 (CLU189-Cas922C). Transduction with AAV-U6-gRNA-EGFP identified gRNA-1, -2, -3, and -6 to be the most effective in reducing <italic>Esr1</italic> mRNA levels by 20–30% in vitro. The efficacy of gRNA-2, -3, and -6 was assessed in vivo by giving unilateral injections of AAV1-U6-gRNA(2, 3, or 6)-Ef1α-mCherry into the medial preoptic area of <italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup>,Rosa26<sup>LSL-Cas9-EGFP</sup></italic> (Vgat-Cas9) mice (N=4 per gRNA). This was found to result in 79 ± 7%, 72 ± 5%, and 78 ± 3% reductions, respectively, in the numbers of ESR1-immunoreactive EGFP-expressing neurons on the injected side of the brain compared with the non-injected side. Our prior studies have shown that this CRISPR-Cas9-AAV platform enables the knockdown of ESR1 in a selective manner in genetically targeted hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>ESR1 knockdown in preoptic GABA neurons</title><p>In the present study, gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 were used for ESR1 knockdown with their effects in medial preoptic GABA neurons evaluated in Vgat-Cas9 mice at the end of the in vivo series of studies.

Mean cycle length for all animals prior to AAV injection was 5.9±1.5 days. No significant differences (p&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon paired tests) were detected in cycle length for mice given gRNA-LacZ (n=6), gRNA-2 (N=7), or gRNA-3 (n=6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Whereas individual gRNA-LacZ mice exhibited relatively stable cycles before (5.9±0.7 days) and 3 weeks after (5.6±0.7 days) AAV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), gRNA-2 and -3 mice displayed considerable variability in estrous cycle length after AAV injection with some mice entering constant estrous or diestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>); scored as zero for cycle length. We considered that this heterogeneity may have resulted from variations in ESR1 knockdown across the RP3V and MPN in individual mice. To assess this, all animals that had bilateral AAV injections involving the RP3V (n=9) and those with bilateral MPN injections (n=10) were considered as separate groups. These groupings also exhibited great variability with no significant differences (p&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon paired tests) in cycle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

However, re-sorting individual mice on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression provided highly consistent reproductive traits; mice with absent RP3V kisspeptin expression were acyclic and failed to exhibit an LH surge but retained pulsatile LH secretion. These data demonstrate an essential role for the RP3V GABA-kisspeptin neuronal phenotype in the murine estrogen-positive feedback mechanism.</p><p>We show here that gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 are effective at knocking down ESR1 expression in preoptic GABA neurons in adult female mice; both gRNA achieved a 60–70% reduction in ESR1 within the RP3V and MPN compared to gRNA-lacZ mice. We had previously reported that gRNA-3 generated an 80% knockdown in ESR1 within arcuate kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2022</xref>). This indicates the general utility of the CRISPR approach for in vivo gene editing of ESR1 in the mouse brain.</p><p>When examined on the basis of the original GABA neuron groupings, the only significant observation was that expression of ESR1 in RP3V GABA neurons correlated positively with the percentage of GnRH neurons expressing cFos at the time of the surge. The significant correlation between the ESR1 expression in RP3V GABA neurons and cFos in GnRH neurons when all gRNA-2 and gRNA-3 mice were combined revealed that this was not likely to be due to any unique actions of gRNA-2. While providing evidence that ESR1 in RP3V GABA neurons was required for normal activation of the GnRH neurons at the time of the surge, this was not the case for the LH surge. We note that single-point LH measurements are unreliable even for the OVX+E2 paradigm with individual mice exhibiting quite marked variability in surge onset and peak LH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref>). As such, we favor cFos expression in GnRH neurons as a more reliable index of whether the surge has commenced at the time of investigation.</p><p>The highly variable reproductive phenotypes of the ESR1 knockdown mice became consistent when sorted on the basis of their RP3V kisspeptin expression. Four mice exhibited a near-complete lack of kisspeptin immunoreactivity within the entire RP3V. As the RP3V kisspeptin neurons are a GABAergic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>), they will all be targeted for Cas9 expression in Vgat-Cas9 mice. Prior estimates have indicated that 20–75% of RP3V kisspeptin neurons express <italic>Vgat</italic> in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheong et al., 2015</xref>) although it is very likely that all RP3V kisspeptin neurons express VGAT during development and, as such, will all express Cas9 as adults. Hence, when the bilateral stereotaxic AAV-gRNA injections happen to include the entire extent of the RP3V, all GABA-kisspeptin neurons will be targeted. The almost complete lack of kisspeptin immunoreactivity is due to the critical dependence of kisspeptin expression on ESR1 in RP3V kisspeptin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubois et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwald-Yarnell et al., 2016</xref>). The CRISPR-mediated knockdown in ESR1 within these RP3V cells would gradually result in the suppression of kisspeptin biosynthesis. However, one curious observation is that essentially all cytoplasmic kisspeptin immunoreactivity is absent despite the expectation that some kisspeptin neurons would retain functional ESR1 due to the inherent mosaicism of this CRISPR strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Platt et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the near-complete absence of kisspeptin might also result from disordered circulating estradiol levels in acyclic mice.</p><p>We also noted an interesting reproductive phenotype in mice with unilateral knockdown of ESR1 in RP3V kisspeptin neurons resulting in unilateral reductions in kisspeptin-immunoreactive neuron numbers. Although showing no change in estrous cycles, these mice had somewhat similar deficits in GnRH neuron activation levels at the time of the surge compared to mice with no RP3V kisspeptin. Prior studies have indicated that 30–50% reductions in RP3V kisspeptin neuron number are compatible with a normal surge mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Szymanski and Bakker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that a substantial reduction in RP3V kisspeptin input to GnRH neurons from one side of the brain results in weaker surge activation. It may also alter the timing of surge onset outside the window examined in this study as the mice maintain normal estrous cycles implying that ovulation is occurring.</p><p>It is widely anticipated that that RP3V kisspeptin neurons are the critical estradiol-sensing component underlying the preovulatory surge mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Uenoyama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kauffman, 2022</xref>). We now provide data demonstrating that ESR1-expressing RP3V kisspeptin neurons are essential for the surge mechanism and estrous cyclicity in mice. It is unclear why the previous CRISPR-Cas9 study by Wang and colleagues did not observe the same result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, that study did not examine kisspeptin expression, so it is difficult to estimate the degree or level of functional knockout within the population. Also, only the AVPV was targeted so that the great majority of RP3V kisspeptin neurons that are located in the PVpo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clarkson and Herbison, 2006</xref>) were presumably unaffected in that study.</p><p>We find that pulsatile LH secretion is maintained in the absence of RP3V kisspeptin expression. A non-significant trend toward reduced LH pulse amplitude was observed but pulse frequency was unchanged. This observation agrees with the ‘two-compartment model’ of the GnRH neuron network in which the kisspeptin pulse and kisspeptin surge generators are thought to operate in relative independence at different compartments of the female GnRH neuron to bring about LH pulses and the LH surge, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herbison, 2020</xref>).</p><p>A caveat to an exclusive role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in surge generation is the possibility that non-kisspeptin ESR1-expressing GABA neurons immediately adjacent to RP3V kisspeptin cells are also required for the surge. However, we note that acyclic mice with no kisspeptin (‘bilateral loss’) had similar levels of ESR1 knockdown in RP3V GABA neurons found in normal mice that exhibited normal surge activation. Nevertheless, we cannot be sure that the significant correlation between the degree of ESR1 knockdown in RP3V GABA neurons and GnRH neuron activation at the surge is attributable entirely to GABA-kisspeptin neurons. If RP3V GABAergic non-kisspeptin neurons are involved, it seems that they may play an intrinsic role within the RP3V as GABA release from the RP3V to GnRH neurons is inconsequential for surge induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Piet et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show here that CRISPR gene editing can be used to efficiently knock down ESR1 in GABAergic neurons. Characterizing reproductive phenotypes on an individual animal basis in relation to GABA neuron sub-populations revealed that a loss of kisspeptin in RP3V GABA neurons was perfectly correlated with an absent surge mechanism and estrous acyclicity. These observations provide definitive evidence for ESR1-expressing RP3V GABA-kisspeptin neurons being essential for the preovulatory surge mechanism while having no role in pulse generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup>, Rosa26<sup>LSL-Cas9-EGFP</sup></italic> (Vgat-Cas9) mice were generated by crossing 129S6Sv/Ev C57BL6 <italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (JAX stock #026175) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vong et al., 2011</xref>) with B6J.129(B6N) <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-Cas9-EGFP</sup></italic> mice (JAX stock #026175) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Platt et al., 2014</xref>).

This brain area is implicated in regulating the pre-ovulatory LH surge in females, but the identity of the estrogen-sensitive neurons that are required remains unknown. The data indicate that approximately 70% knockdown of ESR1 in GABA neurons resulted in variable reproductive phenotypes. However, when the ESR1 knockdown also results in a decrease in kisspeptin expression by these cells, the females had disrupted LH surges, but no alterations in pulsatile LH release. These data support the hypothesis that kisspeptin cells in this region are critical for the pre-ovulatory LH surge in females.</p><p>Strengths: The current study examined the efficacy of two guide RNAs to knockdown ESR1 in GABA neurons, resulting in an approximate 70% reduction in ESR1 in GABA neurons. The efficacy of this knockdown was confirmed in the brain via immunohistochemistry and the reproductive outcomes were analyzed several ways to account for differences in guide RNAs or the precise brain region with the ESR1 knockdown. The analysis was taken one step further by grouping mice based on kisspeptin expression following ESR1 knockdown and examining the reproductive phenotypes. Overall, the aims of the study were achieved, the methods were appropriate, and the data were analyzed extensively. This data supports the hypothesis that kisspeptin neurons in the anterior hypothalamus are critical for the preovulatory LH surge.</p><p>Weaknesses: One minor weakness in this study is the conclusion that the two different guide RNAs didn't seem to have unique effects on GnRH cFos expression or the reproductive phenotypes. Though the data indicate a 60-70% knockdown for both gRNA2 and gRNA3, 3 of the 4 gRNA2 mice had no cFos expression in GnRH neurons during the time of the LH surge, whereas all mice receiving gRNA3 had at least some cFos/GnRH co-expression. In addition, when mice were re-categorized based on reduction (&gt;75%) in kisspeptin expression, most of the mice in the unilateral or bilateral groups received gRNA2, whereas many of the mice that received gRNA3 were in the &quot;normal&quot; group with no disruption in kisspeptin expression. Whether these results occurred by chance or due to differences in the gRNAs remains unknown. Thus, additional experiments with increased sample sizes would be needed, even if the efficacy of the ESR1 knockdown was comparable, before concluding these 2 gRNAs don't have unique actions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90959.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Clarkson et al investigated the impact of in vivo ESR1 gene disruption selectively in preoptic area GABA neurons on the estrogen regulation of LH secretion. The hypothalamic pathways by which estradiol controls the secretion of gonadotrophins are incompletely understood and relevant to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving fertility and reproduction. Using CRISPR-Cas9 methodology, the authors were able to effectively reduce the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in GABA neurons located in the preoptic area of adult female mice. The results obtained were rather variable except in the animals with concomitant suppression of kisspeptin in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V), which displayed interruption of ovarian cyclicity and an altered estradiol-induced LH surge. The experimental approach used allowed for a cell-selective, temporally-controlled suppression of ER-alpha expression, providing further evidence of the critical role of RP3V kisspeptin neurons in the estrogen positive-feedback effect. The preovulatory LH surge is a variable phenomenon and is better evaluated using serial blood sampling. Although the assessment of the estradiol-induced LH surge was performed in one terminal blood collection, c-Fos expression in GnRH neurons was used as a reliable proxy of the LH surge occurrence. The present findings also suggest that GABA neurotransmission in the preoptic area itself is not involved in the positive-feedback effect of estradiol on LH secretion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90959.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: The present study sought to investigate the role ERα expressed in Gabaergic neurons of the rostral periventricular aspect of the third ventricle (RP3V) and medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) in the positive feedback using genetically driven Crispr-Cas9 mediated knockdown of ESR1 in VGAT expressing neurons. ESR1 Knockdown in preoptic gabaergic neurons led to an absence of LH surge and acyclicity when associated with severely reduced kisspeptin (Kp) expression suggesting that a subpopulation of neurons co-expressing Kp and VGAT are key for LH surge since total absence of Kp is associated with an absence of GnRH neuron activation and reduced LH surge. Although the implication of kisspeptin neurons was highly suspected already, the novelty of these results lies in the fact that estrogen signaling is necessary in only a selected fraction of them to maintain both regular cycles and LH surge capacity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Remarkable aspects of this study are, its dataset which allowed them to segregate animals based on distinct neuronal phenotype matching specific physiological outcomes, the transparency in reporting the results (e.g. all statistical values being reported, all grouping variables being clearly defined, clarity about animals that were excluded and why) and the clarity of the writing. Another remarkable feature of this work lies in the analysis of the dataset. As opposed to the cre-lox approach which theoretically allows for the complete ablation of specific neuronal populations, but may lack specificity regarding timing of action and location, genetically driven in vivo Crispr-Cas9 editing offers both temporal and neuroanatomic selectivity but cannot achieve a complete knock down. This approach based on stereotaxic delivery of the AAV encoded guide RNAs comes with inevitable variability in the location where gene knockdown is achieved. By adjusting their original grouping of the animals based on the evaluation of the extent of kisspeptin expression in the target region, the authors obtained a much clearer and interpretable picture. Although only few animals (n=4) displayed absent kisspeptin expression, the convergence of observations suggesting a central impairment of the reproductive axis is convincing. Finally, the observation that the pulsatile secretion of LH is maintained in the absence of Kp expression in the RP3V lends support to the notion that LH surge and pulsatility are regulated independently by distinct neuronal populations, a model put forward by corresponding author a few years ago.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90959.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Clarkson</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yip</surname><given-names>Siew Hoong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Porteous</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kauff</surname><given-names>Alexia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heather</surname><given-names>Alison K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Otago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dunedin</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses: One minor weakness in this study is the conclusion that the guide RNAs didn't seem to have unique effects on GnRH cFos expression or the reproductive phenotypes. Though the data indicate a 60-70% knockdown for both gRNA2 and gRNA3, 3 of the 4 gRNA2 mice had no cFos expression in GnRH neurons during the time of the LH surge, whereas all mice receiving gRNA3 had at least some cFos/GnRH co-expression. In addition, when mice were re-categorized based on reduction (&gt;75%) in kisspeptin expression, most of the mice in the unilateral or bilateral groups received gRNA2, whereas many of the mice that received gRNA3 were in the &quot;normal&quot; group with no disruption in kisspeptin expression. Thus, additional experiments with increased sample sizes are needed, even if the efficacy of the ESR1 knockdown was comparable before concluding these 2 gRNAs don't result in unique reproductive effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: A draw back of the CRISPR approach is the substantial mosaicism in gene knockdown that is unavoidable due to the nature of DNA repair in each cell relying on several competing pathways. As such, variable knockdown occurs in each mouse as shown in Fig.1C. In the case of the correlation between RP3V ESR1 knockdown and cFos in GnRH neurons (Fig.4C), three gRNA3 and four 4 gRNA2 mice look to be very similar with two gRNA3 mice having knockdown but normal cFos activation. The reasons for this are not known and it is very likely chance that these two (of nine) mice happened to have received gRNA3. This issue becomes exacerbated when animal group numbers unintentionally become smaller with the re-grouping on the basis of kisspeptin expression. The key point here is that each “kisspeptin grouping” remains mixed in terms of gRNA2 and gRNA3 mice so that gRNA3 mice did contribute to the “bilateral group” even if it was only one of four mice. The practicalities of repeating this work are substantial and we do not think justified. We would note that we have previously used Kiss-Cre mice to undertake CRISPR knockdown of ESR1 in RP3V kisspeptin neurons but this failed to target sufficient cells with Cas9 to be experimentally useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2B (gRNA2), there appear to be 4 mice (4 lines) that have a normal cycle length and then drop to 0 for the cycle length. However, in the Figure legend, it states that there were 3 gRNA2 mice that had a cycle length of 0. Can the authors clarify if it was 4 mice (as indicated in Figure 2B) or 3 mice (as indicated in the legend) that received gRNA2 and exhibited constant estrus?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now clarified in the text that 3 gRNA2 mice went into constant estrus, the other mouse was in constant diestrus, also scored as “0” cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3H, there is one green data point that has an LH level of around 0.15 and % VGAT with ESR1 around 10%. However, that data point does not appear in Figures 3I and 3J, when you would expect it to be in a similar place (~10%) on the x-axis in those Figures. Was it excluded? If so, please elaborate on the justification for excluding that data point.Response: This was one of the three mice that exhibited no LH pulses so we were only able to report on mean LH levels.</p><p>Similarly, in Figure 3K, there is a blue data point that is almost at 0 for both the x-axis and the y-axis. However, that data point does not show up in Figures 3L and 3M around 0 on the x-axis as you would expect. Can the authors clarify where this data point went in Figures 3L and 3M?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This was one of the three mice that exhibited no LH pulses so we were only able to report on mean LH levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Finally, the study leaves unanswered the role of GABA itself. As there was no evident phenotype for the ESR1 knockdown in GABA neurons that do not coexpress kisspeptin, this suggests that GABA neurotransmission in the preoptic area is not involved in the estrogen regulation of LH secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The current evidence for no substantial role of GABA from RP3V neurons in the LH surge agrees with our prior in vivo work showing that low frequency optogenetic stimulation of RP3V kisspeptin neurons (only GABA release) has no impact on LH secretion (doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0658-18.2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Title. The present data do not clearly demonstrate the blockade of the LH surge. Thus, the statement that &quot;abolishes the preovulatory surge&quot; is an overinterpretation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree and now use “suppresses the preovulatory surge”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 3. The numbers of individual data points per group change for the different LH pulse parameters, but they should not (Fig. 3 E-G).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This occurs because one mouse in each group had no LH pulses so that only a mean value was available for these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4. (4B) The use of only one terminal blood collection (4B) is insufficient to comprehensively characterize the LH surge. It is not possible to conclude what was the actual effect on the LH surge, whether a blockade or altered amplitude or timing. Serial blood samples at 30- or 60-minute intervals should be used. For comparative purposes, the pulsatile LH secretion, which does not seem to be a major outcome in the study, was fully characterized (Fig. 3). (4C) The linear correlation between c-Fos/GnRH and RP3V/ESR1 appears to be well-fitted for gRNA2 (blue) but not gRNA3 (green). Although this is interpreted as an important result of the study, its description and consistency are not so clear. Authors should perform an Anova/ Kruskal-Wallis analysis of these data as a column graph (as in Fig. 4A, B) and discuss the discrepancies between gRNA2 and gRNA3.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As noted in the manuscript, we agree that a single point LH measurement is a relatively inaccurate assessment of the LH surge and very likely underlies much of the substantial variability between mice. However, the extended duration of cFos expression in GnRH neurons at the time of the surge is a much more accurate “single point” indicator and we feel that these results better reflect the state of surge activation. This was noted in the original manuscript.</p><p>The linear correlations for the different preoptic regions are undertaken on the complete data set not on individual gRNA groups due to low N numbers in the sub-divided groups. However, column graphs of the RP3V and MPN look the same as Fig.4A and would not change the current interpretation. Please see comments to Reviewer 1 on discrepancies between gRNA2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Table. It is unclear why the % VGAT with ESR1 was not statistically reduced in the &quot;bilateral&quot; animals. Would this mean that the ESR1 knockdown was not effective in this subgroup with the more consistent effects?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, this would be a reasonable interpretation suggesting that mice with kisspeptin ablation may have had a slightly different overall impact on ESR1 in VGAT neurons. However, this was not discernable from examining the anatomical distribution of AAV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Discussion 1st paragraph. It is interpreted that mice lacking kisspeptin expression &quot;failed to exhibit an LH surge&quot;. This should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We believe that this is a correct statement. Mice lacking kisspeptin had LH surge values between 0.8 and 2.1 ng/ml that we would not consider consistent with being a surge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Immunohistochemistry. It is not clear in the text how a cross-reaction between goat antirabbit 568 (ERa) and goat antirabbit/streptavidin 647 (mChery) was avoided when used in the same reaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We were forced into this option due to the lack of different primary antisera to ESR1 and mCherry. We first stained for rabbit ESR1 detected by biotin anti-rabbit/ strep647 which resulted in confined nuclear staining (pseudo-blue; far red). The subsequent staining for rabbit mCherry was detected by goat anti-rabbit 568 that will indeed cross-react by binding to any free epitopes on the rabbit ESR1 primary antibody. However, this would not compromise interpretation as additional 568 labelling to the nucleus is essentially irrelevant when examining far red 647 nm emission and only mCherry cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was used to define the anatomical locations of the AAV spread. This is now clearly explained in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Statistical analysis.

This limited amount of detail allows for an easy read with the well-articulated introduction quickly presenting the framework of the study. Although not presenting the axis itself nor mentioning the position of GnRH neurons in this axis or its lack of ERα expression is not detrimental to the understanding of the study, presenting at least the position of GnRH neurons in the axis and their critical role for fertility would likely broaden the impact of this work beyond a rather specialist audience.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that this would provide a more complete picture and have modified the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression of kisspeptin constitutes a key element for the analysis and conclusion of the present work. However, the quality of the kisspeptin immunostaining seems suboptimal based on the representative images. The staining primarily consists of light punctuated structures and it is very difficult to delineate cytoplasmic immunoreactive material defining the shape of neurons in LacZ animals. For some of the cells marked by an arrow, it is also sometimes difficult to determine whether the staining for ESR1 and Kp are in the same focal plane and thus belong to the same neurons. Although this co-expression is not critical for the conclusions of the study, this begs the question of whether Kp expression was determined directly at the microscope (where the focal plan can be adjusted) or on the picture (without possible focal adjustment). Moreover, in the representative image of Kp loss, several nuclei stained for fos (black) show superimposed brown staining looking like a dense nucleus (but smaller than an actual nucleus). This suggests some sort of condensed accumulation of Kp immunoproduct in the nucleus which is not commented. Given the critical importance of this reported change in Kp expression for the interpretation of the present results, it is important to provide strong evidence of the quality/nature of this staining and its analysis which may help interpret the observed functional phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The kisspeptin immunoreactivity represents both fiber and cytoplasmic staining that can be difficult to discern in some cases. The reviewer can be assured that all counts were undertaken “live” on the microscope so that the plane of focus was adjusted to establish co-labelling. Please note that the nuclear immunoreactivity is for ESR1 and not cFos. Regardless, we struggle to see condensed brown staining over the black nuclei as suggested by the Reviewer. The kisspeptin staining is light brown and confined to just a few fibers in Fig.5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As acknowledged in the introduction, this study is not the first to use in vivo Crisp-Cas editing to demonstrate the role of kisspeptin neurons in the control of positive feedback. Although the present work achieved this indirectly by targeting VGAT neurons, I was surprised that the paper did not include more comparison of their results with those of Wang et al., 2019. In particular, why was the present approach more successful in achieving both lack of surge and complete acyclicity?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Wang et al., reported an ~60% reduction in ESR1 expression in Kiss1-Cre (Elias) driven Cas9-expressing cells in the AVPV. As they did not examine kisspeptin expression itself it is unknown to what degree their editing impacted upon kisspeptin neurons. The other differentiating factor was that Wang focussed on the AVPV that only contains a minority of the preoptic kisspeptin population whereas we targeted the AVPV and PeN together. Thus, we suspect that the Wang phenotype arises from insufficient ESR1 knockdown in just the AVPV sub-population of preoptic kisspeptin neurons. We have added a comment to the Discussion as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, why is it that targeting ESR1 in a selected fraction of GABAergic neurons can lead to a near-complete absence of Kp expression in this region? This is briefly discussed in the penultimate paragraph but mostly focuses on the non-kisspeptinergic GABA neurons rather than those co-expressing the two markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have modified this section to try and make it clear that it is very likely that all RP3V kisspeptin neurons would have been targeted to express Cas9 in this mouse model.
