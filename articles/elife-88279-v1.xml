However, the knockdown of <italic>Pten</italic> knockout or treatment of neurons with hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6) transforms neurons into a regenerative state, allowing them to regenerate axons in the injured optic nerve and spinal cord. Transneuronal delivery of hIL-6 to the injured brain stem neurons enables functional recovery after severe spinal cord injury. Here we demonstrate that the beneficial hIL-6 and <italic>Pten</italic> knockout effects on axon growth are limited by the induction of tubulin detyrosination in axonal growth cones. Hence, cotreatment with parthenolide, a compound blocking microtubule detyrosination, synergistically accelerates neurite growth of cultured murine CNS neurons and primary RGCs isolated from adult human eyes. Systemic application of the prodrug dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT) facilitates axon regeneration in the injured optic nerve and spinal cord. Moreover, combinatorial treatment further improves hIL-6-induced axon regeneration and locomotor recovery after severe SCI. Thus, DMAPT facilitates functional CNS regeneration and reduces the limiting effects of pro-regenerative treatments, making it a promising drug candidate for treating CNS injuries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>optic nerve injury</kwd><kwd>parthenolide</kwd><kwd>microtuble detyrosination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>03VP05200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Dietmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systemic treatment with di-methyl-amino-parthenolide facilitates CNS axon regeneration and functional recovery by reducing the induction of microtubule detyrosination by established regenerative therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic CNS injuries often lead to irreversible impairments, such as blindness or loss of motor and sensory function, due to the inability of severed axons to regrow. This regenerative failure is mainly caused by an insufficient intrinsic growth capacity of mature CNS neurons and the inhibitory environment for axonal growth cones at the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer and Leibinger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although no clinically applicable treatment is available to human patients, various strategies exist to promote axon regeneration in experimental models of CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer and Leibinger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng and Tuszynski, 2023</xref>). For example, targeting the inhibitory environment at the lesion site by neutralizing myelin-derived factors or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) led to axonal regeneration and, in some cases, induced functional recovery after incomplete spinal cord lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradbury et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cafferty and Strittmatter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it became evident that not only disinhibition but also strategies to stimulate cell-intrinsic signaling pathways are essential to promote robust axon growth. Among these, lens injury-induced expression and release of the IL-6-type cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from retinal astrocytes transforms retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into a regenerative state and enables moderate axon growth in the injured optic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leibinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2009</xref>). The designer cytokine hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6), a fusion protein of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα) can enormously increase these effects. In contrast to natural cytokines, hIL-6 directly binds to the gp130 receptor and does not rely on previous interaction with cytokine-specific alpha-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heinrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terheyden-Keighley et al., 2022</xref>). This enables a more potent activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, AAV-mediated hIL-6 expression in RGCs elicits a more vigorous optic nerve regeneration over long distances than most other single treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer, 2017</xref>). Similarly, hIL-6 expression in corticospinal neurons simultaneously promotes axon regeneration of multiple descending tracts and partially restores motor function after a complete spinal cord crush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leibinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terheyden-Keighley et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Another way to stimulate CNS axon regeneration is to directly activate the PI3K/AKT pathway by knockout of phosphatase and tensin homolog (<italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zukor et al., 2013</xref>). This approach stimulated axon regeneration in the corticospinal tract even when applied one year after injury and induced functional recovery of voluntary skilled movements after incomplete spinal cord injury or pyramidotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewandowski and Steward, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danilov and Steward, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or hIL-6-mediated AKT activation causes phosphorylation of several substrates, including inactivating phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sutherland et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutherland and Cohen, 1994</xref>). The specific GSK3β knockout (<italic>Gsk3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) in RGCs facilitates optic nerve regeneration by reducing collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) phosphorylation in axons, while constitutively active GSK3 (<italic>Gsk3<sup>S/A</sup></italic>) compromises <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and cytokine-induced regeneration, underlining the relevance of the AKT/GSK3/CRMP2 pathway for CNS regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leibinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibinger et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Besides CRMP2, GSK3 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). Phosphorylated MAP1B keeps microtubules in a dynamic state by blocking the removal of the C-terminal tyrosine from α-tubulin subunits (detyrosination) in axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goold et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez-Billault et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Owen and Gordon-Weeks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gobrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, inhibition of tubulin detyrosination accelerates peripheral nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>). This was achieved by local or systemic application of the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, an inhibitor of VASH1/2, which mediates detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fonrose et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aillaud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gobrecht et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The current study addressed whether parthenolide affects axon regeneration in the CNS. It shows that it markedly accelerates neurite outgrowth of primary CNS neurons by reducing tubulin detyrosination in axonal tips. Moreover, intraperitoneal application of its prodrug dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT) facilitates axon regeneration after optic nerve and spinal cord injuries <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, hIL-6 and <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> increased tubulin detyrosination. At the same time, parthenolide antagonized this effect, further enhancing hIL-6-induced optic nerve and spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery of hindlimb locomotion after severe spinal cord injury. The effects of parthenolide on detyrosination and neurite outgrowth were reproducible in human adult RGCs. In particular, parthenolide is an ideal cotreatment to accelerate axon regeneration and functional recovery in combination with other treatment strategies, making it a promising drug candidate for treating nerve injuries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Parthenolide and CNTF synergistically promote neurite growth of adult RGCs</title><p>In contrast to adult RGCs, sensory neurons usually show spontaneous neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leibinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, parthenolide-induced inhibition of tubulin detyrosination in axonal growth cones markedly accelerates the regeneration of sensory neurons in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gobrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate whether parthenolide has similar effects on CNS neurons, we cultured murine RGCs in the presence of increasing compound concentrations for 4 days. As in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>), parthenolide significantly enhanced neurite extension concentration-dependently with maximum effects at 0.5 and 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Expectedly RGC survival remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) since RGCs do not undergo axotomy-induced cell death as early as 4 days after culturing. Moreover, cotreatment of parthenolide with CNTF showed a significant additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), resulting in a 3.5-fold higher average neurite length than vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Although parthenolide reportedly reduces JAK/STAT3 signaling at micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sobota et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Skoumal et al., 2011</xref>), the nanomolar concentrations used in our experiments did not alter CNTF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Conversely, CNTF did not measurably affect parthenolide’s inhibitory effect on microtubule detyrosination in axon tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). We also tested parthenolide on human RGCs. To this end, we prepared and cultured primary RGCs from adult human eyes. Their identity as human RGCs was verified by retinal wholemount staining, showing βIII-tubulin-positive cells in the ganglion cell layer and axon bundles in the fiber layer, as seen in murine retinae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, their morphology was comparable to murine RGCs, while the cell diameter of human RGCs was larger as observed in cultures and in retinal wholemounts. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).Viability of cultured human RGCs was confirmed by their ability to express GAP43 and to grow neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Parthenolide and CNTF significantly enhanced the average neurite length at similar concentrations as in mouse RGCs, while cotreatment enhanced neurite growth sixfold compared to controls after 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). The total numbers of RGCs per well remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).

However, AKT inactivates GSK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which promotes CRMP2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leibinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibinger et al., 2019</xref>). While enhanced CRMP2 activity is favorable for axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leibinger et al., 2017</xref>), GSK3 inhibition might also elevate tubulin detyrosination via reduced MAP1B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, as shown in the previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), reducing microtubule detyrosination promotes neurite growth, suggesting that this effect of AKT/GSK3 might limit optimal axonal growth. We intravitreally injected AAV2-hIL-6 into mice 3 weeks before tissue isolation to test these possibilities. Subsequent western blot analysis of respective optic nerve lysates indeed revealed increased inhibitory phosphorylation of both GSK3 isoforms (pGSK3α, pGSK3β) by hIL-6 compared to untreated controls, without affecting total GSK3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). Moreover, while hIL-6 reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of CRMP2 at threonine 514 (T514) without changing total CRMP2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, F and G</xref>), it expectedly elevated tubulin detyrosination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and H</xref>). Since parthenolide specifically acts on tubulin detyrosination without influencing CRMP2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), it should be suitable to counteract an hIL-6-mediated increase in axonal tubulin detyrosination. To test this hypothesis, we cultured RGCs from AAV-hIL-6-treated mice or respective controls for 4 days without or in the presence of different parthenolide concentrations. Afterward, we measured the percentage of axon tips with detyrosinated tubulin. Notably, DMAPT does not affect long-lived pre-existing microtubules because, within these, tubulin is present mainly in the detyrosinated form already (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gundersen and Bulinski, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gundersen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Maiato, 2017</xref>). However, DMAPT can prevent the detyrosination of newly attached tubulin dimers in the growth cones of developing axons. Confirmingly, microtubule detyrosination in axonal tips was significantly higher in hIL-6-treated cultures than in controls, and parthenolide cotreatment reversed this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Furthermore, the increased detyrosination in hIL-6-treated neurons also affected the effective parthenolide concentration on neurite extension in these cultures. Compared to the control cultures, where parthenolide showed the most substantial increase between 0.5 and 1 nM, followed by a decrease at 5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), neurite growth of hIL-6-stimulated RGCs was increased even at higher parthenolide concentrations (up to 5 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>).

To this end, adult mice were subjected to an optic nerve crush (ONC) and received daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or DMAPT (2 µg/kg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The number of CTB-labeled, regenerated axons was quantified in optic nerve sections 2 weeks post-injury. Compared to vehicle-treated controls, more axons reached distances of up to 0.5 mm distal to the lesion site after DMAPT application, indicating a slight but significant effect on regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). Expectedly, DMAPT was not able to protect RGCs from axotomy-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>) since it does solely accelerate microtubule polymerization in axonal growth cones without affecting neuroprotective signaling pathways in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then repeated these experiments in combination with intravitreally applied AAV2-hIL-6 which reportedly has a significant neuroprotective effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Two weeks after injury, retinal cross-sections revealed robust phosphorylation of STAT3 in AAV2-hIL-6-treated RGCs, which remained unaffected by DMAPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>), hIL-6 treatment alone enabled substantial regeneration with CTB-labeled axons reaching distances up to 1.5 mm 2 weeks after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–O</xref>). Notably, additional DMAPT application at 2 µg/kg increased the number of axons at 1.5 mm fivefold, with some axons reaching distances of 2.5 mm within the same time after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K, N and O</xref>).

To this end, we performed a complete SCC at the thoracic vertebra 8 (T8) level, followed by daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or DMAPT at 2 µg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Hindlimb movement was analyzed using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2006</xref>) over 8 weeks after injury.

For this reason, the spinal cord tissue of some animals was analyzed for serotonergic fiber regeneration at this early time.

Parthenolide’s effects on CNS regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> were confirmed in cell culture using primary RGCs from adult mice and humans. As on sensory neurons (preprint server, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gobrecht et al., 2022</xref>), parthenolide reduces microtubule detyrosination in axonal tips, which increases their dynamics and promotes axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>). As for sensory neurons, this effect is likely mediated by inhibiting VASH1/VASH2, the enzymes catalyzing the detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gobrecht et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, the effective concentration range and doses of parthenolide/DMAPT to accelerate axon regeneration of RGCs and serotonergic fibers in the spinal cord acompanied with functional recovery was similar to sensory neurons and regeneration in the injured peripheral nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gobrecht et al., 2022</xref>). Parthenolide did not affect CRMP2 or STAT3 activity at the nanomolar concentrations used in this study, both critical for CNS axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibinger et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the reduction of microtubule detyrosination causes the axon growth-promoting effects. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other known activities of parthenolide/DMAPT, such as oxidative stress or NF-kB inhibition, could have contributed to the observed effects, this is rather unlikely because such effects have only been reported at much higher micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bork et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saadane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Systemic DMAPT treatment significantly promotes axon extension in the optic nerve and regeneration of serotonergic fibers beyond the injury site. The selective elimination of serotonergic fibers by DHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capela et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cummings et al., 2009</xref>) abolishes the recovered locomotion, demonstrating that the improved regeneration of serotonergic fibers is essential for recovery after SCC. These data are consistent with previously published data, showing a similar effect on AAV-hIL-6-mediated recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leibinger et al., 2021</xref>). It might appear conceivable that the depletion of non-regenerated serotonergic axons may have contributed to these results. However, we can largely rule this out since DHT did not influence the injured but non-regenerated vehicle control group. Furthermore, we have shown in a previous publication that the general depletion of serotonergic neurons in uninjured animals also has no significant influence on open-field locomotion as measured in the BMS score and subscore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leibinger et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, even though DMAPT-mediated functional improvement depends on the regeneration of serotonergic fibers, we cannot exclude the possibility that spinal tracts other than the raphespinal tract also contributed. The fact that DMAPT improved axon regeneration in the optic nerve and the spinal cord also implies that sufficient amounts of the drug reached the axonal growth cones, where the drug affects the microtubule detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that an oral application of DMAPT, which reportedly is &gt;60% bioavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gobrecht et al., 2022</xref>), has similar effects on nerve regeneration, bolstering the potential as a drug to treat CNS axonal damage. In contrast to the raphespinal tract, axon regeneration in the optic nerve after sole DMAPT treatment might appear only moderate. However, in contrast to raphe neurons, RGCs are subject to apoptotic cell death after axotomy, and DMAPT acts on the axonal growth cones without mediating neuroprotection. Thus, DMAPT can only develop its full effects in combination with neuroprotective approaches like hIL-6, which activates cell-intrinsic signaling pathways and the survival of a larger number of RGCs. In this combination, DMAPT dramatically enhanced axon regeneration.</p><p>Another significant finding of the current study is that pro-regenerative hIL-6 and <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> treatments induce microtubule detyrosination in RGC axons. Given that a parthenolide-mediated reduction of microtubule detyrosination promotes axon growth, these observations suggest that this effect of hIL-6 or <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> compromises their full axon regeneration-promoting potential. hIL-6 and <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> induced microtubule detyrosination is likely caused by inhibitory GSK3 phosphorylation via increased PI3K/AKT activity. As a result, MAP1B activity is decreased, and the axonal detyrosination rate is elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leibinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kath et al., 2018</xref>). However, CNTF does not affect detyrosination due to its lower AKT activation than hIL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibinger et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, hIL-6 and <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mediated GSK3 inhibition confers disinhibitory effects toward myelin-associated molecules because CRMP2 is less inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leibinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibinger et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the disinhibitory effect of GSK3 inhibition promotes regeneration, while the detyrosinating effect on microtubules rather compromises it. Therefore, by counteracting detyrosination, parthenolide/DMAPT cotreatment further increases the axon growth-promoting effect of hIL-6. Consistently, effective parthenolide concentrations reduce detyrosination levels in hIL-6-treated, and <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> RGCs, and combined treatment leads to more substantial neurite growth than each treatment alone. This notion is also supported by the fact that <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and hIL-6-stimulated neurons sustain parthenolide-induced additive elevation of axon growth even at higher parthenolide concentrations, which already diminish outgrowth on naïve or CNTF-stimulated RGCs. The level of detyrosinated tubulin at the maximal applied parthenolide concentration in hIL-6 treated RGCs was still similar to untreated control RGCs. The synergistic effects of DMAPT and hIL-6 were also reproduced <italic>in vivo</italic> in the optic nerve and spinal cord. Thus, parthenolide/DMAPT neutralizes the hIL-6-mediated limiting effect of decreased microtubule dynamics and synergistically accelerates CNS regeneration.</p><p>Our findings also indicate that DMAPT mainly accelerates axon growth and has little effect on the intrinsic regenerative state of neurons. Therefore, the RGC regeneration-promoting effects of parthenolide on its own are only moderate but synergistically increase hIL-6-mediated axon extension. Nevertheless, DMAPT enabled substantial regeneration of serotonergic RpST after complete SCC. Furthermore, the length of regenerating RpST axons after SCC further increased from 2 to 8 wpc, while the functional recovery was already almost maximal in the early phase. This observation might be based on the different possibilities of achieving functional recovery. On the one hand, descending supraspinal axons might need to grow over long distances to reestablish functional connections within the lumbar central pattern generator (CPG), a network of neurons responsible for generating stereotyped hindlimb movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Brand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, it is also possible that severed axons only need to overcome short distances of a few spinal segments and then connect to existing propriospinal interneurons, which might serve as a relay station to the CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). An observation accounting for the latter possibility is increased axonal sprouting in the region of the lumbar CPG (~6–7 mm distal to the lesion) at 8 wpc, whereas the substantial increase in functional recovery occurred already earlier (~2–3 wpc) before the axons had reached the CPG. Thus, DMAPT-induced long-distance RpST regeneration might not be essential for its beneficial effects on functional recovery, whereas DHT experiments showed that RpST regeneration, in general, is crucial.</p><p>In conclusion, systemically applied DMAPT measurably accelerates CNS regeneration and functional recovery and overcomes the limiting effect of AKT/GSK3 on elevating microtubule detyrosination.

The in vitro and mechanistic work laid the foundation for the authors to reach several key predictions that such detyrosination can be applied for in vivo applications.

Overall, the results from in vitro studies are largely well performed. However, the in vivo data are less convincing.</p><p>Interpretation of the findings in this study are limited by several gaps:</p><p>1. It is unclear whether microtubule detyrosination a primary effect of hIL-6 and PTEN deletion or secondary to the increased axon growth?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is based on a misunderstanding, as shown in Fig. 2 by Western blot, that detyrosination was increased after intravitreal injection of AAV2-hIL-6 into optic nerves. These optic nerves were uninjured! This indicates that the increased detyrosination is an effect of the treatment itself and does not occur due to axonal regeneration.</p><p>Why hIL-6 and PTEN nevertheless increase axonal regeneration is because the positive effect on other signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT3 and mTOR, ultimately predominates. Consequently, we show, for both PTEN ko and hIL-6, that we can further enhance these positive effects by neutralizing the negative aspect of increased detyrosination using DMAPT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Is there any direct evidence for Akt and/or JAK/Stat3 to promote microtubule detyrosination?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway, it has been well described that GSK3 activity leads to phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 1B, which results in enhanced tubulin detyrosination (Lucas et al., 1998, Goold et al 1999, Owen and Gordon-Weeks 2003). As shown in our previous and cited work, hIL-6 promotes the activation of AKT, which in turn inhibits GSK3 (Leibinger et al. 2016). In Fig. 2, we have also shown that intravitreal hIL-6 treatment in the optic nerve leads to increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 at the target site of AKT, and that tubulin detyrosination is increased. The same was also shown for PTEN ko: In a previous publication, we showed that PTEN ko increases AKT activity, inhibiting GSK3 phosphorylation (Leibinger et al. 2019). In Fig. 3 of the actual study, we show that PTEN ko results in enhanced tubulin detyrosination. In conclusion, treatments activating the AKT/GSK3 signaling enhance tubulin detyrosination.</p><p>On the other hand, JAK/STAT3 has no direct effect on detyrosination. This was demonstrated in experiments using the CNTF application, which reportedly activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway without affecting AKT/GSK3 (Leibinger et al, 2009, 2016, 2017).</p><p>In cell culture, we have shown that activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by CNTF does not change tubulin detyrosination in neurites (Fig. 1 H, I, M; N). Moreover, DMAPT in RGC’s cell bodies does not affect the phosphorylation of STAT3 and S6, and thus has no measurable effect on JAK/STAT3 or the mTOR pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What is the impact of parthenolide on cell soma of neurons and other cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>Parthenolide and DMAPT show a regenerative effect in the nanomolar range (cell culture) and a bell-shaped concentration-response curve. We show a close correlation between detyrosinated microtubules and regeneration (with and without hIL-6 or PTEN-KO), which is, in our opinion, convincing. Moreover, we would like to address a likely misunderstanding in this comment and provide further clarification. The detyrosination of alpha-tubulin occurs after its attachment to microtubules through the action of the tubulin carboxy peptidase vasohibin 1 and 2 (Vash 1, 2). Consequently, tubulin is already present in the detyrosinated form within existing microtubules, and the administration of DMAPT does not affect these pre-existing microtubules. However, DMAPT does play a crucial role in preventing the detyrosination of newly attached tubulin dimers in the growth cones of developing axons. This explains why we can detect detyrosinated tubulin specifically in those regions and why our immunohistochemical analyses in the cell culture experiments focused solely on axon tips.</p><p>It is important to note that when used at low concentrations, which promote axon growth, DMAPT does not measurably affect detyrosination in other neuronal compartments, such as the RGCs' somata. We might observe a decrease in detyrosination only at much higher concentrations. However, this outcome would be inconsequential to our findings.</p><p>Whether additional effects of DMAPT contribute to improved regeneration is not excluded, although unlikely. If so, their investigation would be beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Direct evidence that parthenolide augments PTEN deletion in optic nerve or spinal cord is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Our research paper primarily investigates the combination of DMAPT with h-IL-6. We chose to combine DMAPT with hIL-6 because, unlike PTEN-KO, only hIL-6 has been demonstrated to facilitate functional recovery following a complete spinal cord crush injury (Leibinger et al., 2021). Therefore, it is unclear why conducting in vivo experiments with PTEN-KO would be necessary, which cannot be used therapeutically. Since we have shown the beneficial effects of DMAPT on hIL-6 in two different in vivo models (optic nerve and spinal cord) anatomically and functionally, we feel that the repetition of these experiments with PTEN ko, which has no therapeutic implication, would not justify the sacrifice of additional animals. This would contradict the principles of reduction, refinement, and replacement, aiming to minimize the use of animals in our research.</p><p>In contrast, the PTEN experiments primarily serve to support the underlying mechanism and demonstrate that DMAPT generally counteracts the negative effect on MT detyrosination, even in conjunction with other procedures that activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings were mechanistically elucidated through cell culture experiments utilizing immunohistochemial analysis, which the editors highlighted as strengths of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Serotonergic neurotoxin DHT ablates both regenerating and non-regenerating serotonergic axons, which makes spinal cord findings it difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>The impact of unregenerated serotonergic axons on stereotypic hind leg movements, as assessed through BMS analysis, appears to be minimal, as demonstrated in our previous study (Leibinger et al., 2021). Specifically, our findings revealed that depleting serotonergic neurons using DHT did not significantly affect the BMS score in uninjured animals (Leibinger et al., 2021). Furthermore, even in the control group comprising animals with spinal cord lesions where anatomical regeneration of the RpST did not occur, the administration of DHT had no discernible effect (Fig. 7 K, L).</p><p>To address this concern, we included the following information in the revised manuscript: &quot;It might be considered plausible that the depletion of non-regenerated serotonergic axons could have contributed to these results. However, we can largely dismiss this possibility, as DHT did not influence the non-regenerated vehicle control group. Additionally, in a previous publication, we have demonstrated that the general depletion of serotonergic neurons in uninjured animals also does not significantly impact open field locomotion, as measured by the BMS score and subscore (Leibinger et al., 2021).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In brief, the in vivo evidence was rather weak, especially if no further evidence was offered to respond to these points below.</p><p>To possibly improve the manuscript, the authors could consider enhancing the in vivo parts in the following manner;</p><p>1. possibly detyrosination staining in the optic nerve vertical section - it would be interesting to see how the detyrosination assays may work for regenerating conditions, or as an alternate, the authors may consider retina tissue biochemistry (with &amp; without IL6, with &amp; without DMAPT) repeating the biochemical assays as established Fig 2B –</p></disp-quote><p>The detyrosination of alpha-tubulin occurs after its attachment to microtubules through the action of the tubulin carboxy peptidase vasohibin 1 and 2 (Vash 1, 2).

How do the authors benchmark the DMAPT retreatment in the setting of PTEN (aav2-cre injection for cKO) and /or PTEN/SOCS3/CNTF dKO? Which are the best approaches to promote optic nerve regeneration? Would the authors expect DMAPT retreatment to be synergetic with PTENcKO?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our previous findings, we anticipate that DMAPT would exhibit a synergistic effect when combined with PTEN ko, as demonstrated in our in vitro studies with cultured neurons. Additionally, synergistic effects between DMAPT and PTEN/SOCS3 dKO +CNTF are possible. While these hypotheses hold promise, our current paper primarily focuses on combining DMAPT with hIL-6, which has consistently shown remarkable efficacy as a standalone treatment in optic nerve regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Regarding the DMAPT treatment, one notable issue was that the RGC survival subject to ONC was very poor, which may limit the effects of DMAPT daily injection. The authors may consider further combining DMAPT with the DLK/LZK inhibitors to examine the synergistic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As DMAPT itself is not neuroprotective and does not affect retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs) regenerative state by inducing the expression of regeneration-associated genes, a combination with a neuroprotective and regenerative treatment would show stronger effects. This is exactly what we found when combining DMAPT with neuroprotective hIL-6 (Leibinger et al. 2016) in the current paper.</p><p>Moreover, in the raphespinal tract, where respective neurons do not undergo apoptotic cell death after axotomy, the DMAPT effect on anatomic axon regeneration was stronger than in the optic nerve, even without combination with hIL-6, with some axons reaching distances of up to 7 mm distal to the lesion. So, DMAPT can induce long-distance regeneration in neuronal populations unaffected by cell death. Therefore, additional experiments with DLK/LZK inhibitors, as suggested by this reviewer, would not provide an additional benefit to our paper and would not justify the additional sacrifice of animal lives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Overall, the phenotypes in Figs 5-8 were rather weak after DMAPT treatment, which are universal challenges to spinal cord regeneration. The authors may present this section of the data with further clarification on the selection standards in the methods, such as how the animals and treatment were selected and how a double-blinded experimental design may help further evaluate the effects of DMAPT treatment. I found little relevant information in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the anatomic and functional regeneration analysis presented in Fig. 5-8, we only included animals with a BMS score of 0 one day after the spinal cord crush, indicating a complete absence of hind leg movement. Furthermore, we employed immunohistochemical staining to ensure that no serotonergic axons were detected at 8-10 mm from the lesion site in any of the animals, thus confirming the thoroughness of the lesion (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both the evaluation of the BMS score and the assessment of anatomical regeneration was conducted in a double-blinded manner, ensuring unbiased and objective observations. To address this concern, we will add the following paragraph in the M&amp;M part:</p><p>“Blinding procedure for in vivo experimentsBefore the start of the experiment, individual vials containing DMAPT or vehicle (DMSO) stock solution were prepared for each particular experimental animal. The vials were randomized by a person who was neither involved in the implementation nor in the evaluation of the experiments. These numbers were randomly distributed to mice of the same age and sex in different cages. This was carried out independently by another person who was neither involved in the data evaluation nor the randomization of the samples. This was followed by the execution of the experiments and the evaluation by scientists who were not involved in any of the randomization processes and did not know the identity of the injected samples. After completion of the data collection, values from mice with signs of spared axons were first removed from the data set for reasons of quality assurance. The criteria for this were a BMS-Sore of a maximum of 0-1 on the first day after the lesion and the absence of uninjured serotonergic axons in spinal cord cross-sections &gt;8-10 mm distal to the lesion site. Finally, the data points were assigned to the respective experimental groups by the person who initially blinded the vials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Addition of supporting data, revision of discussion, and inclusion of references for parthenolide activities improved the manuscript and adequately addressed concerns</p></disp-quote><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We feel that the use of human RGCs should be considered a highlight and strength of our paper because, as far as we know, our study is the first to utilize human primary cultures of RGCs to confirm the effectiveness of drugs on human cells. Therefore, this might be of interest to colleagues in our field. Moreover, we have added additional data as suppl. Fig. proving that these cells are living RGCs so this concern has been addressed. In addition, we provide further explanations why other activities of DMAPT beyond microtubule detyrosination, such as oxidative stress and NFkB inhibition, are not considered in experimental examinations or in the interpretation of findings. Therefore, we strongly recommend that this point should not be considered a weakness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>1.

Moreover, we demonstrate a close correlation between the inhibition of detyrosinated microtubules and regeneration and consider the effects of hIL-6 or PTEN-KO on detyrosination in mouse and human RGCs. Therefore, we offer a coherent and satisfactory mechanistic explanation for the effects of parthenolide. We, therefore, feel the request to experimentally explore additional, somewhat speculative possibilities is not reasonable or helpful, and this issue should not be considered as a weakness. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence suggests profound antioxidative effects of DMAPT or parthenolide within these low-concentration ranges and that these would affect axon regeneration. Antioxidative effects may also not explain the observed bell-shaped curve. Furthermore, we have already considered the effect of NFkappaB in our previous work (Gobrecht et al., 2016) and shown that NFkappaB remains unaffected by low concentrations of parthenolide. Hence, conducting additional experiments addressing oxidative stress or other speculative causes will not strengthen our findings and do not justify the additional sacrifice of animal lives.</p><p>Nevertheless, we added the following sentence in our manuscript to address this issue: “Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other known activities of parthenolide/DMAPT, such as oxidative stress or NF-kB inhibition, could have contributed to the observed effects, this is rather unlikely because such effects have only been reported at much higher micromolar concentrations (Bork et al., 1997; Saadane et al., 2007; Carlisi et al., 2016; Gobrecht et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Editorial Comments:</p><p>The reviewers' consensus is that this manuscript, although containing an impressive amount of data, lacks cohesion.</p><p>The mechanistic studies in vitro are of a distinctly different caliber than the in vivo studies. Additional data is needed to demonstrate that the mechanisms delineated in vitro are related to the outcomes in vivo. As is, this reads as a comprehensive in vitro study with premature in vivo data tacked on the end.</p><p>The manuscript should contain the necessary background and contextual information needed to fully understand the work. Clarity of rationale and context for experimental method/design (why one reagent or insult is selected over another), result interpretation (what does this data tell you and not tell you), and implications for results (what does this mean in the context of current knowledge) should be improved throughout.</p><p>Technical:</p><p>1. There is no validation of human RGC cultures. If this data is to remain in the manuscript, proper verification data should be provided to demonstrate that these are indeed RGCs and that they are viable.</p></disp-quote><p>The retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were identified by applying the same criteria as murine and rat RGCs,encompassing morphological and immunohistochemical criteria. The staining of a piece of human retina (see Author response image 1) shows βIII-tubulin-positive cells in the ganglion cell layer and forming axonal bundles in the fiber layer. These are RGCs, and it is confirmed that the βIII-tubulin antibody stains human RGCs (Author response image 1A). In addition, the somata of these human RGCs in the retina have a similar diameter (somewhat larger than murine RGCs Author response image 1A, B) to the cultured βIII-tubulin-positive cells (RGCs) and a similar morphology. Finally, these regenerating neurons are GAP43-positive, a regeneration-associated protein shown in Author response image 1C. Thus, these data prove that the cultured cells were human RGCs.

For graphs depicting means and errors, it is advised that the authors evaluate their use of SEM. Standard deviation should be used when illustrating the distribution of measurements/individuals within a population. Standard error should be used for determining accuracy of the calculated mean, i.e. how close are individuals to the calculated mean? Since standard error is a measure of accuracy rather than distribution, it moves towards zero as the population size increases, regardless of the distribution.

We then repeated these experiments in combination with intravitreally applied AAV2hIL-6 which reportedly has a significant neuroprotective effect (Leibinger et al., 2016) (Fig. 4 H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Serotonergic neurotoxin DHT, which in the spinal cord injury model ablates both regenerating and nonregenerating serotonergic axons, which makes interpretation of the results difficult. This should be addressed directly in interpretation and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The impact of unregenerated serotonergic axons on stereotypic hind leg movements, as assessed through BMS analysis, appears to be minimal, as demonstrated in our previous study (Leibinger et al., 2021). Specifically, our findings revealed that depleting serotonergic neurons using DHT did not significantly affect the BMS score in uninjured animals (Leibinger et al., 2021). Furthermore, even in the control group comprising animals with spinal cord lesions where anatomical regeneration of the RpST did not occur, the administration of DHT had no discernible effect (Fig. 7 K, L).</p><p>To address this concern, we propose including the following information in the revised manuscript: &quot;It might appear conceivable that the depletion of non-regenerated serotonergic axons may have contributed to these results. However, we can rule this out since DHT did not influence the non-regenerated vehicle control group. Furthermore, we have shown in a previous publication that the general depletion of serotonergic neurons in uninjured animals also has no significant influence on openfield locomotion as measured in the BMS score and subscore (Leibinger et al., 2021). Furthermore, we have shown in a previous publication that the general depletion of serotonergic neurons in uninjured animals also has no significant influence on openfield locomotion as measured in the BMS score and subscore (Leibinger et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5). Overall, the phenotypes in Figs 5-8 were rather weak after DMAPT treatment, which are universal challenges to spinal cord regeneration. The authors may present this section of the data with further clarification on the selection standards in the methods, such as how the animals and treatment were selected and how a double-blinded experimental design may help further evaluate the effects of DMAPT treatment. I found little relevant information in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the anatomic and functional regeneration analysis presented in Figures 5-8, we only included animals with a BMS score of 0 one day after the spinal cord crush, indicating a complete absence of hind leg movement. Furthermore, we employed immunohistochemical staining to ensure that no serotonergic axons were detected at 8-10 mm from the lesion site in any of the animals, thus confirming the thoroughness of the lesion (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both the evaluation of the BMS score and the assessment of anatomical regeneration was conducted in a doubleblinded manner, ensuring unbiased and objective observations. To address this concern, we will add the following paragraph in the M&amp;M part:</p><p>“Blinding procedure for in vivo experimentsBefore the start of the experiment, individual vials containing DMAPT or vehicle (DMSO) stock solution were prepared for each experimental animal. The vials were randomized by a person who was neither involved in the implementation nor evaluated the experiments. These numbers were randomly distributed to mice of the same age and sex in different cages. This was carried out independently by another person who was neither involved in the data evaluation nor the randomization of the samples. This was followed by the execution of the experiments and the evaluation by scientists who were not involved in any randomization processes and did not know the identity of the injected samples. After completion of the data collection, values from mice with signs of spared axons were first removed from the data set for quality assurance. The criteria for this were a BMS Sore of a maximum of 0-1 on the first day after the lesion and the absence of uninjured serotonergic axons in spinal cord cross-sections &gt;9-10 mm distal to the lesion site. Finally, the data points were assigned to the respective experimental groups by the person who initially blinded the vials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Several supplemental figures are discussed as critical elements of the studies performed. The authors are encouraged to include figures discussed as primary data as primary figures in the manuscript and provide the necessary information regarding experimental design and methods, including &quot;n&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While the &quot;n&quot; is clear for some subsets of figures (as noted in the rebuttal), it is not clear for all outcomes/figure subsets. For example, it appears that some outcomes were performed in only a subset of the total experimental population and not in the context of statistically significant result. A good example of this is the figure for in vivo suboptimal dosing. The experimental design suggests n=7-10, but the group considered suboptimal due to statistical insignificance is listed as n=4. Is this an entirely separate cohort? If so, is n=4 sufficient and was it considered statistically in the context of the higher-powered cohorts? The lack of clarity regarding experimental design should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>To ensure transparency we have provided all n-numbers for each outcome and figure subset. Additionally, the precise n-numbers can be inferred by observing the number of individual points depicted in the graphs. All statistical data are appropriately indicated in the figure legends for reference.</p><p>The data presented in suppl. Fig. 3 represents a preliminary experiment to find effective doses of DMAPT in vivo. In this initial phase, we tested three different doses of DMAPT (0.2, 2, 20 µg/kg) in a reduced group size of only four animals per group. This reduction in animal numbers aligns with the principles to determine reduction, refinement, and replacement, aiming to minimize the use of animals in our research. Subsequently, the group demonstrating the most robust effect (2 µg/kg) was expanded by including additional animals to meet the a priori calculated sample size and validate the results. These additional animal data are presented in Figure 4 A-C.In the case of suppl. Fig. 3 A, B the statistical analysis indicated a significant effect in A using an n=4. As a result, there was no need to utilize additional animals for this particular experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gaps:</p><p>1. By in vitro studies, the authors showed that hIL-6 treatment or PTEN knockout elevated microtubule detyrosination. But when does this occur? In another words, is this a primary effect of these treatments or secondary to the increased axon growth? How does this fit with the observations that these interventions promote axon regeneration both in vitro and in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>This point also seems to be based on a misunderstanding, as shown in Figure 2 by Western blot, that detyrosination was increased after intravitreal injection of AAV2-hIL-6 into optic nerves. These optic nerves were uninjured! This indicates that the increased detyrosination is an effect of the treatment itself and does not occur due to axonal regeneration.</p><p>Why hIL-6 and PTEN nevertheless increase axonal regeneration is because the positive effect on other signaling pathways, such as JAK/STAT3 and mTOR, ultimately predominates. Consequently, we show, for both PTEN ko and hIL-6, that we can further enhance these positive effects by neutralizing the negative aspect of increased detyrosination using DMAPT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Is there any direct evidence for Akt and/or JAK/Stat3 to promote microtubule detyrosination?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our previous and cited work, hIL-6, in contrast to CNTF, promotes the activation of AKT (Leibinger et al. 2016). In Fig. 2, we have also shown that intravitreal hIL-6 treatment in the optic nerve leads to increased phosphorylation of GSK3, a substrate of AKT, and that tubulin detyrosination is increased.</p><p>As far as we know, JAK/STAT3 has no direct effect on detyrosination.</p><p>In cell culture, we have shown that activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by CNTF application does not change tubulin detyrosination in neurites (Fig. 1 H, I, M; N).</p><p>DMAPT in RGC’s cell bodies does not affect the phosphorylation of STAT3 and S6, and thus has no measurable effect on JAK/STAT3 or the mTOR pathway. Moreover, tubulin detyrosination in neuronal cell bodies is not affected by DMAPT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Empirical data linking in vivo regeneration with mechanisms delineated in in vitro studies is limited. The addition of such data (i.e. biochemical assays, relevant histology) would better enable interpretation of in vivo studies and improve cohesiveness of the work as a whole.</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanistic links between hIL-6 /PTEN-signaling and tubulin detyrosination and the abrogation of the adverse effects by DMAPT have been extensively addressed in vitro, which has been positively highlighted here in several places. Indeed, the in vivo data were intended to mainly confirm that the mechanisms elaborated in vitro are relevant to axonal regeneration and functional restoration in vivo. Most importantly our data demonstrate that systemic DMAPT application promotes axon regeneration in the CNS and improves functional recovery after a complete spinal cord injury. Form a clinical point of view this is important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. DMAPT activities are not limited to microtubule detyrosination. These alternate activities should be considered, particularly in in vivo studies. Empirical evidence of the potential impact for these mechanisms in the retina, optic nerve, and systemically is strongly encouraged. In vitro studies or studies of a specific neuronal population are insufficient to extrapolate activities in an intact system.</p></disp-quote><p>Parthenolide and DMAPT show a regenerative effect in the nanomolar range (cell culture) and a bell-shaped concentration-response curve. We show a close correlation between detyrosinated microtubules and regeneration (with and without hIL6 or PTEN-KO), which is, in our opinion, convincing. Whether additional effects of DMAPT contribute to improved regeneration is not excluded, although unlikely. If so, their investigation would be beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How do the authors benchmark the DMAPT retreatment in the setting of PTEN (aav2-cre injection for cKO) and /or PTEN/SOCS3/CNTF dKO? Which are the best approaches to promote optic nerve regeneration? Would the authors expect DMAPT retreatment to be synergetic with PTENcKO?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our previous findings, we anticipate that DMAPT would exhibit a synergistic effect when combined with PTEN ko, as demonstrated in our in vitro studies with cultured neurons. Additionally, synergistic effects between DMAPT and PTEN/SOCS3 dKO +CNTF are possible. While these hypotheses hold promise, our current paper primarily focuses on combining DMAPT with hIL-6, which has consistently shown remarkable efficacy as a standalone treatment in optic nerve regeneration.</p><p>Furthermore, our rationale for combining DMAPT with hIL-6 rather than PTEN-KO stems from the fact that, unlike PTEN-KO, hIL-6 has been proven to enable functional recovery following complete spinal cord crush injuries (Leibinger et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. A cohesive discussion of findings would be beneficial. What can and cannot be elucidated from in vitro and in vivo studies? How does the in vivo effect compare to existing strategies? What are the limitations of the studies performed? Are there alternative explanations for the findings in vitro or in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
