We use computational modelling to test different scenarios for how Four-jointed might act and test the model predictions by employing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching as an in vivo assay to measure the influence of Four-jointed on Fat-Dachsous binding. We demonstrate that in vivo, Four-jointed acts both on Fat to promote its binding to Dachsous and on Dachsous to inhibit its binding to Fat, with a bias towards a stronger effect on Fat. Overall, we show that opposing gradients of Fat and Dachsous phosphorylation are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of Fat–Dachsous binding and planar polarisation across the wing, and thus demonstrate the mechanism by which a long-range gradient is interpreted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05789.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05789.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05789.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Epithelial cells form sheets that line the body surfaces and internal cavities of animals—such as the skin and the lining of the gut. Certain structures on the surface of epithelial cell sheets—for example scales, hair, and feathers—are often all orientated in a particular direction. Epithelial cells with structures organised like this are described as being ‘planar polarised’.</p><p>Different proteins work together to set up planar polarity in a sheet of epithelial cells. Dachsous and Fat are two proteins that are found in the cell membranes of epithelial cells, including in the wings of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These proteins bind to each other and link a cell to its neighbour. Dachsous and Fat accumulate on opposing sides of each cell: Fat accumulates on the side closest to the fly's body, and Dachsous builds up on the side closest to the wing tip. This pattern provides directional cues that help orientate surface structures, and the pattern is established, in part, by the activity of an enzyme called Four-jointed.</p><p>Four-jointed adds phosphate groups onto Dachsous and Fat. The activity of the Four-jointed enzyme forms a gradient along a developing wing: levels are low near the fly's body, and high at the wing tip. Previous experiments performed on cells grown in the laboratory showed that when Four-jointed adds phosphate groups to Fat and Dachsous, it prevents Dachsous from binding to Fat. However, it also makes Fat more able to bind to Dachsous. These opposing effects are thought to cause the proteins to accumulate on opposing sides of each cell. However, this has yet to be demonstrated in real tissue, not least because of the technical difficulty of measuring whether Fat-Dachsous binding has occurred in living organisms.</p><p>Here, Hale et al. overcome this challenge using a method called ‘fluorescence recovery after photobleaching’ (or FRAP) to measure Fat and Dachsous binding in the epithelial cells in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. Combining these experimental results with a computational model confirmed the findings of previous laboratory studies: that Four-jointed makes it easier for Fat to bind to Dachsous, and makes it more difficult for Dachsous to bind to Fat. The opposing effects on the activity of Fat and Dachsous that result from the Four-jointed gradient in the developing wing are able to fully explain the observed patterns of Fat-Dachsous binding and of planar polarisation across the wing.</p><p>Overall, Hale et al. demonstrate how a gradient of protein activity that spans many cells is sensed and interpreted by individual cells to establish planar polarity. However, exactly how the phosphate groups added to Dachsous and Fat by Four-jointed modifies how they bind to each other remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05789.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05789.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>PCP</kwd><kwd>planar polarity</kwd><kwd>gradients</kwd><kwd>Four-jointed</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strutt</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brittle</surname><given-names>Amy L</given-names></name><name><surname>Strutt</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opposing gradients of Fat and Dachsous phosphorylation are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of Fat-Dachsous planar polarisation across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Planar polarity (also known as planar cell polarity [PCP]) refers to the coordinated polarisation of cells within the plane of a tissue such as an epithelium. How epithelia are planar polarised and how planar polarisation is co-ordinated across a tissue has intrigued researchers for decades. In the late 1950's, Locke presented evidence that orienting gradients could control epithelial tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Locke, 1959</xref>), but despite years of research, the mechanisms by which graded cues might mediate the coordinated polarisation of individual cells remain incompletely understood (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Strutt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Of the known molecular systems regulating planar polarity, only for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fat-Dachsous-Four-jointed (Ft-Ds-Fj) pathway is there strong evidence for a primary role of graded activity in providing orienting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeidler et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Simon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). Ft and Ds are large atypical cadherins known to bind to each other heterophilically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>), and Fj is a kinase shown to be active in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strutt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>).

How the complementary expression patterns of Fj and Ds result in the accumulation of Ft and Ds on opposing cell edges is still under investigation, however, the data suggest that higher proximal expression of Ds and the opposing gradient of Fj expression leads to a gradient of Ft–Ds dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Strutt, 2009</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Waddington (1943)</xref> first reported a genetic interaction between <italic>fj</italic> and <italic>ds</italic>, and subsequent work revealed that Fj was able to regulate the localisation and function of both Ft and Ds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Irvine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strutt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casal et al., 2006</xref>). Fj is able to phosphorylate several cadherin repeats of both Ft and Ds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>), raising the possibility that this is a mechanism by which Fj regulates Ft–Ds binding. This led to examination of the result of Fj phosphorylation on Ft and Ds binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Using a cell aggregation assay, based on <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells co-transfected with Fj, Ds, or Ft, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al. (2010)</xref> deduced that Fj was able to act on three previously identified serines in Ds to inhibit the binding of Ds to Ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>). Using an alkaline phosphatase-based cell surface binding assay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al. (2010)</xref> similarly found that Fj inhibited the ability of Ds to bind to Ft and were also able to demonstrate an improvement in Ft binding to Ds. In addition, in vivo assays examining the propagation of polarity from over-expression clones also found that over-expressed Fj promoted Ft activity and inhibited Ds activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>So far there is no direct in vivo evidence that Fj normally does act on both Ft and Ds to modulate their binding during tissue patterning, or that any such activity is directly dependent on the mapped phosphorylation sites in the cadherin domains. Furthermore, it is unclear how the observed asymmetric subcellular distributions of Ft and Ds are related to the proposed differences in binding affinities between neighbouring cells and across the tissue.</p><p>To address these issues, we have carried out in vivo studies of Ft and Ds behaviour, making use of both normal protein forms and variants mutated at the mapped phosphorylation sites, and using protein mobility as measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) as a novel assay for in vivo binding activity. Furthermore, to better understand the possible effects of Fj phosphorylation on Ft–Ds binding and how this might lead to their asymmetric subcellular distributions, we have combined our experimental approach with computational modelling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modelling Ft and Ds interactions and the emergence of cellular asymmetry</title><p>As an aid to understand the possible consequences for the generation of cellular asymmetry of Fj acting on either Ft or Ds or both, we generated a computational model reflecting a one-dimensional line of cells each with two compartments, to simulate Ft–Ds binding between cells according to a Fj gradient (see ‘Materials and methods’). In the model, Fj is allowed to phosphorylate either Ft or Ds in proportion to its concentration, and Ft and Ds are then permitted to freely bind at cell edges until they reach equilibrium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To produce a representative model, we measured the gradient of Fj expression across <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), using <italic>fj</italic> null clones to determine the appropriate background correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C′′</xref>). A gradient of 2.5–3.5% between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was observed along the proximo-distal axis. We also allowed redistribution of Ft and Ds to occur in the model, in accordance with our experimental observations of protein mobility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,L</xref>). A hierarchy of binding affinities was used, based on the in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>), with phosphorylated Ft (FtP) and unphosphorylated Ds (Ds) producing the strongest partnership, and unphosphorylated Ft (Ft) and phosphorylated Ds (DsP) producing the weakest partnership (see ‘Materials and methods’).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05789.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational modelling of the effect of a Fj gradient on Ft–Ds binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustrating Ft–Ds binding and the predicted effect of a Fj gradient on the distribution of Ft–Ds heterodimers in a single cell. In the absence of any gradients (i.e., uniform Ft, Ds, and Fj expression across the tissue), Ft (blue) and Ds (purple) freely associate at junctions, with a certain proportion binding to form heterodimers (indicated by double black bars). We predict that by adding a Fj gradient (yellow bar) an asymmetric distribution of Ft–Ds binding across a cell will occur. If Fj inhibits Ds binding and promotes Ft binding more strongly to the right, Ft molecules in each cell prefer to bind to Ds in the next left-most cell (with which they have a stronger binding interaction), and so preferentially accumulate at left cell edges; similarly Ds molecules prefer to associate with Ft in the next right-most cell and in turn accumulate at right cell edges. Hence, the overall consequence of a Fj gradient and free movement of Ft and Ds within cells is the generation of cellular asymmetries of Ft and Ds distributions.

If Fj acts on Ds only (<bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>), weak asymmetry is seen within cells (3.8% increase) and a tissue gradient of higher to lower Ft–Ds binding is seen as Fj increases. If Fj acts on Ft only (<bold>D′</bold> and <bold>E′</bold>) similar weak asymmetry (3.6% increase) is seen within cells, however, a tissue gradient of lower to higher Ft–Ds binding is observed as Fj increases.

Initially, puncta and non-puncta regions are selected and their intensity measured (pre-bleach intensity). The regions are bleached for a few seconds by increasing the laser power. Bleached regions are imaged over time and recovery of the unstable population is measured for around 5 min. Measurements are plotted and a one-phase exponential curve is fitted to the data. The plateau of this curve gives us the unstable fraction and to get the stable fraction we minus the unstable fraction from 1, for example, 1–0.78 = 0.22. This figure is multiplied by the pre-bleach intensity to give the stable amount. So if, for example, 78% unbleached protein has recovered, 22% of the bleached protein in the region of interest is then the stable fraction. We multiply this by the original pre-bleach intensity. So, a starting intensity of 500 units is multiplied by 0.22 to get a final stable amount of 110 units. However, if a mutant has a starting intensity of 250 and the same stable fraction of 22% we would say the stable amount of the mutant is 55. The mutant has therefore much less stable protein at junctions despite having a similar stable fraction.

However, in both cases there is also a shallow gradient of bound protein across the tissue. If, however, Fj acts on both Ft and Ds, there is improved cellular asymmetry and a negligible tissue gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D″,E″</xref>). Notably, neither situation predicts the approximate two-fold asymmetry in Ds distribution across the cell axis that is experimentally observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>, see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>Thus, in our model, Fj acting on only Ft, or only Ds, or both results in asymmetric subcellular distributions of Ft and Ds. Therefore, in order to resolve the role of Fj in Ft–Ds asymmetry generation, we sought to understand its effects on Ft–Ds binding in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ft and Ds exhibit stable populations at the cell junctions</title><p>As there is no method for directly measuring the strength of binding of two proteins in the in vivo context of a living tissue, we instead employed FRAP to assay the mobility of Ft and Ds in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. During FRAP, flies with an EGFP-tagged protein (e.g., Ds-EGFP) are used, and a fluorescent region of interest is selected and bleached. The same region is imaged over time and recovery of fluorescent protein is measured. Recovery is due to movement of unbleached protein into the bleached area from elsewhere in the cell and any protein that has been bleached remains bleached and is not reactivated. Therefore, if after bleaching and imaging, over time we see, for example, fluorescence recovering to 30% of the starting intensity we assume that 70% of the bleached protein remains and is therefore stably bound at the junction. We perform all of our experiments using the same microscope settings (unless otherwise stated) and since protein levels (and thus fluorescent intensity) can vary between genotypes, we must take this into account during our analysis. To do this, we multiply the starting intensity by the stable fraction to get a final stable amount (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We make the assumption that a decrease in the speed or size of the mobile population provides a readout of increased binding interactions. For instance, if the size of the mobile population (unstable fraction) increases in a particular genotype and, once the intensity is taken into account, a smaller stable amount of overall protein is calculated, we assume that binding affinity has decreased. Additionally, if the speed of protein recovery after bleaching increases in a particular mutant, we infer that binding is not as strong as ‘wild-type’ and the protein can therefore relocate more quickly. FRAP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strutt et al., 2011</xref> see also ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: individual data points and confidence intervals are also provided in the relevant figure supplements and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in the same proximal region of the wing disc (unless otherwise stated) using a strain of flies expressing the Ds protein endogenously tagged with EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>), and a newly generated strain in which EGFP was inserted at the C-terminus of the endogenous Ft coding region (see ‘Materials and methods’). Both transgenes were found to be expressed and localised similarly to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and insertion of the tag did not affect wing size or shape suggesting protein function is normal.</p><p>Live imaging of both Ft-EGFP and Ds-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>) revealed that the junctional populations exhibit a punctate distribution, as previously seen by immunolabelling in fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>) and also for components of the ‘core’ planar polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>). In our FRAP experiments, puncta and non-puncta regions were bleached and fluorescence recovery was measured over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Ft-EGFP signal was almost twice the level of Ds-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), therefore laser power had to be adjusted accordingly between experiments meaning the final stable amounts for Ds-EGFP cannot be compared directly to those for Ft-EGFP. For both puncta and non-puncta, there was some recovery of fluorescence demonstrating that the proteins were mobile at junctions. Recovery was not complete indicating that there was also a population of stable Ds-EGFP and Ft-EGFP that did not recover during the time period used. Measuring protein recovery revealed a significant difference in stability between puncta and non-puncta regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) with puncta showing an increased amount of stable protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C″,D″</xref>, both p = 0.0001) when taking pre-bleach intensity levels into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C′,D′</xref>).

The internalisation assay is performed in pre-pupal wings as the peripodial membrane prevents the assay from being effective in the wing disc. Live pre-pupal wings were dissected in Schneider's medium and incubated with antibody against V5 at 0°C followed by washing and chasing at room temperature before fixation. The amount of V5-Ft at the cell surface was determined via incubation with secondary antibody in the absence of detergent. When endocytosis was allowed by moving the tissue to room temperature the total amount of apical cell surface protein decreased over time suggesting protein internalisation was occurring and indicating the presence of an unstable cell surface population of V5-Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To confirm that protein loss was not due to antibody drop off, V5-Ft previously found at the surface was traced to internal vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and found to co-localise with the early endosome marker Hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F′</xref>). Populations of V5-Ft appeared to be resistant to endocytic turnover with persistent puncta of cell surface V5-Ft observed after 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This was consistent with the puncta stability observed in FRAP experiments both in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D″</xref>) and also in the pre-pupal wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Note however, that although we assume that these remaining populations in each assay are the same, we cannot be certain that this is the case. During FRAP, we are unable to observe the fate of the bleached protein. Furthermore, in the internalisation assay, protein might be internalised and return to the same sites via exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ft and Ds require each other for junctional stability</title><p>To understand whether the observed protein stability at junctions was due to the presence of heterophilic binding between Ft and Ds, FRAP was performed on both Ft-EGFP and Ds-EGFP in <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>ft</italic> null mutant backgrounds, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Removal of the putative binding partner resulted in the loss of obvious puncta and the almost complete recovery of fluorescence after bleaching, indicating that the majority of protein had become unstable at junctions. Thus, the observed stability of each protein is dependent on the presence of the binding partner.</p><p>Comparing data for the rate of recovery of fluorescence of Ds-EGFP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) further revealed that the mobile populations of Ds-EGFP show slower movement, either in puncta or non-puncta, in the presence of Ft, compared to that in the absence of Ft (where no puncta are observed). This suggests that in addition to the immobile population of Ds bound to Ft which is concentrated in puncta as described in the previous section, there is also a mobile population of Ds-EGFP present in both puncta and non-puncta regions which is bound to Ft and shows less rapid movement than free Ds-EGFP (i.e., Ds-EGFP in the absence of Ft). The reduction in the rate of movement of these mobile Ds-Ft heterodimers in puncta as opposed to non-puncta might indicate the presence of a cis-dimerisation mechanism that promotes the clustering of heterodimers into the puncta. Alternatively, mechanisms such as physical interactions with the cytoskeleton similar to those seen for E-Cadherin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavey et al., 2008</xref>) may be responsible for the reduced mobility.</p><p>Our data on the rate of recovery of Ft-EGFP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) also support these conclusions. However, in this case there is a negligible difference in the rate of movement of Ft-EGFP in non-punctate regions in the presence of Ds, as compared to the rate of movement of Ft-EGFP in the absence of Ds, and also a faster rate of Ft-EGFP mobility within puncta as compared to Ds-EGFP in puncta. We surmise that these differences are due to there being an excess of Ft-EGFP present over Ds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), resulting in an increased proportion of the population of Ft-EGFP being unbound and thereby free to move into bleached regions.</p><p>Overall, we conclude from our FRAP experiments using ‘wild-type’ Ft-EGFP and Ds-EGFP, that Ft and Ds bind to each other across cell membranes resulting in the production of immobile fractions of Ft and Ds at cell junctions, and a reduction in mobility of Ft and Ds at junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The in vivo effect of Fj on Ft/Ds stability</title><p>Having thus demonstrated that Ft–Ds binding can be measured in vivo by virtue of the effects that binding has on protein mobility and stability, we next sought to understand the effects of Fj on Ft–Ds binding.

As Ft–Ds binding across junctions is mutually dependent, we infer that if one protein gains or loses stability, so will the other. Moreover, as Fj is thought to act on Ft and Ds in opposite ways, if we remove Fj, we might not expect to see any difference in overall stability of Ft–Ds dimers as the positive and negative effects could cancel each other out. If a difference is observed, it suggests that phosphorylating one protein has a stronger effect than phosphorylating the other.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05789.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ft and Ds stability upon loss of Fj.</title><p>Stable fraction of (<bold>A</bold>) Ds-EGFP and (<bold>B</bold>) Ft-EGFP in a <italic>fj</italic><sup><italic>d1</italic></sup> background (yellow lines).

However, we found that Ds-EGFP became less stable upon removal of Fj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A″</xref>, p = 0.004), with a reduction in both the stable fraction (i.e., an increase in the height of the plateau) and the stable amount at junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,A″</xref>).

However, our data have shown that, although Fj can act on both Ft and Ds, the phosphorylation of Ft to increase Ft–Ds binding is dominant. Furthermore, in the absence of Ft phosphorylation (in a Ft phosphomutant), the phosphorylation of Ds (‘wildtype’ vs <italic>fj</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>) has no significant effect on the overall amount of bound protein. In order to understand how this might affect the establishment of cellular asymmetry and binding across a tissue, we modified our model parameters as follows: first, we reduced the degree by which phosphorylated Ds inhibits Ft–Ds binding in complexes where Ft is phosphorylated (i.e., complexes A and B); second, we made the binding affinities for complexes formed from unphosphorylated Ft (i.e., complexes C and D) the same (see ‘Materials and methods’). We then ran the model with Fj acting on both Ds and Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We consequently still see the establishment of cellular asymmetries in Ft–Ds distribution within each cell, but also see a tissue gradient of Ft–Ds binding that follows the Fj gradient.

A tissue gradient of 4.7% in the model when acting on both Ft and Ds, compared to 10% when Fj acts on Ft alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D′,E′</xref>) suggests that Ds phosphorylation is required to counter the strong graded effects of Ft phosphorylation.

These results directly confirm the predictions of the model, showing not only that a slight gradient of binding strength exists across the tissue, but also that an opposing gradient of Ds phosphorylation usually acts to counter the effects of a gradient of Ft phosphorylation, resulting in a relatively even distribution of bound Ft–Ds complexes at junctions across the tissue axis from low to high Fj.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A long-standing problem in developmental biology is understanding how long-range patterning gradients are interpreted at the cellular level. More specifically, with regard to understanding how cell polarity is coordinated across sheets of cells, a major goal is to determine the mechanism by which a gradient of transcription across a tissue (produced for instance in response to a morphogen) can be sensed by individual cells to result in each cell adopting a uniform polarisation. A particular challenge for such a sensing mechanism is that the difference in levels of transcription between adjacent cells may be very small (e.g., only a few percent or less of the peak expression levels), and at the high end of the gradient this difference needs to be read against the background of a high overall expression level.</p><p>The Ft-Ds-Fj pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> represents an excellent system for addressing this problem. The Ft and Ds cadherins bind heterophilically between adjacent cells, and the visible readout of polarity is the asymmetric distribution of these dimers across the cell axis, such that approximately two-fold higher Ds is found on one cell edge, bound to Ft on the apposing edge of the neighbouring cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). However, the measured Ft asymmetry across the cell axis is weaker than that of Ds, most likely because there is a larger population of Ft present at junctions, including a presumably significant unbound fraction which is symmetrically distributed.</p><p>Importantly, the asymmetric distribution of Ft–Ds dimers is a result of the patterns of transcription of the <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>fj</italic> genes as specified by upstream morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we focus specifically on the mechanisms determining Ft–Ds subcellular polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar wing imaginal disc. At this stage, Fj is expressed in a gradient, high at the putative distal end of the wing (i.e., the centre of the wing pouch) and low proximally towards the wing hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strutt et al., 2004</xref>), whereas Ds is relatively uniformly expressed in the visible region of the wing pouch, but higher in hinge regions of the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</xref>). It is important to point out that much of the proximal wing blade is folded at the larval stage and most likely also has high levels of Ds expression and this region of high Ds expression could therefore also be promoting Ft–Ds asymmetry. Although we believe that both the Fj and Ds expression patterns are important cues for specifying Ft–Ds asymmetry in the wing pouch, the evidence suggests that boundaries of Ds expression may only be able to act as a patterning cue over a few cell diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore throughout much of the wing pouch the Fj gradient is likely to be a dominant cue.</p><p>In in vitro assays, Fj is able to mediate the phosphorylation of extracellular cadherin repeats of Ft and Ds, and phosphorylation of Ft has been shown to promote its binding to Ds, whereas phosphorylation of Ds appears to inhibit its binding to Ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the gradient of Fj in the wing pouch is predicted to produce opposing gradients of Ft–Ds binding affinities, with Ft–Ds binding favoured between cells moving down a Fj gradient, and Ds-Ft binding favoured between cells moving up a Fj gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). It has been previously proposed that these opposing binding gradients might play a role in producing uniform Ft–Ds interactions across the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05789.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models of Ft–Ds interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustrating our model of Ft–Ds binding across a tissue according to a Fj gradient. Ft-P (dark blue) and Ds-P (dark purple) increase, and Ft (light blue) and Ds (light purple) decrease as you move up the Fj gradient. Weak binding (no line) between heterodimers can occur between all populations, intermediate binding (double lines) can occur when Ft-P is available and the strongest bond (solid line) occurs only between Ft-P and Ds. As there is a bias towards Ft phosphorylation increasing binding, more intermediate binding occurs in regions of high Fj even though less favourable Ds (light purple) is available. In regions of low Fj, although there is more favourable Ds available, Ft-P is less abundant meaning fewer intermediate bonds are able to form. As Ft-P allows for stronger binding in cells with higher Fj, Ds in the next left-most cell preferentially accumulates to the right cell edge meaning the Fj gradient produces cellular asymmetry. A gradient of tissue binding is also produced with cells in the left-most cell producing fewer intermediate bonds than those in the right-most cell. (<bold>B</bold>) Conformational changes caused by the phosphorylation of Ft and Ds could provide an explanation for the differences in binding affinity caused by apparently similar phosphorylation events. The ‘open’ conformation of Ft and the ‘closed’ conformation of Ds may bind preferably such that if Ft is phosphorylated and Ds is not, binding is strongest (+++). If Ft and Ds are both phosphorylated, binding strength is intermediate (++). ‘Closed’ conformation of non-phosphorylated Ft produces the weakest binding and is not affected by Ds (+).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05789.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05789.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05789-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In this study, we use a mixture of computational and experimental methods to address the mechanism of action of Fj. Initially, we constructed a simple one-dimensional computational model, in which Fj activity either promotes Ft binding activity or inhibits Ds binding activity, and in which Ft–Ds dimers are then allowed to freely bind at either cell edge until they reach an equilibrium state. Using this we show that a Fj gradient can lead to cellular asymmetry of Ft–Ds if Fj acts on either Ft or Ds or both. Our predictions differ from those of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>) which suggested that Fj acting only on Ft would not result in a cellular asymmetry of activity: the origin of this difference is that in our model (in accordance with our experimental observations) the Ft and Ds populations are mobile and able to redistribute to the most favourable cell edge. However, in agreement with the same study, our model does predict that only in the situation that Fj acts on both Ft and Ds is the amount of Ft–Ds dimers bound at the junctions approximately the same across the entire axis of the Fj gradient.</p><p>Using FRAP to measure the levels of stable amounts and mobility of Ft and Ds at cell junctions, combined with either removal of <italic>fj</italic> activity or mutation of the Fj phosphorylation sites in Ft and Ds, we directly demonstrate that Ft and Ds stably associate at cell junctions in vivo, that Fj modulates this binding with a net positive effect in promoting binding, and that as predicted from the in vitro assays, Fj acts independently on both Ft and Ds to promote or inhibit their binding, respectively.</p><p>An interesting experimental observation is that the effects of Fj on Ft–Ds binding and the total amounts stably localised to cell junctions are relatively modest. For instance, blocking the phosphorylation of either Ft or Ds only decreases the stable junctional amounts by about twofold. Thus, all the molecular species (i.e., Ds and DsP and Ft and FtP) contribute to the final population of bound Ft and Ds at cell junctions.</p><p>Our experimental results reveal that the effect of Fj on Ft is stronger than the effect of Fj on Ds. A simple prediction of this observation, confirmed by our computational model, is that the ability of the gradient of phosphorylated Ds to oppose the gradient of phosphorylated Ft is reduced, and therefore a gradient of Ft–Ds binding is expected to be observed across the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5A and 6A</xref>). This prediction was confirmed experimentally. We cannot rule out that under normal circumstances the in vivo effects of Fj on Ds are in fact negligible compared to those on Ft, as our experiments make use of Ds transgenes and may not fully represent events occurring when wild-type Ds is expressed from its endogenous locus. Nevertheless, the simplest interpretation of both our observations and previous published work is that Ds phosphorylation contributes to normal patterning. In sum, our findings demonstrate an in vivo mechanism for how a Fj expression gradient is converted into cellular asymmetries via phosphorylation of both Ds and Ft.</p><p>We note that our computational simulations result in relatively modest cellular asymmetries of Ft and Ds distributions (around 10% of the total cellular levels), whereas in vivo, observed Ds asymmetry can be as high as twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). However, our model is only intended to make simple predictions regarding the effects of binding and redistribution of Ft and Ds molecules in a simple one-dimensional system and does not capture the full complexity of a three-dimensional cell environment and changes that occur in protein production and degradation and other cell properties over time. Furthermore, it is generally believed that relatively weak asymmetries generated by expression gradients might subsequently be amplified by feedback mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>), and some molecular mechanisms that might contribute to amplification have recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>With regard to possible amplification mechanisms, an intriguing observation is that the majority of stable Ft–Ds at junctions is concentrated in bright regions which we refer to as ‘puncta’. Furthermore, even mobile junctional populations of Ft and Ds show reduced mobility within these brighter regions. This might suggest that in addition to trans-interactions between Ft and Ds in neighbouring cells, there may also be cis-interactions between Ft and Ds molecules in cell junctions, a view supported by previous experimental reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sopko et al., 2009</xref>). Such a clustering mechanism could provide the molecular basis of a positive feedback interaction. Previous observations have suggested that Ft–Ds puncta do not co-localise with ‘core’ planar polarity protein puncta at junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). We are unsure as to the reasons for these distinct puncta populations, they could correspond to specialised membrane domains that favour binding or they could be random regions of protein clustering driven by cis-dimerisation or cytoskeleton tethering.</p><p>A final conundrum is the observation, first made in vitro, which we have now confirmed in vivo, that modification of analogous serine residues in cadherin repeats of Ft and Ds by Fj phosphorylation leads to opposite effects on their binding activity. The simplest model would be that phosphorylation either promoted or inhibited binding to a partner, but this is evidently not the mechanism in play here. A possible working hypothesis is that phosphorylation events lead to changes in the intramolecular conformation of the extracellular regions of Ft and Ds, by analogy to the way in which phosphorylation frequently acts to cause other classes of molecules to enter ‘open’ or ‘closed’ conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu and Carpenter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Potter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertocchi et al., 2012</xref>). A possible scenario is that phosphorylation of each molecule causes it to enter an ‘open’ conformation, and that ‘open’ Ft binds most favourably to Ds, but ‘closed’ Ds binds most favourably to Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A recent publication analysing the configuration of mammalian Ft4 and Ds1 revealed multiple hairpin-like bends in their C-terminal regions caused by the loss of calcium binding linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsukasaki et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that Fj phosphorylation results in conformational changes between cadherin repeat domains near to these calcium binding sites resulting in the regulation of binding strength, as suggested previously for E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petrova et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies of the structures and mode of heterophilic interactions between Ft and Ds will be required to resolve this question.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies, immunolabelling and imaging</title><p>Wing discs were dissected from wandering third instar larvae, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 prior to immunolabelling.

Sellotape was placed smoothly on to the centre of the slide and a 7-mm<sup>2</sup> area was cut out using a razor blade. Wandering stage larvae were collected and cleaned by rinsing in PBS. Wing discs were dissected in Shields and Sang M3 media (Sigma [#S3652], Missouri, USA) with 2% added foetal bovine serum (M3FBS). Discs were transferred by pipette to the cut out area in the imaging chamber with around 4 µl of media and arranged with their apical surface facing towards the base cover glass. The M3FBS was spread evenly around the cut out area. A 13-mm circular cover glass (Thermo Scientific) was carefully placed over the top allowing extra media to spread to the edges. Quick drying nail varnish was used to seal the cover glass after leaving to settle for a few minutes.</p><p>For FRAP, samples were imaged on an inverted Nikon A1R GaAsP confocal using a Nikon 60× oil objective lens at 11.76× zoom producing a FRAP region of 256 × 256 pixels with a pixel size of 0.07 µm. For pre- and post-bleach images, a 448 Argon laser was used at an output of 0.5% with varying gain settings depending upon phenotype. Eight 1 µm<sup>2</sup> regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per wing and bleached using the 488 argon laser at 50% power, passing 1–3 times for between 0.5 and 1.5 s depending upon experiment. Two pre-bleach images were captured with no delay as well as an immediate post-bleach image, 10 images were then captured every 5 s, followed by 10 images every 10 s and 10 images every 30 s. The initial rapid imaging was done in order to capture adequate rate information. For analysis, ROIs were individually reselected in ImageJ at each time point and acquisition bleaching was measured in non-bleached regions. Data were corrected for acquisition bleaching and normalised against pre-bleach values. An XY graph was plotted for each wing in PRISM (v.6 GraphPad). A one-phase exponential association curve was fitted for each ROI and an average plateau value recorded. A one-phase exponential curve was generated as we observe a single mode of recovery that reaches a plateau. We note that should the mode of recovery be more complex than this a two-phase exponential curve may be more appropriate; however, we do not have relevant experimental data to support this. Pre-bleach values were averaged per wing and multiplied by their associated plateau giving a stable amount. Stable amounts were then averaged across wings producing a final figure for each genotype. Stable amounts were analysed using unpaired t-tests or ordinary one-way ANOVAs with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons. Final stable fraction graphs were produced using the average plot for each wing and intensity was averaged across ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Modelling</title><p>We developed a computational model of Ft–Ds binding at cellular junctions, described by a set of ordinary differential equations. In this framework, we define a one-dimensional row of cells, whose proximal and distal membranes contain the same initial amount of Ft and Ds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These molecules were then phosphorylated according to a linear gradient of Fj activity, applied to reflect in vivo measurements of Fj quantity. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated molecules were allowed to bind across junctions resulting in formation of four possible complexes, each in two orientations, namely, FtP—Ds (A), FtP—DsP (B), Ft—Ds (C), and Ft—DsP (D). This consideration of all four possible complexes between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of Ft and Ds is a key distinguishing feature of our model, when compared to previous computational approaches which only considered a single binding species essentially equivalent to our complex A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jolly et al., 2014</xref>).

rates between molecules are parameterised by the association constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>) for each complex, since a higher ‘on’ rate constant will result in an increased concentration of complexed molecules. Relative binding strengths of different molecule combinations reflect findings from in vivo and in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon et al., 2010</xref>), such that phosphorylation of Ft (FtP) promotes its binding and conversely phosphorylation of Ds (DsP) inhibits its binding. The following hierarchy of relevant association constants was used initially, A &gt; B = C &gt; D, such that the complex containing the two favoured molecules, FtP and Ds making complex A, had a faster ‘on’ rate than other combinations. Initial values of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> for A, B, C, and D were chosen as 1, 1/4, 1/4 and 1/16, respectively, to reflect the relative differences in stable amounts measured experimentally.</p><p>Binding was allowed to continue over time until convergence. Simulations were run using an in-built ode solver (ode23s) in MATLAB (R2013a; MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA) and final concentrations of bound molecules were plotted.</p><p>We went on to adapt this model to reflect our experimental finding that Fj appears to have a dominant effect on Ft. To achieve this, we altered association constants of binding reactions to allow phosphorylation of Ds to have a less significant effect on binding strengths, giving A &gt; B &gt; C = D. Thus association constants for each complex A, B, C, and D, were given as 1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4, respectively. Further explanation can be found in the ‘Results’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ken Irvine for the <italic>P[acman]V5-ft</italic> fly stock, Hugo Bellen for the anti-Hrs antibody, John Walker for generating the <italic>ft-EGFP</italic> stock, and Katrina Hofstra for assistance producing the anti-Fj antibody.

the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>).

Your article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), and four reviewers, one of whom, Peter Lawrence, is serving as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>I have now assembled four reviews and all agree that a revised version of your paper will be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. We are impressed with the directness of your approach to an important and challenging problem that, up to now, most have preferred to simulate rather than investigate. No additional experiments are asked for but taken together there are a large number of criticisms that in my view arise mainly from a lack of clarity in your manuscript. The techniques you use, the way you present the data and some of your descriptions are complicated, and have caused confusion. So I think the simplest way to proceed is for me to send you these criticisms more or less undiluted.</p><p>The only suggestion we all agree on is that you should provide more details of your theoretical model, its assumptions, equations, and parameters so readers can understand it better and compare it with other similar models. There are other points that come up in more than one review. But my opinion is based on the fact that your paper is yours, not ours, your names will go forward with the paper and therefore I believe you, not us, should decide how to revise it. But I urge you to consider the points raised, try to make it clearer. In this case I have decided <italic>not</italic> to ask you to provide a reasoned explanation for all you have decided to do and not to do. This would take a huge amount of time and effort and the result might well be longer than the paper and written only really to satisfy the curiosity of we reviewers. However I know that as a responsible scientist you will want to take these criticisms seriously and do your best to make your paper as lucid as you can.</p><p>Regarding the Jolly model, if you go to PLoS ONE you will see that we already raised a query with Jolly about their model.</p><p>Here is a list of all the comments for you to consider:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and accomplished article. It addresses in a new and concrete way a long-standing question that asks how a shallow multicellular gradient can be converted into a consistently oriented and asymmetric distribution of molecules within single cells. This question has often been explored by modelling but the models are not usually checked out by observation. However this paper is based on the Ft/Ds system for planar cell polarity and combines molecular measurements with modelling. The amount of bound Ds and Ft is estimated by an apparently ingenious use of FRAP. The paper has interesting findings: for the first time the authors have weighed the relative contributions of the Ds, Ft and Fj distributions to the final pattern and tried to quantify how and why the effects of Fj on Ds and Ft differ in strength. They have found evidence for a central tenet of the Ds/Ft model, as proposed earlier, that there should be a gradient of Ds/Ft heterodimers across the tissue. They have estimated the steepness of the Fj gradient from measurements based on Fj antibody. In our opinion the paper clearly deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but only after revision, the main purpose of which would be to make its scientific strategy and results clearer for the reader.</p><p>Results:</p><p>There are problems with the Results section in that the details of some experiments confuse us, possibly because the authors have not presented their results as clearly as they should. Below we list some of the problems we have encountered in trying to understand both the data and the model. The results of the authors' model are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DE</xref>. We have tried to work out how the model is set up and what the parameters, rules and equations are (as shown in the first paragraph), but have not succeeded. Perhaps more could be explained in a legend or in the Methods?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the Results section, the expression “a hierarchy of binding affinities”: what does this mean in terms of the model and how is this hierarchy calculated?</p><p>Fourth paragraph of the Results: “the speed… of the mobile population” ?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref> are not explained well, e.g. in the fifth paragraph of the Results section, the unstable fraction is estimated by a height of the curve, while the stable fraction is the area above the line, we can work out how the area is calculated but it is not well explained how a height is compared with an area.</p><p>In making these exponential curves the data is “fitted” to the curve but it is not clear how this is done, how objective it is, how good the fit is. After all the data could also be “fitted” to a straight line; presumably the fit would not be so good.</p><p>Seventh paragraph of the Results section onwards: it might be better to tell us at the beginning, that in ft- and in ds-, no puncta are seen (although we are not sure if that is so of ds-?)</p><p>Ninth paragraph of the Results section: this is an interesting finding and consequently we ask has the excess of Ft over Ds been put in the model?</p><p>Eleventh and twelfth paragraphs of the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: this is a difficult section, particularly as the effects of Fj on Ds are going to be declared insignificant, when compared to the effects of Fj on Ft, and therefore one is led down two paths and one seems to go nowhere. It is hard on the brain and I think the authors should do more work to make the data behind <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> more accessible. For example consider <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and A’</xref>. Are these results in accord with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, G and H</xref>?</p><p>Thirteenth and fourteenth paragraphs of the Results section: This is also a difficult section as one is trying to deduce the effects on heterodimers from the effect of Fj on Ft or Ds in conditions in which one of these effects is blocked by a mutation in the site of Fj's action. We get the impression that the results again show that the effect of Fj on Ds is insignificant. If this is so, then couldn't the whole be presented more simply and the effect on Fj ignored in these presentations (there is still evidence in vivo published in Brittle et al. that Fj can effect Ds ability to bind to Ft, but this was with overexpression of Fj, so this matter should be addressed in the Discussion). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D'</xref> would seem to show almost no effect, barely at the level of significance. If this is so, then the headline for the thirteenth paragraph of the Results section and the statement in the eighteenth paragraph could mislead us?</p><p>The histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we are confused by them. They do show large effects, but are these differences caused more by the original intensities of levels in the puncta and non-puncta than by the variable that is pertinent (which is the difference in stability due to phosphorylation)? Consider <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for instance where we seem to be misled by the p=0.006. An example to explain (if we understand correctly): if you have an intensity of 1000 in the puncta and a recovery of 0.8 it gives 800 as a stable amount. If in the non-puncta there is an intensity of 200 and a recovery also of 0.8 the result would be 160; and course the difference between 160 and 800 is great but those two figures are not the figures one should be comparing as the recovery is 0.8 in both cases.</p><p>Another example for illustration: imagine you have, in the puncta, an intensity of 1000 and a recovery of 0.4, giving a stable amount of 400 and in the non-puncta an intensity of 200 and a recovery of 0.9, giving a stable amount of 180. In this case 400 is clearly higher than 180, but can we not be misled if we use these figures? The differences between the two fitted curves are really what matters here, is that not so? Therefore should the histograms be left out as they confuse and give an impression of a difference that is not the difference that matters?</p><p>In the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, calculation of “stable amount” could be better explained and does this data fit with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C and C'</xref>.</p><p>Thinking about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and the disparity of the effects of Fj on Ds and Ft: the effects measured would depend on locality in the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed in vivo results depended on where the clone was made (Brittle et al.). And we see here the effect of Fj varies across the wing. Thus where in the wing these measurements are made is likely to be an important factor but it is not controlled here?</p><p>Where Fj is high shouldn't Ds be low, therefore if Fj is removed, stability should surely be greater where Fj is normally high, not as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> where we see the reverse?</p><p>Does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> show a significant change, i.e. a significant effect on Ds?</p><p>Eighteenth paragraph of the Results section: We don't know the parameters used to set up the model, a problem for the reader of this section.</p><p>Paragraph 19 of the Results section: where are these measurements made, puncta or non-puncta?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: the model presented in A is virtually identical to that presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casal et al., 2006</xref>, is that not so?</p><p>It might be useful for the authors to consider the possibility that phosphorylation may not be all or none (per Ds or Ft molecule) but could be partial. Would that possibility change interpretations?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The authors are attempting to understand the long-standing developmental biology problem of how global tissue wide patterning gradients can lead to local cellular asymmetries of protein interactions and localization. This is a highly important question that should be of interest to a wide range of audiences. The Fat-Dachsous-Four-jointed pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> presents an ideal system to investigate the mechanisms of planar cell polarity establishment. The authors are attempting to understand the problem quantitatively by developing a 1D computational model. Using experimentally measured values for a Four-jointed (Fj) gradient, and relative binding affinities between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Fat and Dachsous, they claim to be able to computational explain the observed in vivo patterns of Fat-Dachsous binding and planar polarization across the wing.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>The attempt to measure in vivo protein stabilities and deduce relative binding affinities is to be applauded. However, even with these new in vivo parameters, their model still did not produce in vivo like cellular asymmetries of Fat and Dachsous distribution, which is their main readout for the model. The main interest in this subject area is how relatively mild patterning gradients across tissues can be interpreted to give relatively high cellular asymmetries, such as the 2-fold differences in Ds that has been experimentally measured previously. I feel the authors have not been able to address this issue fully, and merely show a mild cellular asymmetry as a result of their new proposed model, which is only slightly better than their first model, where they did not have the new in vivo parameters. Admittedly, the authors do acknowledge this problem, and discuss several possible mechanisms for generating a higher cellular asymmetry, such as feedback and amplification mechanisms. Unless the authors can attempt to include these mechanisms and show that they can be significant factors in generating the high cellular asymmetries, the mystery, in my opinion, still exists. As a result, in its current state, this work does not represent a significant enough advance on the field to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) The authors only measure the Fj gradient in one quadrant of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). What about the other regions (quadrants) of the wing pouch? What are the gradients of Fj? If these are used in the model, can these gradients produce the same asymmetries in Fat and Ds (using same parameters for everything else)?</p><p>2) To go with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, please provide images to show what is a 'puncta' bleach and a 'non-puncta' bleach. It is hard to see how one would define and select these regions.</p><p>3) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">figures 1D-E and 5A</xref> it would be useful to show the actual values of the bound Ds and bound Ft on either side of each cell. The current graphs can only show asymmetries, but not how much, and whether that changes across the tissue. For example, for bound Ds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the asymmetry seems greater more distally in the tissue. Is that true in vivo?</p><p>4) The authors should provide more details for the set-up of the model, such as the equations for the ODE and actual parameter values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is an informative and valuable extension of the authors' 2010 study on the role of Fj in the regulation of Ft-Ds interactions, informed by more recent findings on the polarization of Ds and Ft localization within single cells. The former study was largely limited to measurements of Ft-Ds binding in vitro, and the current work extends this to in vivo work using late third instar wing imaginal discs.</p><p>The work looks pretty straightforward, although the authors have had to make some assumption about the relationship between stability, recovery and binding; it is always possible that some of the changes are caused by something other than Ft-Ds binding, such as trafficking or protein stability. Nonetheless, the results largely match the expectations based on previous work, with only a few exceptions. These include the finding that the Fj effect on Ft seems to predominate in vivo over its effects on Ds, and that this creates a slight gradient of Ft-Ds binding strength across the wing that depends on distal Fj. The authors also find that a phosphomimetic version of Ds does not show the expected decrease in stable binding. The authors argue that the mutations do not perfectly mimic phosphorylation, and indeed that matches the reduced effect this version had in their previous in vitro assays, where they made the same argument.</p><p>Other than the concerns about less direct causes of the results, I had only a couple major comments:</p><p>1) The authors' data indicates that Ft-Ds binding is less stable in the absence of Fj. The one counter-example I found in the literature was rather less direct, but in Matakatsu and Blair (2012) the Hippo signaling boundary effects created by Ft overexpression extended further distally in the absence of Fj than its presence, suggesting stronger Ft-Ds binding in the absence of Fj. Is it possible that the result depends as well on the levels of Ft or Ds being expressed? That might make one a bit cautious about results at anything other than endogenous expression levels.</p><p>2) If the authors think that the polarization of Ft, Ds and Dachs in the distal wing/pouch is due entirely to Fj, has anyone demonstrated that? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brittle et al. (2012)</xref> only looked at dachs in <italic>fj</italic> ds double mutants, I believe. Bosveld looked at <italic>fj</italic> mutants but in the notum, not wing, and to my eye there was still some Ds polarization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript focuses on how long range gradients contribute to planar cell polarity. I focused primarily on assessing the modeling and FRAP analysis used in this work. In general, the interpretation of the FRAP data is consistent with the conceptual model presented by the authors, and the experiments appear to be well performed and thorough. However, I have several concerns regarding the computational model. Other points also require further clarification.</p><p>1) The details of the mathematical model are not presented here. This makes it almost impossible to evaluate the soundness of the model. The authors are advised to present the complete underlying assumptions and governing PDE equations, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and the parameters used for the modeling. Some of these parameters (such as the diffusion coefficients of Ft and Ds) could be extracted from the experiments presented. In addition, the authors indicate that model is in PDE (diffusion was included), but the numerical scheme presented here was determined using an ODE solver. This point needs to be clarified.</p><p>2) The way the kinetic equations (hierarchy of relevant associations) are presented in the Method is confusing. They should be represented using standard notations.</p><p>3) The manuscript fails to cite and discuss a recent study using mathematical modeling to examine mechanisms contributing to the sub-cellular asymmetry of Ft-Ds heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jolly et al., 2014</xref>, Mathematical Modeling of Sub-Cellular Asymmetry of Fat-Dachsous Heterodimer for Generation of Planar Cell Polarity, PLoS ONE, 9(5):e97641). This is very surprising given that the work of Jolly et al. addresses very similar questions as the current study, albeit solely from a theoretical perspective. It is essential that the authors elaborate on how their current findings relate to this published work.</p><p>4) In this study, FRAP is used to monitor changes in putative interactions between proteins that occur between two cells and thus in separate membranes. Under these specialized conditions, one might intuitively expect diffusion of both binding partners to be slowed, as the authors suggest. However, it seems likely that other types of interactions would be required to cause immobilization per se. The authors suggest that cis-interactions may be important (eighth paragraph of the Discussion section). Other types of events, such as interactions of proteins with the actin cytoskeleton might be important as an immobilization mechanism and/or the establishment of “stable” populations. It appears that such a mechanism was previously suggested to be important for the case of E-cadherin in puncta (Cavey et al., Nature, 2008, 453:751-6, A two-tiered mechanism for stabilization and immobilization of E-cadherin). This possibility should be discussed.</p><p>5) On a related note, the authors report that Ft and Ds localize in part to puncta where the proteins appear to be immobilized but do not say very much about the possible identity of the puncta or their relationship to other puncta previously identified. These points should be further developed in the Discussion.</p><p>6) The authors use the word “stable” in several different contexts, beginning in the second headline of the Results section. For the case of the FRAP measurements, they use this to refer to an immobile fraction of proteins. They use it again to refer to a pool of proteins that do not undergo internalization in the endocytosis assay. These two “stable” pools are not necessarily identical. As such, the exact meaning of “stable” needs to be better qualified in each case.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05789.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have now revised our manuscript in response to the comments from the four expert reviewers.

A complex that contains both favoured molecules (complex A with FtP and Ds) will bind better than one which contains both least favoured molecules (complex D with Ft and DsP). The remaining combinations of molecules making up complexes B and C will bind somewhere in the middle. We have given B and C association constants and began by making them equal to one another since we had no evidence to suggest one was better at binding than the other. The values broadly reflect the differences in stable amount we have measured in our experiments. For example, complex A and C both contain unphosphorylated Ds, but differ in the phosphorylation of Ft. We have set association constants as 1 and ¼ for A and C respectively, which is similar to the differences in stable amount seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> comparing Ds phosphomutant in the presence (complex A) or absence (complex C) of Fj.</p><p><italic>Fourth paragraph of the Results section: “the speed… of the mobile population”?</italic></p><p>We have extensively rewritten this part of the text.

Several other models have been previously published to investigate Ft-Ds polarity and Reviewer 4 specifically mentions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jolly et al., 2014</xref>. Other papers also include Mani et al., PNAS, 2012 and Abley et al., Development, 2013, all three of which only consider one possible complex forming, essentially equivalent in our model to complex A (FtP–Ds). This means that in each study the authors needed to implement feedback mechanisms to avoid non-uniform levels of bound material across the tissue. We have added citations to all three publications and a description of this key difference (see Materials and methods). Reviewer 2 noticed subtle differences in the modelled cellular asymmetries across the tissue presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Upon further examination we found that this was an artifact of the presentation of the model implementation, and we have thus replaced the figure, which we hope appears clearer. Regardless, there is no significant difference in asymmetries across the tissue in any of our modeling figures, furthermore, we now indicate the average cellular asymmetry for each graph in the figure legends. There was some confusion over whether this was an ODE or PDE model. Since we have stated that we included a diffusion term in our equations, one might presume that we are considering how molecule concentrations vary over space as well as time, thus requiring PDEs. We have now renamed this a redistribution term, since we have simply redistributed unbound molecules across the two membranes of each cell within our ODE model.</p><p>Finally, other mechanisms such as amplification, production/degradation and trafficking have not been explored in the current version of the model. Also, since this is not presented as a modelling paper, we have not presented a full exploration of parameter space. We plan to address these issues in a separate theoretical work at a later date.</p></body></sub-article></article>
