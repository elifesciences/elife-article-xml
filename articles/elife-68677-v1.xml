mechanisms have meiotic roles that ensure successful gamete formation. While completion of meiotic double-strand break (DSB) repair requires the canonical RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 (9A-1-1) complex, mammalian meiocytes also express RAD9A and HUS1 paralogs, RAD9B and HUS1B, predicted to form alternative 9-1-1 complexes. The RAD1 subunit is shared by all predicted 9-1-1 complexes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes even in the absence of HUS1 and RAD9A. Here, we report that testis-specific disruption of RAD1 in mice resulted in impaired DSB repair, germ cell depletion, and infertility. Unlike <italic>Hus1</italic> or <italic>Rad9a</italic> disruption, <italic>Rad1</italic> loss in meiocytes also caused severe defects in homolog synapsis, impaired phosphorylation of ATR targets such as H2AX, CHK1, and HORMAD2, and compromised meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Together, these results establish critical roles for both canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes in meiotic ATR activation and successful prophase I completion.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms protect genomic integrity by sensing and repairing DNA lesions or initiating apoptosis when lesions are unrepairable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackford and Jackson, 2017</xref>). DDR proteins are also essential for successful haploid gamete formation. Although double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are considered to be the most toxic form of DNA damage, meiotic recombination relies on SPO11-induced DSBs for homologous chromosomes to synapse, exchange genetic material, and properly segregate at the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). Of particular importance are the meiotic events that occur during the five substages of prophase I, a major feature of which involves the transient formation of the proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahoon and Hawley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>). During the first stage, leptonema, axial elements containing SC protein 3 (SYCP3) form along condensed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>). Additionally, the DNA damage marker, γH2AX, accumulates during leptonema as chromosomes experience SPO11-induced DSBs. Progression into zygonema is characterized by the pairing and synapsis of chromosomes, marked by the presence of the central element protein SC protein 1 (SYCP1). During pachynema, DSB repair is completed, and by mid-pachynema γH2AX is no longer present on the fully synapsed autosomes. However, in male meiocytes, abundant γH2AX is apparent at the sex body containing the X and Y chromosomes, which synapse only in a small domain called the pseudoautosomal region but otherwise remain unsynapsed. Meiotic cells subsequently enter diplonema, featuring dissolution of the central element while homologous chromosomes remain tethered by crossovers. Breakdown of the SC marks the final stage in prophase I, diakinesis.</p><p>Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is a key regulator of recombinational DSB repair and synapsis throughout meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>). ATR activation in somatic cells has been well characterized; however, the mechanisms of meiotic ATR activation have not been fully elucidated. ATR activation in response to replication stress and other signals in mitotic cells is known to involve interaction between the RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 (9A-1-1) complex and topoisomerase 2-binding protein I (TOPBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackford and Jackson, 2017</xref>). The toroidal, PCNA-like 9A-1-1 complex is loaded at recessed DNA ends by the RAD17–replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichinger and Jentsch, 2011</xref>). ATR in association with ATR interacting protein (ATRIP) independently localizes to replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). The 9A-1-1 complex then interacts with RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 interacting nuclear orphan (RHINO) and TOPBP1, which allows TOPBP1 to activate ATR via its ATR-activating domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotta-Ramusino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindsey-Boltz et al., 2015</xref>). ATR activation initiates several downstream processes such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, fork stabilization, and inhibition of new origin firing, or triggers apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saldivar et al., 2017</xref>). Independent of 9A-1-1/TOPBP1, ATR also can be directly activated during a normal mitotic cell cycle by Ewing’s tumor-associated antigen 1 (ETAA1), in part to promote metaphase chromosome alignment and spindle assembly checkpoint function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass and Cortez, 2019</xref>).</p><p>During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and undergo recombination, with regions of asynapsis being subjected to DDR-dependent transcriptional silencing. ATR, along with meiosis-specific HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2)-domain proteins, TOPBP1, and other factors, localizes to unsynapsed chromatin regions in leptotene- and zygotene-stage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fedoriw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keegan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kogo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Perera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>). At pachynema, the homologs are fully synapsed, at which point ATR localizes only to the unsynapsed axes and throughout the chromatin of the X and Y chromosomes, where it triggers a mechanism called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). MSCI is essential for successful meiotic progression through the silencing of toxic Y-linked genes and sequestration of DDR proteins away from autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Royo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turner et al., 2006</xref>). Central to MSCI is ATR-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 and other factors, and subsequent spreading of H2AX phosphorylation via the adaptor MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, ATR mediates meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) at autosomes that have failed to synapse properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turner, 2015</xref>). Beyond silencing, ATR has an essential role in promoting RAD51 and DMC1 loading to enable meiotic DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Widger et al., 2018</xref>). Previous work indicates that HUS1 and RAD9A are largely dispensable for meiotic ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vasileva et al., 2013</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that HUS1B- and RAD9B-containing alternative 9-1-1 complexes contribute to ATR activation during mammalian meiosis.</p><p>In addition to its ATR-activating role, the 9A-1-1 complex also functions as a molecular scaffold for proteins in multiple DNA repair pathways. For example, the 9A-1-1 complex participates in homologous recombination by interacting with the RAD51 recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pandita et al., 2006</xref>) and EXO1 exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ngo and Lydall, 2015</xref>). Consistent with these observations from mitotic cells, RAD9A co-localizes with RAD51 on meiotic chromosome cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>), and RAD1 similarly co-localizes with DMC1 when visualized by immunofluorescence staining, although higher-resolution immunoelectron microscopy analysis indicates that RAD1 and DMC1 are at distinct sites along meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freire et al., 1998</xref>). In wild-type pachytene-stage cells, RAD51 foci are lost as DSBs are resolved, whereas without <italic>Hus1</italic> RAD51 is retained on spermatocyte autosomes into late prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Loss of any canonical 9A-1-1 subunit in mice leads to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hopkins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weiss et al., 2000</xref>). In conditional knockout (CKO) models, loss of <italic>Hus1</italic> or <italic>Rad9a</italic> in the testis results in persistent DSBs during meiotic prophase, leading to reduced testis size, decreased sperm count, and subfertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vasileva et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of RAD1 and RAD9A on meiotic chromosome cores only partially overlaps, with RAD1 localizing as puncta on autosomes and coating asynapsed autosomes and the XY cores, and RAD9A present in a punctate pattern suggestive of DSB sites on autosomes and sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>). Although RAD9A fails to localize to meiotic chromosome cores in <italic>Hus1</italic>-deficient meiocytes, RAD1 localization is largely HUS1-independent, supporting the idea that RAD1 can act outside of the canonical 9A-1-1 complex.</p><p>The HUS1 and RAD9A paralogs, HUS1B and RAD9B, are highly expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dufault et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hang et al., 2002</xref>). Based on our previous results and the findings discussed above, we hypothesized that meiocytes contain alternative 9-1-1 complexes, RAD9B-RAD1-HUS1 (9B-1-1) and RAD9B-RAD1-HUS1B (9B-1-1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyndaker et al., 2013b</xref>). Since RAD1 has no known paralogs, it is expected to be common to both canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes. In order to elucidate the roles of each of the 9-1-1 complexes in mammalian meiosis, we generated <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice in which <italic>Rad1</italic> was disrupted specifically in male spermatocytes. <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice exhibited reduced sperm count, reduced testis size, and severe germ cell loss associated with DSB repair defects, consistent with previous studies of HUS1 and RAD9A. However, homolog synapsis and MSCI, which were largely unaffected in <italic>Hus1</italic> or <italic>Rad9a</italic> CKO mice, also were disrupted by <italic>Rad1</italic> loss. Furthermore, impaired phosphorylation of ATR substrates in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes indicated that the canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes work in concert to stimulate meiotic ATR signaling. This study highlights the importance of multiple 9-1-1 complexes during mammalian meiosis and establishes key roles for these DDR clamps in ATR activation, homolog synapsis, and MSCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution and tissue-specific expression of 9-1-1 subunits</title><p>Human RAD9A and RAD9B share 36% identity, while HUS1 and HUS1B are 48% identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dufault et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hang et al., 2002</xref>).

The residual RAD1 protein observed in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice may be attributed in part to somatic cells of the testis or pre-meiotic germ cells.

We therefore anticipated that the apoptosis and germ cell loss observed in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice were due to meiotic defects. To address the possibility of pre-meiotic defects in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice, we assessed mice at 8 days postpartum (dpp), prior to meiotic entry.

To further confirm that RAD1 loss did not affect cells prior to meiotic entry, we stained sections for LIN28, a marker of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which have not initiated meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aeckerle et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, no significant differences in LIN28 staining were observed between genotypes in testes from mice at 8 dpp or 4 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and E</xref>), consistent with the notion that RAD1 targeting is specific to meiotic cells.

This later loss of LIN28-positive cells in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice can be attributed to large-scale germ cell loss, which could indirectly disrupt the environment required for proper SSC proliferation and survival.</p><p>Next, staining of surface spread spermatocyte nuclei was performed to test how localization of 9-1-1 subunits was affected by RAD1 loss. SYCP3, a component of the SC, was used to visualize the five substages of prophase I. Consistent with prior results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>), RAD1 localized in control meiocytes during leptonema as foci (209.3 ± 23.9 RAD1 foci), including on chromosome cores that were not yet synapsed, and during zygonema on both unsynapsed and synapsed chromosome cores (208.2 ± 9.2 RAD1 foci) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In mid-pachynema, RAD1 was present on fully synapsed core axes of autosomes as well as along the X and Y chromosomes (120.8 ± 27.3 RAD1 foci). By late-pachynema, RAD1 was no longer present on autosomes but continued to be abundant along the X-Y cores. RAD1 localization was completely absent in 43% of spermatocytes from 12-week-old <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice, whereas 100% of control cells showed proper RAD1 localization and abundance in zygotene- and pachytene-stage cells. The RAD1 localization observed in some <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes could be attributed to cells that failed to undergo CRE-mediated recombination or in which RAD1 levels were not yet fully depleted. Consistent with the latter possibility, pachytene-stage <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells with detectable RAD1 focus formation had significantly fewer RAD1 foci than stage-matched control cells (106.0 ± 25.8 vs. 120.8 ± 27.3 RAD1 foci; p-value ≤ 0.0002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The fact that <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells were prone to apoptosis as described below would be expected to eliminate cells lacking RAD1, leaving RAD1-intact meiocytes enriched among the remaining cells. Additional functional analyses (see below) indicated that, overall, approximately 72% of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells had a meiotic defect (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next evaluated how RAD1 disruption impacted RAD9A/B localization. In control samples, RAD9A and RAD9B localized to unsynapsed chromosomes as foci in leptotene-stage cells (145.5 ± 20.8 RAD9A foci; 211.5 ± 50.8 RAD9B foci) and to synapsed and unsynapsed chromosome cores in zygotene-stage cells (125.2 ± 25.6 RAD9A foci; 230.5 ± 40.5 RAD9B foci) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). By pachynema, RAD9A and RAD9B localized primarily as foci on autosomes and sex chromosome cores (107.3 ± 32.6 RAD9A foci; 125.5 ± 19.2 RAD9B foci).

First, we questioned whether RAD1-deficient cells were able to progress past mid-pachynema. Histone variant H1T is a marker of mid-pachynema and later stage wild-type spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cobb et al., 1999</xref>).

By contrast, in pachytene-like stage <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells, TOPBP1 localized to only a subset of asynaptic sites, failing to coat the entirety of unsynapsed chromosome cores, similar to the pattern observed for ATR. These findings suggest a role for the 9-1-1 complexes in promoting ATR and TOPBP1 localization to unsynapsed chromatin, although this is, at least in part, likely an indirect effect of the extensive asynapsis in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells as the available pool of silencing factors can be insufficient to localize to all asynaptic sites under such circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The best characterized ATR substrate in somatic cells is the transducer kinase CHK1.

Interestingly, in the <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mutant, pCHK1 was absent at all stages of prophase I. Reduced CHK1 phosphorylation at ATR target sites S317 and S345 in the absence of RAD1 was confirmed by whole testis immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, meiotic spreads from <italic>Hus1</italic> CKO mice showed normal patterns of CHK1 (S317) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Notably, phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that phosphorylation of cohesin complex (SMC3) and SC (SYCP1, SYCP2, and SYCP3) components during meiosis is RAD1- and ATR-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sims et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, correlated evolutionary relationships, as measured by ERC analysis, were observed between genes encoding 9-1-1 subunits and those encoding cohesin and SC proteins, including SMC1β, RAD21L1, SYCP2, and SYCE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We therefore further interrogated the relationship between RAD1 and SMC3. RAD1 and pSMC3 (1083) co-localized at the XY in pachynema-stage wild-type spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In control meiocytes, SMC3 was observed on chromatin cores throughout prophase I and was phosphorylated specifically at unsynapsed chromatin cores during leptonema and zygonema, and at the unsynapsed regions of the XY in mid-pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Although total SMC3 loading was unaffected by RAD1 loss, <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes showed reduced accumulation of phosphorylated SMC3 (pSMC3 S1083) at unsynapsed chromatin regions in pachytene-like cells as compared to mid-pachytene-stage control cells. Western blot analysis of whole testis lysates confirmed that SMC3 phosphorylation (pSMC3 S1083) was significantly reduced in testes from <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

To determine if SMC3 (1083) phosphorylation was ATR dependent, we performed immunostaining of spermatocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 male mice treated with the ATR inhibitor AZ20 (ATRi). Similar to the effects of RAD1 loss, acute ATRi treatment caused a decrease in pSMC3 (S1083) at X and Y chromatin loops and cores despite the fact that SMC3 localization to chromosome cores appeared normal, suggesting a specific defect in SMC3 phosphorylation. Together, these results suggest that 9-1-1 complexes and ATR act in conjunction to regulate meiotic cohesin phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loss of 9-1-1 complexes disrupts ATR-mediated meiotic silencing</title><p>Given that ATR is a primary regulator of MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fedoriw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Widger et al., 2018</xref>), the defects in ATR signaling noted above prompted us to assess meiotic silencing in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice. We first looked upstream of ATR and examined whether the absence of RAD1 impacted localization of HORMA-domain proteins 1 and 2 (HORMAD1 and HORMAD2).

By mid-pachynema, the HORMADs localized strictly at the unsynapsed regions of the XY, similar to the localization of ATR.

However, in pachytene-like <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells, phosphorylated HORMAD2 was detected at only a subset of unsynapsed regions. That HORMAD2 localized properly in the absence of RAD1 but lacked phosphorylation at an ATR-regulated site further supports the notion that meiotic ATR signaling requires the 9-1-1 complexes. BRCA1 is another key meiotic silencing factor, and its localization is interdependent with that of ATR in a stage-specific manner, with conditional <italic>Atr</italic> deletion disrupting BRCA1 localization to XY axial elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Royo et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this possibility, we first examined the localization of RNA Pol II, the exclusion of which from the XY body is an indicator of MSCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In control cells, RNA Pol II was excluded from the sex body in the vast majority of cells, with only 8.8% ± 2.4% of cells showing any RNA Pol II at the XY chromosomes. In <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes with extensive asynapsis, RNA Pol II was diffusively distributed, but the sex chromosomes cannot be distinguished in such cases. We next assessed RNA Pol II in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells with apparently normal synapsis and observed that 27.8% ± 19.1% of such cells failed to fully exclude RNA Pol II from the XY body. This contrasted with our previous analysis of <italic>Hus1</italic> CKO spermatocytes with disruption of the canonical 9A-1-1 complex, in which RNA Pol II was properly excluded from the sex body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>). Finally, we directly evaluated meiotic silencing via RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the X-chromosome gene <italic>Scml2</italic> that should be silenced in early pachynema-stage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Royo et al., 2010</xref>). Because autosome asynapsis antagonizes MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>), the analysis of <italic>Scml2</italic> expression focused on cells with normal homolog synapsis and excluded those with asynapsis.

This quantification underestimates the extent of the silencing defect upon RAD1 loss since some cells with apparently normally synapsis in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice retain normal RAD1 expression. Nevertheless, approximately 30% of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells with apparently normal synapsis show both defective exclusion of RNA Pol II from the XY body as well as inappropriate expression of an X-linked gene. Together with the clear evidence for defective ATR signaling upon RAD1 loss, these results demonstrate the importance of the canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes in promoting ATR-mediated MSCI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report that testis-specific RAD1 loss results in homolog asynapsis, compromised DSB repair, faulty ATR signaling, and impaired meiotic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Previous analyses of the canonical 9A-1-1 complex in meiosis revealed that loss of <italic>Hus1</italic> or <italic>Rad9a</italic> leads to a small number of unrepaired DSBs that trigger germ cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyndaker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vasileva et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, homolog synapsis, ATR activation, and meiotic silencing all are grossly normal in the absence of the canonical 9A-1-1 subunits HUS1 and RAD9A. The expanded roles for RAD1 identified here are consistent with its ability to additionally interact with RAD9B and HUS1B, paralogs that evolved in higher organisms and are highly expressed in germ cells. The dependency of RAD9A and RAD9B localization as well as meiotic ATR activation on RAD1 supports the idea that RAD1-containing alternative 9-1-1 complexes (9B-1-1 and 9B-1-1B complexes) mediate essential roles in meiotic DSB repair, homolog synapsis, and MSCI, although we cannot exclude the possibility that RAD1 also functions independently of these heterotrimeric complexes.</p><p>In <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes, RAD51 loading onto meiotic chromosome cores was significantly reduced at leptonema and zygonema relative to controls. By mid-pachynema in control cells, RAD51 chromatin levels are low as DSB repair is concluding, but substantial RAD51 focus formation was still observed in pachytene-like <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells, suggesting major DSB repair defects. The meiotic DSB repair defects following RAD1 loss are similar to those previously observed in <italic>Atr</italic> loss-of-function mouse models. Zygotene-stage cells from a Seckel mouse model with disrupted ATR expression have decreased RAD51 and DMC1 loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>), similar to that of spermatocytes lacking RAD1. Meiotic RAD51 focus formation did not increase further in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes after irradiation.

The 9-1-1 complex is well established to modulate DNA end resection, having stimulatory or inhibitory effects in different contexts. In both yeast and mammals, the resection-stimulatory effects of the 9-1-1 complex involve recruitment of the Exo1 and Dna2 nucleases to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaikley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ngo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ngo and Lydall, 2015</xref>).

By contrast, the localization of ATR, TOPBP1, and BRCA1 to unsynapsed regions was compromised in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes. ATR and BRCA1 work in a positive feedback loop to encourage meiotic silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), and the canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes may also be part of this regulatory circuitry. Phosphorylation of some ATR targets, such as H2AX and HORMAD2, still occurred in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes but only at a subset of unsynapsed chromatin regions. It should be noted that HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 localized appropriately to all unsynapsed regions independently of RAD1, indicating that HORMAD localization was not sufficient to drive ATR signaling and highlighting essential roles for the 9-1-1 complexes in meiotic ATR activation, likely through interaction with TOPBP1. Other ATR substrates were more profoundly affected by RAD1 loss. CHK1 phosphorylation during meiosis was absent in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice but present in <italic>Hus1</italic> CKO mice, suggesting that HUS1-independent alternative 9-1-1 complexes are necessary for meiotic CHK1 activation. CHK1 regulates the timing of both removal of γH2AX from autosomes and establishment of an ordered γH2AX domain at the sex body, but is not essential for MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2018</xref>). Proper loading of RAD51 and DMC1 onto chromatin also depends on CHK1 and ATR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>).

Our analyses found SMC3 localization to meiotic chromosome cores to be unperturbed, but SMC3 phosphorylation at S1083 was dependent on RAD1 and ATR. NIPBL, which functions in association with Mau2 as an SMC loader that localizes to chromosomal axes from zygonema to mid-pachynema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Visnes et al., 2014</xref>) also had reduced phosphorylation in testes from <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO and ATRi-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sims et al., 2021</xref>).

ERC analysis can infer functional protein partners based upon correlated rates of evolutionary change. ERC network analysis of the relationship between proteins involved in meiosis I and the 9-1-1 subunits revealed a clustering of RAD9B, RAD1, and HUS1, while RAD9A and HUS1B did not show high ERC values with the other 9-1-1 subunits and had mostly separate network interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). This approach also highlighted significant evolutionary correlations between the genes encoding 9-1-1 complex subunits and those encoding proteins involved in SC formation, such as SYCP1, SYCE1, SYCE1L, and SYCE2, in addition to RAD21, RAD21L, and SMC1β, which are involved in cohesion. Defects in homolog synapsis in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice, together with the decreased cohesin phosphorylation, further implicate the 9-1-1 complexes in these key aspects of meiotic chromosome structure. However, further exploration of the mechanisms underlying the interactions between SC proteins, cohesin, and the 9-1-1 complexes is necessary and may provide insights into the basis for the DSB repair defects in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice as proper SC formation and cohesin function is important for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishiguro, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In mitotic cells, ATR activation is dependent on the 9A-1-1/TOPBP1 axis under cellular stress, while ATR activation during unperturbed conditions relies on ETAA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass and Cortez, 2019</xref>). The potential contributions of ETAA1 to meiotic ATR activation have yet to be directly assessed. However, <italic>Etaa1</italic> expression is low in germ cells and in spermatocytes in particular, and ETAA1 was reported to not localize to the XY chromosomes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">ElInati et al., 2017</xref>). Mice expressing a ETAA1 mutant with a 42 amino acid deletion show signs of replication stress but are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miosge et al., 2017</xref>), further hinting at a predominant role for the 9-1-1/TOPBP1 axis as a primary regulator of meiotic ATR activation. Understanding the differential roles of 9-1-1/TOPBP1 and possibly ETAA1 in meiotic ATR activation may highlight different modes of structure-specific ATR activation that are coupled with distinct downstream outputs.</p><p>Although this study highlights key meiotic functions of both canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes, our approach does not resolve the relative importance of the DNA repair and checkpoint signaling roles of the 9-1-1 complexes during meiosis. Previous studies identified separable roles for 9-1-1 complexes in ATR activation via TOPBP1 interaction, and DNA repair protein scaffolding through the outer surface of 9-1-1 clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). The loss of 9-1-1 complex formation and loading in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice disrupts both of these roles. In budding yeast, the direct interactions between the 9-1-1 complex and Red1 as well as Zip3, together with additional evidence that the roles for 9-1-1 in SC formation and recombination can be distinguished from those of Mec1 (ATR), provide compelling support for the notion that the 9-1-1 complex executes signaling-independent functions during meiosis, aside from its roles in checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichinger and Jentsch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shinohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shinohara et al., 2015</xref>). In the future, separation-of-function 9-1-1 mouse mutants could be used to clarify precisely how the 9-1-1 complexes mediate meiotic processes such as homolog synapsis, cohesion, and silencing. Moreover, continued genetic and biochemical analysis of the paralogs RAD9B and HUS1B holds promise for resolving the differential and overlapping roles of the canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes in spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-RAD1;

Orthologs that did not meet those criteria were considered to have low confidence. Sequences only found in the NCBI Gene database were considered as high confidence if they were found to be syntenic. Synteny was determined based on whether the gene had at least one shared neighbor gene upstream or downstream that also was conserved. Species divergence across time was obtained from TimeTree website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://timetree.org/">http://timetree.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Protein sequences of 9-1-1 orthologs were obtained using NCBI HomoloGene. Multiple alignment of protein sequences was done using Clustal Omega (1.2.2) implemented in Geneious Prime (2020.0.5). A substitution model was tested using ProtTest (v. 3.4.2). The selected substitution model with specific improvements was JTT + I + G + F (Jones–Taylor–Thornton;+ I: invariable sites; + G: rate heterogeneity among sites; + F: observed amino acid frequencies). Improvements were included to take account of any evolutionary limitations due to conservation of protein structure and function. A nonrooted phylogenetic tree was made using Maximum Likelihood interference (four gamma distributed rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) and implemented with iTOL (itol.embl.de) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Letunic and Bork, 2019</xref>). Branch distance represents substitution rate, and branch support was performed with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. Nodes below 70% branch support were collapsed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ERC analysis</title><p>ERC calculations were completed using the ERC web tool at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://csb.pitt.edu/erc_analysis/">https://csb.pitt.edu/erc_analysis/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolfe and Clark, 2015</xref>). Group analysis was performed to examine ERC values between all gene pairs indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> using UCSC gene sequences from 33 mammalian species as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Priedigkeit et al., 2015</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, the protein set list for Gene Ontology subontology Meiosis I (GO:0007127) was obtained from AmiGO 2 (v2.5.13). ERC values were calculated against each of the 9-1-1 subunits using the ERC analysis website. Using R (v4.0.3), ERC values were depicted as a heatmap and a network plotted using the packages pheatmap (v1.0.12) and qgraph (v1.6.5), respectively. A cutoff of ERC value of 0.4 was used to determine significant comparisons. The Fruchterman and Reingold algorithm was used to generate a forced-directed layout to help determine clusters of highly connected nodes, and after 500 iterations the distance between nodes shows absolute edge weight (ERC values) between nodes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice used for this study were handled following federal and institutional guidelines under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cornell University (protocol numbers 2011-0098 and 2004-0034).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68677-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.

Mammals have three distinct DDR clamps, Rad9A-Rad1-Hus1, Rad9B-Rad1-Hus1, and Rad9B-Rad1-Hus1B, in which Rad1 is a share component. The authors showed Rad1 CKO is defective in the repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), chromosome synapsis and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) mediated by ATR kinase. This is an extension of previous works by the authors on Hus1 and Rad9A CKO mice. Moreover, with phosphor-proteomic analysis of proteins in testis of the Rad1 CKO and ATR inhibitor-treated testis, the authors showed the link of Rad1- and ATR-dependent phosphorylation to various chromosomal events such as cohesion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper examined the function of RAD1, a common subunit of mammalian 9-1-1 complex in male meiosis. Importantly, the phenotype of Rad1 CKO appeared to be more severe than that of other redundant subunits of the 9-1-1 complex (Hus1 CKO and Rad9a CKO), and the authors presented promising pieces of data that show that ATR signaling was largely impaired. Pictures are high quality in general. However, a subset of mutant germ cells apparently complete meiotic prophase and reached round spermatids, and it appeared that ~ 40% of mutant cells completed chromosome synapsis (Figure 3- supplement 1D). Therefore, after reading this manuscript, it is not clear how many mutant cells showed such severe prophase defects (as demonstrated in some main figures); nor is the efficiency of Cre deletion confirmed. Although the study has potential, it is somewhat preliminary to conclude the mechanism by which the 9-1-1 complex regulates meiosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, the Weiss lab reveals the function of RAD1 during the mouse meiotic prophase. RAD1 is a component of the 9-1-1 complexes, which are responsible to activate the DNA damage response kinase ATR in somatic cells. Canonical (9A-1-1) and alternative (9B-1-1 and 9B-1-1B) 9-1-1 complexes have been described in mice. Importantly, all 9-1-1 complexes contain RAD1. Previous work from the group studying RAD9A suggested that the canonical complex had no major role in meiosis. Nonetheless, nothing was known about the function of the rest of the 9-1-1 complexes in meiosis. The presented data clearly shows that RAD1 is required to complete meiotic recombination, homologous synapsis, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, and to activate ATR in spermatocytes. In general, the study is well designed and executed, the manuscript is well organized and reads easily, and the conclusions are supported by the data.</p><p>This study highlights the importance of the 9-1-1 complexes and the ATR signaling pathway in spermatocytes, something that was not known before. The data presented here will be very useful for the DNA repair, meiosis, and reproductive biology communities studying the roles of the ATR signaling pathway. However, I think the study could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the presence of the different 9-1-1 complexes in mouse testis as well as the relation of the 9-1-1 complex with early recombination markers. Also, I missed the description of the role of RAD1 in female mice fertility, something that would clearly expand the relevance of the findings described in the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68677.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since using the same data set in co-submitted papers is unusual, we strongly ask you to move most of the ATR-dependent phosphor-proteomic data described in Figure 6 (and possibly Figure 7-since there is little insight on the role of ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Smc3) to the accompanying paper by Smolka.

As suggested, we have removed the phosphoproteomic data (original Figure 6) from the revised manuscript. We retained the analysis of SMC3 phosphorylation as an example of a RAD1- and ATR-dependent phosphorylation event that is consistent with the <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO phenotypes we report, but we have de-emphasized this result by moving several of the related panels to a supplemental figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and by integrating the results into a section that describes several different ATR signaling defects (revised Figure 5) rather than giving it a separate section. The Results section now ends with a figure devoted to the important new findings of meiotic silencing defects in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice (revised Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (experiments and analyses):</p><p>1. Since the role of Rad1, thus 9-1-1, in ATR-dependent meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is a very new observation, you need a more detailed description of defective MSCI in Rad1 cKO by staining with BRCA1. Moreover, Scml2 RNA FISH data are not sufficient to conclude MSCI defects. You should check the localization of RNA polymerase II to see if MSCI is disrupted.</p></disp-quote><p>To further characterize the MSCI defect, we performed additional staining for BRCA1 and RNA Pol II in control and <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes (Figure 6). In pachytene-like cells lacking RAD1 expression, BRCA1 showed a defective localization pattern similar to what we observed for TOPBP1 and ATR, with BRCA1 failing to localize to all unsynapsed regions in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes (Figure 6D).</p><p>Whereas RNA Pol II showed the expected exclusion from the sex body in pachytene spermatocytes from control males, RNA Pol II was diffusely distributed in RAD1-deficient pachytene-like spermatocytes with extensive asynapsis. However, the only way to definitively establish whether a protein has a primary role at the XY pair to initiate MSCI is to specifically assay cells in which autosomal synapsis is unaffected, because asynapsis of the autosomes antagonizes MSCI by sequestering the proteins that are required for silencing away from the sex chromosomes (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200710195">10.1083/jcb.200710195</ext-link>). We therefore further examined apparently normal, fully synapsed cells from <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO testes and observed a higher frequency of abnormal localization of RNA Pol II in the sex body (27.8 ± 19.1%) as compared to control cells (8.8 ± 2.4% of cells; Figure 6E). Together with the defective localization of gH2AX and the RNA FISH data showing aberrant X-linked gene expression in cells from <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO testes with apparently normal synapsis, these new results provide further evidence that 9-1-1 complexes are important for MSCI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In order to address this, we performed immunoblotting on testes from 14 day old mice and observed decreased RAD1 levels in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO samples (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), similar to the reduction detected in samples from adult <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO testes (Figure 2C).</p><p>Immunoblotting for SMC3 and pSMC3 (1083) in P14 testis lysates was also performed.

In addition, Freire et al. previously reported that RAD1 and DMC1 co-localize in immunofluorescence assays and thus are in the same general vicinity but actually have distinct localizations by immunoelectron microscopy (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/12/16/2560.long">10.1101/gad.12.16.2560</ext-link>). We have fortified our descriptions of these prior results and focused new experimentation on co-staining of RPA and RAD1. We report that relatively limited co-localization in early Prophase I (Figure 4 Supplement 1A). As RPA and RAD1 foci become apparent along chromosome cores, additional overlap in signal is evident, although much of the signal is non-overlapping which is not surprising given that RPA coats single-stranded DNA whereas 9-1-1 likely is present on double-stranded DNA. Co-localization of RAD1 and RPA on autosomes in pachytene-stage cells may in part reflect recombination intermediates during the final stages of DSB repair (DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.015">10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.015</ext-link>). In late pachytene, RAD1 is known to coat the unsynapsed regions of the X and Y, and is present there even when there are no apparent RPA foci, which likely reflects the role of RAD1 in MSCI rather than DSB repair. Additional data from our studies and others hint at 9-1-1 functions in synapsis and cohesion, and these roles also may position RAD1 independently of RPA throughout Prophase I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

What percent of tubules have round spermatids?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewer and agree that a clearer description of the extent of RAD1 loss in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice was needed. As noted by the reviewer, RAD1 expression was undetectable in 43% of spermatocytes. Additional data further suggest that among the remaining 57% of spermatocytes with detectable RAD1 expression, a subset of the cells had functional defects reflecting significant but partial loss of RAD1 expression. First, approximately 60% of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes had synapsis defects. Additionally, some of the cells with apparently normal synapsis had other functional defects. Namely, 15% of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes with apparently complete synapsis exhibited defects in γH2AX staining on the XY body, 28% showed aberrant RNA Pol II localization, and 29% had defects in silencing of the X-linked <italic>Scml2</italic> gene. We have added a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) that summarizes the three categories of spermatocytes observed in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice: (1) those with no detectable RAD1 foci and severe defects; (2) those with some detectable RAD1 foci but clear functional defects; and (3) those with detectable RAD1 foci and no apparent functional defects. In total, approximately 72% of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells had functional defects.</p><p>Our new quantification of round spermatids in testis sections from 12-week-old mice further supports the notion that the majority of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO meiocytes had functional defects. Although the severe germ cell loss in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice prevented staging of tubules, we found that 65% of tubules in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO testes had fewer than 10 round spermatids while no tubules from control had fewer than 10 round spermatids. We have updated the text to include this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the same line, ~40% of spermatocytes show complete chromosome synapsis-these cells are positive for gH2AX and ATR staining (Figure 3D showed incomplete gH2AX domains, but Figure 5G showed an apparently normal gH2AX domain). The frequency of the phenotype needs to be scored. Given that ~ 40% of mutant cells completed chromosome synapsis, what is the ATR-activation phenotype in these ~ 40% of mutant cells that completed chromosome synapsis? Figure 3D showed incomplete gH2AX domains, but Figure 5G showed an apparently normal gH2AX domain. Please explain this discrepancy</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, Figure 3D showed asynapsed autosomes with incomplete gH2AX localization. Original Figure 5G, from an RNA FISH experiment, showed sex chromosomes with gH2AX localizing only to a portion of the X and absent from the Y, an abnormal pattern that correlated with the lack of silencing of the X-linked gene <italic>Smcl2</italic>.</p><p>To quantify the frequency of aberrant gH2AX localization, we further analyzed gH2AX staining at the sex body in both control and <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells with apparently normally synapsis. Abnormal staining was defined as either lack of gH2AX on the XY or extension of the gH2AX domain beyond the XY onto a nearby autosome. This quantification revealed abnormal gH2AX staining at the XY in 3.2 ± 1.5%, of pachytene-stage control cells. However, in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice, 15.1 ± 11.5%, of cells with apparently normal synapsis had gH2AX defects at the XY (Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). A fraction of <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO cells with apparently normal synapsis also showed defective RNA Pol II localization (27.8 ± 19.1%), and aberrant <italic>Smcl2</italic> expression was observed at a similar frequency (28.9 ± 3.2%). We conclude that among the 40% of cells in the <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO model with apparently complete synapsis, a subset of cells have a partial reduction of RAD1 that results in functional defects in ATR signaling and silencing. The new schematic shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B highlights this population of cells with RAD1 foci present but clear functional defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Quantification of RAD1, RAD9A, and RA9B foci in different meiotic stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified RAD1, RAD9A and RAD9B foci in control cells and added these numerical data to the paper to provide a clearer picture of how 9-1-1 subunits are distributed throughout meiotic prophase I. We found that RAD1 is present at high levels in early prophase (209.3 ± 23.9 RAD1 foci in leptonema and 208.2 ± 9.15 in zygonema) and reduced as the cells reached mid-pachynema (120.8 ± 27.3 RAD1 foci). Foci counts for RAD9A and RAD9B followed a similar trend as RAD1 in leptotene-stage cells (145.5 ± 20.8 RAD9A foci; 211.5 ± 50.8 RAD9B foci) and zygotene-stage cells (125.2 ± 25.6 RAD9A foci; 230.5 ± 40.5 RAD9B foci) and also dropped by mid-pachynema (107.3 ± 32.6 for RAD9A; 125.5 ± 19.2 for RAD9B). In pachytene-stage cells we observed RAD1 coating of the XY cores while RAD9A and RAD9B localized to the XY as discrete foci. Whether the differences in distribution of 9-1-1 subunits along the sex chromosomes reflect technical limitations of current immunoreagents or distinct roles for 9-1-1 subunits in DNA repair, MSCI or other processes is an open question for future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Provide a more accurate description of the location of 9-1-1 complexes as synapsis progresses. Are foci present in synapsed axis? (from the images provided in Figure 3A it seems so, but I don't think it's been described in the text)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that our description of 9-1-1 localization relative to homolog synapsis was underdeveloped. As DSBs occur and repair begins in leptonema, RAD1 foci were present in high numbers. As synaptonemal complex formation progressed in zygonema, RAD1 colocalized with axial elements on the chromosome cores. The reviewer is correct that in mid-pachynema RAD1 remained present on fully synapsed regions of the autosomes. RAD1 signal was also highly concentrated on the XY cores. RAD1 continued to be observed on the XY cores in late-pachynema but was no longer present on autosomes. We have discussed these patterns more explicitly in the revised text and suggest that the pattern reflects several possible functional roles for 9-1-1 complexes in synapsis, cohesion, DSB repair, and MSCI as detailed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. No CHK1 phosphorylation sites were detected in supplemental table 1 of the phosphoproteomics data. However, the authors study pCHK1 in Figure 5F. Since CHK1 is not required for MSCI, and non-phosphor CHK1 has never been detected on the XY body, the validity of CHK1 data in Figure 5F is questionable. Western blots should be performed, at least in controls, to confirm the presence of pCHK1 (S317) in normal meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that CHK1 was not identified in the companion phosphoproteomic screen as a RAD1- and ATR-dependent target. However, in somatic cells the regulation of CHK1 phosphorylation via the 9A-1-1/TOPBP1/ATR axis is well established. Given our observations of defective ATR localization in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes, we endeavored to examine CHK1 phosphorylation levels.</p><p>While CHK1 does not directly participate in MSCI, it has been implicated in meiotic DNA damage signaling and meiotic progression. In addition, Fedoriw et al. (DOI: 10.1242/dev.126078) previously reported that CHK1 and pCHK1 S317 localize to the XY core and XY chromatin loops. This is in line with what we observe in our control spermatocytes stained for pCHK1 S317 (Figure 5C-D). We did not intend to conclude that the CHK1 phosphorylation and MSCI defects we observed in RAD1-deficient cells were inter-connected, and therefore we have moved the CHK1 data to the figure describing characteristics of the TOPBP1/ATR signaling axis (Figure 5). At the suggestion of the reviewer, we also performed pCHK1 immunoblotting on whole testis lysates. Consistent with our other results, <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO testes showed a reduction in pCHK1 (S317) and pCHK1 (S345) relative to control testes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Together, the immunostaining and immunoblotting data indicate that RAD1 is required for CHK1 S317 phosphorylation during meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. pSMC3 (1083) was not detected in supplemental table 1 of the phosphoproteomics data.

Nevertheless, given that phosphorylation of SMC3 (1083) has been shown previously to be linked to ATR signaling and there is a commercial antibody readily available to us, we decided to interrogate the site further. The lack of pSMC3 (1083) phosphorylation that we observed in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO spermatocytes is intriguing since it hints at a role for the 9-1-1 complexes in cohesin regulation via ATR phosphorylation, with potential implications for the DSB repair and synapsis defects we observe. However, we agree that the role of 911-mediated SMC3 regulation remains to be determined, and therefore we have placed less emphasis on this finding in the revised manuscript and include it as one of several examples in revised Figure 5 of altered phosphorylation of ATR targets in <italic>Rad1</italic> CKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If possible:</p><p>1.
