However, our understanding of this essential organ remains incomplete. A substantial challenge has been the syncytial cells of the placenta, which have made dissociation and independent evaluation of the different cell types of this organ difficult. Here, we address questions concerning the ontogeny, specification, and function of the cell types of a representative hemochorial placenta by performing single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) at multiple stages of mouse embryonic development focusing on the exchange interface, the labyrinth. Timepoints extended from progenitor-driven expansion through terminal differentiation. Analysis by snRNA-seq identified transcript profiles and inferred functions, cell trajectories, signaling interactions, and transcriptional drivers of all but the most highly polyploid cell types of the placenta. These data profile placental development at an unprecedented resolution, provide insights into differentiation and function across time, and provide a resource for future study.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>single nuclei RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>placental development</kwd><kwd>labyrinth</kwd><kwd>syncytiotrophoblasts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 HD055764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blelloch</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A time-course of single nuclei RNA-seq of the mouse placenta identifies trophoblast subtypes and the genes, signaling events, and transcriptional networks important for their differentiation, maintenance, and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The placenta links maternal tissues and the embryo, providing necessary support and instructing the development of the embryo. The placenta performs many essential functions including transport of nutrients and exchange of gases and waste between maternal and fetal blood, production and uptake of hormones, and regulation of the maternal immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maltepe and Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). The mouse placenta is separated into three main regions – the decidua, the junctional zone (JZ), and the labyrinth. Select fetal trophoblast invade into the maternal decidua and remodel and line maternal arteries, facilitating maternal blood to flow into the fetal portion of the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maltepe and Fisher, 2015</xref>). The JZ lies directly beneath the decidua and consists of parietal trophoblast giant cells, spongiotrophoblast, and glycogen cells that largely function in hormone secretion and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Beneath the JZ, closest to the embryo, is the labyrinth, which is specially designed to maximize surface area for gas and nutrient exchange between maternal and fetal blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soncin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woods et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear isolation and snRNA-seq of mouse placental cells (E9.5-E14.5).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the main regions of the placenta – Labyrinth, Junctional Zone, Parietal TGC, and Decidua.

This begins a process of invasion and branching morphogenesis resulting in an expansive surface area for gas and nutrient exchange by E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soncin et al., 2015</xref>). The gas exchange interface in the mouse contains three layers of differentiated trophoblast separating maternal blood from the endothelial cells of the fetal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maltepe and Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coan et al., 2005</xref>). Sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells (S-TGC) reside in the maternal blood space, have demonstrated exocrine functions, and are a source of placental lactogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simmons et al., 2008b</xref>). S-TGC are attached to the outermost syncytiotrophoblast layer (SynTI) but are perforated allowing maternal blood to contact SynTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). Next, are the two SynT layers which together transport gasses and nutrients from the maternal blood to the fetal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georgiades et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woods et al., 2018</xref>). SynTI is the outer layer in direct contact with maternal blood forming the barrier between maternal blood and fetal tissue. Beneath, is SynTII which functions as an intermediary between SynTI on its apical membrane and the fetal endothelium on its basal side. Proper patterning of each cell type ensures efficient transport of nutrients and waste between maternal and fetal blood, and is necessary for embryonic growth, development, and viability.</p><p>Investigating the cells of the placental labyrinth is difficult due to their size and an expansion in the number or ploidy of nuclei. SynT cells are multinucleate and are not amenable to standard dissociation and isolation procedures. As a reference, human SynT are 80–200 µM in diameter and contain 5–15 nuclei meaning their size and fragility do not allow for profiling by FACS or passage through microfluidic channels for droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, questions remain about how each cell type is specified, how essential placental functions are distributed between cell types, and how each cell type changes throughout developmental time.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing has become the preferred method for understanding the composition of a complex tissue at the transcriptional level. Several studies in both mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Home and Ghosh, 2019</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suryawanshi et al., 2018</xref>) have profiled the placenta using scRNA-seq, however, syncytiotrophoblast are greatly underrepresented in these data. Studies in mouse have either avoided profiling the labyrinth trophoblast, or are unable to distinguish between the two SynT layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Home and Ghosh, 2019</xref>). Recently, application of droplet-based transcriptome profiling to nuclei has been shown to provide high quality data and results which recapitulate those from whole cell scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2020</xref>). To circumvent complications with single-cell dissociation and capture of placental cells, we applied single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to the mouse placenta.</p><p>In this study, we used snRNA-seq to profile the murine placental development at four time points spanning placental cell type specification, differentiation, and maturation (E9.5, E10.5, E12.5, and E14.5). We resolve all populations of the labyrinth at single-nucleus resolution and identify distinct markers and transcript signatures for each population. We are able to separate each SynT layer, furthering the understanding of the independent roles of each cell type at the gas exchange interface. Mapping differentiation from stem/progenitor cells to terminal differentiation, we capture novel intermediates and identify putative regulators. We predict signaling interactions between populations of the labyrinth to understand crosstalk between these populations, revealing factors guiding concerted development of SynT and fetal endothelium. Finally, we identify transcription factor (TF) driven gene regulatory networks active in each placental population, uncovering candidate regulators of fate and function in the placenta. By separating and characterizing placental cell types, specifically those in the labyrinth, these data provide a resource for understanding development in vivo, generation of molecular tools in vitro and in vivo, and for future modeling of prenatal pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear isolation and snRNA-seq of mouse placental cells (E9.5-E14.5)</title><p>To gain a better understanding of the constitution of cell types and developmental trajectories in the mouse placenta, we performed single nuclei droplet-based sequencing of their transcriptomes at four embryonic time points: E9.5, E10.5, E12.5, and E14.5. Given the largely syncytial nature of the placenta, we reasoned that sequencing of nuclei would bypass the problems inherent in using a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach. To decrease contribution from maternal tissues, the placenta was carefully dissected at the boundary between the fetal junctional zone and the maternal decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the labyrinth side of the placenta, the placenta was separated from embryo proper at the point of attachment with the allantois on the basal side (embryo facing). Nuclei were isolated and sorted for DNA content by FACS enabling the removal of doublets and contaminating cytoplasmic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Isolated nuclei were subjected to droplet-based sequencing using the 10x Genomics platform.</p><p>A total of 27,326 nuclei passed quality control (between 500 and 4000 unique genes identified and fewer than 0.25% mitochondrial reads), ranging from 4124 to 9485 nuclei across the embryonic days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Clustering of nuclei using the Seurat package identified 26 clusters, then projected in UMAP expression space allowing for an understanding of the relationship among populations as visualized by proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Based on general markers, these populations were separated into five broad groups: trophoblast, decidual stroma, blood cells, endothelial cells, and fetal mesenchyme.</p><p>The maternal decidual stroma was identified by the absence of Xist expression in male embryonic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Marker genes further subdivided the five broad groups into subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The fetal mesenchyme group consisted of two distinct subgroups. One (clusters 6, 10, and 24) expressed markers of pericytes (e.g. <italic>Acta2</italic>) and several growth factors including <italic>Wnt5b</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> that are critical for development and maintenance of vascular populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>).

The endothelial group consisted of cells expressing markers of vascular endothelium (Cluster 3 - <italic>Pecam1</italic>, <italic>Kdr</italic>, <italic>Tek</italic>), lymphatic endothelium (cluster 26 - <italic>Flt4</italic>/<italic>Vegfr3</italic>), and pro-angiogenic and lymphogenic lineages (Clusters 20 and 25 - <italic>Vegfc</italic> and <italic>Igf1</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Björndahl et al., 2005</xref>). The identification of cells expressing lymphatic markers is intriguing because the placenta is not thought to contain lymphatics. However, lymphatic endothelium has been discovered in human and it is possible a similar cell type exists in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pique-Regi et al., 2019</xref>). The blood cell group consisted of putative erythrocytes (Cluster 13 - Hbb-y, Hba-x), macrophages (Cluster 17 - Mrc1+; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinez and Gordon, 2014</xref>), B-cells (Cluster 21 - Bank1, Btla; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiba et al., 2006</xref>), T-cells (Cluster 22 – Gzmc, Slamf1, Cd84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griewank et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Veillette, 2006</xref>), and natural killer cells (Cluster 23 Cd<italic>244</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2004</xref>).

One of these clusters highly expressed the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>Met</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which was previously described as a marker of labyrinth trophoblast progenitor (LaTP) cells with trilineage potential: SynTI, SynTII, and S-TGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). The snRNA-seq data places these cells as most closely related to SynTII. Notably, the LaTP shared expression of the Wnt signaling pathway members <italic>Ror2</italic>, <italic>Lgr5</italic>, and <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> with presumptive SynTII precursors. Interestingly, the clustering identified a second subpopulation of cells in the central body that shared relatively high expression of <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> and the long non-coding RNA <italic>Pvt1</italic> with LaTPs, but expressed low levels of <italic>Met</italic>, <italic>Ror2</italic>, and <italic>Lgr5</italic> and high levels of <italic>Egfr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These cells were more closely related to SynTI and S-TGC. We designated this subpopulation as LaTP2. Correlative analysis of RNA levels for Met and Egfr in individual cells confirmed that for the most part these markers were uniquely expressed in LaTP and LaTP2 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previously described LaTPs were also shown to express high levels of the adhesion protein EPCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). EPCAM mRNA and protein was mostly limited to the MET+ LaTP cells, although rare EPCAM/EGFR double positive cells were also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Positionally, MET expressing LaTP cells were more basal than the EGFR expressing LaTP2 cells, suggesting that LaTP may be giving rise to LaTP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, immunofluorescence staining of E8.5 embryos identified a large number of EPCAM/MET double positive cells, but few EGFR positive cells in the developing chorion plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these data show that LaTPs can be separated into two populations based both on mRNA and protein expression. The developmental relationship between these two populations will require future lineage tracing.</p><p>The remaining two clusters within the central body appeared to represent precursors of the differentiated cells of the junctional zone – glycogen cells (GCs) and spongiotrophoblasts (SpT) [Junctional zone precursors (JZPs) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)]. JZP1 exclusively expressed high levels of <italic>Cdh4</italic>, whereas <italic>Prune2</italic> and <italic>Ncam1</italic> showed a continuum of expression, increasing from JZP 1 to 2 and finally specified GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Markers such as <italic>Igfbp7</italic>, <italic>Pla2g4d</italic>, <italic>Plac8, and Pcdh12</italic> marked later stages of GC specification. In contrast to GCs, the SpT arm separated from late JZP2/early GCs, with increasing expression of <italic>Mitf</italic>, <italic>Flt1</italic>, <italic>Prl8a9</italic>, and <italic>Slco2a1</italic> as they transitioned from precursors to differentiated cells. The relationship between LaTPs and JZPs is unclear as they shared few markers. One shared marker was <italic>Pvt1</italic>, a target and enhancer of expression of the oncogene <italic>Myc</italic> and, therefore, may reflect the shared proliferative nature of these two populations, explaining their juxtaposition in UMAP space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tseng et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The arms extending from the central body showed a transition from progenitors through precursors to fully differentiated cells representing five previously described cell types of the mouse placenta: SynTI, SynTII, S-TGCs, GCs, and SpTs. SynTI was easily identified based on the expression of known markers of SynTI function including the transferrin receptor <italic>Tfrc</italic> and monocarboxylase transporter <italic>Mct1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walentin et al., 2016</xref>), but also expressed previously unknown markers such as the transcription factor (TF) <italic>Glis1</italic> and the retinol receptor <italic>Stra6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). SynTI precursors also expressed these markers, albeit at lower levels, while additionally expressing high levels of the signaling molecules <italic>Epha4</italic> and <italic>Tgfa</italic>, which decreased with further differentiation. SynTII was annotated by expression of the TF <italic>Gcm1</italic> and fusion gene <italic>Synb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maltepe and Fisher, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>), but also expressed many previously unknown cell-specific genes such as the glucagon receptor <italic>Gcgr</italic> and vascular endothelial growth factor <italic>Vegfa</italic>. SynTII precursors showed elevated expression of <italic>Ror2</italic> and <italic>Lgr5</italic> relative to the LaTP. In contrast, <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> decreased throughout the process of differentiation from LaTP to SynTII. S-TGCs were easily identified by the expression of the canonical marker <italic>Ctsq</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>), but also uniquely expressed the leptin receptor <italic>Lepr</italic> and the Nitric Oxide Synthase one adaptor <italic>Nos1ap</italic> among other genes. Marker genes for all populations are included in supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We further probed the transition from multipotent LaTP through precursors to each of the differentiated labyrinth cell types (SynTII, SynT1, and S-TGC) using pseudotime analysis. The pseudotime analysis program Slingshot aligned cells along a 2D trajectory from the most transcriptionally similar LaTP population (LaTP-SynTII; LaTP2-SynTI; LaTP2-STGC) to each of the mature populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Street et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source datas 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">4</xref>). Pseudotime analysis expanded upon the marker genes for each population by defining the timing of expression of genes through the differentiation process and identifying distinct signaling pathways in each lineage. Expression of Wnt regulated TF <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> along with Wnt receptor <italic>Ror2</italic> were maintained from LaTP through commitment to a SynTII precursor state. Upon commitment to the SynTII lineage, the TF <italic>Zfhx3</italic> and growth factor receptor <italic>Igf1r</italic> are newly expressed while canonical markers <italic>Gcm1</italic> and <italic>Synb</italic> are among the later transcript changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). SynTI Precursor cells maintain <italic>Pvt1</italic> expression but uniquely upregulate the ephrin receptor <italic>Epha4</italic>, the Egf-related ligand <italic>Tgfa</italic>, and the Egf receptor substrate <italic>Eps8</italic>. Only mature SynTI express the kinase <italic>Prkce</italic> and clathrin coat assembly protein <italic>Snap91</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). S-TGC Precursor cells activate the receptors <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Lifr</italic> as well as the hypoxia induced TF <italic>Epas1</italic> upon lineage commitment. Expression of the canonical marker <italic>Ctsq</italic> occurs only in mature S-TGC along with <italic>Lepr</italic> and the glucocorticoid signaling effector <italic>Tsc22d3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data are consistent with distinct signaling pathways (e.g. SynTII – WNT, IGF; SynTI – EGF, EPH; S-TGC – LIF, PPAR) driving differentiation of LaTP into the three main cell types of the placental labyrinth. Interestingly, the S-TGC appear to differentiate from the junction of LaTP2 and JZP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), potentially suggestive that S-TGC arise from ectoplacental cone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>) as well as from chorion derived LaTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible the location of the S-TGC near JZP1 reflects the shared prolactin expression between S-TGC and other junctional zone populations. Again, lineage tracing will be required to address their developmental relationships.</p><p>As described above, the remaining two arms were consistent with differentiation of the JZ populations: SpT and GC cells. Immunofluorescence of the representative markers NCAM1 and SLCO2A1 confirmed their expression in the JZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, staining of juxtaposed sections confirmed their mutually exclusive expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Co-staining with the known GC marker PCDH12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rampon et al., 2005</xref>), verified the GC identity of the NCAM1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Previous work has identified differential expression of prolactin genes between GC and SpT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the expression of these genes in our dataset. Expression analysis of prolactin genes showed both distinct and overlapping expression of this large gene family between the SpT and GC cells, and confirmed the identities of these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Of important note, parietal TGC nuclei were not identified in our snRNA-seq data, likely due to their very large size precluding their passage through the FACS pre-filter, which removes nuclei greater than 35 microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Our data also did not identify invasive trophoblast giant cells (spiral artery and canal TGCs) that invade the decidua, which was dissected away. Still, this analysis of the trophoblast snRNA-seq was able to clarify the cell types and their relationships for a predominance of the lineages of the mouse placenta identifying novel intermediate states and markers of the different cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Developmental time course and trajectory inference reveal details of lineage dynamics and commitment</title><p>Next, we asked how the trophoblast cell populations changed over developmental time by separating the conglomerate data into its individual timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This visualization clearly showed the rapid diminishment of the LaTP populations over time, resulting in few progenitors remaining by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The precursor populations also decreased over time, presumably maturing into terminally differentiated cells, which dramatically increased during the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

In contrast, the cells within each precursor population showed uniform directionality and large magnitudes, especially at E10.5 and E12.5, the period of greatest placental expansion. Surprisingly, the differentiated cell populations also showed vectors of great magnitude and uniform directionality at the early timepoints, suggesting ongoing transcriptional maturation, before diminishing by E14.5. To evaluate ongoing changes in the mature populations, we selected the S-TGC population and performed differential expressional analysis between each timepoint and E9.5.

S-TGCs are connected to SynTI by desmosomes, which are known to undergo constant remodeling and have additional functions in signaling and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmons et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). These S-TGC-specific programs along with the high expression of <italic>Podxl</italic>, likely underlie a central role for these cells in the function of the maternal sinuses. S-TGC are also enriched for the placental development category which includes several genes important for giant cell function including <italic>Hand1</italic> (regulation of giant cell lineage), <italic>Hsd17b2</italic> (steroid hormone production), and <italic>E2F7</italic> (endoreduplication).</p><p>Given that the labyrinth represents the site of exchange of nutrients, minerals, metabolites, ions, gases, and regulatory factors, between the mother and fetus, we next wanted to better understand how these functions are distributed across the different trophoblast layers. We focused on two large functional categories: solute transporter and cholesterol/vitamin transport. All genes in these categories that were found to be differentially expressed between one of the interface populations (SynTI, SynTII, S-TGC) compared to all other trophoblast populations were included in this analysis. The results suggested a striking separation of functions between the layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). For example, genes responsible for carboxylate transport were highly enriched in SynTII, while organic anion transporters were enriched in SynTI. Even within specific transport pathways, functions were often separated; for example, factors important in Zinc transport were distributed across, yet distinctly expressed between the populations. Cholesterol transporters are enriched in SynTII (<italic>Scarb1</italic>, <italic>Vldlr</italic>) and S-TGC (<italic>Hdlbp</italic>, <italic>Ldlr</italic>), while Folate receptors (<italic>Folr1</italic>, <italic>Folr2</italic>) are uniquely expressed in SynTI.

Our snRNA-seq data contained many well-studied TFs, but expression alone is not necessarily a good indicator of function. TFs typically act cooperatively with other TFs and numerous factors influence their activity. Therefore, we sought to identify active TFs based on both expression of the TF and its downstream targets within the same cells. To do so, we used the SCENIC package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) which uses a database of TFs and their annotated motifs to identify enrichment of a TF motif within or near the promoter regions of co-expressed genes within each cell to define ‘regulon activity’.

Only 17 of the 200 TFs had annotated placental phenotypes, while 124 are lethal during development (defined as until weaning) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Many of these developmental lethal phenotypes likely are associated with placental defects given that 68% of 103 intrauterine lethal and subviable mouse knockout lines also have placental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>).

In particular, the regulon data was evaluated for evidence of coexistence of paired regulon activity with associated high confidence annotations (defined by either direct annotation or inferred by orthology) of binding sites for one or both of the TFs in the other TF’s promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). <italic>Gcm1</italic>, the master regulator of the SynTI lineage, and <italic>Zhfx3</italic> have reciprocal high confidence motif in their promoter regions, suggestive of a positive feedback loop. <italic>Zfhx3</italic> and <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> also show mutual regulation of one another, and <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> also has a high confidence binding site in the promoter of <italic>Gcm1</italic>.

Strong GATA1 staining was also obvious in the nuclei of fetal erythrocytes with vascular lumen. Therefore, GATA1 appears to be expressed exclusively in SynTII population of trophoblasts and likely has important regulatory functions specific to SynTII.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study profiles the development of the mouse placenta by transcriptome capture of nuclei, rather than whole cells, resulting in a high-resolution map of labyrinth differentiation and allowing for the first independent analyses of the two SynT populations. In contrast to previous studies where SynT comprise fewer than 10% of cells identified, almost 30% of trophoblast nuclei captured in this study originate from SynT cells. Profiling four developmental stages from E9.5 to E14.5 allowed for the capture of stem/progenitor and terminally differentiated populations including previously unknown intermediate states and new putative regulators of cell identity. Modeling receptor–ligand interactions predicted how SynTII and endothelial cells coordinate spatial proximity and development through growth factor secretion. In addition, network inference predicted gene regulatory networks defined by TFs and feedback loops among the TFs, including novel candidate regulators of placental development. All together, these data represent a high-resolution map of placental labyrinth development providing insights into the cell autonomous and non-autonomous molecular events underlying the formation and function of this remarkable organ.</p><p>Understanding the development of any tissue begins with the progenitor populations. Previous work uncovered a population of EPCAM and MET expressing progenitors that give rise to the three trophoblast populations of the labyrinth (SynTI, SynTII, and S-TGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). Clustering analysis of the snRNA-seq data separated these cells into two closely related clusters, LaTP and LaTP2. Both expressed <italic>Epcam</italic>, but only LaTP expressed <italic>Met</italic>. The relationship between these populations is unclear. Both LaTP populations had low RNA velocities and there was no coordinated directionality to indicate differentiation from one population to the other. However, the relative positions of the two populations in the developing labyrinth and the earlier presence of EPCAM/MET double positive cells (i.e. at E8.5) suggest that LaTP2 arise from LaTP. Alternatively, the two populations may arise from progenitors that separate earlier in development resulting in distinct lineage biases. LaTP is more similar to SynTII, while LaTP2 is more similar to SynTI and S-TGC. Understanding the specification and heterogeneity of labyrinth progenitors will be an important undertaking given that early defects are likely to have large effects in proportion of terminally differentiated trophoblast resulting in embryonic defects and ultimately reduced viability.</p><p>Tracking differentiation from the LaTP populations identified previously unknown precursor populations along differentiation to SynTI and S-TGC. Profiling differentiation to SynTII confirmed previous work demonstrating the role of Wnt signaling in specification and efficient differentiation of SynTII, both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuura et al., 2011</xref>). However, such detailed information and derivation protocols did not exist for SynTI or S-TGC. SynTI precursor cells strongly upregulated Egf signaling members <italic>Tgfa</italic> and <italic>Eps8</italic>. Additionally, expression of Egf ligands by mature SynTI and <italic>Egfr</italic> by LaTP 2, SynTII, and S-TGC underscore the centrality of Egf signaling to labyrinth development and function. While Egfr loss or mutation in vivo causes labyrinth disorganization, the deciphering of mechanism has been confounded by defects in junctional zone cells and strain-specific variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strunk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dackor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Threadgill, 2009</xref>).

Loss of <italic>Lifr</italic> results in disorganization of the labyrinth and dramatically enlarged non-functional maternal blood sinuses lined by multinuclear aggregates, and not S-TGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ware et al., 1995</xref>). While Lif-Stat3 is also active in the junctional zone, this striking labyrinth phenotype is likely explained by a necessity for Lif signaling in the differentiation, patterning, and/or function of S-TGC. Deciphering how <italic>Lifr</italic> is necessary for S-TGC and the regulation of maternal blood spaces will require genetic manipulation specific to S-TGC. This will be important to understand establishment and maintenance of functional maternal blood spaces which are at the core of common placental diseases like preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and diabetic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ware et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts and Escudero, 2012</xref>).</p><p>This study represents the first independent transcript profiling of each SynT layer in vivo. This was achieved by the isolation of nuclei prior to transcriptome capture. These data demonstrate the utility of snRNA-seq in profiling syncytial placental cells without damaging and lengthy enzymatic digestion or single-cell dissociation. Mouse is the most common model for human placentation, even though the species differ in organ morphology, especially with respect to the gas exchange interface. Human placentas have villi that float in a pool of maternal blood. The villi are covered by a single syncytial layer and have no clear S-TGC equivalent. Comparing the transcript profiles of the interface populations in mouse and human will help to understand how the functions of SynTI, SynTII, and S-TGC are distributed across the fewer trophoblast populations of the human placenta. Such information is also likely to provide important insight into how the different structures arose during evolution and which human developmental processes can be effectively modeled in mouse.</p><p>In our study of the mouse labyrinth, specific marker genes identified in each layer provide insight into the functions of SynTI versus SynTII. Gene Ontology analysis of SynTI indicates enrichment for membrane associated proteins, including numerous transporters, receptors, and GTPase signaling factors. Many of these proteins, like STRA6, are localized to the apical surface where they transduce signals and uptake nutrients from maternal blood. However, SynTII also expressed many classes of solute transporters and signaling receptors, reflecting the export of molecules to the fetal endothelium. SynT layer-specific expression indicates which transporters are likely involved in uptake from maternal blood (SynTI enriched), export to fetal blood (SynTII enriched), or both (SynTI and SynTII enriched). Transcript data represent the first step in understanding the chain of nutrient transport and inform the critical cell type for targeted therapies for nutrient deficiencies.</p><p>Surprisingly, SynTII display unique enrichment for adhesion and junctional proteins, likely necessary to support frequent gap junctions on the border with SynTI and robust attachment to the basal lamina, respectively. Notably, several laminin, integrin, and collagen subunits are highly expressed. Electron microscopy has demonstrated only one basal lamina exists, which is between SynTII and fetal endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coan et al., 2005</xref>). Endothelial cells express a complementary set of extracellular matrix protein subunits (<italic>Col4a1</italic>, <italic>Col5a</italic>2, <italic>Col18a1</italic>), suggesting deposition of this membrane is a coordinated process between these two cell types. Coordinated development between SynTII and the endothelium is also found in a positive feedback loop of necessary growth factors (Wnt and Vegf). These data support an additional role for SynTII as a vascular support cell and likely cell type of origin for many placental vascular abnormalities.</p><p>Recent work identified that a surprising proportion of developmental lethal mouse mutants had unidentified placental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). At least 200 TF defined regulatory networks are active in trophoblast during development. Over 62% of these TFs exhibit developmental lethal phenotypes upon homozygous loss of function but only 8.5% have published placental phenotypes (according to MGI). Candidate regulators were identified in all cell types, including <italic>Zfp110</italic> in LaTP, <italic>Pax2</italic> in SynTI, <italic>Gata1</italic> in SynTII, <italic>Meis1</italic> in S-TGC, and <italic>Etv6</italic> in GCs. For some TFs with strong phenotypes in other organ systems, a methodical analysis of placental morphology may not have been performed or published. For example, <italic>Zfhx3</italic> is predicted to form an autoregulatory loop with <italic>Gcm1</italic> and regulate several genes important to SynTII function. While loss of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> results in developmental lethality and severe growth defects, its role in placental development has not been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>). Several TFs may have not been identified due to overlapping or compensatory roles with other proteins. One such example is <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> and <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>. While highly active in the SynTII, <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> exhibits no placental abnormalities upon knockout. <italic>Tcf7l1</italic>, which is also highly active in LaTP, has demonstrated redundancy with <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> in the skin and it is likely each factor compensates for loss of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). As the knockout of both factors is lethal prior to the genesis of the labyrinth, conditional deletion in only extraembryonic tissues would be required to investigate their function in the placenta. While conditional or temporal control over deletion may be necessary for other factors inducing early lethality (<italic>Klf5</italic>) or confounding defects in other organ systems (<italic>Gata1</italic>), genetic deletions for almost all identified TFs exist and represent a large resource for immediate study of their effects in placental development.</p><p>In summary, this study represents a compendium of mouse placental labyrinth development from E9.5 through E14.5. These data provide a lens through which to better understand congenital defects, environmental and nutrient deficiencies, and species-specific differences in development and function.</p></sec><sec

Each sample was sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 to a depth of approximately 20,000–30,000 reads per nucleus. The gene expression matrices for each dataset was generated using the CellRanger software (v3.0.2 - 10x Genomics). A custom premRNA GTF was generated to create an intron–exon reference according to 10x Genomics recommendations and all reads aligned to mm10 using STAR.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Steve Charnock-Jones as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the use of single nuclei RNA sequencing of the mouse placenta. The authors performed snRNA-seq at four different stages of mouse embryonic development E9.5, E10.5, E12.5 and E14.5 and performed various computational analyses to identify distinct cells types of the developing placenta, especially, the progenitor and differentiated cell types of the placental labyrinth.</p><p>The use of separated nuclei allows analysis of the transcripts in the syncytial layers of the placenta to be analysed for the first time. This is a very significant advance and opens up a new dimension of analysis. The study provides information about possible new transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in placental cell types. The reviewers are therefore enthusiastic about this manuscript. As with other single nuclei or single cell papers this manuscript contains a very large amount of data. The quality and depth of these data will be extremely valuable to those working in the field. However, there are some areas of the manuscript that require revision and/or clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In several places are there are claims that are too bold – they are not fully supported by the data and need to be toned down. For example: subsection “Developmental time course and trajectory inference reveal details of lineage dynamics and commitment” please change &quot;luminogenesis&quot; -&gt;&quot; lumenogenesis in early embryos&quot;. The inference of the role of Podxl is too strong. The lumenogenesis described by Shahbazi et al., is the formation of a lumen in the centre of a rosette of primitive endoderm whereas the lumen of the maternal blood spaces in the labyrinthine layer is formed from the invagination of the fused chorion and allantois by finger-like projections of extra-embryonic mesodermal cells. These processes are quite likely to be regulated differently. Similarly, the inference in subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface” is too strong.</p><p>2) The authors seem to describe LaTP2 cells as &quot;novel intermediate states&quot;. This is a bit of a stretch given the lack of information about the direct lineage relationship between the precursors and the differentiated cell types, or about how LaTP and LaTP2 might be related. In the absence of direct lineage analysis this text needs to be toned down to avoid overstating the findings (but please note the comment below about immunolocalization).</p><p>3) The discovery of LaTP2 cells is potentially very interesting and these cells seem to be largely defined by the absence of Met, Ror2, Lgr5. Can the authors rule out that this subpopulation is standing out simply because of technical dropout of these gene markers? The Uena et al., study showed that c-Met (and its ligand Hgf) sustain the LaTP population. Please comment on whether you think that the LaTP2 cells could be controlled through alternative pathways.</p><p>4) The analyses of hematopoietic cells using GATA4 and cKit is problematic. Multiple previous studies have shown that placental hematopoiesis starts at ~E10.5 as the hematopoietic stem cells emerge at that developmental stage and maximal number of HSCs are detected around E12.5. Thus, it is surprising that so many hematopoietic cells are detected at E9.5 and E10.5 and fewer at E12.5. Please reanalyze the data using additional hematopoietic markers.</p><p>5) The study does not provide information of Parietal giant cells and invasive trophoblast population and also contains incomplete information on other junctional zone cells. There are published reports that Junctional Zone cells, like glycogen cells undergo major changes in gene expression and function after E14.5 leading to the expansion of the junctional zone. (Coan et al., 2006). Also, Figure 3B clearly shows strong presence of junctional zone progenitors at E14.5, indicating incomplete differentiation. Thus, the study is not a complete picture of mouse placental development and authors should be more cautious about this aspect in the description of the title and within the body of the manuscript. Their description should be specific to their study, which is mostly focusing on the placental labyrinth zone involving SynT and S-TGC development and function.</p><p>6) Similarly, the authors need to explicitly comment on the cells that are poorly represented in their analysis. Specifically, the analyses of spongiotrophoblast vs. glycogen cells are also questionable. Ectoplacental cone derived cells expressing genes like Tpbp and Ascl2 are missing. These are well known genes with respect to the development of the spongiotrophoblast and progenitors of the invasive glycogen cells. The authors should include analyses with respect to these genes. In addition, some of their markers are also questionable. For example, Prl8a9 is highly expressed in Glycogen cells (Simmons et al., 2008). Also, authors should include data or comment about specific Glycogen cell markers like Connexin 31, IGF2R.</p><p>7) Subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface” – While you can make the argument this cell layer functions as if it is a maternal endothelium I don't think it is correct to state &quot;it forms a maternal endothelium&quot;. After all it is not composed of endothelial cells and does not have the receptors for the angiogenic growth factors made by SynTI and II as illustrated in Figure 5B. A description of the endothelial like properties of these cells would be warranted – indeed desirable. For example, do they have (nor not have) RNAs encoding anti- and adhesive surface markers (ICAM for example).</p><p>8) The section describing the likely functional differences in the trophoblast layers in the labyrinth requires additional detail and clarification (subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface” and Figure 4). There seem to be three groups of &quot;differentially expressed&quot; genes – one for each of the trophoblast types (S-TGCs, SynTI and SynTII). It is not clear from the methods whether this is from all cells (albeit down-sampled) at all time points. I assume that as the FindMarkers function was used then the comparison is the group of interests (S-TGCs for example) vs all other groups. It would be helpful to have this detail clarified. Also, the authors should comment on why there appear not to be any genes that are lower in any group (so were only positive markers selected?) and what criteria were used to define a &quot;differentially expressed&quot; gene. In Supplementary file 14 there are apparently significantly regulated transcripts with a fold change of ~1.2 so are the differently expressed genes defined solely by the Padj? – but there is clearly some additional filtering (as shown in Figure 4C-E). Were all genes listed in Supplementary file 14 used for the ontogeny analysis? – the numbers of genes listed would suggest not (Supplementary file 14, 2104 genes; Supplementary file 15 686+483+842=1910). I presume not all the genes map to GO terms but the methods for the GO analysis are not described so it is not possible to know this.</p><p>9) The GO analysis yields a very large number of significant terms with the top 5 clusters for each cell type presented in Figure 4C-E. The rationale for choosing the &quot;top 5&quot; is not clear – especially as clusters (ie GO terms) are hierarchically related. This is exemplified in 4D where cluster D (GO:0072659) is actually a child of term B (GO:1990778). Finally, the large number of terms reported is hard to understand as they are from different levels in the GO term hierarchy and report the same pathway (eg hippo signalling and regulation of hippo signalling).</p><p>10) There is very little said about the possible function and development of the S-TGCs. These cells (as their name implies) have previously been described as being similar to giant cells. The UMAP shown in Figure 2A suggests they arise from a population of cells related to the junctional zone precursors. Indeed, this would fit with the prolactin expression profiles (see Simmons et al., 2008). Notably, the prolactins, which are present in the S-TGCs are not in found in the labyrinthine syncytial cells but in EPC derived cells lineage. This requires some discussion.</p><p>11) The analysis of likely ligand – receptor interactions, and the transcription factor regulons, raise interesting new leads, but very few are validated.</p><p>12) As authors are proposing presence of a new progenitor population, it is important to provide more information about the origin, timing of emergence as well as spatial distribution of the two LaTP progenitor lineages. These aspects need more analyses, especially at an earlier developmental time point (E7.5-E9). As the authors have identified probable unique marker genes, they should include additional studies with placental sections during early time points (E7.5-E9) to better characterize the two LaTP populations.</p><p>To address these concerns (11-12), we request some additional immunolocalization studies be added. Of particular interest are transcription factors and markers that differentiate between the LaTP and LaTP2 lineages. We appreciate this this work will be constrained by the availability of suitable antibodies.</p><p>13) The two syncytial layers for a continuous barrier between the maternal and fetal compartments. Nutrient, gas and waste products have to cross or be transported across this barrier – ie they need to cross both layers. The section describing this (subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface”) does not address this. Indeed, the analytical approach seems flawed – by focusing on the genes that are &quot;enriched&quot; in one layer, overlooks that fact that a transport network may exist across both layers. Of course, it is quite possible that one mechanism may be used to transport something across one layer and a different mechanism operate for the other layer, nonetheless the nutrients needs to traverse both layers. Describing the transporter RNAs that are present in both SynT layers is essential. This is an opportunity that has been missed as this study has the resolution to evaluate this for the first time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60266.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the use of single nuclei RNA sequencing of the mouse placenta.

This is a bit of a stretch given the lack of information about the direct lineage relationship between the precursors and the differentiated cell types, or about how LaTP and LaTP2 might be related. In the absence of direct lineage analysis this text needs to be toned down to avoid overstating the findings (but please note the comment below about immunolocalization).</p></disp-quote><p>“Novel intermediate States” is meant to reflect the SynTI Precursor, SynTII Precursor, and S-TGC Precursor populations, which have distinct gene expression from both progenitors and their respective differentiated states. The text has been modified to reflect this. In concert with Essential revision point 12, we have provided additional evidence for gene expression differences between LaTP and LaTP2. Between the LaTP populations, we identify Met as largely restricted to LaTP and Egfr largely restricted to LaTP2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We colocalize each protein with EPCAM, an established marker of LaTP (previously described in Ueno et al., 2013) which through sparse clonal labeling has been shown to give rise to SynTI, SynTII, and S-TGC. We identify at E9.5 that MET and EPCAM have matching domains of expression, while EGFR and EPCAM are largely non-overlapping, although rare double positive cells do exist (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Similar to mRNA, EGFR and MET protein appear to be mutually exclusive. The MET/EPCAM positive cells appear more basally localized than EGFR positive cells suggestive that the former gives rise to the later. The new analysis and immunofluorescence data have been added to the supplementary figures and the text has been changed to reflect these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discovery of LaTP2 cells is potentially very interesting and these cells seem to be largely defined by the absence of Met, Ror2, Lgr5.

The Uena et al., study showed that c-Met (and its ligand Hgf) sustain the LaTP population. Please comment on whether you think that the LaTP2 cells could be controlled through alternative pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C and Figure 2- 1A demonstrate that LaTP and LaTP2 do not differ drastically in the number of unique genes identified, the number of total transcripts identified, or the percent of mitochondrial reads. Thus, we believe the differences in these populations is not due to technical dropout or low information cell driving the clustering. We have identified Egfr as a strong marker of the LaTP2 population (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D). We also confirm strong MET protein expression in the LaTP population. Because LaTP2 do not express Met or Wnt receptors, Ror2 and Lgr5, it is unlikely this population is sustained by HGF-MET or Wnt signaling. However, given the expression of Egfr (both transcript and protein) in LaTP2 and the expression of Egf ligands, Tgfa and Hbegf, by SynTI we hypothesize that Egf signaling is important for control of LaTP2. The text and figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-E) have been updated to include these new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The analyses of hematopoietic cells using GATA4 and cKit is problematic. Multiple previous studies have shown that placental hematopoiesis starts at ~E10.5 as the hematopoietic stem cells emerge at that developmental stage and maximal number of HSCs are detected around E12.5. Thus, it is surprising that so many hematopoietic cells are detected at E9.5 and E10.5 and fewer at E12.5. Please reanalyze the data using additional hematopoietic markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We included clusters 15 and 19 in the Fetal Mesenchyme group due to their mesenchymal features, but did note these cell expressed some HSC markers but lacked other important markers. We analyzed the gene expression in these clusters according to markers found in McKinney-Freeman et al., 2013. No cluster identified in our data matches with HSCs, although other hematopoietic lineages express some of these markers. Recent, single cell sequencing data in the mouse identified HSCs to be only 0.05% of total cells. By these numbers we would only expect 13 HSC nuclei in our data. Likely, the lack of HSCs in our data is due to the rarity of this population.</p><p>We have edited the text to clarify the annotation of these cells in mesenchyme (not trophoblast and not HSC). Additionally, we performed immunofluorescence staining for another shared marker of clusters 15 and 19, PDPN. This shows expression in interstitial cells with long processes which seem to make contact with fetal endothelial cells. These data are now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and mentioned in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The study does not provide information of Parietal giant cells and invasive trophoblast population and also contains incomplete information on other junctional zone cells.

In our data Pcdh12 is expressed in increasing levels from JZP1 to JZP2 to differentiated glycogen cells. We thank the reviewers for suggesting Simmons et al., BMC Genomics 2008 as a resource for determining Glycogen Cell vs. Spongiotrophoblast specific expression of prolactin genes. We analyzed the expression of the prolactin genes highlighted in this paper in our dataset. This data is now included in Figure 2-figure supplement 3A and B, alongside the expression of Pcdh12 and the other markers suggested by the reviewers (Tpbpa, Ascl2, Connexin31/Gjb3, and Igf2r). Our data is largely in agreement with the in situ hybridization data from Simmons et al. 2008, and this is summarized in Figure 2-figeru supplement3. While it is clear that there are several common markers of the SpT and Glycogen trophoblast and that prolactin expression in the placenta is quite complex, we feel the annotation we have provided are the best possible considering the current understanding of the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface”- While you can make the argument this cell layer functions as if it is a maternal endothelium I don't think it is correct to state &quot;it forms a maternal endothelium&quot;.

Were all genes listed in Supplementary file 14 used for the ontogeny analysis? – the numbers of genes listed would suggest not (Supplementary file 14, 2104 genes; Supplementary file 15 686+483+842=1910). I presume not all the genes map to GO terms but the methods for the GO analysis are not described so it is not possible to know this.</p></disp-quote><p>For these analyses the cells in the SynTI, SynTII, and S-TGC clusters were subset from the trophoblast dataset containing all timepoints. FindAllMarkers was used to identify positive differentially expressed genes among these three populations (one population against the other two, for each population). Differentially expressed genes are determined using a Wilcoxon rank sum test considering genes expressed in at least 25% of cells in a cluster and those with log fold change of 0.25 or greater.</p><p>All markers were included in the GO analysis using the package clusterProfiler. The list of genes was first converted to Entrez IDs. In each cluster approximately 1% of genes did not match to Entrez IDs (SynTI – 7/715; SynTII – 8/507; S-TGC – 12/882). Transcripts that did not match represent non-coding RNAs and predicted genes. Those genes with Entrez IDs were then subject to GO analysis and for each cluster with 95-96% of genes mapping to at least one GO categories (SynTI – 686/708; SynTII – 482/499; S-TGC – 842/870). Therefore, the analysis considers 2010 out of a possible 2104 marker genes (95.5%). The methods have been updated with a thorough description of the GO analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The GO analysis yields a very large number of significant terms with the top 5 clusters for each cell type presented in Figure 4C-E. The rationale for choosing the &quot;top 5&quot; is not clear – especially as clusters (ie GO terms) are hierarchically related. This is exemplified in 4D where cluster D (GO:0072659) is actually a child of term B (GO:1990778). Finally, the large number of terms reported is hard to understand as they are from different levels in the GO term hierarchy and report the same pathway (eg hippo signalling and regulation of hippo signalling).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the redundancy. We have repeated this analysis, this time using a cutoff to consolidate hierarchically related terms with greater similarity than 0.5. We still show the top 5 GO terms ranked by adjusted p-value for clarity of presentation. However, the top 10 GO terms are included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and all significantly enriched GO terms are included in Supplementary Table 15. If reviewers are aware of alternative means/packages for consolidating related terms, we would be happy to apply them. For now, we present our latest analysis in Figure 4C-E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A have updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) There is very little said about the possible function and development of the S-TGCs. These cells (as their name implies) have previously been described as being similar to giant cells. The UMAP shown in Figure 2A suggests they arise from a population of cells related to the junctional zone precursors. Indeed, this would fit with the prolactin expression profiles (see Simmons et al., 2008). Notably, the prolactins, which are present in the S-TGCs are not in found in the labyrinthine syncytial cells but in EPC derived cells lineage. This requires some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s raise an interesting point concerning the origin of S-TGCs. Simmons et al., 2007 and Simmons et al., 2011 provide evidence for these cells arising from either ectoplacental cone or chorion trophoblast. Ueno et al. 2013 demonstrate S-TGC can arise from Epcam<sup>hi</sup> LaTP (a chorionic population). Our data place the S-TGC as sprouting from between the LaTP and JZP populations. Unfortunately, this does not conclusively provide an answer to the origin of S-TGC, but supports idea that this population may arise from multiple locations. Additional discussion of the genesis has been included in the text describing Figure 2, and additional discussion of function has been added to the discussion of Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The analysis of likely ligand – receptor interactions, and the transcription factor regulons, raise interesting new leads, but very few are validated.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the validation of VEGFA protein expression in SynTII cells (Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A), we also validated the expression of HBEGF in SynTI through colocalization with SynTI marker STRA6 (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). We further confirm Egf signaling between SynTI and SynTII and colocalized the ligand HBEGF and the receptor EGFR. These experiments reveal only HBEGF protein in SynTI but co-expression of HBEGF and EGFR in SynTII, suggesting functional signaling in this layer (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>To validate the expression of a SCENIC predicted TF regulon, we selected GATA1. Staining for GATA1 revealed expression in trophoblast to be restricted to SynTII, although GATA1 is strongly expressed by several hematopoietic lineages in the fetal vessels (Figure 6F and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). Colocalization of GATA1 with SynTII marker IGF1R demonstrates GATA1 positive nuclei abutting the basal membrane of SynTII marked by IGF1R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) As authors are proposing presence of a new progenitor population, it is important to provide more information about the origin, timing of emergence as well as spatial distribution of the two LaTP progenitor lineages. These aspects need more analyses, especially at an earlier developmental time point (E7.5-E9). As the authors have identified probable unique marker genes, they should include additional studies with placental sections during early time points (E7.5-E9) to better characterize the two LaTP populations.</p><p>To address these concerns (11-12), we request some additional immunolocalization studies be added. Of particular interest are transcription factors and markers that differentiate between the LaTP and LaTP2 lineages. We appreciate this this work will be constrained by the availability of suitable antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise important points concerning the emergence and location of the two LaTP populations. To address this question, we have now done additional immunostaining as described above. To recap: first, we identify Met as a specific marker of LaTP, and Egfr as a highly enriched marker in LaTP2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C). We then colocalized each of these proteins with EPCAM, the canonical LaTP marker identified by Ueno et al., 2013 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). At E9.5 EPCAM and MET have overlapping domains of expression. This is in agreement with the transcript data and suggests that the LaTP cluster is the LaTP population as defined by Ueno et al., 2013. In contrast, only the rare EGFR+ cell showed coexpression with EPCAM protein (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Interestingly the EGFR+ cells were juxtaposed to the MET+ and positioned as such to suggest that the later may be giving rise to the former.</p><p>In addition to the staining at E9.5, we also added staining at E8.5 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). This timepoint is coincident with chorioallantoic fusion. We found many EPCAM/MET positive cells in the chorion, but few to no EGFR expressing cells. These data would be consistent with interpretation that EPCAM/MET precede and may even give rise to the EGFR+ LaTP2 cells. Along with figures noted above, we have added text to discuss these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The two syncytial layers for a continuous barrier between the maternal and fetal compartments. Nutrient, gas and waste products have to cross or be transported across this barrier – ie they need to cross both layers. The section describing this (subsection “Defining distinct roles of the trophoblast subtypes at the gas exchange interface”) does not address this. Indeed, the analytical approach seems flawed – by focusing on the genes that are &quot;enriched&quot; in one layer, overlooks that fact that a transport network may exist across both layers. Of course, it is quite possible that one mechanism may be used to transport something across one layer and a different mechanism operate for the other layer, nonetheless the nutrients needs to traverse both layers. Describing the transporter RNAs that are present in both SynT layers is essential. This is an opportunity that has been missed as this study has the resolution to evaluate this for the first time.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity concerning this analysis. The analysis of transport genes includes all genes found to differentially expressed in any of the interface populations (SynTI, SynTII, and/or S-TGC) compared to all other trophoblast populations. However, since this is distinct from the differentiation expression shown in Figure 4B and used in the GO analysis in Figure 4C-E. The text has been changed to explicitly state which genes were analyzed. This information is also included in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
