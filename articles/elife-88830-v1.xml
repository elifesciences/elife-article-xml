However, the life cycle of cancer cells as they respond to and survive environmental and therapeutic stress is understudied. In this study, we utilized a microfluidic device to induce the development of doxorubicin-resistant (DOXR) cells from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells within 11 days by generating gradients of DOX and medium. In vivo chemoresistant xenograft models, an unbiased genome-wide transcriptome analysis, and a patient data/tissue analysis all showed that chemoresistance arose from failed epigenetic control of the nuclear protein-1 (NUPR1)/histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) axis, and high <italic>NUPR1</italic> expression correlated with poor clinical outcomes. These results suggest that the chip can rapidly induce resistant cells that increase tumor heterogeneity and chemoresistance, highlighting the need for further studies on the epigenetic control of the NUPR1/HDAC11 axis in TNBC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microfluidic chip</kwd><kwd>triple negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>polyaneuploid cancer cells</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd><kwd>nuclear protein 1</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase 11</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020206</institution-id><institution>Korea Dementia Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HU21C0157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Jee-Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003052</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20008413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sungsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003661</institution-id><institution>Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P0008746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Wanyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A microfluidic device induces doxorubicin-resistant polyaneuploid cancer cells from triple negative breast cancer cells, revealing NUPR1/HDAC11 axis dysfunction drives chemoresistance, increasing tumor heterogeneity and impacting clinical outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A leading cause of cancer-related death is drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jazaeri et al., 2005</xref>), which is increased by tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heppner and Miller, 1983</xref>). Microfluidic chips are highly useful for studying drug resistance because they can manipulate and control fluids and particles at the micron level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, a microfluidic platform consisting of an array of connected microchambers with concentration gradients has been developed to induce drug resistance in various types of cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>), and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). In previous studies, we identified the molecular mechanisms involved in doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in GBM and TNBC by analyzing mutation and expression data from chemoresistant cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, Lin et al. used a microfluidic chip that generates a docetaxel gradient to induce resistant cells from PC-3 prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms by which cells acquire chemoresistance and whether cells obtained from a chip resemble those found in patient tissues remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we utilized the Cancer Drug Resistance Accelerator (CDRA) chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>) to generate gradients of DOX and medium to induce DOX-resistant (DOXR) cells from MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells within 11 days. Interestingly, a subpopulation of very large cells, referred to as L-DOXR cells, emerged within the DOXR cell population in the CDRA chip on day 11. These L-DOXR cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and maintained their survival off the chip. To better understand the role of L-DOXR cells in chemoresistance in TNBC, we conducted in vivo chemoresistant xenograft models, an unbiased genome-wide transcriptome analysis, and a patient data/tissue analysis. Our results demonstrate that the chemoresistance of L-DOXR cells is attributed to failed epigenetic control of nuclear protein-1 (NUPR1)/histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) axis, which can be alleviated through <italic>NUPR1</italic> inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and analysis workflow.</title><p>Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells were subjected to doxorubicin (DOX) and nutrient gradients to induce DOX-resistant TNBC cells in a Cancer Drug Resistance Accelerator (CDRA) chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Large DOX-resistant (L-DOXR) cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and their transcriptome was analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The oncogenic properties of L-DOXR cells were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to better understand their effect on cancer progression. Additionally, the proportion of L-DOXR cells in TNBC patient tissues was positively associated with TNBC tumor grade. The roles of histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) and nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) in DOX-resistance were investigated through molecular analysis and survival analysis of patients with high/low NUPR1 expression.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88830-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>NUPR1, which is also known as Com-1 or p8, is involved in multiple aspects of cancer, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and the cell cycle, and its expression responds to stress signals induced by genotoxic signals and agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2021</xref>).

In breast cancer cells, NUPR1 upregulates p21 transcription, allowing breast cancer cells to progress through the cell cycle, and it confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol and DOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vincent et al., 2012</xref>).

However, HDAC11 expression is negatively correlated with high-risk uveal melanomas and gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dali-Youcef et al., 2015</xref>), and HDAC11 knockout mice demonstrate increased tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that its regulation of different cancer types is complex.

However, in contrast to L-DOXR cells, mRNA level of <italic>NUPR1</italic> was barely detectable in the WT cells and WT cell-derived tumor tissues. While DOXR cells exhibited a marked increase in <italic>NUPR1</italic> expression compared to the WT cells, this expression was substantially less than that observed in L-DOXR cells, as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Furthermore, transactivation activity of the <italic>NUPR1</italic> promoter was highly elevated in L-DOXR cells but not in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>NUPR1</italic> expression is highly enhanced in L-DOXR cells.

These results suggest that <italic>NUPR1</italic> upregulation may be a major driver of chemoresistance in L-DOXR cells.</p><p>To define the potential role of NUPR1 in mediating chemoresistance in TNBC, we treated WT cells and L-DOXR cells with ZZW-115, a NUPR1 inhibitor that alters its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2020</xref>), in the absence or presence of DOX. ZZW-115 treatment led to re-sensitization of L-DOXR cells to DOX in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the WT cells barely responded to ZZW-115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Delocalization of NUPR1 and increased cell death caused by ZZW-115 were confirmed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and active CASPASE-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). To further verify whether NUPR1 inhibition could overcome DOX resistance and enhance drug response in L-DOXR cells, we treated xenograft model mice with DOX and two doses of ZZW-115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–P</xref>). The addition of ZZW-115 to DOX in the xenograft models resulted in a reduction of tumor volume compared to DOX-only-treated tumors (–469.5 ± 25.20 mm<sup>3</sup> [2.5 mg/kg] and –627.2±15.36 [5.0 mg/kg]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M-O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and induced significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>).

Because epigenetic alterations affect gene expression and are usually associated with cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter et al., 2014</xref>), we first examined the DNA methylation status of the <italic>NUPR1</italic> promoter region. However, we did not find any remarkable changes in promoter methylation between WT cells L-DOXR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR using the histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27)-acetylation antibody revealed H3K27 acetylation in L-DOXR cells, specifically in promoter region 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Spurred by our finding of enriched acetylation in L-DOXR cells, we attempted to identify a putative epigenetic regulator, such as a histone acetyltransferase or HDAC, that could be involved in the increased acetylation of <italic>NUPR1</italic>. An RNA-seq analysis of HATs and HDACs in WT cells and L-DOXR cells showed almost no detectable mRNA expression of <italic>HDAC11</italic> in L-DOXR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which we confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). <italic>HDAC11</italic> expression was also dramatically reduced in tumors from L-DOXR cell-derived xenografts compared with tumors derived from WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, the protein expression of NUPR1 and HDAC11 was inversely correlated in L-DOXR cells and WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), suggesting that low levels of HDAC11 in L-DOXR cells might contribute to the upregulation of <italic>NUPR1</italic> through enriched acetylation in its promoter region. Indeed, forced expression of HDAC11 elicited a dramatic reduction in H3K27 acetylation in the L-DOXR cells promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which reduced the mRNA expression of <italic>NUPR1</italic> in a dose-dependent manner not seen in the parental WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and also greatly impaired the promoter activity in the L-DOXR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Moreover, HDAC11 inhibitor treatment in WT cells augmented the expression of <italic>NUPR1</italic>, presumably, reflecting the reverting of promoter acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that HDAC11 mediates <italic>NUPR1</italic> promoter deacetylation, underscoring that the suppressed expression of HDAC11 in L-DOXR cells allows <italic>NUPR1</italic> to escape deacetylation and thereby causes its aberrant high expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HDAC11 suppression leads to <italic>NUPR1</italic> upregulation in L-DOXR cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the promoter region of <italic>NUPR1</italic>.

Thus, these data emphasize that <italic>NUPR1</italic> is inversely correlated with <italic>HDAC11</italic> level in TNBC patients, and that the epigenetic dysregulation of <italic>NUPR1</italic> caused by low HDAC11 level may cause the chemoresistance that dictates the development of L-DOXR cells in TNBC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment. However, chemoresistance is common and contributes to the long-term survival of TNBC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liedtke et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we obtained DOX-resistant cells that exhibit an enlarged phenotype with increased genomic content. We also identified a mechanism for that drug resistance through epigenetic control of the NUPR1/HDAC11 axis in TNBC. L-DOXR cells and L-DOXR cell-derived tumor tissues showed high-level expression of <italic>NUPR1</italic>, which was consistent with the poor clinical outcomes, including low overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients with high <italic>NUPR1</italic>. Our findings demonstrated that <italic>NUPR1</italic> expression in L-DOXR cells is induced by acetylation of the <italic>NUPR1</italic> promoter through the aberrantly restricted expression of HDAC11. The identification of <italic>NUPR1</italic> as a novel epigenetic target of HDAC11 in L-DOXR cells helps to explain how L-DOXR cells acquire chemoresistance. HDAC11 is the most recently discovered HDAC, and its pathophysiological role is poorly understood. For example, HDAC11 has a positive correlation with tumor growth, but its incongruously high expression also conferred longer DFS and OS in pancreatic tumor patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klieser et al., 2017</xref>). HDAC11 is overexpressed in certain cancer cell lines, including prostatic (PC-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huo et al., 2020</xref>), ovarian (SK-OV-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), and breast cancer (MCF-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2002</xref>) cells, and HDAC11 inhibition has shown beneficial effects in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thole et al., 2017</xref>) and Hodgkin lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buglio et al., 2011</xref>). However, HDAC11 expression is inversely correlated with high-risk uveal melanomas and gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dali-Youcef et al., 2015</xref>), and HDAC11 knockout mice have increased lymphoma tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sahakian et al., 2015</xref>). HDAC11 inhibition promotes breast cancer cell metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leslie et al., 2019</xref>). In basal-like breast cancer cells with decreased HDAC11 expression, overexpression of HDAC11 did not inhibit tumor growth but did inhibit invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denkert et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the Cancer Genome Atlas shows that <italic>HDAC</italic>11 promoter methylation is associated with a poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting the need for in-depth studies of the specific mechanisms of HDAC11 in specific tumors. In this study, we observed extremely low HDAC11 expression in L-DOXR cells compared with WT cells, and we confirmed that its expression is much lower in patients with high-grade TNBC tumors than in those with low-grade tumors. We also found a positive correlation between its expression and disease-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Because we identified that NUPR1 as a novel target of HDAC11, and drastically decreasing the expression of HDAC11 causes aberrantly high expression of NUPR1 in L-DOXR cells and TNBC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), it is plausible that limited expression of HDAC11 leads to a high NUPR1 level to acquire chemoresistance. It is also possible that HDAC11 expression may be suppressed in chemoresistant TNBC cells by a specific regulator that requires further elucidation.</p><p>In breast cancer, aberrations in histone modification such as acetylation have been shown to be important for tumor progression and have been proposed as a promising therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). HDACs have been an attractive therapeutic strategy for restoring both acetylation and gene expression, with the potential benefit of being better tolerated than cytotoxic chemotherapy. Epigenetic modulation has also been hypothesized as a mechanism of chemoresistance. In this study, we showed that NUPR1 overexpression upon acquisition of DOX resistance leads to upregulation of cancer-promoting signaling. Moreover, we demonstrated that NUPR1 inhibition with ZZW-115 reconstitutes the drug sensitivity of L-DOXR cells and HDAC11 overexpression inhibited <italic>NUPR1</italic> expression by eliciting deacetylation of the <italic>NUPR1</italic> promoter region in L-DOXR cells. Thus, despite the promising anti-tumor effects of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in preclinical models, our results suggest the importance of evaluating HDACi as therapeutic candidates in the context of drug-resistance in TNBC.</p><p>The L-DOXR cells observed in our study resemble the previously reported polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>).

Cells in the PACC state demonstrate plasticity and have the capacity to further divide and produce progeny, contributing to an increase in tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niu et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanism by which the PACC state confers drug resistance is unknown.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that clinically meaningful resistant cells can be obtained within a few weeks using the CDRA chip to mimic the spatiotemporally heterogeneous ecosystem of cancer cells in the tumor tissues of patients receiving chemotherapy. Although large cells with high genomic content are often found in cancer patient tissues, their isolation is technically difficult, which is an obstacle to studying how they contribute to chemoresistance in cancer patients. Therefore, our methodology, examining the expression of genes involved in the chemoresistance of chip-derived large cells and comparing those results with gene expression data from patient tissues in which cells with high genomic content are found, opens a new avenue for understanding the mechanism of chemoresistance. Because the chip requires approximately 15,000 cells each, it can be also used to predict resistance in patients prior to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garraway and Jänne, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fabrication of the CDRA chip</title><p>The CDRA chip was fabricated using soft lithography, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2019</xref>).

They use a new multifluidic cell culture chamber to grow MB-231 TNBC cells in the presence of doxorubicin and identify a cell population of large, resistant MB-231 cells they term L-DOXR cells. These cells maintain resistance when grown as a xenograft model, and patient tissues also display evidence for having cells with large nuclei and extra genomic content. RNA-seq analysis comparing L-DOXR cells to WT MB-231 cells revealed upregulation of NUPR1. Inhibition or knockdown of NUPR1 resulted in increased sensitivity to doxorubicin. NUPR1 expression was determined to be regulated via HDAC11 via promoter acetylation. The data presented could be used as a platform to understand resistance mechanisms to a variety of cancer therapeutics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88830.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors induced large doxorubicin-resistant (L-DOXR) cells by generating DOX gradients using their Cancer Drug Resistance Accelerator (CDRA) chip.

Given their enlarged morphology and polyploidy, they termed these cells as Large-DOXR (L-DORX). Through comparative functional omics, they deduce the NUPR1/HDAC11 axis to be essential in imparting doxorubicin resistance and, consequently, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the NUPR1 to restore sensitivity to the drug.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study focuses on a major clinical problem of the eventual onset of resistance to chemotherapeutics in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They use an innovative chip-based platform to establish as well as molecularly characterize TNBC cells showing resistance to doxorubicin and uncover NUPR1 as a novel targetable driver of the resistant phenotype.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Critical weaknesses are the use of a single cell line model (i.e., MDA-MB-231) for all the phenotypic and functional experiments and absolutely no mechanistic insights into how NUPR1 functionally imparts resistance to doxorubicin. It is imperative that the authors demonstrate the broader relevance of NUPR1 in driving dox resistance using independent disease models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment #1. Standard practice would include multiple TNBC cell lines to test the author's hypotheses, but the authors rely only on one cell line in the entire paper, MDA-MB-231 cells. The authors do correlate their findings to patient data, but the inclusion of an additional TNBC cell line would strengthen their findings about the L-DOXR cells and help with the assessment as to how reproducible their original microfluidics system is.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable feedback. We recognize the importance of utilizing multiple TNBC cell lines for rigorous validation and reproducibility. There are several reports highlighting the generation of L-DOXR cells in other types of breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7 (Fei et al., 2015), and in other cancer types like the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. These studies utilized a microfluidic device with a concentration gradient of Doxorubicin. With this existing evidence, we are confident that a variety of cancer cell types have the potential to form L-DOXR cells in a doxorubicin gradient. The cited reports support our choice of the MDA-MB-231 cell line for our current study:</p><p>“L-DOXR cells exhibit increased genomic content (4N+) as compared to WT cells. The presence of cells with increased nuclear size and increased genomic content has been demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in several types of cancers (Alharbi et al., 2018; Amend et al., 2019; Fei et al., 2015; Imai et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2014; Mukherjee et al., 2022; O’connor et al., 2002; Saini et al., 2022; Trabzonlu et al., 2023). (Page 5, Line 24)”</p><p>However, we acknowledge the validity of your point regarding the strengthening of our findings with the inclusion of additional TNBC cell lines. We are considering expanding our research in future studies to further validate our findings across multiple TNBC cell lines.Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we hope our response adequately addresses your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2. It would be helpful to comment on the frequency at which doxorubicin is used clinically to treat TNBC patients. The authors equate their resistance phenotype to all chemotherapies (in patient data and title) but only test doxorubicin. Does NUPR1 overexpression result in resistance to other chemotherapies?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for raising these pertinent questions. To address your first point regarding the clinical use of doxorubicin for TNBC patients: At the Samsung Medical Center, the typical chemotherapy regimen for TNBC patients involves administering Neo. AC (Doxorubicin 34 mg + Cyclophosphamide 840 mg per session) four times, followed by Adj. D (Docetaxel 25 mg + 80 mg per session) for another four sessions. This provides insight into the clinical relevance and frequency of Doxorubicin's use in treating TNBC.</p><p>Regarding your second point about NUPR1 overexpression and its broader implications for chemotherapy resistance: Yes, NUPR1 overexpression has been documented to result in resistance to various chemotherapies. A study by Lei Jiang et al. in the Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology found that NUPR1 plays a role in YAP-mediated gastric cancer malignancy and drug resistance through the activation of AKT and p21 (Jiang et al., 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jpp/rgab010">https://doi.org/10.1093/jpp/rgab010</ext-link>). Additionally, another study by Wang et al. in Cell Death and Disease observed that the transcriptional coregulator NUPR1 is linked to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells (Wang et al., 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03442-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03442-z</ext-link>). In light of this, while our study primarily focused on doxorubicin, the role of NUPR1 in resistance spans across various chemotherapeutic agents, adding depth to our findings and their broader implications in cancer therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #3. The authors knockdown NUPR1 in L-DOXR cells, but overexpression of NUPR1 in WT TNBC cells to see if this renders the WT cells more resistant would be an important experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion, which indeed underscores an important aspect of our study. In response, we have incorporated additional experiments in the revised manuscript. Specifically, on page 7 (lines 7-8) and in Supplement Figure 2c, we present data from experiments where we overexpressed Nupr1 in WT-MDA-MB231 cells. Our findings revealed that overexpression of GST-Nupr1 not only attenuates Dox-induced cell death but also mildly enhances cell viability in WT cells even without DOX treatment. This implies that cells expressing Nupr1 exhibit resistance to the cytotoxic effects of DOX. We believe these new data further solidify our conclusions and address the valuable point you raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #4. The similar colors/symbols chosen for the different groups in the xenograft plots are hard to easily interpret without zooming in.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We modified the xenograft plots as you recommended in Figure 3F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #5. There are some grammatical errors throughout the paper. Below is an example: In the opening of the Discussion &quot;TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment. However, chemoresistance is common and contributes to the long-term survival of TNBC patients&quot; - this sentence makes it seem like chemoresistance makes TNBC patients survive longer. The following sentence &quot;These cells demonstrated a large phenotype with increased genomic content.&quot; is abrupt and doesn't make sense. Consider carefully re-reading the manuscript for grammatical errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for highlighting the grammatical errors and providing specific</p><p>examples. We deeply apologize for the oversight. In response to your feedback, we'vecarefully re-reviewed the manuscript and made the necessary corrections. Based on your example: We've revised the sentences to: “TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, with chemotherapy being a mainstay of treatment. However, the development of chemoresistance frequently occurs and poses significant challenges to the long-term survival prospects of TNBC patients.” “As for the cells in question, they exhibited an enlarged phenotype along with an increased genomic content.”</p><p>We appreciate your meticulous review, and we have made an effort to address and rectify other such errors throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>I recommend the authors to address the following minor issues. Below are specific comments on the manuscript.</p><p>Comments # 1. Thank you for the comment. In CDRA chip, DOXR cells and L-DOXR cells appeared in the mid-DOX region. What is the concentration of DOX in this region? Can the authors calculate the concentrations of DOX in high-, mid-, and low- regions (or ranges of concentrations)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Instead of DOX, we used FITC dye to visualize the concentration gradient overthe chip as below because DOX generate very low fluorescent light.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88830-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While our method provides an estimation rather than precise measurement due to the difference in molecular weight between FITC (389.38 g/mol) and DOX (579.98 g/mol), it is still possible to approximate the distribution of DOX concentrations across different regions. We utilize a formula where the ratio of the average fluorescence intensity of FITC for each specific region to the highest recorded fluorescence intensity is multiplied by the peak DOX concentration (1.5 μM). This approach gives us an estimated average concentration of DOX in each region, acknowledging that the diffusion characteristics of FITC and DOX may vary due to their differences in molecular weight. The following formula.</p><p>With this formula we can calculate the concentration in each region. High region = 1.161 μM; Mid region = 0.554 μM; Low region = 0.098 μM</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2. Is there any other phenotypic difference between DOXR cells and L-DOXR cells besides their size?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: &quot;In addition to differences in cell size, L-DOXR cells exhibit several distinctphenotypic characteristics when compared to DOXR cells. These include variations in thecell cycle profile (as detailed in Fig. 2F-H), altered drug efflux capabilities (presented in Fig.2I-J), and changes in nuclear morphology (illustrated in Fig. S3D). These phenotypicdistinctions suggest that L-DOXR cells may have adapted unique mechanisms of resistanceand survival, which are comprehensively depicted in the figures mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #3. Please add a description of abbreviations when the abbreviation is first used in the manuscript (e.g. NUPR1, HDAC11 etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We corrected the mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment # 4. Figure 2B is the schematic of the chip, not the dimension of the chip. Please add the dimension of the chip to keep the figure caption as is or change the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the correction. We change the figure caption as Schematic of the chip.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Lim and colleagues use an innovative CDRA chip platform to derive and mechanistically elucidate the molecular wiring of doxorubicin-resistant (DOXR) MDA-MB-231 cells. Given their enlarged morphology and polyploidy, they termed these cells as Large-DOXR (L-DORX). Through comparative functional omics, they deduce the NUPR1/HDAC11 axis to be essential in imparting doxorubicin resistance and, consequently, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the NUPR1 to restore sensitivity to the drug. Although innovative, some deficiencies in the present manuscript slightly weaken the primary conclusions. A couple of critical issues are the use of a single cell line model (i.e., MDA-MB-231) for all the phenotypic and functional experiments and absolutely no mechanistic insights into how NUPR1 imparts resistance to doxorubicin. Some questions and comments are listed below for the authors' consideration and response:</p><p>Major:</p><p>Comment #1. The authors treated only the MDA-MB-231 cells with doxorubicin in the CDRA chip. Do other TNBC cell lines (namely, MDA-MB-436, HCC1187, or others) respond similarly to dox treatment, eventually yielding enlarged, aneuploid cells with the resistant phenotype? It is important to show that this phenotype is not confined to a single cell line, particularly given the numerous TNBC models that are commonly used.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your insightful query regarding the generalizability of our findings across different TNBC cell lines. In this initial study, we focused exclusively on MDA-MB-231 cells due to their widespread use as a model for aggressive triple-negative breast cancer and the constraints of time and resources. While we cannot definitively claim that the observed phenotypic changes upon doxorubicin treatment will be identical in other TNBC cell lines such as MDA-MB-436 or HCC1187, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms of chemoresistance and cellular response could be similar across various TNBC models. This hypothesis is supported by literature indicating common pathways of drug resistance in TNBC. We believe that our findings lay the groundwork for future studies to explore the response of a broader range of TNBC cell lines to doxorubicin treatment. Such studies would greatly enhance our understanding of the cellular adaptations to chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC and help to validate the potential universal application of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2: Do the L-DOXR cells permanently hold onto the enlarged and polyploid states upon prolonged culture in vitro? Does that change given the presence or withdrawal of the drug? In other words, is the physical state of the resistant cells reversible, or is it passed onto the progeny cells regardless of continued stress from the drug?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your question about the stability of the phenotypic changes in L-DOXR cells. Our observations suggest that the enlarged and polyploid states in L-DOXRcells are not permanently fixed. When cultured in vitro over an extended period without theselective pressure of doxorubicin, we have noted that some cells may revert to a non-polyploid state. However, this reversion does not seem to be a stable change as subsequentgenerations can present with polyploidy again, even in the absence of the drug. This indicatesa potential epigenetic or microenvironmental influence on the phenotypic state of these cells,suggesting a complex interplay between the drug-induced stress and the inherent cellularresponse mechanisms. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the dynamics ofthese phenotypic changes and whether they are heritable and/or reversible under differentculture conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #3: In Figures 2F-H, the authors perform DNA-staining-based FACS to estimate the ploidy of the cells. These estimations could be improved using 2D cell cycle analyses using EdU or BrdU co-treatment and staining. This would further allow a clear distinction between S-phase and G0/G1 and M-phase cells in the WT, DOXR, and L-DORX populations.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the suggestion to enhance the accuracy of our ploidy estimations. We appreciate the advice to implement 2D cell cycle analyses using EdU or BrdU co-treatment and staining, as this could indeed provide a clearer distinction between the various phases of the cell cycle in our WT (wild-type), DOXR (doxorubicin-resistant), and L-DOXR (large doxorubicin-resistant) cell populations. Incorporating these thymidine analogs would allow us to label newly synthesized DNA and thereby accurately delineate cells in the synthesis phase from those in the G0/G1 and M phases. This approach will likely add depth to our understanding of the cell cycle dynamics and the mechanism behind the drug resistance phenotype. We will consider incorporating these techniques in our future experiments to validate and extend the findings reported in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #4. In Figure 3H, the authors quantitate the number of enlarged cells detected in human specimens of TNBC or normal breast tissues. How were these cells detected simply using the H&amp;E staining, particularly when assessing the genomic content? Were certain size and nuclear staining intensity thresholds used for these categorizations? If so, these should be mentioned in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: In our study, we identified enlarged cells within human TNBC and normal breast tissue specimens using H&amp;E staining, and their quantitation was carried out using the Colour Deconvolution 2 plugin (Landini G et al., 2020) within the ImageJ software. This method allowed us to analyze the staining intensity and cell size systematically. To ascertain that we were indeed observing cells with increased genomic content, we established specific size and nuclear staining intensity thresholds. Cells exceeding these predetermined thresholds were categorized as 'enlarged'. Additionally, we used continuous serial slides for the human TNBC tissues microarray (BR1301, US Biomax) for more accurate comparisons in Figures 3H, I, and 5H. To strengthen our findings, we verified that NUPR1 expression, which is associated with the observed cell enlargements, was indeed elevated in these same cells from the patient samples. We have detailed these methodological aspects and the criteria for cell categorization in the 'Tissue Microarray and Immunohistochemistry' section of our Materials and Methods to ensure clarity and reproducibility of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #5: In Figure 3I, the authors label the enlarged cells in the patient tissues as L-DOXR cells. Were these assessments done in dox-treated tumors? Even if that is the case, it'll be unfair to call them resistant to doxorubicin. The axis label &quot;% enlarged cells&quot; might be more accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's attention to detail and agree that the terminology used in Figure 3I was inaccurate. The cells identified in patient tissues were labeled based on their morphological resemblance to L-DOXR cells observed in vitro; however, these patient tissue samples were not confirmed to be treated with doxorubicin, nor were the cells confirmed to be resistant. Therefore, we have amended the figure legend to reflect this and now refer to these cells simply as 'enlarged cells’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #6: The authors uncovered that NUPR1 expression is dramatically increased in the L-DOXR cells vs the wild-type cells. How does the NUPR1 gene expression and activity compare between L-DOXR and DOXR MDA-MB-231 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the valuable comment. The data are included in figure supplement 3 and we revise the manuscript as below. “While DOXR cells exhibited a marked increase in Nupr1 expression compared to the WT cells, this expression was substantially less than that observed in L-DOXR cells, as detailed in figure supplement 3.”(Page 7, Line 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #7: Following from above, the authors show that NUPR1 activity is not necessary for cell survival in the absence of doxorubicin (Fig. 4H). But, does it control the cellular size and polyploid states of the L-DOXR cells? In other words, is there any association between increased size and genomic content of the cells to their sensitivity to doxorubicin? Are cells resistant to other chemotherapeutics as well? Or is the resistant phenotype specific to doxorubicin?The authors causally implicate NUPR1 in driving the dox-resistant phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells. To fully substantiate this claim, the authors should perform gain-of-function studies, in at least 2-3 TNBC cell lines, to show that over-expression of NUPR1 alone is sufficient to impart doxorubicin resistance. Also, the most critical information missing from the study is how NUPR1 drives resistance to doxorubicin. What is the function of NUPR1 in L-DOXR cells and what gene expression program does it activate to impart the resistant phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: During the experimental process either the loss of function or gain of functionof Nupr1 in the L-DOXR cells, we have not noticed any specific changes in the cellularsize and polyploid states of L-DOXR cells. Although we cannot rule out the possibility thatnot only by DOX treatment, phenotypically larger cell might arise in response to otherchemotherapeutics, in the current study, we found that high level of Nupr1 expression is correlated with sensitivity to doxorubicin in L-DOX cells. Moreover, as followed by the reviewer’s suggestion we performed gain-of-function study to determine whether over-expression of NUPR1 alone is sufficient to impart doxorubicin resistance in TNBC cells. Overexpression of GST-NUPR1 attenuates DOX-induced cell death while slightly increased cell viability of WT (MDA-MB231) cells in the condition of vehicle -treatment, indicating that NUPR1 expressing cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effect of DOX. We have also demonstrated that Nupr1 upregulation in L-DOXR cells are due to suppressed expression of HDAC11 in these cells as we found that HDAC11 triggers promoter acetylation of Nupr1 in L-DOXR cells. Thus, it is conceivable that increased expression of Nupr1 upon HDAC11 suppression in L-DOXR cells is at least responsible for doxorubicin resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #8: Do the authors speculate the dox-resistant phenotype to be restricted to basal TNBC tumors or even NUPR1-high ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF7 or T47D) would likely be resistant to doxorubicin or other chemotherapeutics?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, NUPR1-high ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF7 or T47D) would likely be resistant to doxorubicin or other chemotherapeutics as reported elsewhere; Wang, L., Sun, J., Yin, Y. et al. Transcriptional coregualtor NUPR1 maintains tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. Cell Death Dis 12, 149 (2021). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03442-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03442-z</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #9: The authors suggest that HDAC11 continuously deacetylates the NUPR1 promoter to suppress its expression. Consequently, does the inactivation of HDAC11 in wild-type TNBC cells lead to NUPR1 up-regulation? Is this increase in NUPR1 expression reverted upon inhibition of the HAT machinery (say P300/CBP) in HDAC11-deficient TNBC cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: In the revised manuscript (pg 8, lines 14-16 and Fig 5H) consistent with our observation that while overexpression of HDAC11 suppresses the expression of Nupr1 in the both WT and L-DOXR cells, HDAC11 inhibitor treatment enhances Nupr1 expression in WT cells, inversely mirroring an unusual low expression of HDAC11 and high level of Nupr1 in L-DOXR cells. Conceivably, the increased Nupr1 expression reflects reverting of promoter acetylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>Comment #10: In Figure 4L, how many animals or tumors were in each of the treatment arms? Were the weights of all the tumors recorded as well? It would be meaningful to add this data, if available. The authors keep changing gene nomenclature throughout the manuscript, listing the gene names in either capital letters or the small-case. This can be made consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have used 6 mice per group and one tumor for one mouse due to the tumor</p><p>size of L-DORX with the vehicle group. We also added new data showing the weights of the tumors in Figure supplement 2D. We apologize for the unmatched gene names. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, the names of genes/proteins have been changed in figures and legends to the recommendations of the HUGO gene nomenclature committee (HGNC).</p></body></sub-article></article>
