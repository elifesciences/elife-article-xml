Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>For proteins to accurately carry out their role in the cell, they must first be precisely folded into specific 3D shapes. Stress, aging or disease can interfere with this delicate process, leading to misfolded proteins clumping together and causing damage. In response, the cell can deploy ‘chaperones’ which disentangle these aggregates and ensure that proteins recover their proper structure. Chaperones from the Hsp70 protein family, for example, are crucial for cell survival, especially under biologically stressful conditions. Yet Hsp70 proteins cannot perform their role without the assistance of co-chaperones such as Hsp110; why this is the case, however, has remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this question, Sztangierska et al. used a variety of biochemical assays to test how purified human and yeast Hsp70, Hsp110 and other co-chaperones could bind aggregates and recover misfolded proteins. The role of each protein was examined at every stage of the disaggregation process – from the initial aggregate binding, through chaperone-driven changes in aggregate structure to the final protein folding.</p><p>The experiments revealed that Hsp110 helps draw Hsp70 to the aggregate surface, breaking down the protein ‘clump’ into smaller pieces which are more easily processed by other chaperones. The results also showed that the various co-chaperones compete for Hsp70 binding; too much of one might interfere with another, emphasizing the need for balance between chaperones for optimal disaggregation.</p><p>Overall, these results clarify the role of Hsp110 in the Hsp70 system and reveal several mechanistic details of the protein rescue process. Further experiments will be needed to fully understand these dynamics and identify how they may be relevant to conditions in which harmful protein aggregates are observed, such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Homo sapiens</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019/35/B/NZ1/01475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liberek</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Recovery of proteins from aggregates by Hsp70 is boosted by the Hsp110 co-chaperone, which promotes abundant Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and supports initial aggregate remodelling into small assemblies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During stress, protein homeostasis is perturbed by protein misfolding and aggregation. Accumulation of protein aggregates disrupts cellular functions and contributes to ageing and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morimoto, 2008</xref>). A protein quality control system, relying on a network of cooperating chaperones, has evolved to moderate stress-induced proteotoxicity and rebalance proteostasis.</p><p>To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state, eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, and its co-chaperones: an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) and a J-domain protein (JDP/Hsp40), together with an Hsp100 disaggregase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>). The process is initiated by a JDP, which delivers Hsp70 to an aggregated substrate and whose J-domain induces ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70, resulting in conformational changes that stabilise the interaction with aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rohland et al., 2022</xref>). Next, Hsp100 interacts with the Hsp70-aggregate complex and the aggregate-trapped polypeptides are translocated through the Hsp100 hexamer. The disentangled and released polypeptides can fold back into their native conformation, alone or with further aid of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schaupp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seyffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weibezahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zietkiewicz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Hsp110 co-chaperone boosts the Hsp70 activity by stimulating nucleotide exchange and substrate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shaner et al., 2005</xref>). It belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily, with identical domain organisation to Hsp70 but distinct size and arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Easton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Hendrickson, 2007</xref>). In contrast to Hsp70, Hsp110 is unable to refold denatured proteins, yet it may bind to and prevent aggregation of certain misfolding substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goeckeler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). In its well-established NEF function, the NBD of Hsp110 interacts with the ADP form of Hsp70, which mediates the release of the nucleotide. Subsequent ATP binding to the NBD of Hsp70 prompts the opening of the SBD and substrate dissociation, resetting Hsp70 for another round of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andréasson et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laufen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liberek et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mayer and Gierasch, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In vivo studies on yeast chaperones demonstrated that the Hsp110 co-chaperone Sse1 plays a key role in Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and is essential for protein disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaimal et al., 2017</xref>). Hsp110 is a major cytoplasmic NEF of Hsp70 and the deletion of its both paralogs, <italic>SSE1</italic> and <italic>SSE2</italic>, is lethal and the growth can only be supported, albeit with less efficacy, by overexpression of <italic>FES1,</italic> another cytoplasmic NEF from an unrelated armadillo family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviol et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The importance of Hsp110 is also manifested in vitro in the low disaggregation activity of the yeast Hsp70 system without Hsp110 and the complete interdependence between their human orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mattoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nillegoda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rampelt et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies on the human system revealed that Hsp110 function in disaggregation of amyloid fibrils is not limited to its NEF activity but it may also affect the architecture of chaperone complexes, inducing Hsp70 clustering, although it is not clear whether similar effects occur during disaggregation of non-fibrillar, stress-associated aggregates. The effect is not well understood, but it presumably increases entropic pulling of aggregated polypeptides, ultimately leading to their disentanglement by the Hsp70 system, efficient even without the Hsp100 disaggregase. Developing an Hsp70 system that is self-sufficient in disaggregation could have compensated for the loss of the Hsp100 disaggregase in a common metazoan ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mattoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shorter, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another factor that potentiates the Hsp70 system is the diversity of JDP paralogs, assigned to cytoplasmic classes A and B, which differently regulate Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Cyr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nillegoda et al., 2015</xref>). The main distinction between class A and B JDPs is an auxiliary interaction site between CTD1 domain of class B JDPs and the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Class B JDPs are additionally regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism, in which Hsp70 binding by the J-domain is restricted by a neighbouring helix. Upon binding to the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70, the J-domain is released and it can interact with the NBD of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faust et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>). We have recently shown that the yeast class A JDP Ydj1 and class B JDP Sis1 exhibit diverse mechanisms during Hsp70 binding to aggregated substrates. Ydj1, in accordance with the classical model of the Hsp70 ATPase cycle, binds misfolded polypeptides and loads Hsp70 onto aggregates. Unlike that, Sis1 only weakly binds protein substrates but due to the more complex interaction with Hsp70, it loads more Hsp70 molecules onto aggregates, which results in more efficient disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the vast knowledge on how Hsp110 serves as a regulator of the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andréasson et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andréasson et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaner et al., 2006</xref>), little is known about the function of Hsp110 considering the mechanism of Hsp70 interaction with different JDP classes.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the interplay between Hsp110 and Hsp70 in disaggregation strictly relies on the class of a JDP and unravel the critical role of the B-class-specific interaction with the EEVD motif of Hsp70 for the Hsp110-dependent stimulation. Furthermore, we elucidate differential contribution of the NEF across different phases of protein recovery from aggregates. We employ biolayer interferometry (BLI) to investigate the Hsp110 impact on the formation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface and we assess changes in aggregates’ properties associated with the abundant chaperone binding. Finally, we address a question of the competition between the NEF and JDP co-chaperones. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms behind the potentiation and inhibition of the disaggregation activity of Hsp70 by its co-chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulation of the Hsp70 disaggregation activity by Hsp110 depends on the class of JDP</title><p>Our recent studies showed that during the recovery of aggregated proteins, the Hsp70 chaperone system exhibits different mechanisms of action with class A and class B JDP co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). To better understand the interplay within the Hsp70 chaperone network, we addressed how Hsp110 affects Hsp70 with members of different JDP classes. First, we tested the effect of Sse1, the most abundant yeast NEF, on the recovery of a model protein substrate, aggregated luciferase, by Hsp70 (Ssa1) and class A (Ydj1) or class B (Sis1) JDPs. Compared with Ssa1-Sis1, which exhibits delayed start of disaggregation characteristic for class B JDPs, the initial luciferase recovery was significantly faster, with higher overall output, in the presence of Sse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, Sse1 slightly decreased the disaggregation efficacy in the case of Ssa1-Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With another aggregated substrate, GFP, Sse1 improved the disaggregation activity with either of the JDPs, albeit for Ssa1-Sis1, the stimulation was almost four times higher than with Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impact of Hsp110 on protein disaggregation by Hsp70 system depends on class of J-domain protein (JDP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Refolding of aggregated luciferase by Ssa1-Sis1 (1 µM Ssa1, 1 µM Sis1)±µM Sse1 (0.1 µM) (left) or Ssa1-Ydj1 (1 µM Ssa1, 1 µM Ydj1)±Sse1 (0.1 µM) (right).

The chaperone system comprising Hsp104-Ssa1-Sis1 with Sse1 yielded approximately three times higher luciferase and GFP recovery rates than without the NEF, while in the case of Hsp104-Ssa1-Ydj1, the simulation by Sse1 was much weaker, from marginal to twofold, depending on the protein substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Thus, the positive effect of the Hsp110 NEF on protein recovery from aggregates is substantially more pronounced when the Hsp70 chaperone system comprises a class B JDP.</p><p>Theoretically, the stimulation by Sse1 might occur at one or many stages of protein disaggregation – starting from the association of the Hsp70 system with an aggregate surface, through polypeptide disentanglement, to the final folding of the released substrate. Previous studies show that Ssa1-Ydj1 is much more effective than Ssa1-Sis1 in restoring the native structure of unfolded luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Cyr, 1998</xref>), which could represent the final step of disaggregation – the polypeptide folding after translocation by Hsp104. To test how Sse1 contributes to the protein folding by the Hsp70 system, we measured the recovery of denatured, non-aggregated luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imamoglu et al., 2020</xref>). Curiously, neither of the systems, Ssa1-Sis1 nor Ssa1-Ydj1, was stimulated in luciferase folding by Sse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that the NEF plays an important role at earlier stages of disaggregation.</p><p>We recently showed that JDP co-chaperones determine the association kinetics and the size of chaperone complexes formed at the aggregate surface, which contributes to the total effectiveness of disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). To gain insight into the influence of the Hso110 on the assembly of the protein disaggregation complex, we analysed the binding of the Hsp70 system to heat-aggregated luciferase using BLI. The presence of Sse1 increased the rate of Ssa1-Sis1 association with an aggregate-covered biosensor approximately two times and resulted in a 50% thicker protein layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, Sse1 did not substantially influence the binding level of Ssa1-Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar effects were observed with heat-aggregated GFP or heat-aggregated yeast lysate proteins immobilised on the sensor, indicating that they are not substrate-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). The binding of chaperones to the aggregates required ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the ATP dependence of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sse1 did not stimulate the binding of Ssa1 or JDPs alone, nor did it interact with the aggregate on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>We also assessed the evolutionary conservation of the observed trends and applied BLI to investigate how Hsp105, a human Hsp110, affects aggregate binding by the Hsp70 system. Similarly as the yeast system, Hsc70-DNAJB4 (orthologous to Ssa1-Sis1) exhibited delayed binding and the addition of Hsp105 resulted in much faster association and a sixfold increase in the binding level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the case of Hsc70-DNAJA2 (orthologous to Ssa1-Ydj1), the binding also increased upon Hsp105 addition, however, the stimulation was three times less pronounced than with DNAJB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to the yeast proteins, the stimulation occurred with both JDP classes, which is in line with the stronger dependence of the human Hsp70 system on the NEF in protein disaggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>The BLI results suggest that the Hsp110 NEF greatly improves Hsp70 binding to aggregates, especially with class B JDPs. What could be the basis for this specificity? A major discrimination factor between the two JDP classes is the stable interaction between class B JDPs and the EEVD motif of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Perturbation of this interaction restricts the J-domain-dependent Hsp70 activation, which can be restored through the E50A mutation in Sis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) or the mutation in DNAJB4 Helix 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faust et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies showed that Ssa1<sup>∆EEVD</sup>-Sis1<sup>E50A</sup> resembles Ssa1-Ydj1 in aggregate binding and disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>), therefore we asked what effect this disruption has on the stimulation by Sse1. We observed that the Sis1 E50A-Ssa1 ∆EEVD system is strongly inhibited by Sse1 in protein disaggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and the level of aggregate binding is also negatively affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This suggests that the Hsp70-JDP stimulation by Hsp110 is functionally linked to the Sis1-Ssa1 EEVD interaction.</p><p>We next asked whether Hsp110 contributes to the extra chaperone layer at the aggregate surface in a way that it comprises more Hsp70 molecules. To evaluate the amount of bound Hsp70, we carried out an analogous BLI experiment with fluorescently labelled Ssa1 (Ssa1*A488). After protein dissociation to the basal level, the total dissociated Ssa1*A488 was quantified based on fluorescence. In the presence of Sis1 and Sse1, the amount of Ssa1*A488 was nearly two times higher than in the presence of Sis1 only, whereas Sse1 did not influence the amount Ssa1*A488 bound to the biosensor when Ydj1 was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The increase in the fluorescence signal corresponded to that of BLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting a major contribution of Ssa1 to the thickness of the chaperone complex forming on the aggregate surface.</p><p>Since the presence of Sse1 substantially increased the association of Ssa1 with aggregates, we asked if the problem limiting Hsp70 binding that is overcome by Hsp110 is the insufficient availability of Hsp70 molecules targeting the aggregate. To address that, we tested whether a similar effect to the Sse1-induced stimulation of Ssa1 binding can be obtained by increasing Ssa1 concentration itself. Sse1 stimulated Ssa1 binding much above the level that could be achieved for the saturating concentration of Ssa1 in the absence of Sse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This indicates that the mechanism of stimulation by Hsp110 is more complex than an enrichment of the pool of Hsp70 molecules capable of substrate binding and might involve generating more Hsp70-binding sites.</p><p>To explore whether the observed effects are unique to Hsp110, we examined another cytosolic NEF that belongs to the Armadillo type family, Fes1. It is structurally distinct from Hsp110, with a C-terminal armadillo domain that triggers nucleotide exchange in Hsp70 through a different mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). Fes1 has weaker affinity for Hsp70 and lower nucleotide exchange activity than Sse1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike Sse1, Fes1 does not directly bind protein substrates, but its N-terminal RD domain is involved in substrate release from Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>). When we carried out luciferase disaggregation by Ssa1-Sis1, the level of stimulation achieved by Sse1 required 10 times more Fes1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Similarly, 1 µM Fes1 stimulated Ssa1 binding to luciferase aggregates on the BLI sensor to the level achieved with 0.1 µM Sse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result suggests that the substrate-binding activity specific to Hsp110 is not necessary to increase the Sis1-Ssa1 binding to aggregates and that the effective NEF concentration is negatively correlated with its affinity for Hsp70.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sse1 leads to Hsp70-dependent reduction of aggregate size</title><p>Recently, we have reported that larger Hsp70-JDP assemblies at the aggregate surface, dependent on Sis1 and its interaction with EEVD, can modify aggregates into misfolded protein species that are more amenable to disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). To assess whether Hsp110 further stimulates such aggregate-remodelling activity, and this way contributes to the more efficient protein recovery, we used a variant of Hsp104 with abrogated interaction with Hsp70, D484K F508A (Hsp104<sup>mut</sup>). Hsp104<sup>mut</sup> does not require Hsp70 for allosteric activation and aggregate binding and it can serve as an indicator of Hsp70-dependent aggregate modification by facilitating final reactivation of its products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamera et al., 2019</xref>). When heat-aggregated GFP was initially incubated with Ssa1-Sis1-Sse1, which yielded very low protein recovery, we added Hsp104<sup>mut</sup> and observed much faster and more effective GFP reactivation than when the substrate was first incubated with Ssa1-Sis1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To shed light on this, we visualised the aggregates of luciferase C-terminally fused with GFP using fluorescence microscopy.

The negative effect of Sse1 on protein folding could potentially mask a positive effect of saturating Sse1 on aggregate modification, e.g., through entropic pulling. We thus analysed the size of aggregates after their incubation with Ssa1-Sis1 and 1 μM Sse1, however it was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that higher Sse1 levels also limit the aggregate-remodelling activity of Hsp70. Consistently, when we measured Hsp70 association with luciferase aggregated on the BLI sensor across Sse1 concentrations, we observed the biphasic effect for Ssa1-Ydj1 and Ssa1-Sis1, with the maximum binding at 0.05 µM and 0.2 µM of Sse1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, Hsp110 promotes Hsp70 assembly at aggregates and their modification only at sub-stoichiometric concentrations, with peak performance at higher levels of Sse1 in the presence of class B than class A JDPs.</p><p>To establish whether the inhibition that occurs at higher Sse1 concentrations is directly associated with the interaction between Sse1 and Ssa1, or rather between Sse1 and a substrate, we used the previously characterised Sse1-2 variant (N572Y E575A), with disrupted interaction with the A300 residue of Ssa1, which reduces Hsp70 binding to 20% and nucleotide exchange to 5% of that of the wild type (WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polier et al., 2008</xref>). The variant has been reported to partially compensate for the <italic>SSE1/SSE2</italic> double deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polier et al., 2008</xref>). Consistently with the weak Ssa1 binding affinity of Sse1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), Ssa1-Sis1 required 20 times higher concentration of the Sse1-2 variant than Sse1 WT to reach the same GFP disaggregation activity and no inhibition was observed up to 2 µM of Sse1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Also, the Sse1-2 variant had a much weaker impact on luciferase disaggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nonetheless, 1 µM Sse1-2 was sufficient to obtain a similar effect as 0.1 µM WT Sse1 in stimulating Ssa1-Sis1 binding to the aggregated luciferase in the BLI assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>This suggests that it is the high-affinity interaction between Hsp70 and the NEF that enables strong stimulation already at very low Hsp110 levels.

Knowing that the sensitivity to Sse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>) is negatively correlated with the strength of the Hsp70-JDP interaction, higher in the case class B JDP due to its binding of the EEVD motif of Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>), we explored the possibility that Hsp110 restricts the formation of the Hsp70-JDP complex.</p><p>To test this, we immobilised Sis1 on the BLI sensor and monitored Ssa1 binding across a range of Sse1 concentrations.

Potentiation of the Hsp70 activity by the NEF strongly depends on the class of the JDP and the preference for class B, conserved in yeast and human orthologs, relies on Hsp70 binding through the EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages: chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase. We also gained insight into the biphasic impact of Hsp110: with increasing Sse1 level, the stimulation is overshadowed by inhibition and the contribution of each trend depends on the phase of disaggregation and the composition of the disaggregating system, with a crucial role of the NEF’s affinity for Hsp70. Finally, we show that the disaggregation inhibition by Hsp110 involves disruption of the Hsp70-JDP interaction, suggesting competition between JDP and Hsp110 co-chaperones.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Impact of Hsp110 on Hsp70-dependent disaggregation.</title><p>Hsp110 stimulates aggregate disassembly by Hsp70 with class B J-domain proteins (JDPs) and Hsp104 (green arrow), contrary to the stage of final folding of the solubilised polypeptide (light purple arrow), at which Hsp70 with class A JDP are most effective.

On the other hand, the final folding of a soluble substrate by Ssa1 relies much more on the class A JDP (JDP<sup>A</sup>) Ydj1 than on Sis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Cyr, 1998</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and not on Sse1 altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>)<italic>,</italic> which is in line with previous reports that its human ortholog, Hsp105 inhibits luciferase folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rauch and Gestwicki, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The higher degree of stimulation with class B JDP has been previously observed, albeit without broader insight, for Hsp110 and other NEF BAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rampelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rauch and Gestwicki, 2014</xref>). We show that the distinguishing feature fundamental for this specificity is the auxiliary interaction between the CTD domain of Sis1 and the EEVD motif of Hsp70. The Sis1 E50A variant, featuring derepressed J-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), together with Ssa1 ΔEEVD exhibited a similar aggregate binding pattern with or without Sse1 to the system with Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, and J</xref>). However, while Ydj1 can bind misfolded proteins and prevent aggregation, Sis1 cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Cyr, 1998</xref>). When Sis1 is deprived of Ssa1 binding through EEVD, which has a major contribution to the stability of their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>), the effect of Sse1 on disaggregation is detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This underlines the importance of the Hsp70-JDP complex stability for the stimulation of substrate binding and disaggregation by Sse1.</p><p>In our previous work, we reported sigmoidal aggregate binding kinetics characteristic for the Ssa1-Sis1 system, suggesting that the binding gradually generates more chaperone binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). Now, we show that this apparent cooperativity is conserved in yeast and human, implying mechanistic similarities between the systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). While the s-shaped Ssa1-Sis1 binding to the aggregate results in the association of more Ssa1 than with Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>)<italic>,</italic> Hsp110 shortens the initial lag phase and boosts the binding efficacy, loading a thicker layer of Hsp70 molecules onto aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), similarly as has been shown for amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beton et al., 2022</xref>). This corresponds with Hsc70 clustering on amyloid in the presence of Hsp110, reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>. Clustered, densely packed Hsp70 has been proposed to generate entropic pulling effect that leads to fibril fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goloubinoff and De Los Rios, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sousa and Lafer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, we observed remodelling of amorphous aggregates into smaller aggregated species, which resembles amyloid disassembly in terms of the dependence on the NEF activity of Hsp110, the class B JDP and its interaction with the Hsp70 EEVD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beton et al., 2022</xref>). We propose that the local extraction of polypeptides by Hsp70-JDP<sup>B</sup>-Hsp110, which penetrates the surface and takes apart amorphous aggregates, although not enough for full protein recovery, could successfully generate more manageable substrates for chaperones, as we demonstrated by applying the derepressed Hsp104 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This Hsp70 activity, albeit yielding very low protein reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), might be relevant for the fragmentation of a thinner, linear amyloid structure.</p><p>Such clustering-augmented aggregate remodelling and fragmentation, possibly through expanding the total effective aggregate surface, leads to the much-improved protein reactivation by Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This would explain the previous findings that although Sse1 is not necessary for Hsp104 recruitment to aggregates, it is essential for Hsp104-dependent aggregate clearance in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaimal et al., 2017</xref>). Apparently, despite the more heterogenic and dynamic nature of cellular aggregates than of those generated in vitro, their disaggregation by Hsp104 largely relies on the Hsp110-boosted processing by the Hsp70 system.</p><p>Above a certain Hsp110 level, however, the disaggregation is inhibited. The susceptibility to the NEF depends on the phase of the process and the composition of the Hsp70 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which may explain the discrepancies between different studies of Hsp110’s impact on disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shorter, 2011</xref>) As well established, the most effective is sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 proportion to Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>) which corresponds with the physiological conditions, where the ratio between all cytoplasmic Hsp70 and Hsp110 paralogs involved in disaggregation ranges from approximately 10:1.7 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownridge et al., 2013</xref>) to 10:2.4 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finka and Goloubinoff, 2013</xref>). According to our data, the optimum, at which the stimulation and inhibition curves intersect, is shifted to higher levels: (a) during the initiation versus final protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), (b) with class B JDP, in comparison with class A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, and D</xref>), (c) with Hsp104, comparing with the system without the disaggregase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and (d) for the human Hsp70 system, comparing with the yeast chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The latter trend might result from the stronger dependence of the human Hsp70 chaperone on the nucleotide exchange activity, possibly associated with the lower basal rate of nucleotide dissociation than that reported for Ssa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>). Possibly, due to these problems with ADP release, the positive impact of Hsp110 on Hsc70 is manifested both in the presence of class A and B JDPs and the inhibition occurs at much higher Hsp110 levels. Accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that the human system, lacking Hsp104, has evolved towards better tolerance for Hsp110 to boost the disaggregation activity of the Hsp70 system alone, e.g., to counteract amyloid toxicity.</p><p>Excessive dissociation of Hsp70 from a substrate, promoted by nucleotide exchange, may explain the system’s susceptibility to Hsp110. Here, we propose an additional mechanism behind this inhibition. The fact that the NEF and JDP binding occurs at mutually exclusive nucleotide states of Hsp70 has raised a question of competition between the two co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sousa and Lafer, 2019</xref>), which, to our knowledge, has never been addressed before. On the other hand, class B JDP goes beyond the classical model of the Hsp70 cycle due to the auxiliary interaction with the EEVD motif, which is not nucleotide-sensitive and theoretically might not be exclusive with Hsp110 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, our results clearly demonstrate that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP’s complex with Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This way, Hsp110 may cause the release of Hsp70 from an aggregate, as well as of a JDP, unless it remains tethered via another interaction, e.g., through the other JDP subunit in complex with an aggregate-bound Hsp70 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The fate of the displaced proteins is yet to be established, presumably at low Hsp110 levels, they may re-bind at another site on the substrate or to the aggregate-bound chaperones. At high Hsp110 levels, the JDP<sup>B</sup>-Hsp70 interaction is very strongly affected, similarly as aggregate binding and disaggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A and B</xref>), suggesting that the proteins released by Hsp110 do not re-bind or that any subsequent binding is non-productive.</p><p>The apparent competition between the co-chaperones is reflected in the fact that the inhibition by Hsp110 is moderated at increasing Sis1 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the class B JDP also exerts a biphasic effect on disaggregation, and optimal concentrations of the two co-chaperones are strongly interdependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). The highest disaggregation yield occurs at Ssa1:Sis1:Sse1 ratio closest to the average reported in the cytosol, 10:0.3:1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownridge et al., 2013</xref>), pointing to a possibility that the proportions between the co-chaperones have undergone evolutionary fine-tuning to develop higher tolerance to stress.</p><p>The sub-stoichiometric optimum is unique to Hsp110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>), while other NEF, Fes1, requires 10 times higher level to reach the same degree of stimulation, similarly as the Sse1-2 variant with reduced affinity for Hsp70. Fes1’s ability to improve Hsp70 loading onto aggregate is surprising, regarding findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wentink et al., 2020</xref>, who demonstrated, using Hsp110 and BAG1 variants, that Hsp70 clustering on amyloid requires a bulky NEF. Although Fes1 is only 33 kDa, the stretch of its armadillo repeats and different mode of interaction with NBD could possibly lead to similar excluded volume effects as Hsp110. Nevertheless, Fes1 is present in a cell at approximately one-fifth the level of Sse1, and even its 8.4-fold overexpression from two plasmids, shown by Kaimal et al., was insufficient to complement the thermosensitive phenotype of <italic>sse1-200 sse2</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaimal et al., 2017</xref>), as it was six times too low to reach the level effective in disaggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). It is worth noting that Fes1 has been reported to target substrates to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gowda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gowda et al., 2013</xref>) and apparently its role in Hsp70 recruitment to disaggregation is minor.</p><p>An abundant association of Hsp70-JDP<sup>B</sup> with aggregate surface, although generating strong pulling effect to disentangle polypeptides, could also mask access of chaperones to the newly emerging sites adjacent to and buried beneath the complex. We demonstrate that Hsp110 could theoretically uncover such sites not only through Hsp70 dissociation from the substrate due to the nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dragovic et al., 2006</xref>), but also by disrupting the JDP<sup>B</sup>-Hsp70 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Four Hsp70-binding sites in a JDP<sup>B</sup> dimer allow to form an extensive network of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that Hsp110 introduces plasticity into this network, enabling the chaperone complex to infiltrate cavities emerging within the aggregate in a fluid-like manner, binding to the uncovered chaperone-binding sites and pulling up to the aggregate fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Such behaviour would require only a small destabilising effect of the NEF that would not dissociate the complex completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), similarly as observed at the Hsp110 concentration that supports the most effective aggregate binding and disaggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). Further experimental verification of this scenario and future studies of the dynamics within the Hsp70 chaperone system will be critical to understand and combat the stress- and disease-related protein aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Briefly, GFP (74 μM) was thermally inactivated at 85°C for 15  min. The reactivation reaction was carried out at 25 °C in the renaturation buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 8.0], 7% [vol/vol] glycerol, 60  mM potassium glutamate, 7 mM DTT, 15 mM MgOAc, 10 mM ATP), with an ATP regeneration system comprising 1.2 μM creatine kinase and 20 mM creatine phosphate. Disaggregation of the 100 times diluted GFP aggregates was initiated by adding the chaperone proteins at the following concentrations: Ssa1 (1  μM), Ydj1 (1 μM), Sis1 (1  μM), Sse1 (0.1 μM), Hsp104 WT (1 μM), Hsp104<sup>mut</sup> (0.15 μM), unless indicated otherwise.

Then, it was transferred to 48°C for 10 min and 10-fold diluted into the buffer A containing 5 mM ATP and 2 mM DTT. After 15 min of incubation at 25°C, the reaction was initiated upon addition of the mix of chaperones at 1 μM concentration, except for Sse1 used at 0.1 μM. The final concentration of luciferase-GFP aggregates in the reaction was 0.3 μM. After 1 hr of incubation with the chaperones, the reaction was arrested upon addition of 200 mM NaCl and transferred on ice. Specimens were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica SP8X with a ×100 oil immersion lens (Leica, Germany). Presented data show results from three independent experiments. Each sample within the repeat was photographed 10 times. Data analysis was performed with Leica LAS X software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dynamic light scattering</title><p>Luciferase (23,7 µM) was incubated in the buffer A with 6 M urea at 25°C for 15 min, then it was transferred to 48°C for 10 min.

Then, it was subjected to a DLS measurement to confirm the presence of the aggregates, size of which ranged between 1000 nm and 3000 nm. The reaction was initiated upon an addition of a mix of chaperones used at 1 μM concentration, except for Sse1 used at 0.1 μM. The final concentration of luciferase was 0.6 μM. DLS was measured using the ZetaSizer NanoS instrument (Malvern) after 1 hr of incubation with chaperones at 25°C. For each sample, three independent measurements were performed, and particle size distributions were calculated as percent within a range between 0.4 nm and 10,000 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>BLI experiments</title><p>All the BLI experiments described below were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>) using the BLItz and Octet K2 instruments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Binding of chaperones to luciferase aggregates</title><p>Initially, the Ni-NTA biosensor (ForteBio Dip and Read) was hydrated in the buffer A for 10 min and subsequently immersed in the same buffer containing 6 M urea and 8.2 μM His-tagged luciferase for 10 min, resulting in an anchoring layer of ~6 nm.

The study builds on former work by the authors (Wyszkowski et al., 2021, PNAS), analyzing the binding of Hsp70 and J-domain protein (JDP) cochaperones to protein aggregates using bio-layer interferometry (BLI). It was shown before by other groups that Hsp110 enhances Hsp70 disaggregation activity. The mechanism of Hsp110-stimulated disaggregation activity, however, remained poorly defined. Here, the authors show that yeast Hsp110 increases Hsp70 recruitment to the surface of protein aggregates. The effect is largely dependent on J-domain protein (JDP) identity and particularly pronounced for class B JDPs (e.g. yeast Sis1), which are also more effective in disaggregation reactions. The authors also confirm former results, showing inhibition by increased Hsp110 levels and provide novel evidence that the inhibitory effect is caused by competition between Hsp110 and JDPs for Hsp70 binding.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work represents a very thoroughly executed study, which provides novel insights into the mechanism of Hsp70-mediated protein disaggregation. Key findings established for yeast chaperones are also documented for human counterparts. The observation that Hsp110 might displace JDPs from Hsp70 during the disaggregation reaction is very appealing. It will now become important to validate this initial finding and dissect how it propels the disaggregation reaction.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>How exactly the interplay between JDPs and Hsp110 orchestrates protein disaggregation remains largely speculative and further analysis is required for a deeper mechanistic understanding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94795.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sztangierska</surname><given-names>Wiktoria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wyszkowski</surname><given-names>Hubert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pokornowska</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kochanowicz</surname><given-names>Klaudia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdańsk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rychlowski</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liberek</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Klosowska</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gdańsk</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gdansk</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- The title may not reflect the key finding of the paper.

Most figures would benefit from an indication of the used stoichiometry (or all absolute concentrations) to support the points made about the stoichiometry, especially the figures showing titrations of Sse1, Sse1-2, and Sis1 (Fig. 3D, 3E, 4A-C, S2B, S5F, S6A-E).</p></disp-quote><p>The information of protein concentrations has been included in all figure captions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The manuscript includes a summary model. While this model is a plausible hypothesis of the mechanism of disaggregation by Hsp70, in particular when viewed with previous data (Wyszkowski et al., 2021), it focuses rather heavily on the potential remodeling of clients by Hsp70, which is not the primary focus of the data presented in this manuscript.

These conditions lead to a spontaneous refolding yield of 20% (Figure 3C), which is very high and limits conclusions on the effect of Hsp110 but also JDPs on the refolding process. Typically this assay uses 6 M GdnHCl for Luciferase denaturation and under these conditions, spontaneous refolding of Luciferase is hardly observed (e.g. Laufen et al. PNAS 1999). The authors are therefore asked to repeat key experiments using altered (6M) GdnHCl concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We based our experiments assessing luciferase refolding on the publication by Imamoglu et al. (2020), in which the authors, using 5 M GdnHCl for luciferase denaturation, demonstrated that spontaneous and chaperone-assisted luciferase refolding strongly depends on luciferase concentration. In this work, a similar degree of luciferase refolding was reported for the same final luciferase concentration (100 nM) as we used in our experiments (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). As an additional control, we compared the effects of 5 M and 6 M of GdnHCl during denaturation on luciferase refolding under the same conditions (100 nM, 25 °C, 2 h) and we observed no significant differences (Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Chaperone-assisted folding of luciferase after denaturation at 5 M or 6 M GdnHCl.</title><p>Luciferase was denatured in 5 M or 6 M GdnHCl according to the protocol in the Materials and Methods section.

In the case of less than 3 repeats of the results presented in the Supplementary Figures, the remaining repeats are added to the provided Source Data file, information about which has been added to the captions of the respective figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The observation that Hsp110 can interrupt Hsp70 interaction with JDPs is intriguing. Do the authors envision JDP displacement from the aggregate? If so this could be shown in BLI experiments by monitoring the release of fluorescently labeled Sis1 (similar to labeled Ssa1, Fig. S3C). Or will the released JDP immediately rebind to another binding site on the aggregate? The authors should at least discuss the diverse scenarios as they are relevant to the mechanism of protein disaggregation.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed experiment is challenging due to the transient nature of Sis1 binding to aggregate and high background observed with the method using the fluorescently labelled proteins. The aspect of chaperone’s re-binding after their release by Hsp110 proposed by the reviewer has been introduced into the Discussion section (pages 12/13, lines 25-4). We speculate that Hsp110 might release an Hsp70 molecule as well as a JDP molecule that had been bound to the aggregate through Hsp70 (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2B: Ssa1/Sis1/Sse1 strongly decreases the size of Luciferase-GFP aggregates. Yet this activity only allows for limited refolding of aggregated Luciferase and the reaction stays largely dependent on Hsp104. How do the authors envision the role of the hexameric disaggregase in this process? Does it act exclusively on small-sized aggregates after Hsp110-dependent fragmentation?</p></disp-quote><p>A question of the Hsp104 activity with the Hsp70-processed aggregates is indeed intriguing and we agree that it should have been discussed more thoroughly. We added to the manuscript the results of the reactivation of luciferase-GFP with and without Hsp104 to emphasize the role of Hsp104 in the active protein recovery (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) (page 7, lines 24-27). We propose that aggregate fragmentation by Hsp70-JDPB-Hsp110 increases the effective aggregate surface, at which Hsp104 might become engaged. We do not think that Hsp104 acts only on small aggregates, it might be just more effective, when the number of exposed polypeptides is larger. In the cell, where Hsp104 binds to aggregates of various sizes, protein aggregates apparently also need to undergo such Hsp110-boosted pre-processing by Hsp70, based on the finding that Sse1 is not necessary for Hsp104 recruitment to aggregates, but it is required for Hsp104-dependent disaggregation (Kaimal et al., 2017). We have added a comment on this problem to the Discussion section (pages 11/12, lines 33-4) .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Page 9: The authors state that the Sse1-2 variant is nearly as effective as Sse1 Wt in stimulating substrate dissociation and refer to published work (Polier et al., 2008). It is unclear how the variant should have Wtlike activity in triggering substrate release although its activity in catalyzing nucleotide exchange is reduced to 5% (both activities are coupled). The observation that high Sse1-2 concentrations do not inhibit protein disaggregation does not necessarily exclude the possibility that high Sse1 WT concentration inhibit the reaction by overstimulating substrate release. The latter possibility should be considered by the authors and added to the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the description of the Sse1-2 variant was misleading, as it was lacking the key information, that according to the published data (Polier et al., 2008), it was 10 times higher the concentration of the Sse1-2 variant than Sse1 WT that had a similar nucleotide-exchange activity to the wild type. We have changed the text (page 9, lines 16-22, page 13, lines 26-28) to avoid confusion as well as the model in the Figure 5, to underline the importance of substrate release as the cause of the Hsp110-dependent inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While similar effects are observed for human class A and class B JDP co-chaperones, they are clearly less pronounced. A mechanistic explanation for the difference between yeast and human chaperones is currently missing and the authors are asked to elaborate on this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>There are indeed clear differences between the human and yeasts systems, especially regarding the dependence on the NEF. Hsc70 has been reported to have a lower rate of ADP release (Dragovic et al., 2006) and thus might rely more on Hsp110 than its yeast ortholog. For the same reason, the strong Hsc70 stimulation by Hsp105 is also observed with class A JDP. We have added a comment on these effects in the Discussion section (page 12, lines 17-21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>- Figure S1C (right): the disaggregation rate (%GFP/h) is somewhat misleading/confusing as a value of more than 150%/h is determined in the presence of the complete disaggregation system while only approx. 60% GFP is indeed refolded by the system (Figure S1C, left). Showing the rate as %GFP/min seems more rational.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the units according to the Reviewer’s comment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S5B: Only a single data point is shown for Ssa1/Sis1/Sse1.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the figure to include datapoints from all three repeats (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There are several typos throughout the manuscript.

For example, in Figure 1A, FFL is used with only limited reactivation (10% reactivated at the last timepoint and the curve is flattening), while in Figure 2B FFL-EGFP is used to monitor microscopically what appears to be complete disaggregation. Does FFL-EGFP behave the same as FFL in assays such as the one in Figure 1A or are there major differences that may impact how the data should be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the results of Luc-GFP reactivation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B) (discussed on page 7, lines 24-27 of the manuscipt) which agree with the results obtain with Luciferase as a substrate (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 B). They clearly show that the Ssa1-Sis1-Sse1-dependent decrease in aggregate size is not associated with the recovery of active protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Experimental data concerning the class A JDPs should be interpreted with caution. These experiments show very small reactivation activities for luciferase in the range of 0-1% without the addition of Hsp104 and 0-15% with the addition of Hsp104. Moreover, since the assay is based on the recovery of luciferase activity, it conflates two chaperone activities, namely disaggregation and refolding. It is possible that the small degree of reactivation observed for the class A JDP reflects a minor subpopulation of the aggregated species that is particularly easy to disaggregate/refold and may thus not be representative of bulk behaviour.</p></disp-quote><p>The disaggregation by the Hsp70 system can be enhanced by the addition of small heat shock proteins at the step of substrate aggregation (Rampelt et al., 2012). However, sHsps compete with Hsp70 for binding to the aggregate (Żwirowski et al., 2017) and for that reason we decided not to include sHsps in the experiments presented in the manuscript, as it would introduce another level of complexity. However, as a control, we performed the disaggregation assay with Hsp70 with Ydj1 using luciferase aggregates formed in the presence or absence of sHsp (Author response image 2). In 1 h, the Hsp70 system without Hsp104 yielded 5% of recovered luciferase activity and the system with Hsp104, 23% compared to the native. The impact of Sse1 on Ssa1-Ydj1 and Ssa1-Ydj1-Hsp104 was similar as for luciferase aggregates formed without sHsps (Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 B). Furthermore, according to the Reviewer’s comment, we have changed the Figure 5 to underscore the more prominent role of class A JDPs in the final protein folding than in disaggregation.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Disaggregaton of heat-aggregated luciferase – impact of sHsps.</title><p>Luciferase (2 μM) was denatured with (blue) or without (red) Hsp26 (20 μM) at 45 ̊C for 15 min in the buffer A (Materials and Methods).
