We demonstrate that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) within the adult murine hippocampus are particularly sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death. Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent, with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hr post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression, consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentategyrus (DG)– without ablating adult neurogenesis– can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact. These findings expand on recent reports implicating rAAV-linked toxicity in stem cells and other cell types and suggest that future work using rAAV as an experimental tool in the DG and as a gene therapy for diseases of the central nervous system should be carefully evaluated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>adeno-associated virus (AAV)</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor cell</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG056306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gage</surname><given-names>Fred H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH114030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gage</surname><given-names>Fred H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 NS093130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shtrahman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gage</surname><given-names>Fred H</given-names></name><name><surname>Shtrahman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD025060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shtrahman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

Adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) are continuously generated from a pool of largely quiescent neural stem cells that undergo proliferation, differentiation, and fate specification before maturing into neurons that are indistinguishable from developmentally derived dentate granule cells (DGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kempermann et al., 2015</xref>). These stem cells and their immature progeny are sensitive to environmental stimuli; their proliferation, development, and survival are regulated by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including experience, stress, inflammation, and pharmacologic agents (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kempermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Monje et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vivar et al., 2016</xref>). Numerous studies demonstrate that abDGCs are critical for maintaining the physiological activity of mature DGCs and contribute to hippocampus-dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clelland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ikrar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lacefield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saxe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tronel et al., 2012</xref>). While the specific role that immature DGCs play in hippocampal function, including the formation of memories, is not fully established, progress has been achieved through recent work focused on precisely modulating and measuring the activity of immature and mature DGCs within the DG of animals during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anacker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirschen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A key tool enabling many of these and other advances in in vivo neurophysiology is recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Wild-type AAV is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus endemic to humans and primates and has been previously proposed to have no known pathogenicity. This replication-defective virus contains a 4.7 kb genome that includes the Rep and Cap genes and a pair of palindromic 145 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The Rep and Cap genes can be supplied in trans to create space for incorporating transgenes of interest, yielding the widely used rAAV, which retains only the ITRs from the original wild-type genome. In experimental neuroscience, rAAV is often used to deliver a variety of genetically encoded tools, including actuators and sensors of neuronal function, to specific cell types and brain regions. In addition, rAAV’s minimal viral genome and limited immunogenicity and toxicity have made it the vector of choice for human gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Büning and Schmidt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choudhury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hocquemiller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hudry and Vandenberghe, 2019</xref>), including two FDA-approved therapies for disorders of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoy, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smalley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite its safety profile, rAAV has increasingly been reported to demonstrate toxicity in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bockstael et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinderer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hordeaux et al., 2018</xref>). However, the toxic effects of rAAV on abDGCs have previously not been assessed. Motivated by our own efforts to study the role of adult neurogenesis and the DG in learning and memory, we discovered that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons in the DG are highly susceptible to rAAV-induced death at a range of experimentally relevant titers (3 <sc>e</sc>11 gc/mL and above). This process appears to be cell autonomous and mediated by AAV2 ITRs, which are used nearly universally in rAAVs. Consistent with previous ablation studies, elimination of 4-week-old abDGCs by rAAV alters the activity of mature DGCs, resulting in DG hyperactivity (as indicated by cFOS expression). To circumvent this problem, we used the rAAV2-retro serotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>) to label DGCs in a retrograde manner, which avoids infection of susceptible cells and preserves adult neurogenesis. We demonstrate the utility of this delivery method by measuring the activity of mature DGCs in vivo using two-photon calcium imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>rAAV eliminates abDGCs in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>In preliminary studies, we found that the delivery of calcium indicators via commonly used rAAV serotypes at doses equivalent to or below previously reported doses resulted in a dramatic qualitative loss of the immature neuron marker doublecortin (DCX) 2 weeks after viral injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This effect occurred following the injection of a variety of rAAV preparations, regardless of vector production facility (Salk Institute Viral Vector Core, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Addgene), purification method (iodixanol, CsCl), capsid serotype (AAV1 and AAV8; all incorporating AAV2 ITRs), promoter (CAG, Syn, CaMKIIa), and protein expression (GFP, jRGECO1a, a red calcium indicator, and mCherry) at doses typically required for the functional manipulation or visualization of DGCs in vivo. To systematically quantify the effect of rAAV transduction on abDGCs, we chose to inject a widely available, minimally expressing cre-recombinase-dependent virus (AAV1-CAG-flex-eGFP, U. Penn. and Addgene #51502) in non-cre-expressing wild-type C57BL/6J mice to mitigate any contributions from toxicity that might be attributed to protein expression. Mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 3 days to label dividing cells; then 1 µL of 3<sc>e</sc>12 gc/mL rAAV was injected unilaterally into the DG immediately (0 day), or 1, 2, or 8 weeks later (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell survival on the virus-treated side depended on the age of BrdU-labeled cells when the virus was delivered (F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(3,27)=29.0, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, last four columns). Cells that were 2 days old and younger at the time of injection were almost completely eliminated within 48 hr (−83.9 ± 6.7%, p&lt;0.001, all textual results reported as change relative to the mean of non-injected contralateral DG ± standard error of the mean difference, unless stated otherwise). Cells that were 7–9 days old were partially protected (−41.3 ± 6.3%, p&lt;0.001), whereas cells that were 14–16 days old were largely protected with variable but non-significant loss (−15.4 ± 6.3%, n.s.). Fully mature abDGCs, approximately 8 weeks old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laplagne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Piatti et al., 2013</xref>), also did not demonstrate significant loss at 1 week following AAV injection (−4.5 ± 6.3%, n.s.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> last column). In the same tissue, Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors were lost even when mature BrdU+ cells were spared, demonstrating that the virus did not lack toxicity in these animals (F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(3,27)=3.0, p&lt;0.05; 0 weeks: −80.2 ± 9.1%, p&lt;0.001; 1 weeks: −76.9 ± 8.5%, p&lt;0.001; 2 weeks: −82.6 ± 8.5%, p&lt;0.001; 8 weeks: −50.8 ± 8.5%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine the effect of viral attachment and penetration in rAAV-induced toxicity, we injected 1 µL of high titer (3.7 <sc>e</sc>13 capsids/mL) empty AAV viral capsid (University of North Carolina Viral Vector Core and Salk Institute Viral Vector Core) containing no viral DNA into the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, first column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At 1 week post-injection, there was no effect on BrdU+ cells (2 days old at the time of empty capsid injection) relative to the contralateral control DG, although there was a mild decrease 4 weeks post-injection that did not recapitulate the severe loss observed with intact virus (F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(1,14)=6.5, p&lt;0.05, 1 week post-injection: 6.2 ± 5.7%, n.s., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, first column; 4 weeks: −14.5 ± 5.7%, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>rAAV eliminates abDGCs in a dose-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design of rAAV injection into DG following indelible labeling of adult-born DGCs with BrdU.

Instead, a rapid loss of proliferating Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors by 2 days drives much of the rAAV-induced toxicity, including the progressive loss of the DCX+ population that is observed as these cells differentiate into mature neurons and decline in number over time. To test the effect of increasing the size of the proliferating NPC population on rAAV-induced toxicity, we housed mice in an enriched environment with running wheels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>, schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>) Nearly all of the BrdU+-dividing cells gained from enrichment and exercise were eliminated by rAAV (F<sub>housing</sub>(1,14)=8.7, p&lt;0.01; F<sub>treatment</sub>(1,14)=124.0, p&lt;0.001; F<sub>housing x treatment</sub> (1,14)=9.4, p&lt;0.01; home cage: −79.5 ± 13.9%, p&lt;0.001; enriched environment: −139.9 ± 13.9%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

Following labeling with BrdU, animals were injected with 1 µL of 3<sc>e</sc>12 rAAV into unilateral dorsal DG and 1 µL saline into the contralateral DG to control for the acute effect of surgery- and injection-induced inflammation and tissue damage. rAAV-injected DGs already showed a modest decrease in BrdU+ cells at 12 and 18 hr relative to their contralateral saline-injected control (F<sub>treatment</sub>(1,13)=13.9, p&lt;0.01; F<sub>time</sub>(1,13)=0.04, n.s.; F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(1,13)=0.07, n.s.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

Although the increase in total pyknotic and karyorrhexic cells in rAAV-injected DG was short of significant (p=0.058), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>), a significant increase in pyknosis was seen in BrdU+ proliferating cells (2.3 ± 0.7 additional cells/section, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

Taken together, these findings suggest that rAAV increases programmed cell death of dividing and recently divided cells in the DG.</p><p>Both systemic and local inflammation are known to negatively impact adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ekdahl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Monje et al., 2003</xref>) Therefore, we investigated whether rAAV-induced cell loss could be explained by inflammation resulting from rAAV infection. Variable inflammatory responses were observed with different viral preparations, particularly around the intermediate time point of 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, rapid (&lt;48 hr) loss of NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) occurred independent of expression of the microglial marker Iba1, which did not increase until 4 weeks post-injection (F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(2,19)=54.6, p&lt;0.001; 2 days:18.6 ± 10.3%, n.s.; 1 week: −9.0 ± 9.7%, n.s.; 4 weeks: 132.4 ± 10.34%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). No obvious change in microglial morphology was observed at 2 days or 1 week relative to contralateral control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At 4 weeks, microglia exhibited an amoeboid morphology, indicative of active inflammation. Similarly, expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP was unchanged in the SGZ and hilus at 2 days post-injection, slightly increased at 1 week, and greatly increased at 4 weeks (F<sub>treatment x time</sub>(2,19)=91.0, p&lt;0.001; 2 days: 21.6 ± 8.7%, n.s.; 1 week: 25.2 ± 8.1%, p&lt;0.05; 4 weeks: 165.5 ± 8.7%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Ongoing inflammation within the neurogenic niche at the 4 week time point could exert some level of chronic toxicity on mature cells at this time point despite there being no observable loss of mature BrdU+ 8-week-old cells 1 week after viral injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further rule out a bystander effect that would result from inflammation or other non-cell-intrinsic processes, we injected 30 nL of 5 <sc>e</sc>12 gc/mL AAV1-Syn-NES-jRGECO1a into the DG. Histology demonstrated incomplete loss of DCX labeling that faithfully followed the boundaries of transgene expression even at this small volume, with DCX cells within the area of viral spread lost and uninfected cells located microns away from those expressing jRGECO1a spared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These findings suggest that AAV-induced toxicity may be cell autonomous and is unlikely to be mediated by astrocyte- or microglia-activated immune responses or by inflammatory signals and other indirect or local changes within the niche. Additionally, we found that rAAV-induced toxicity was not altered in Sting knockout mice and, therefore, likely not dependent on foreign nucleic acid detection through Sting-mediated pathways (BrdU: −90.2% ± 14.2, p&lt;0.001; Tbr2: −88.7 ± 12.9%, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>rAAV induces toxicity in NPCs in vitro</title><p>To further explore whether rAAV-mediated toxicity is cell-autonomous, we developed an in vitro assay to study rAAV-induced elimination of NPCs.

AAV retro is a designer AAV variant capsid optimized to be taken up by axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). We used AAV retro (AAVretro-CaMKIIa::NES-jRGECO1a) to deliver jRGECO1a to DGCs in a retrograde fashion by injecting virus into the dorsal CA3, where their axons (‘mossy fibers’) terminate. This delivery method allowed us to avoid infecting immature DGCs whose mossy fiber projections do not reach CA3 until after 2 weeks of age, a time point when these neurons also demonstrate decreased susceptibility to rAAV-induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following viral injection, a cranial window was implanted to permit visualization of DGC activity via two-photon calcium imaging (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Histology performed following two-photon calcium imaging confirmed that adult neurogenesis was intact 2 weeks after injection relative to the uninjected contralateral hippocampus (Tbr2: +4.7 ± 7.0%, t(5)=0.7, n.s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>; DCX +14.3 ± 6.3%, t(5)=4.3, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). Spontaneous calcium activity was recorded in DGCs and quantified in these mice under head fixation on a cylindrical treadmill in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). A similar number of DGCs was identified across animals (255.3 ± 20.5 cells/DG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Total activity of these cells was demonstrated to be sparse (282.9 ±104.5 events/minute; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Approximately one quarter of the cells were active in any given minute during imaging (24.3 ± 7.6% cells active/minute; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), with a small number of calcium transients per active cell observed per minute (2.0 ± 0.4 events/active cell/minute; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). The limited activity of DGCs measured in our study with AAV retro is consistent with previous imaging studies in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>).

Despite this limitation, a small suppressive effect of AAV1 injection on DG activity was already evident by 2-photon imaging 2 weeks post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), when DG imaging is often initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>). No change in cFOS expression due to AAV1 was observed at this earlier time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that (1) delivery of AAV directly into the DG ablates neurogenesis and influences activity in this network, particularly at time points when abDGCs make a strong contribution to DG function, and (2) AAV retro enables delivery of transgenes to the DG, permitting studies of DGC function in vivo while leaving adult neurogenesis intact.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A developmental window for sensitivity to rAAV-induced toxicity</title><p>We demonstrate that adult murine NPCs and immature neurons up to approximately 1 week of age are eliminated by rAAV in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This is consistent with our findings that the timing of rAAV-induced apoptosis and cell loss (hours to days) is not commensurate with the time course or spatial extent of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>) and is independent of exposure to empty capsids, which lack ITRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Analysis with FACS demonstrated that administration of high-dose ITR oligonucleotides resulted in a disproportionate loss of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). To a large extent, this finding seems to recapitulate in vivo experiments, which demonstrate that a developmental window exists where actively dividing Type 2 NPCs and recently post-mitotic immature neurons are sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death, whereas rarely dividing neural stem cells and mature abDGCs flanking this window are significantly less affected. However, future in vivo studies using techniques that permit viral free delivery of large oligomers, approaching the size of ITRs, are required to establish sufficiency of ITR toxicity in vivo.</p><p>Note that the persistence of Sox2 expression in dividing Type 2a progenitors may account for the initial modest decrease seen in the number of Sox2+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kempermann et al., 2015</xref>). Why these cells do not replenish the Tbr2+ pool following rAAV infection remains unknown. One possibility is that Type I cells infected with rAAV undergo delayed apoptosis upon entering the cell cycle, precluding the recovery of neurogenesis after infection. However, few Sox2+ cells were lost over the course of 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and triple labeled Sox2+GFP+caspase3+ cells 1 week after viral injection were exceedingly rare. Alternatively, delayed inflammation observed in our experiments 1 month after rAAV injection could create a non-permissive environment for neurogenesis and could explain the inability of Sox2 cells to replenish the Tbr2 and DCX cell populations. However, both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that inflammation does not account for the initial elimination of dividing NPCs by AAV.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>rAAV as a model system for viral toxicity in the developing CNS</title><p>Infections involving a number of viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Zika, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of microcephaly, the abnormal development of the cerebral cortex resulting in small head size. There is evidence that these viruses cause microcephaly through the elimination of NPC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devakumar et al., 2018</xref>) in HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balinang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>), CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teissier et al., 2014</xref>), and Zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qian et al., 2016</xref>) among others. However, the complex biology of these viruses and their neural progenitor targets has precluded elucidation of a precise mechanism, despite the association between these viruses and microcephaly being known for over 75 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Swan et al., 1946</xref>). Perhaps the best studied among these is Zika virus, which, similar to rAAV, attenuates proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse DG, demonstrating a marked loss of EdU+ cells following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These findings resemble the loss of proliferating cells in brain organoids and other models of the developing nervous system in response to Zika infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cugola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qian et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these studies have focused on Zika virus’ selective tropism for Sox2+ and Nestin+ NPCs over Tbr2<sup>+</sup> and other immature cell types in the brain. However, these studies typically measure the fraction of Zika-infected cells that express Sox2, Tbr2, and other immature markers, but do not track changes in the total size of these populations resulting from Zika infection. These measurements could have missed a rapid elimination of Tbr2 cells, which in our measurements was apparent within 48 hr of rAAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,K</xref>). Alternatively, the proliferative capacity and thus the susceptibility of the Sox2+ population to viral infection could differ between developmental models and the adult DG, where in adult neurogenesis Sox2+ cells are largely quiescent and perhaps less sensitive to virus-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Further studies are needed to discern the downstream events that lead to viral toxicity and whether this heterogeneous collection of viruses kills dividing NPCs through a common pathway. While a detailed mechanism for virus-induced toxicity in NPCs remains elusive, rAAV, with its exceedingly simple genome, broad tropism, and inability to replicate, offers a tractable model system to dissect the molecular events underlying this important phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for DG and hippocampal function</title><p>Both theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the DG is involved in hippocampus-dependent behavioral pattern separation and pattern completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chawla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lacy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>).

Moreover, DG activity and computations appear to depend on the addition of abDGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clelland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ikrar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>), whose net effect is to quiet activity in mature DGCs and the rest of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berdugo-Vega et al., 2020</xref>). This inhibition on mature DGCs through either monosynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luna et al., 2019</xref>) or polysynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jinde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Toni et al., 2008</xref>) is thought to enhance pattern separation by selectively suppressing competing engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Espinoza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McAvoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this idea, rAAV-induced ablation of neurogenesis results in a dose-dependent increase in mature DGC activity 4 weeks after infection, as measured by immediate early gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In the majority of studies in which rAAV was injected into the DG, neurogenesis was not assessed following viral transduction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sparks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Song et al., 2012</xref> for instances where neurogenesis is assessed). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Song et al., 2012</xref> were able to observe and quantify Type I Nestin+ radial glia-like cells in the DG 4 weeks after AAV injection (other NPC or immature neuronal markers were not measured). Only ~2–6% of radial glia-like cells were dividing in these experiments, consistent with our measurements showing that Sox2+ cells at this time-point are resistant to AAV toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sparks et al., 2020</xref> reported in vivo calcium imaging of adult-born and mature DGCs using rAAV for delivery of GCaMP6. In this paradigm, abDGCs were labeled via Tamoxifen administration in a Nestin-CreER x tdTomato reporter mouse 3 weeks before rAAV injection into the DG at titers of ~1 <sc>e</sc>13 gc/mL. Imaging took place 3 weeks later, when tdTomato-labeled cells were ~6 weeks of age. This paradigm would permit tdTomato-labeled abDGCs that were 3 weeks of age at the time of rAAV injection and 6 weeks old at imaging to largely escape rAAV-induced toxicity. However, the loss of abDGCs ~4 weeks old and younger and their contribution to activity in the DG might have been missed.</p><p>The retrograde labeling of DGCs by injecting AAV retro into CA3 provides an important advance for future studies of the DG, as DGCs can now be imaged and manipulated using genetic tools while leaving adult neurogenesis intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Relatively few studies have performed calcium imaging of the DG in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>). Variability in experimental approaches used to deliver genetically encoded calcium indicators to DGCs and inevitable differences in segmentation routines and analysis of calcium traces make direct comparison with these published results difficult.

Given the steep dose response of rAAV-induced cell death measured in our study, intravenous administration of rAAVs at clinically relevant titers is less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach the SGZ of the DG with sufficient MOI to ablate neurogenesis. However, the protective capacity of the BBB does not preclude AAV-induced toxicity in other progenitor and dividing cells throughout the body. Further studies are needed to characterize rAAV-induced toxicity to stem cells and progenitor cells in other tissues. Also, high MOI may reach the SGZ in clinical trials where rAAV is injected intrathecally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017</xref>) or directly into brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tuszynski et al., 2015</xref>).

This study serves as an additional reminder that rAAV and other viral gene therapies may be associated with significant side effects, particularly during development. Careful consideration of viral titer, delivery method, and viral engineering should be exercised to mitigate side effects where viral therapy may substantially alleviate morbidity or extend life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Salk Institute and the University of California San Diego, and all experiments were conducted according to the US Public Health Service guidelines for animal research.

Calcium traces were extracted by first performing image stabilization for each video using a rigid alignment, maximizing the correlation coefficient between each frame of the movie with an average reference frame constructed from 20 to 30 frames acquired when the mouse was not running. Alignment was further improved using a line-by-line alignment. Portions of the movie with excessive movement artifact, defined by cross-correlation coefficients below a defined threshold, were discarded. Mice were not trained or rewarded for running on the treadmill and thus were stationary during the majority of the presented calcium imaging data. Automated cell segmentation was achieved by scanning a ring shape of variable thickness and size across a motion corrected reference image. When the cross-correlation metric exceeded a user-adjustable threshold, a circular shaped ROI was generated and the signal extracted. User input was then taken for each video to remove a small number of false positives and labeled cells that evaded automatic classification. Once each cell was labeled and the intensities were recorded, the baseline fluorescence (F) was fit to an exponential curve to eliminate photo-bleaching effects. The change in fluorescence (ΔF) over the baseline fluorescence (F) was then calculated to yield %ΔF/F.

For confocal images, Z-stacks were obtained through the entirety of the DGC layer, tiles were stitched using Zen software (Zeiss), and images were maximum projected for quantification. Slide scanner images were obtained from a single plane. For markers quantified by cell counts (BrdU, TBR2, SOX2, CASPASE3), counting was performed manually. For markers quantified by fluorescent intensity (DCX, IBA1, GFAP), a region of interest was drawn in Zen software, and the average intensity over that region was recorded. For DCX, the region of interest included the full DGC layer and SGZ. Background autofluorescence was corrected by recording the intensity of a neighboring region of CA3 or hilus devoid of DCX+ cells. For IBA1 and GFAP, the region of interest was the SGZ and hilus, bounded by the inner edge of the granule cell layer and a line drawn between the endpoints of the two blades. No background correction was performed for inflammation markers due to the relatively complete tiling of glia throughout the hippocampus. For each brain, two to five images were quantified per side. A blinded observer quantified all images.</p><p>Images for analysis of pyknosis and karyorrhexis were obtained on an Airyscan 880 microscope using a 40× objective.

Cell cultures underwent regular testing for the presence of Mycoplasma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vitro rAAV transduction and time lapse imaging</title><p>NPCs were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 10 k cells/well for 24 hr. At 24 hr, medium was changed and supplemented with propidium iodide (1 μg/mL). To serve as baseline, two sets of images were acquired 4 hr apart in bright field and red-fluorescence: five images per well, eight wells per treatment, for five treatments, on an IncuCyte S3 Live Cell Analysis System (Essen Biosciences, Salk Stem Cell Core and UCSD Human Embryonic Stem Cell Core). AAV1-CAG-flex-eGFP stock was serially diluted into sterile PBS (Corning, 21–040-CMR) with an initial MOI at 1 e7, 1 e6, 1 e5, 1 e4. Equal volumes of viral solution or PBS, &lt;1% of the total volume of each well, were added to wells with established cells. MOIs were calculated by dividing total viral particles added per well (1 <sc>e</sc>11, 1 <sc>e</sc>10, 1 <sc>e</sc>9, and 1 <sc>e8</sc> and zero viral particles, respectively) divided by the initial seeding density of 10 k cells/well; the in vitro estimate for MOI inflates the number of viral genomes per cell compared to the in vivo estimate for two reasons. First, cells were allowed to proliferate for 28 hr (approximately a 2–3× increase in cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) before adding virus. Second, in vitro viral particles were distributed throughout the growth media and stochastic diffusion was likely to act as a rate-limiting step to viral entry, whereas in vivo viral adsorption was more likely to act as the rate-limiting step to viral entry. Images were then acquired every 4 hr for 60 hr.

AAV2 ITRs or a sequence largely homologous with the AAV2 ITR sequence were used in the vast majority of rAAV plasmids. Twenty-four-well plates were segregated for imaging and FACS experiments. Imaging plates were supplemented with propidium iodide and images were acquired on an IncuCyte S3 Live Cell Analysis System as follows: 16 images per well, four wells per replicate, three replicates per treatment, for five treatments, every 3 hr for 60 hr. Data were extracted using Incucyte Analysis software using the same mask definition obtained above. NPCs from FACS plates were collected in PBS at 12, 24, and 36 hr using Accutase.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below, additional experiments are required before it can be published.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;.

Also in vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive for a prolonged period of time. To circumvent these effects and transduce the dentate gyrus (DG) while keeping adult neurogenesis intact, injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3 was shown to result in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs.</p><p>This paper reports on an important tool for neuroscience and stem cell biology in general, and studies AAV effects in a multidisciplinary manner with extensive experimental detail; the approaches selected all provide relevant information, most (contralateral, etc) controls are done and they have tested an extensive time series and different concentrations; the data is solid, convincing and relevant and as such, warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential Revisions:<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) One minor issue not discussed much now is their use of isoflurane and dexamethasone during surgery (p.25). Both compounds are well known to alter/suppress neurogenesis per se and while the authors show the virus has not introduced lasting inflammatory responses (based on late microglia markers), and while contralateral controls were done, viral application has occurred in the context of stress and selective GR activation, local insult and immunosuppression, which could at least possibly, have contributed to (changes in) the properties (Fitzsimons MP 2013; Lucassen CSHPB 2015) and selective vulnerability of the NPC and DGC populations, or their local environment, i.e. the adult DGCs. As they do compare 'positive' stimuli like exercise and enrichment, possible effects of suppressive stimuli like stress and immune suppression, deserve to be discussed as well.</p><p>2) The authors do not show now whether AAV has actually targeted the different cell types in vivo directly, or whether the current effects may possibly arise from indirect, local effects.</p><p>3) In this respect, also the prolonged hyperactivity of the remaining DG cells indicates that at least the local surroundings of the NPCs have been altered, which could potentially affect chances of survival for new cells born in that context. This, and the reasons for the remaining hyperactivity, could be discussed some more; several hypotheses have been proposed in literature.</p><p>4) Are differences between dorsal and ventral hippocampus involved?<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In vivo studies. This paper describes a strong and unexpected decline in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells in adult mouse hippocampus following injection of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) in the dentate gyrus. The decline in these cells is very rapid (within 18 hours post-injection of AAV) and persistent. Mature dentate gyrus neurons express c-fos at 4 weeks post-injection of AAV, a sign that they are hyperactive. An early decline in Tbr2 cells (within 18 – 24 hours after AAV delivery) is followed 4 weeks later by an inflammatory response. Transduction of adult dentate granule cells with AAV2retro has no deleterious effects. These observations are an indication that AAV-mediated transduction of cells in the dentate gyrus interferes with neurogenesis and results in changes in hippocampal circuitry, whereas selective transduction of only adult dentate granule cells via the retrograde route has no negative effect on neurons in the dentate gyrus.</p><p>What is lacking in these in vivo studies is evidence that the AAV serotypes used are indeed transducing the early (<italic>Sox2</italic>), middle (Tbr2) and late (DCX+) stage cells in the dentate gyrus. This is important for the interpretation of the data. The number of <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells was hardy reduced following AAV injection and this is taken as evidence that these cells are resistant to AAV toxicity. However an alternative explanation could be that these cells are not or poorly transduced by AAV1 or AAV8. Most Tbr2 cells disappear acutely within 48 hours after AAV delivery, whereas DCX cells decline gradually. This is interpreted as a failure of the Tbr2 cells to replenish the DCX cell population (discussion page 19, lines 5 to 17). An alternative explanation could be that this difference is caused by a differential sensitivity to AAV or differential transduction efficiencies of these two populations of immature neurons by AAV.</p><p>The early decline in Tbr2 cells is followed 4 weeks later by an inflammatory response. Is this inflammatory response the result of the death of immature neurons or is this a response to AAV? Could the inflammation in the dentate gyrus create a non-permissive environment for neurogenesis and could this be the reason for the failure of the <italic>Sox2</italic> cells to replenish the Tbr2 and DCX cell populations? These issues should be discussed in the discussion.</p><p>in vitro studies. In search for the mechanism underlying AAV-mediated death of NPCs, a separate set of in vitro studies were performed that show that transfection of AAV-ITRs is sufficient to induce cell death in cultured embryonic hippocampal mouse NPCs. This observation is in line with a previous report by Hirsch et al. (2011) showing that a 40 nucleotide G-quadruplex rich telomere-like sequence in the AAV-ITR triggers an apoptotic response specifically in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells. It remains unclear, however, whether ITR-induced apoptosis is responsible for the selective death of Tbr2+ cells in the adult hippocampus as observed in the in vivo studies.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The findings are very interesting and provide further evidence for the risks associated with the use of rAAV vectors, especially for human gene therapy, and for this reason, are relevant for a broad audience. The manuscript is well written and although complex, easy to read and follow. however, there are a number of points that require the authors' attention.</p><p>Some of the data presented in the initial figures of the paper require improvement as they at points, contradict later figures:</p><p>1. At the beginning of the Results section, the authors state that transduction with rAAVs resulted in ablation of adult neurogenesis. This seems like a conclusion, as the images presented in Sup figure 1 are DCX+ cells and these are not quantified. It would be more careful to refer to DCX+ numbers rather than to adult neurogenesis. In the same line, the authors state that the effect they observe was robust regardless of production facility, purification method, promoter used, etc…This could be rephrased as these factors were not independent of each other, at least as the data is presented in Sup Figure 1 (three production methods tested at Salk, unknown production method at U Penn, AAV8 used at Salk, AAv1 at U Penn). Finally, the authors mention they have also tested AAV9, but the data is not shown. All these points make the Sup Figure 1 feels somewhat disorganized and confusing. What do the Bule and red symbols in Sup Figure 1B represent?</p><p>2. In figure 1 the authors concentrate on the effect of transduction with rAAVs on the survival of cells previously labeled by BrdU. However, I could not find any indication that BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were actually transduced with the rAAVs in Figure 1 B/D. Are BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells positive for GFP? To which percentage? This should be quantified to support the later claims of cell-intrinsic effects.</p><p>3. The effects of transduction with rAAV on cell survival were all quantified in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells. As some toxicity of BrdU administration on neural precursors has been reported before (e.g. Caldwell et al., 2005; Kolb JNS99), it can not be discarded that the reported effects may be, at least in part, the results of a combined toxicity induced by the combination of BrdU and transduction with rAAV. To discard this possibility the authors could use a different birthdating/labeling method, preferably genetic, to avoid additional toxicity. This point seems particularly important as the main effect on cell loss is on proliferating Tbr2+ cells (&quot;proliferating cells are the main target of the virus&quot;, page 9).</p><p>4. On page 10 the authors state that there was no effect on the expression of the microglia marker Iba1 until 4 weeks p.i. This seems contradictory with the data presented in Sup Figure 1 in which the authors show that transduction with AAV8-CaMKiia-NES-jRGECO (Salk Viral Core – CsCl purification) demonstrated variability in magnitude but consistency in direction of Iba1+ microglia activation. Could the authors please clarify this apparent contradiction?</p><p>5. On page 10, the authors describe no obvious change in microglia morphology 2 days or 1 week p.i. Where is this shown and how was this quantified? Similarly, on page 11 the authors state that at 4 weeks microglia exhibited an ameboid morphology. Where is this shown?</p><p>6. The water (H20) control used in the in vitro experiments presented in figure 3 seems questionable. Usually, in this kind of experiments virus are resuspended in culture medium to avoid changes in Ph, salinity, etc in the cell culture. Which was the volume used to dissolve the viral suspensions? Could these additions have had consequences on the composition of the cell culture medium? Please clarify this technical point.</p><p>7. The authors show that the rAAVs may be toxic for NPSc and immature neurons derived from them, but there is no information presented on the effect of transduction with rAAvs on mature dentate granule neurons, neither of embryonic origin nor originated from adult neurogenesis. The authors should present data on the effects on these relevant cell types.</p><p>8. Is transduction with rAAV also toxic for CA3 neurons? This is an important point regarding the concerns the authors' data raise on the general applicability of AAVS fro human gene therapy.</p><p>9. The hypothesis that infected Type 1 cells undergo apoptosis, precluding neurogenesis, is testable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59291.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) One minor issue not discussed much now is their use of isoflurane and dexamethasone during surgery.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we examined the effect of similar surgeries, including the use of isoflurane and dexamethasone, on activity-dependent development of adult-born dentate granule cell (DGC) dendritic arbors, which showed no discernible effects from anesthesia or surgical procedure conditions (Goncalves et al., Nat. Neuroscience 2016, Supplementary Figure 8,9). However, we agree that there is relevant literature indicating that there could be “selective vulnerability of the NPC and DGC populations” to these experimental manipulations. On page 2 and page 13 of the revised manuscript, we discuss the “possible effects of suppressive stimuli like stress and immune suppression.”</p><p>These stem cells and their immature progeny are sensitive to environmental stimuli; their proliferation, development, and survival are regulated by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including experience, stress, inflammation, and pharmacologic agents.</p><p>In any surgical manipulation of the DG, including our studies, abDGCs are exposed to a variety of experimental manipulations that might affect adult neurogenesis, including anesthesia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids utilized for animal comfort and humane experimentation (Cameron and Gould, 1994; Erasso et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2020; Lehmann et al., 2013; McGuiness et al., 2017; Monje et al., 2003; Saaltink and Vreugdenhil, 2014; Schoenfeld and Gould, 2013; Stratmann et al., 2009, 2010). The effects of these pharmacological agents are largely accounted for by performing intra-subject comparisons where the uninjected or saline-injected contralateral hippocampus is also exposed to these agents. Previous work indicates that these compounds have no significant effect on the development of dendritic arbors in abDGCs, which are sensitive to experience (Gonçalves et al., 2016a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors do not show now whether AAV has actually targeted the different cell types in vivo directly, or whether the current effects may possibly arise from indirect, local effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The concerns regarding the lack of direct demonstration of viral transduction and the possible role of differences in viral tropism across the different cell types described in the study were shared among the reviewers. As described in the manuscript, the cell populations most vulnerable to AAV infection, including recently labeled BrdU+ cells and Tbr2 + cells, are eliminated within 48 hours of infection. In fact, our unpublished data indicate that these populations are almost entirely absent at 24 hours post-infection. This timeframe does not provide enough time for sufficient expression of AAV-delivered transgenes and, as a result, there is no straightforward method for accurate demonstration and quantification of infection in vulnerable cell populations prior to elimination.</p><p>Despite this limitation, we were able to address the question of whether some cell types might avoid AAV toxicity through a “decreased sensitivity to AAV or differential transduction” (Reviewer #2). We performed experiments delivering AAV expressing GFP into the dentate gyrus and measured the percentage of sox2+, DCX+, and Tbr2+ cells in the subgranular zone that express GFP 1 week after viral injection. These experiments demonstrate that the majority of sox2+ cells remaining 1 week after rAAV infection (the minimal time required for reliable GFP protein expression) are GFP positive and that these cells survive despite being infected by rAAV. Overall, we observed an increasing percentage of GFP-expressing cells with increasing survival across the three populations, suggesting that differences in viral tropism are not likely to explain the measurable differences in AAV toxicity (page 5, Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). However, due to strong survivor bias, particularly with Tbr2+ and DCX+ cells, we are not able to accurately quantify transduction efficiency across cell-types.</p><p>We addressed the question of “indirect, local effects” in Supplementary Figure 2I of the original manuscript (now Figure 2—figure supplement 2E), where 30 nanoliter AAV injections were performed in the dentate gyrus. These experiments demonstrate loss of “DCX cells within the area of viral spread” and sparing of “uninfected cells located microns away from those expressing jRGECO1a”. We have edited the description slightly on page 7 to emphasize indirect and local effects:</p><p>“These findings suggest that AAV-induced toxicity may be cell autonomous and is unlikely to be mediated by astrocyte- or microglia-activated immune responses or by inflammatory signals and other indirect or local changes within the niche”</p><p>In addition, dose-dependent AAV-induced toxicity was observed in vitro, again suggesting that indirect and local effects arising from the niche or cells other than NPCs are unlikely to mediate AAV-induced toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In this respect, also the prolonged hyperactivity of the remaining DG cells indicates that at least the local surroundings of the NPCs have been altered, which could potentially affect chances of survival for new cells born in that context. This, and the reasons for the remaining hyperactivity, could be discussed some more; several hypotheses have been proposed in literature.</p></disp-quote><p>As we demonstrated in the manuscript, neurogenesis is essentially absent 4 weeks after “high dose” (3E12 gc/ml) AAV injection, when hyperactivity is observed in mature DGCs. While we agree that hyperactivity resulting 4 weeks after partial ablation of neurogenesis using intermediate doses of AAV (1 E12 gc/ml) could potentially enhance the survival of DGCs born around or slightly before the period of hyperactivity, there is a significant amount of inflammation 4 weeks after injection that would attenuate neurogenesis, even at intermediate doses. Thus, there is likely to be a complex combination of effects and we cannot comment with any confidence about the “chances of survival for new cells born in that context”. With regards to reasons for DG hyperactivity, we have updated the discussion (page 11) to read:</p><p>“Moreover, DG activity and computations appear to depend on the addition of abDGCs (Clelland et al., 2009; Ikrar et al., 2013; Sahay et al., 2011), whose net effect is to quiet activity in mature DGCs and the rest of the hippocampus (Berdugo-Vega et al., 2020). This inhibition on mature DGCs through either monosynaptic (Luna et al., 2019) or polysynaptic inhibition (Jinde et al., 2013; Toni et al., 2008) is thought to enhance pattern separation by selectively suppressing competing engrams (Espinoza et al., 2018; Johnston et al., 2016; McAvoy et al., 2016; Sahay et al., 2011). Consistent with this idea, rAAV-induced ablation of neurogenesis results in a dose-dependent increase in mature DGC activity 4 weeks after infection, as measured by immediate early gene expression (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are differences between dorsal and ventral hippocampus involved?</p></disp-quote><p>Viral transduction was detected throughout the dorsal dentate gyrus and typically spread to the intermediate dentate gyrus (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1E), a region that some delineate as ventral dentate gyrus (Piatti et al., J. Neurosci 2011, Hawley and Leasure, Hippocampus 2011). We saw no obvious differences in rAAV-induced toxicity along the extent of the viral spread.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In vivo <italic>studies. This paper describes a strong and unexpected decline in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells in adult mouse hippocampus following injection of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) in the dentate gyrus. The decline in these cells is very rapid (within 18 hours post-injection of AAV) and persistent. Mature dentate gyrus neurons express c-fos at 4 weeks post-injection of AAV, a sign that they are hyperactive. An early decline in Tbr2 cells (within 18 – 24 hours after AAV delivery) is followed 4 weeks later by an inflammatory response. Transduction of adult dentate granule cells with AAV2retro has no deleterious effects. These observations are an indication that AAV-mediated transduction of cells in the dentate gyrus interferes with neurogenesis and results in changes in hippocampal circuitry, whereas selective transduction of only adult dentate granule cells via the retrograde route has no negative effect on neurons in the dentate gyrus.</italic></p><p>What is lacking in these in vivo studies is evidence that the AAV serotypes used are indeed transducing the early (Sox2), middle (Tbr2) and late (DCX+) stage cells in the dentate gyrus.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Reviewer #1, concern #2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is important for the interpretation of the data. The number of Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells was hardy reduced following AAV injection and this is taken as evidence that these cells are resistant to AAV toxicity. However an alternative explanation could be that these cells are not or poorly transduced by AAV1 or AAV8. Most Tbr2 cells disappear acutely within 48 hours after AAV delivery, whereas DCX cells decline gradually. This is interpreted as a failure of the Tbr2 cells to replenish the DCX cell population.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell-mediated inflammatory responses and toxicity due to recombinant AAV transduction have been described previously in other brain regions devoid of neurogenesis (Hadaczek et al. Hum Gene Therapy. 2009 , Cieseilska et al. Mol Ther. 2013), indicating that the ablation of neurogenesis is not required for inducing subsequent inflammation. However, it could be a contributing factor that enhances the inflammation observed in this brain region. We certainly agree that inflammation could create a “non-permissive environment for neurogenesis and could… be the reason for the failure of the Sox2 cells to replenish the Tbr2 and DCX cell populations”. On page 10 of the discussion, we include the statement:</p><p>“Alternatively, delayed inflammation observed in our experiments 1 month after rAAV injection could create a non-permissive environment for neurogenesis and could explain the inability of Sox2 cells to replenish the Tbr2 and DCX cell populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It remains unclear, however, whether ITR-induced apoptosis is responsible for the selective death of Tbr2+ cells in the adult hippocampus as observed in the in vivo studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We are eagerly and actively exploring approaches to definitively answer this question in the laboratory. However, it remains a significant technical challenge to deliver oligomers greater than 30 base pairs in length reliably to neurons in vivo. Such experiments are required to demonstrate sufficiency in vivo. However, experiments transducing with empty capsids do demonstrate that ITRs are indeed necessary for ablation of Tbr2+ cells in vivo (Figure 2F). There are a number of proprietary lipid carriers that have been developed for mRNA vaccines, including COVID-19, that we would like to test as non-viral vectors to deliver ITRs in the rodent brain. Currently, these experiments are technically challenging and are likely a few years away. We have revised the manuscript to highlight this limitation in our study (page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The findings are very interesting and provide further evidence for the risks associated with the use of rAAV vectors, especially for human gene therapy, and for this reason, are relevant for a broad audience. The manuscript is well written and although complex, easy to read and follow. however, there are a number of points that require the authors' attention.</p><p>Some of the data presented in the initial figures of the paper require improvement as they at points, contradict later figures:</p><p>1. At the beginning of the Results section, the authors state that transduction with rAAVs resulted in ablation of adult neurogenesis. This seems like a conclusion, as the images presented in Sup figure 1 are DCX+ cells and these are not quantified. It would be more careful to refer to DCX+ numbers rather than to adult neurogenesis. In the same line, the authors state that the effect they observe was robust regardless of production facility, purification method, promoter used, etc…This could be rephrased as these factors were not independent of each other, at least as the data is presented in Sup Figure 1 (three production methods tested at Salk, unknown production method at U Penn, AAV8 used at Salk, AAv1 at U Penn). Finally, the authors mention they have also tested AAV9, but the data is not shown. All these points make the Sup Figure 1 feels somewhat disorganized and confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified and revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1 based on the feedback from Reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In figure 1 the authors concentrate on the effect of transduction with rAAVs on the survival of cells previously labeled by BrdU. However, I could not find any indication that BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were actually transduced with the rAAVs in Figure 1 B/D. Are BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells positive for GFP? To which percentage? This should be quantified to support the later claims of cell-intrinsic effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Reviewer #1, concern #2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The effects of transduction with rAAV on cell survival were all quantified in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells. As some toxicity of BrdU administration on neural precursors has been reported before (e.g. Caldwell et al., 2005; Kolb JNS99), it can not be discarded that the reported effects may be, at least in part, the results of a combined toxicity induced by the combination of BrdU and transduction with rAAV.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this concern with new experiments described on page 5 of the revised manuscript, which show significant loss of Tbr2+ and DCX+ cells in the absence of BrdU administration.</p><p>Significant loss of Tbr2+ and DCX+ cells occurred even in the most conservative experimental conditions, in which BrdU was absent (to prevent any synergistic toxicity between rAAV and BrdU) and when saline was injected contralaterally (to mimic any physical disruption due to the injection process itself) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. On page 10 the authors state that there was no effect on the expression of the microglia marker Iba1 until 4 weeks p.i. This seems contradictory with the data presented in Sup Figure 1 in which the authors show that transduction with AAV8-CaMKiia-NES-jRGECO (Salk Viral Core – CsCl purification) demonstrated variability in magnitude but consistency in direction of Iba1+ microglia activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our early experiments demonstrated that the inflammatory response was highly variable at 2 weeks, with some mice showing clear signs of microglia proliferation and others showing no increase in iba1 staining (see 4th example in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A from Penn Vector core). However, we did not perform systematic experiments at this time point. We have clarified this variability observed at the 2-week time point in the manuscript (page 6).</p><p>“Variable inflammatory response was observed with different viral preparations, particularly around the intermediate time point of 2 weeks (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.). However, rapid (&lt; 48 hours) loss of NPCs (Figure 2) occurred independent of expression of the microglial marker Iba1, which did not increase until 4 weeks post-injection”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. On page 10, the authors describe no obvious change in microglia morphology 2 days or 1 week p.i. Where is this shown and how was this quantified? Similarly, on page 11 the authors state that at 4 weeks microglia exhibited an ameboid morphology. Where is this shown?</p></disp-quote><p>Example images demonstrating changes in microglia morphology are now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The water (H20) control used in the in vitro experiments presented in figure 3 seems questionable. Usually, in this kind of experiments virus are resuspended in culture medium to avoid changes in Ph, salinity, etc in the cell culture. Which was the volume used to dissolve the viral suspensions? Could these additions have had consequences on the composition of the cell culture medium?</p></disp-quote><p>The control condition was listed as water (H20) in error and was indeed sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The manuscript has been corrected to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors show that the rAAVs may be toxic for NPSc and immature neurons derived from them, but there is no information presented on the effect of transduction with rAAvs on mature dentate granule neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1B demonstrates that cells labeled with BrdU and born 8 weeks prior to AAV injection, which is widely recognized as a time point of full maturity for adult-born dentate granule cells (Laplagne et al., PloS Biol. 2006, Piatti et al., Front Neurosci. 2013), exhibit no discernible toxicity 1 week post infection. This approach provides perhaps the most rigorous method to unambiguously identify and label mature dentate granule cells with a definitive age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The hypothesis that infected Type 1 cells undergo apoptosis, precluding neurogenesis, is testable.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we stained hippocampal slices from mice infected with AAV expressing GFP and sacrificed 1 week later (see response to Reviewer #1 concern #2) for Sox2 and caspase3 to identify sox2+GFP+caspase3+ cells. As described in the manuscript, loss of Sox2 cells was not detectable at 1 week (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), and triple labeled sox2+GFP+caspase3+ were exceedingly rare. Thus, while we cannot rule out the hypothesis, there is no evidence of Type 1 cells undergoing apoptosis at this time point (described on page 10 of revised manuscript).</p><p>“However, few sox2+ cells were lost over the course of 4 weeks (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure 2c) and triple labeled sox2+GFP+caspase3+ cells 1 week after viral injection were exceedingly rare.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
