Its important involvement in immune responses has been suggested such as in the macrophages’ phagocytosis process. However, the endogenous signaling cascades controlling the gating of TRPV2 remain to be understood. Here, we report that enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably alters the chemical and thermal sensitivities of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. We identify that the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 mediates TRPV2 phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(335), Tyr(471), and Tyr(525). JAK1 phosphorylation is required for maintaining TRPV2 activity and the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We further show that TRPV2 phosphorylation is dynamically balanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). PTPN1 inhibition increases TRPV2 phosphorylation, further reducing the activation temperature threshold. Our data thus unveil an intrinsic mechanism where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dynamic balance sets the basal chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2. Targeting this pathway will aid therapeutic interventions in physiopathological contexts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the cells in our body have a membrane that separates their interior from the outside environment. However, studded across this barrier are numerous ion channels which allow the cell to sense and react to changes in its surroundings. This includes the ion channel TRPV2, which opens in response to mechanical pressure, certain chemical signals, or rising temperature levels.</p><p>Many types of cell express TRPV2, including cells in the nervous system, muscle, and the immune system. However, despite being extensively studied, it is still not clear how TRPV2 opens and closes upon encountering high temperatures. In particular, previous work suggested that TRPV2 only responds when a cell’s surroundings reach around 52°C, which is a much higher temperature than cells inside our body normally encounter, even during a fever.</p><p>To help resolve this mystery, Mo, Pang et al. studied TRPV2 in neurons responsible for sending sensory information and in immune cells called macrophages which had been extracted from rodents and grown in the laboratory. They found that when the cells were bathed in solutions containing magnesium ions, their TRPV2 channels were more sensitive to a number of different cues, including temperature.</p><p>Further biochemical experiments showed that magnesium ions do not directly affect TRPV2, but increase the activity of another protein called JAK1. The magnesium ions caused JAK1 to attach specialized structures called phosphorylation tags to TRPV2. This modification (known as phosphorylation) made the channel more sensitive, allowing it to open in response to temperatures as low as 40°C.</p><p>Mo, Pang et al. found that inhibiting JAK1 reduced the activity of TRPV2. Conversely, inhibiting the enzyme that removes the phosphorylation tags, called PTPN1, increased the channel’s activity. They also discovered that when JAK1 was blocked, macrophages were less able to ‘eat up’ bacteria, which is one of their main roles in the immune system.</p><p>Taken together these experiments advance our understanding of how TRPV2 becomes active. The balance between the phosphorylation by JAK1 and the dephosphorylation by PTPN1 controls the temperature at which TRPV2 opens. Since TRPV2 contributes to several biological functions, including the development of the nervous system, the maintenance of heart muscles, and inflammation, these findings will be important to scientists in a broad range of fields.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPV2</kwd><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>temperature gating</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31929003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2042021KF0218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007046</institution-id><institution>Wuhan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent JAK1-mediated phosphorylation sensitizes TRPV2 activity and thermo-threshold, which is counterbalanced by PTPN1-mediated dephosphorylation, highlighting a role of phosphorylation homeostasis in setting the basal activity of TRPV2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel is broadly expressed in the body, such as the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nedungadi et al., 2012</xref>), the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagasawa et al., 2007</xref>), and the muscular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zanou et al., 2015</xref>).

As TRPV2 knockout mice display normal thermal and mechanical nociception responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2011</xref>), whether TRPV2 functions as a temperature sensor or a mechanical sensor in physiology still remains in debate.</p><p>The role of TRPV2 in immune responses has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santoni et al., 2013</xref>), such as its regulation of macrophage particle binding and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>). In mast cells, TRPV2-mediated calcium flux stimulates protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent proinflammatory degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stokes et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, early studies have shown that peripheral inflammation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways enhance TRPV2 function by recruiting it onto the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimosato et al., 2005</xref>). Meanwhile, the characteristics of TRPV2 activity in endogenous immune cells require to be elucidated.</p><p>At the channel level, our recent study found that the lipid-raft-associated protein flotillin-1 interacts with and sustains the surface expression of the TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). The use dependence of the TRPV2 channel in heat sensitivity but not agonist sensitivity has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). Recently, the oxidation of TRPV2 on methionine residues was found to activate and sensitize the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fricke et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the structure of TRPV2 at near-atomic resolution has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the functional and structural insights, the endogenous signaling elements that gate TRPV2 activities remain to be further understood.</p><p>Here, we show that the regulator of phosphokinases magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) exerts an enhancing effect on both the chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages (rBMDMs). We then provide evidence that Mg<sup>2+</sup> activates the phosphokinase JAK1 to increase the phosphorylation levels of TRPV2. In contrast, JAK1 inhibition downregulates TRPV2 channel activity, which in accordance reduces the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We have also determined three JAK1 phosphorylation sites, Y335, Y471, and Y525, in TRPV2. Further, we identify that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) is the tyrosine phosphatase that mediates TRPV2 dephosphorylation. Our data unmask an endogenous signaling cascade where tyrosine phosphorylation homeostasis contributes to setting the sensitivity of TRPV2 to thermal and chemical stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> enhances both the chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2</title><p>Enriched in cell cytoplasm, Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates the function of a variety of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonov and Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obukhov and Nowycky, 2005</xref>). A couple of TRP ion channels have been reported to be modulated by a high concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore examined whether TRPV2 activity is sensitive to Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Considering that TRPV2 is abundantly and functionally expressed in macrophages where other types of TRPV channels are barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagasawa et al., 2007</xref>), we used rBMDMs as an endogenous cell system to record TRPV2 currents. We found that TRPV2 currents at –60 mV evoked by 0.3 mM 2-APB were slowly but dramatically enhanced in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The pipette solution contained 1 mM adenosine disodium triphosphate (Na<sub>2</sub>ATP). In general, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-potentiated responses typically developed over a period of about 100 s to reach a plateau. The presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> augmented the peak current amplitudes by ~19-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, the following response to 0.3 mM 2-APB was somewhat variable but still remained an ~14-fold increase from that before Mg<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). We further recorded the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 current responses in neurons. TRPV2 channels are predominantly expressed in medium- to large-sized dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons that typically express fewer TRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, we witnessed similar potentiating effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on 2-APB-evoked currents in a small population of DRG neurons, while the lack of TRPV1 expression was confirmed by the absence of responses to capsaicin, indicating these 2-APB-evoked currents were mediated by TRPV2 channels. To further investigate whether the regulatory effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 reflects a channel-inherent mechanism, we performed recordings in a variety of heterologous expression systems including HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>), CHO, Hela, and ND7/23 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) where TRPV2 was transiently expressed. Indeed, the profound enhancement of TRPV2 activity by Mg<sup>2+</sup> was observed in all expression cell lines. Additionally, we found that prolonged application of 0.3 mM 2-APB alone didn’t have a notable sensitizing effect on TRPV2 currents, while subsequent application of the same stimulus in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> produced a significant increase of the TRPV2 currents, indicating that it was Mg<sup>2+</sup> not 2-APB that sensitized TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) activities are enhanced in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mg<sup>2+</sup> potentiates 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) responses in a representative rat bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cell.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, among all the tested divalent cations, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> had a remarkable inhibition of TRPV2 currents, while Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup> enhanced the currents of TRPV2 to different degrees. Among them, Mg<sup>2+</sup> exhibited a more profound effect on enhancing the TRPV2 channel activity.</p><p>To further characterize the regulatory effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 activity, whole-cell currents were elicited by local perfusion of 0.3 mM 2-APB with varied concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was effective above 0.1 mM and remained effective up to 20 mM with a half-maximal concentration of 0.94 ± 0.04 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> of 2-APB on TRPV2 activation was shifted to 0.24 ± 0.01 mM from 0.59 ± 0.01 mM in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Additionally, we found that the inclusion of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution also increased the TRPV2 channel sensitivity to 2-APB, whereby resulting in a leftward shift of the dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>TRPV2 is a member of the temperature-sensitive ion channel. Therefore, we examined the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 thermosensitivity using laser irradiation-based temperature controlling and whole-cell recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). HEK293T cells expressing TRPV2 were held at −60 mV when the temperature jumps were delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, inset). The above experiments showed that the enhanced effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 channel requires long-term continuous treatment, however, prolonged high-temperature stimulation incurs excessive thermal stress and leads to the instability of whole-cell recordings. For such a reason, we first sensitized the TRPV2 channel by stimulating the cells with the combination of 0.3 mM 2-APB and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and then immediately applied the temperature pulses to the same cell right after completely washout 2-APB by bath solution. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–N</xref>, the pretreatment with Mg<sup>2+</sup> evidently lowered the temperature threshold in TRPV2 activation by ~6°C.

Especially, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is an important regulator of phosphokinases and plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity. Enzymatic/catalytic processes also corroborate the fact that the enhancing effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 took a relatively long time (~100 s) and could not be immediately eluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize that Mg<sup>2+</sup> regulates TRPV2 channels through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the phosphorylation level of immunoprecipitated TRPV2 with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phospho-Ser/Thr antibody in the presence of 2-APB agonist, with and without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The results revealed a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation levels of TRPV2 in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Since the mechanism of phosphorylation involves the transfer of a phosphate (Pi) from ATP to the substrate, we thus used AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, to replace ATP to inhibit the process of phosphorylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the enhancement effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 currents was abolished when dialyzed AMP-PNP (4 mM) into the cell through recording pipette, suggesting that Mg<sup>2+</sup> potentiates phosphorylation of TRPV2 upon agonist stimulation. Interestingly, the sensitizing effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also observed in the whole-cell recordings without the addition of ATP in the pipette solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is most likely due to the abundance of ATP in the cell which is not rapidly diluted by the patch pipette solutions. Or the intracellular ATP has a concentration gradient at various sites and is associated with endogenous enzymes at different localizations.</p><p>We next screened the potential kinases involved by treating the cells with various protein kinase inhibitors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>, treatment with Ruxolitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) but not MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor), staurosporine (PKC inhibitor), KN93 (CaMKII inhibitor), D4476 (CK1 inhibitor), or U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) abolished the enhancement of TRPV2 activity by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that JAK1 is probably the kinase promoting TRPV2 activity.</p><p>Utilizing mass spectrometry, we found peptides phosphorylated at the Y335 site that locates on the N terminus (Nt) of TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next tested whether JAK1 directly phosphorylated TRPV2. Based on this finding and considering the difficulty of the purification of the TRPV2 transmembrane region, we purified TRPV2-Nt for in vitro phosphorylation experiments. Using in vitro kinase assay, we observed that JAK1 directly phosphorylated TRPV2-Nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>TRPV2 ion channel has been shown to regulate the phagocytosis of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore examined macrophage phagocytosis of GFP-expressing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (GFP <italic>E. coli</italic>) using flow cytometry by regulating the activity of TRPV2. As expected, knockdown of TRPV2 by shTRPV2#1 significantly inhibited phagocytosis by BMDM cells (36% ± 1% reduction, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We then explored whether inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation by Ruxolitinib affects BMDM phagocytosis. Indeed, Ruxolitinib reduced macrophage phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner, with a reduction of 39% ± 2% observed with 10 μM Ruxolitinib (n = 3). This result thus corroborates the role of phosphorylation in the functional facilitation of TRPV2 activity.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the regulatory effect of JAK1 on TRPV2 function using shRNA-mediated knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We observed that selective knockdown of JAK1 expression largely reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup>-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Since our mass spectrometry experiment had shown that Y335 was a potential site that may be phosphorylated by JAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we asked whether the mutation at this site would affect the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2 currents. Indeed, mutating Y335 into phenylalanine to simulate dephosphorylation partially inhibited the enhancement of TRPV2 currents by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). For comparison, the treatment with 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the 2-APB response (0.3 mM) by approximately 9-fold for mutation Y335F, whereas approximately 16-fold for wild-type (WT) TRPV2. The substitution of Y by F approximates a tyrosine that cannot be phosphorylated, while mutations to the negative charge of aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) are commonly used to mimic phosphorylated tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearlman et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, we observed that mutants TRPV2-Y335D and TRPV2-Y335E increased the sensitivity to 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). We thus further verified the effect of Y335F mutation on protein phosphorylation status. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> illustrates that JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV2-Nt was abolished by TRPV2(Y335F) and significantly inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of JAK1 (JAK1-K908A).

Using mutant Y335F as a template, we further mutated the tyrosine residues in the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, the membrane-proximal domain, intracellular linkers (Linker), and the C-terminal (Ct) into phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. We obtained the following mutants: 8YF (Y98/105/111/162/208/228/271/335F), 3YF (Y323/335/343F), 6YF (Y335/455/471/514/515/525F), and 2YF (Y335/675F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Mutant 6YF greatly reduced the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced enhancement of TRPV2 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). When phenylalanine at positions 471 and 525 were reversed back to tyrosine from the 6YF mutant (6YF471Y and 6YF525Y), the enhancement of TRPV2 was rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>Triple mutant TRPV2(Y335/471/525F) was generated to confirm the significance of these three specific sites. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref> displayed that TRPV2(Y335/471/525F) largely eliminated the enhancement of TRPV2 by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Notably, TRPV2(Y335/471/525F) was a little more sensitive to 2-APB. One possible reason is that the triple mutation might somehow alter the channel conformation and result in the increased sensitivity to its chemical agonist. The protein sequence alignment showed that Y335, Y471, and Y525 amino acid residues are highly conserved in various mammalian TRPV2 homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, this tri-mutant also downregulated tyrosine phosphorylation levels of immunoprecipitated TRPV2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).</p><p>To discern the potentiation is depended on intracellular signaling, we repeated the experiments in excised membrane patches. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, the inside-out recordings from TRPV2-expressing HEK293T cells at +60 mV show that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the 2-APB response. However, whether the excised membrane patches might attach portion of tyrosine kinase JAK1 remained unknown. Therefore, we further conducted the experiments by pretreatment with the JAK1 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, which indeed reduced the enhancement caused by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This confirms the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced TRPV2 current enhancement is modulated by JAK1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, we performed inside-out recordings to test the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV2(Y335/471/525F) mutant channel that loses the capability to be phosphorylated by JAK1. As expected, Mg<sup>2+</sup> failed to enhance the 2-APB-evoked currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Together, these data corroborate that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-JAK1-mediated phosphorylation contributes to the increased sensitivity of the TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Of note, our findings also imply that the excised membrane patches cannot completely isolate the regulatory effect of the intracellular signaling pathway occurring underneath the cell membrane site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tyrosine phosphorylation enhances chemical and thermal sensitization of TRPV2</title><p>Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification mediated by kinases and phosphatases. Having characterized JAK1 as the kinase for tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV2, we next sought to identify the phosphatases that counteracted this process. We took advantage of various protein phosphatase inhibitors to search for the phosphatases that mediated the dephosphorylation of TRPV2. The protein phosphatases comprise the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family, the protein phosphatase Mg<sup>2+</sup>- or Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (PPM) family, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barford et al., 1998</xref>).

This mechanism differs from the action of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRPV1 channels, where a high concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> potentiates the TRPV1 activity from the extracellular side but inhibits TRPV1 currents from the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we noticed that the addition of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the pipette solution was less effective than the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx from outside the cell through the channel. One possible reason is that local transient concentration changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> are more capable of inducing enzymatic reactions, as local Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets are more likely to facilitate subsequent reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg et al., 2007</xref>). It could also be that a uniform global increase in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration may trigger both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which may compromise the degree of TRPV2 phosphorylation.</p><p>We reveal that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-mediated enhancing effect on TRPV2 current responses is tuned by JAK1 kinase and PTPN1 phosphatase at Y335, Y471, and Y525 molecular sites. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV2 controls not only its sensitivity to chemical stimulations but also its thermal activation threshold. Temperature sensing is essential to survive and adapt since failure to avoid noxious temperatures can cause fundamental tissue damage. TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, and TRPM2 channels together sense a broad temperature range spanning from physiological warmness to noxious hotness. The physiological role of the TRPV1 channels in thermosensation has been demonstrated by the knockout of the TRPV1 channels in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garami et al., 2011</xref>). However, the physiological role of the TRPV2 channels remains unclear while it is responsive to noxious heat (&gt;52°C) in heterologous systems. We here demonstrate that enhancing the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of TRPV2 protein lowers its thermal threshold to a near-body temperature level (~40°C). TRPV2 might act as a heat thermosensor in physiopathological conditions when encountering either or both Mg<sup>2+</sup> surges and upregulated tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, intracellular free Mg<sup>2+</sup> can be increased by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion induced by either mitochondrial deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubota et al., 2003</xref>) or cell reactive states that consume a high amount of cytosolic ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brocard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaussin et al., 1997</xref>). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, oxidation of methionine residues or other potential endogenous modulators would independently or synergistically modulate TRPV2 channel sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fricke et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>TRPV2 is expressed abundantly in the cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, osteoclasts, mast cells, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kojima and Nagasawa, 2014</xref>). It has been proven that TRPV2 has a critical role in immunity response, such as phagocytosis of macrophages and degranulation of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). JAK1 is also abundantly in the immune cells. <italic>JAK1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died soon after birth, the development of lymphocytes was severely impaired, and the mature B cells in thymocytes and spleen were significantly reduced, suggesting that JAK1 plays an important role in immune development and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodig et al., 1998</xref>). Based on these findings, JAK1-TRPV2 axis may have a regulatory effect on immune processes.</p><p>Protein post-translational modification represents a main endogenous regulatory mechanism of ion channels and immune signaling, by changing the plasma membrane expression or altering the biophysical properties of the channels. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the TRPV1 channels and the TRPV2 channels have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeske et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stokes et al., 2004</xref>). Phosphorylation of TRPV1 channels via PKC-related pathway or Src-related pathway was reported to mediate TRPV1 surface expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Studer and McNaughton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Differentially, our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV2 directly alters its biophysical properties without changing the expression of TRPV2 on the plasma membrane.</p><p>By specifically perturbing the JAK1-mediated phosphorylation and PTPN1-mediated dephosphorylation, we could substantially alter the chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 ion channel. Thus, TRPV2 channel sensitivity is maintained at the homeostatic point by dynamically balanced phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. The Mg<sup>2+</sup>-enhanced TRPV2 current responses are quickly reverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>), suggesting that the endogenous phosphatase activity of PTPN1 is high. As such, TRPV2 is likely maintained at a low level of phosphorylation in basal conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) through a BNC-2090/MIO acquisition system (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Data acquisition was controlled by QStudio developed by Dr Feng Qin at State University of New York at Buffalo. Data were typically sampled at 5 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments [WPI]) to 2–4 MΩ when filled with 150 mM NaCl solution. The compensation of pipette series resistance (&gt;80%) and capacitance was taken by using the built-in circuitry of the amplifier, and the liquid junction potential between the pipette and bath solutions was zeroed prior to seal formation. All voltages were defined as membrane potentials with respect to extracellular solutions. For whole-cell recording, the bath solution contained the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 EGTA, 10 HEPES (the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). In one set of experiments, the salt of YCl<sub>2</sub> (Y means Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, or Co<sup>2+</sup>) was individually dissolved in deionized water to make stock solutions and subsequently diluted into a basic solution ([in mM] 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) to make a desired final concentration.

For inside-out recordings, the bath and pipette solutions were symmetrical and contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. For cation substitution experiment, pipette solution contains (in mM): 140 NaCl and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. After the whole-cell configuration was obtained, bath solution was replaced with specific cationic solution, and a voltage step pulse was used to measure the reversal potential. Channel activators were diluted into the recording solution at the desired final concentrations and applied to the cell of interest through a gravity-driven local perfusion system. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Water-insoluble reagents were dissolved in either 100% ethanol or DMSO to make stock solutions and were diluted in the recording solutions at appropriate concentrations before experiments. The final concentrations of ethanol or DMSO did not exceed 0.3%, which did not affect the currents.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eric N Senning (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. All three reviewers agreed that the findings in the manuscript are important and novel and that most key conclusions are supported by high-quality experimental data. The reviewers also raised a series of concerns that need to be addressed before publication, which are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revisions requiring additional experimental work:</p><p>1) The authors should include experiments at least in BMDM and TRPV2-expressing HEK293 cells in which 0.3 mM 2-APB is applied for the same duration as 0.3mM 2APB + magnesium. Ideally, this should have been done in all experiments, but I realize this would take a significant amount of effort and that given the rest of the evidence provided, it seems unlikely that this will affect the conclusions.</p><p>2) In figure 2 the authors demonstrate that Mg applied alone does not activate TRPV2 in the inside-out configuration (Figure 2G-H). The authors should include an inside-out experiment to address whether intracellularly applied 2-APB together with magnesium have a sensitizing effect.</p><p>3) Ion permeability of TRPV2 is not very well explored in previous reports. Thus, permeation of Mg through TRPV2 should be convincingly demonstrated by performing measurements of the reversal potential in different concentrations of extracellular magnesium.</p><p>Other essential revisions, including experiments that are suggested, but not required for publication:</p><p>4) The authors included ATP in the pipette in most of their experiments, which could be expected to be essential for observing the sensitizing effect of magnesium. This needs to be discussed. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors included experimental data to directly address whether ATP in the pipette is required for observing the sensitizing effect of magnesium co-applied with 2-APB.</p><p>5) The manuscript would benefit from additional editing to improve readability. A more concisely worded introduction that begins with the general properties of TRPV2 and then highlights our gaps in understanding, especially in any immunological role, would improve the transition into the summarized findings. The underlying hypothesis leading the authors to challenge TRPV2 with high concentrations of extracellular Mg should be (better) stated. There are many ways to explore the role of protein phosphorylation in the activity of ion channels, the authors applied many elegant techniques in this study. The starting point with extracellular Mg is somewhat odd, giving the slight impression that the authors did not have protein phosphorylation in mind when they started this study. The discussion should review and discuss the results in a manner consistent with the order of the figures. I would recommend discussing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent TRPV2 results first and the phosphorylation effect next.</p><p>6) In general, the wording in figure descriptions needs to be more concise and clearly relatable to figure legends. For example, Figure 1B indicates the response to washout but the figure description indicates responses to 0.3mM 2-APB with either 0 or 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This discrepancy needs to be clarified. I would recommend small colored triangles (blue, red) in the current trace of Figure 1A, which indicate the time points at which the summary data measurement is obtained. This recommendation should be extended to all examples of summary plots that employ the same type of comparison (ie. Figure 1D, F, etc.).</p><p>7) The authors should clarify the duration of the exposure to 2APB and magnesium in all experiments where this could be an important factor affecting the results (see public review). The duration of stimulation should be the same or very similar at least for all key experiments – Figure 3E, Figure 3J and K, Figure 4A, G, H, and I, Figure 5B.</p><p>8) All figures where current vs temperature relations at different conditions are compared should be normalized at the same temperature for all data, and the threshold calculated accordingly. Examples of this can be found in Zhang et al. (PNAS, 2017; https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.1717192115).</p><p>9) Line 15-16 on page 5. The authors state that the Mg-induced effect could not be washed out. Looking at the figures, however, it becomes clear that the washout period was only about 10s or so. This is much too short to say anything about if the Mg-induced sensitization of TRPV2 is reversible or not. This needs to be acknowledged and discussed.</p><p>10) On page 6, lines 9-12 the authors state that Mg is the only cation exhibiting a &quot;more profound&quot; effect on TRPV2. When looking at Figure 1 supplement 2 however, it appears other cations also have interesting effects on channel activity. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>11) The authors imply that increased intracellular Mg-concentration accounts for channel phosphorylation. Why did the authors not perform experiments with different – pre-set – concentrations of Mg in the pipette solution? These experiments would be straightforward to perform, and they would make the approach with the TRPV2-E609/E614 mutant less critical.</p><p>12) The authors should remove the calcium imaging data and instead provide measurements of the reversal potential to show whether the mutations effectively reduce permeability to magnesium. Alternatively, all data for the E609/614Q should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>13) The authors should explain the smear that appears on the third lane in the in vitro kinase assay (Figure 3F).</p><p>14) The authors should provide additional information on the mass-spectrometry results to highlight the relevant observations that support phosphorylation at Y335.</p><p>15) The authors should remove the phagocytosis assay from the manuscript, or alternatively, provide additional data with siRNA-dependent knockdown of TRPV2 channel expression to show specificity. SKF96365 is non-specific and more often employed to inhibit TRPC-channels. It may also block TRPV2. 100 µM SKF is a very high concentration that may even be cytotoxic. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors provided whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of BMDM treated with TRPV2 siRNA to show that 2-APB responses are either absent or significantly reduced. Although the consistency between BMDM and HEK293 cell experiments gives confidence in the authors' conclusions, it should be considered that 2-APB is a highly non-specific agonist and that primary macrophages express other ion channels in addition to TRPV2.</p><p>16) The same concerns about the specificity of the findings apply to the current recordings with DRG neurons and BMDM – 2-APB is a non-selective agonist of many ion channel types, including TRP channels also expressed in DRG neurons. Ideally, the authors should have included DRG and BMDM recordings from TRPV2 KO animals, or from cells treated with siRNA. In the absence of this data, the authors should at least discuss these shortcomings.</p><p>17) The authors should provide additional discussion on the possible physiological implications of their findings. Importantly, the authors should discuss whether the magnesium dependence that they observe is consistent with physiological magnesium concentrations in the cytosol, and whether there are any known signaling pathways that could trigger the activity of JAK1 or PTPN1. The discussion about any Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent process as physiological seems overly speculative without additional experiments that maintain physiological conditions throughout experiments. It would be better to highlight the Mg<sup>2+</sup> effect as an excellent tool to explore downstream modulation by cell signaling events. Any speculative aspect of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> effect that is physiological should be clearly labeled as such and limited in scope.</p><p>18) The authors state that three residues (Y335, Y471, Y525) are conserved in other mammalian species. Human TRPV2 is known to often display clear species-specific differences as compared to rodent TRPV2. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors provided data to address whether human TRPV2 channels are also subject to the regulatory mechanism described in the manuscript. However, this is not required and we leave it up to the authors to decide. Similarly, it would also be interesting if the authors examined whether this effect is conserved in TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels, but we realize this might be out of scope for the present manuscript.</p><p>19) The 2-APB concentrations in the figure and the figure legend are not consistent in Figure5A.</p><p>Figures 5A/6D: Explain why the concentration change to 0.03 mM/ 0.1 mM 2APB are necessary compared to earlier experiments (0.3 mM) and provide examples of a minimally effective phosphatase such as LB-100/ and shControl as representative traces.</p><p>20) Page 2, line 3: it is unclear what the peripheral or central functions are. TRPV2 plays important roles in many non-neuronal tissues.</p><p>21) The role of TRPV2 in thermo-, mechano- and osmo-sensing (page 3, lines 6-7 and 11-12) is controversial. The authors should acknowledge this in their introduction.</p><p>22) Page 4, lines 20-21: I suggest removing the statement about therapeutics. Alternatively, the authors should be more specific about what pathology they are referring to.</p><p>23) Page 18, lines 1-2: I do not think that any of the findings in the manuscript indicate that long-term supplementation with magnesium can increase its cytosolic concentration.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tyrosine phosphorylation tunes chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 ion channel&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one of the original reviewers.</p><p>We congratulate you on this important study, which has become significantly improved after the first revision. Several additional experiments have been included, which together with modifications to the text and figures, address most of the concerns raised in the first review. Some points remain to be fully addressed before publication and are outlined below. None of these points involve additional experimental work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Current vs temperature relations in the manuscript figures are normalized differently between the channel constructs that are being compared. The threshold for heat activation appears to be calculated based on this same normalization scheme, which is different from what is indicated in the Methods section (&quot;Temperature Jump&quot;: line 536), done in accordance with the technique of Zhang et al. (2018). We appreciate that the example in R3 showed close agreement between their previous method and the preferred one that normalizes to a common temperature point. However, if their methods section claims the use of the optimal approach, then this should be applied consistently in all figures displaying current-temperature relations.</p><p>2) Please include zero-current lines for all current traces, so that readers can assess the magnitude of the leak currents in each recording.</p><p>3) The new reversal potential measurements with external Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> show that whereas the E609/E614Q double mutant channel has lower Mg<sup>2+</sup>-permeability than WT, Mg<sup>2+</sup> can still permeate through the mutant channel at least to the same extent as Na<sup>+</sup> does. This seems difficult to reconcile with the strong negative effect that the double mutant has on the potentiation caused by external Mg<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 2C and D. Two alternative explanations for the observed results that were not tested are that the E609/E614Q mutations prevent phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues, or that channels lose to capacity to become sensitized by tyrosine phosphorylation. Because these data can be confounding unless additional experimental work is included, we ask the authors to remove these data from the manuscript, or tone down the significance of these findings and mention alternative explanations for the observations that could not be ruled out by the data.</p><p>4) The data in Figures R1 (exposure of inside-out patches to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2-APB applied together) and R2 (effect of ATP in the pipette) should be included in the manuscript as a supplement. These results add important information that is not conveyed elsewhere. The data in Figure R5 should also be included in the manuscript as a Supplementary Figure because it highlights an important methodological constraint, namely that the inclusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette is much less effective in sensitizing TRPV2 channels than when applied from the extracellular side.</p><p>5) The apparent affinity for 2-APB seems to be increased in TRPV2 channels containing the triple mutation Y335/471/525F. This is contrary to what is expected from a mutation that mimics a non-phosphorylated state and runs counter to the main conclusions of the manuscript. This apparent discrepancy should be discussed.</p><p>6) The text contains several typos and stylistic errors that should be fixed. Here are some that I found, with suggested edits already incorporated:</p><p>– &quot;whether TRPV2 can function as a temperature sensor or a mechanical sensor in physiology still remains in debate.&quot;</p><p>– &quot;In mast cells, TRPV2-mediated calcium flux stimulates protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent proinflammatory degranulation (Stokes 68 et al., 2004).&quot;</p><p>– &quot;Here we show that the regulator of phosphokinases magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), exerts an enhancing effect on both the chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages.&quot;</p><p>– &quot;Considering that TRPV2 is abundantly and functionally expressed in macrophages where other types of TRPV channels are barely detectable (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1) (Link et al., 103 2010; Nagasawa et al., 2007), we used rat bone marrow-derived macrophages (rBMDMs) as an endogenous cell system to record TRPV2 currents.&quot;</p><p>– &quot;Our data show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> modulates tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the TRPV2 channel protein, and thereby also its activity.&quot;</p><p>– &quot;For instance, it has been reported that magnesium deficiency caused by genetic deficiencies in MAGT1 impairs anti-virus immune response&quot;.</p><p>– &quot;the cell through ion channels such as TRPM6, TRPM7, or/and magnesium transporters like MagT1&quot;.</p><p>– &quot;Using a TRPV2 mutant deficient in Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeation and supplying the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-chelator EDTA through the patch-clamp glass pipette, our data suggest that transient Mg&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I congratulate the authors for the outstanding job of addressing concerns raised in the review and incorporating the reviewers' suggestions in the revised version of their work. Several additional experiments have been included, and the text has been revised and made much clearer, which together has significantly improved the manuscript. Whereas all my major concerns have been addressed, I still have a few minor points that are relevant and can further improve the work:</p><p>1) Please include zero-current lines for all current traces, so that readers can assess the magnitude of the leak currents in each recording.</p><p>2) The new reversal potential measurements with external Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> show that whereas the E609/E614Q double mutant channel has lower Mg<sup>2+</sup>-permeability than WT, Mg<sup>2+</sup> can still permeate through the mutant channel at least to the same extent as Na<sup>+</sup> does. This seems difficult to reconcile with the strong negative effect that the double mutant has on the potentiation caused by external Mg<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 2C and D. It is possible that the E609/E614Q mutations also disrupt the sensitizing effect of phosphorylation on channel activity, a possibility that was not tested. An experiment should be included to test whether E609/E614Q channels are still sensitized by Tyr phosphorylation, which could be done in inside-out patches exposed cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2-APB, although other alternative experiments would be possible. Alternatively, the data pertaining to E609/E614Q channels can be removed from the manuscript without affecting the main conclusions.</p><p>3) The data in Figure R1 (exposure of inside-out patches to both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2-APB) should be included in the manuscript as a supplement, or at least the results mentioned together with a 'data not shown' statement. These results add important information that is otherwise not conveyed by any of the other data included. The observations on Figure R2 should be referred to in the manuscript at least as 'data not shown'. The data on Figure R5 should be included in the manuscript, as it highlights an important methodological point that would be useful for other scientists when trying to reproduce the results shown here, namely that the inclusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette is much less effective in sensitizing TRPV2 channels than when the cation is applied from the extracellular side.</p><p>4) The apparent affinity for 2-APB seems to be increased in TRPV2 channels containing the triple mutation Y335/471/525F.

I would, however, like to call attention to concern (8), rebuttal figure R3 and updated results on TRPV2 temperature dependence. The main text does not reflect the changes proposed by the rebuttal. Calculation of the temperature threshold for activation is still based on a 10% of maximal response (mentioned in Figure 3) and is not, as indicated in the Methods section (&quot;Temperature Jump&quot;: line 536), done in accordance with the technique of Zhang et al. (2018). I appreciate that the example in R3 showed close agreement between their previous method and the preferred one that normalizes to a common temperature point.

Here the experimental temperature range in panels 6I-J is shifted in comparison to mock-treated cells.</p><p>Consequently, the summary plot in 6K shows a normalization to different final temperatures in each sample set, perhaps staggering the threshold temperatures of activation shown in 6L in the same order as the normalization temperature. To me, it is a serious concern that the arbitrary arrival at ~40 degrees C as the thermosensitive threshold in these data makes its way into the abstract of the report.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78301.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revisions requiring additional experimental work:</p><p>1) The authors should include experiments at least in BMDM and TRPV2-expressing HEK293 cells in which 0.3 mM 2-APB is applied for the same duration as 0.3mM 2APB + magnesium.

As illustrated in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3, prolonged application of 0.3 mM 2-APB alone didn’t have notable sensitizing effect on TRPV2 currents, while subsequent application of the same stimulus in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> with same duration produced a significant increase of the TRPV2 currents. Hence, these new data are consistent with our previous observation and affirm our original conclusions. We now add this description in the main text (page 7, lines 813) and present the results in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In figure 2 the authors demonstrate that Mg applied alone does not activate TRPV2 in the inside-out configuration (Figure 2G-H). The authors should include an inside-out experiment to address whether intracellularly applied 2-APB together with magnesium have a sensitizing effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful comments. We have conducted the suggested experiment. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, the inside-out recordings from TRPV2-expressing HEK293T cells at +60 mV show that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the 2-APB response. However, the excised membrane patches might attach portion of tyrosine kinase JAK1. We then repeated the experiments by pre-treatment with the JAK1 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, which indeed reduced the enhancement caused by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This confirms the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced TRPV2 current enhancement is modulated by JAK1 phosphorylation.</p><p>In addition, we tested the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on inside-out recordings of</p><p>TRPV2(Y335/471/525F) mutant that loses the capability to be phosphorylated by JAK1. As expected, Mg<sup>2+</sup> failed to enhance the 2-APB-evoked currents. Together, these data corroborate the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-JAK1-mediated phosphorylation contributes to the increased sensitivity of the TRPV2 channel. Of note, our findings also suggest that though exerting a facilitatory effect, Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone is unable to activate TRPV2, and the excised membrane patches cannot completely isolate the regulatory effect of the intracellular signaling pathway occurring on underneath the cell membrane site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ion permeability of TRPV2 is not very well explored in previous reports. Thus, permeation of Mg through TRPV2 should be convincingly demonstrated by performing measurements of the reversal potential in different concentrations of extracellular magnesium.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we conducted the new experiment to characterize the relative selectivity’s for Mg<sup>2+</sup> through TRPV2 channel by measuring the reversal potential. For cation substitution experiment, a normal bath solution was used to establish a whole cell configuration. After the whole-cell configuration was obtained, bath solution was replaced with the solutions containing 110 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, the measured <italic>I-V</italic> curves for different cationic solutions, and the zero-bias current indicates that Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions pass more easily than Na<sup>+</sup>. We now add this description in Material and Methods (page 27, lines 8-14, and page 31, lines 38), and present the results in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other essential revisions, including experiments that are suggested, but not required for publication:</p><p>4) The authors included ATP in the pipette in most of their experiments, which could be expected to be essential for observing the sensitizing effect of magnesium. This needs to be discussed. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors included experimental data to directly address whether ATP in the pipette is required for observing the sensitizing effect of magnesium co-applied with 2-APB.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that replacing cytosolic ATP with AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, eliminated the regulatory effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 3C), indicating that ATP is required for the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have carried out new experiments without the addition of ATP in the pipette solution. The sensitizing effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also observed in the whole-cell recordings from TRPV2-expressing HEK293T cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This is most likely due to the abundance of ATP in the cell which is not rapidly diluted by the patch pipette solutions. Or the intracellular ATP has a concentration gradient at various sites and is associated with endogenous enzymes at different localizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript would benefit from additional editing to improve readability. A more concisely worded introduction that begins with the general properties of TRPV2 and then highlights our gaps in understanding, especially in any immunological role, would improve the transition into the summarized findings.

First, we update the introduction by pointing the necessity to understand the activity features of TRPV2 in immune cells, prior to transiting the study to mechanism studies (page 4, lines 4-5). Second, we place the early reports on potential effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on TRP channels prior to the exploration of its role in TRPV2 channel regulation, so to link to the current experimental work (page 6, lines 5-6). Finally, we adjust the discussion first on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent TRPV2 potentiation and the phosphorylation effect next (page 17, lines 7-11 and lines 15-22, and page 18, lines 1-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In general, the wording in figure descriptions needs to be more concise and clearly relatable to figure legends.

Due to the differences between cells, we sticked to the results only when the cell’s responses to stimulation can reach a steady state. By this functional standard, the application duration of 2-APB and magnesium in our experiments fall in comparable ranges (~70-100 s) for Figure 3E, Figure 3J and K, Figure 4A, G, H, and I, Figure 5B.

Indeed, as illustrated in Figure 1 supplement 2, a variety of different divalent cations exhibited different regulatory effects on TRPV2 currents.

We have now added the comment to results (page 7, lines 17-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors imply that increased intracellular Mg-concentration accounts for channel phosphorylation. Why did the authors not perform experiments with different – pre-set – concentrations of Mg in the pipette solution? These experiments would be straightforward to perform, and they would make the approach with the TRPV2-E609/E614 mutant less critical.</p></disp-quote><p>The inclusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 did enhance the sensitivity of the TRPV2 channel resulting in a leftward shift of the dose-response curve. However, we noticed that the addition of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the pipette solution was less effective than the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx from outside the cell through the channel. Possible reasons for this may lie in, (1) local transient concentration changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> are more capable of inducing enzymatic reactions, just as local ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets are more likely to facilitate subsequent reactions (Amberg et al., 2007); (2) a uniform global increase in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration may trigger both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which may compromise the degree of TRPV2 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors should remove the calcium imaging data and instead provide measurements of the reversal potential to show whether the mutations effectively reduce permeability to magnesium.

To exclude the interference of other proteins, we prepared kinase-dead JAK1 (K908A) proteins.

SKF96365 is non-specific and more often employed to inhibit TRPC-channels. It may also block TRPV2. 100 µM SKF is a very high concentration that may even be cytotoxic. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors provided whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of BMDM treated with TRPV2 siRNA to show that 2-APB responses are either absent or significantly reduced. Although the consistency between BMDM and HEK293 cell experiments gives confidence in the authors' conclusions, it should be considered that 2-APB is a highly non-specific agonist and that primary macrophages express other ion channels in addition to TRPV2.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the results of qPCR, we found that the expression level of the <italic>Trpv2</italic> is the highest among all <italic>Trpv</italic> and <italic>Trpc</italic> channels (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A).

The whole-cell recordings showed that the cells significantly reduced their response to 2-APB stimulation (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D-1F). To date, 2-APB, while not a specific agonist, has only been found to activate TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels, suggesting that the 2-APB-induced BMDMs currents are most likely from TRPV2 channels. Similar to the previous use of inhibitor SKF96365 that inhibited TRPV2 channel activity to reduce the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, knockdown of TRPV2 expression also reduced macrophage phagocytosis (revised Figure 3G). We now add this information in the main text (page 6, line 9) and the Materials and methods (page 24, lines 19-21), and present the results as Figure 1 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The same concerns about the specificity of the findings apply to the current recordings with DRG neurons and BMDM – 2-APB is a non-selective agonist of many ion channel types, including TRP channels also expressed in DRG neurons. Ideally, the authors should have included DRG and BMDM recordings from TRPV2 KO animals, or from cells treated with siRNA. In the absence of this data, the authors should at least discuss these shortcomings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, which is, related to comment 15. Based on the results of qPCR, we found that the TRPV1 and TRPV2 are highly expressed in DRG neurons, while the expression of other types of TRPV channels was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). TRPV2 channels are predominantly expressed in medium- to large-sized DRG neurons that typically express fewer TRPV1 channels (Caterina et al., 1999). Additionally, we used capsaicin to confirm the lack of TRPV1 expression in recorded DRG neurons (Figure 1C). Although 2-APB is a non-selective agonist, has only been found to activate TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels so far. Thus, our use of 2-APB functionally targeted the TRPV2 ion channels.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Expression of TRPV2 in DRG neurons.</title><p>Relative mRNA expression levels of different <italic>Trpv</italic> channels in BMDMs were assessed by qPCR.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78301-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The authors should provide additional discussion on the possible physiological implications of their findings. Importantly, the authors should discuss whether the magnesium dependence that they observe is consistent with physiological magnesium concentrations in the cytosol, and whether there are any known signaling pathways that could trigger the activity of JAK1 or PTPN1. The discussion about any Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent process as physiological seems overly speculative without additional experiments that maintain physiological conditions throughout experiments. It would be better to highlight the Mg<sup>2+</sup> effect as an excellent tool to explore downstream modulation by cell signaling events. Any speculative aspect of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> effect that is physiological should be clearly labeled as such and limited in scope.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm is about 10 to 30 mM, but most intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> are bound to ribosomes, polynucleotides, and ATPs, resulting in the free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of about 0.3 to 1.2 mM (de Baaij et al., 2015; Funato et al., 2014; Moomaw and Maguire, 2008).

Human TRPV2 is known to often display clear species-specific differences as compared to rodent TRPV2. It would strengthen the manuscript if the authors provided data to address whether human TRPV2 channels are also subject to the regulatory mechanism described in the manuscript. However, this is not required and we leave it up to the authors to decide. Similarly, it would also be interesting if the authors examined whether this effect is conserved in TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels, but we realize this might be out of scope for the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion, we have carried out new experiments to study whether human TRPV2 channels are also subject to the regulatory mechanism. As illustrated below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), the Mg<sup>2+</sup> shows the inhibition effect on human TRPV2. That might be due to Mg<sup>2+</sup> blocking the human TRPV2 channel or Mg<sup>2+</sup> simply inhibiting the single-channel current. Ion substitution experiments performed in whole-cell mode showed that the human TRPV2 channel is selective for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Then Mg<sup>2+</sup> which was dialyzed into the cell through recording pipette caused a left-shift of the concentration-response curve to 2-APB from the whole-cell experiments, and the EC<sub>50</sub> of 2-APB on TRPV2 activation was shifted to 2.4 ± 0.2 mM from 3.4 ± 0.1 mM in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, PTP inhibitor 2 also induced a left shift of the concentration-response curve to 2-APB.

Two alternative explanations for the observed results that were not tested are that the E609/E614Q mutations prevent phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues, or that channels lose to capacity to become sensitized by tyrosine phosphorylation. Because these data can be confounding unless additional experimental work is included, we ask the authors to remove these data from the manuscript, or tone down the significance of these findings and mention alternative explanations for the observations that could not be ruled out by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful comments.

As for why the E609/E614Q double mutant channel showed negative effect to the external Mg<sup>2+</sup>, one possible reason might be due to the very different extracellular concentrations of the two ions, 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> vs. 145 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, used in the potentiation experiment.
