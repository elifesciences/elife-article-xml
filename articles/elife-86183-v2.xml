experiments in rodents permit unparalleled experimental control, precise measurement of behavior, and concurrent modulation and measurement of neural activity. Here, we present OHRBETS (Open-Source Head-fixed Rodent Behavioral Experimental Training System; pronounced ‘Orbitz’), a low-cost, open-source platform of hardware and software to flexibly pursue the neural basis of a variety of motivated behaviors. Head-fixed mice tested with OHRBETS displayed operant conditioning for caloric reward that replicates core behavioral phenotypes observed during freely moving conditions. OHRBETS also permits optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation under positive or negative operant conditioning procedures and real-time place preference behavior, like that observed in freely moving assays. In a multi-spout brief-access consumption task, mice displayed licking as a function of concentration of sucrose, quinine, and sodium chloride, with licking modulated by homeostatic or circadian influences. Finally, to highlight the functionality of OHRBETS, we measured mesolimbic dopamine signals during the multi-spout brief-access task that display strong correlations with relative solution value and magnitude of consumption. All designs, programs, and instructions are provided freely online. This customizable platform enables replicable operant and consummatory behaviors and can be incorporated with methods to perturb and record neural dynamics in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>ingestive behavior</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA032750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuber</surname><given-names>Garret D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA038168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuber</surname><given-names>Garret D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A customizable open-source hardware and software platform for conducting diverse behavioral experiments in head-fixed mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studying mouse behavior under head-fixed conditions offers many distinct advantages over freely moving conditions. At the cost of reduced naturalistic behavior and enhanced stress, head fixation offers high degrees of behavioral control that enables consistent delivery of stimuli to the animal, precise measurement of behavior, and isolation of subcomponents of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjerre and Palmer, 2020</xref>). Holding the mouse stable permits a wide range of behavioral experiments that have features that are challenging or impossible to conduct reliably in the freely moving condition including the delivery of somatosensory stimuli to select locations, temporally precise odor delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2018</xref>), presentation of visual stimuli to fixed parts of the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krauzlis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguillon-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>), temperature manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2022</xref>), and high-resolution video recording of facial expression or paw movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dolensek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>). Eliminating or controlling physical approach behaviors, but not all movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>), allows for greater isolation of both appetitive and consummatory behaviors and related neuronal dynamics. By removing turning associated with locomotion, head-fixed behavioral approaches offer enhanced compatibility with neuroscience approaches that require tethers including optogenetics and fiber photometry. Furthermore, head fixation is also compatible with tools for measuring and manipulating neuronal activity at the single cell level, including two-photon calcium imaging and holographic optogenetics.</p><p>Motivated behaviors are essential for survival and can be disrupted in brain circuits, leading to various diseases such as addiction and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenny, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi and Stuber, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Volkow et al., 2017</xref>). Motivation in animal models is often assessed and quantified using multiple tasks that attempt to isolate distinct behavioral components such as appetitive and consummatory behaviors that can be the product of independent or overlapping brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panksepp, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>). To determine the role of brain circuits in distinct components of behavior, behavioral models with a high degree of experimental control and reproducibility are paramount as they can isolate components of behavior and limit variability across labs, subjects, and trials. There are a variety of approaches in freely moving rodents that model individual components of motivated behavior. Motivation is often modeled using operant responding on levers or nose pokes to earn a caloric reward or intracranial brain stimulation. A highly controlled version of operant responding includes retractable levers and retractable lick spouts to limit access of both operant and consummatory responses, respectively. In contrast, consummatory behaviors require measuring the volumetric amount of appetitive or aversive solutions. A particularly useful model is the brief-access task, which consists of trial-based presentations of one of multiple solutions, enabling recording of behavioral and neuronal responses to gradations of both rewarding and aversive solutions within a single session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boughter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith, 2001</xref>). Despite the widespread use of these procedures in freely moving animals, there has been limited adaptation of these tasks for head-fixed rodents despite the advantages afforded by the of the head-fixed approach.</p><p>Here, we present OHRBETS (Open-Source Head-fixed Rodent Behavioral Experimental Training System), a low-cost, open-source platform of hardware and software for quantifying both operant and consummatory behavior in head-fixed mice. OHRBETS features the ability to precisely limit operant and consummatory behaviors during operant conditioning, replicating the retractable levers and spout aspects of the freely moving condition. OHRBETS has a multi-spout design that allows multiple solutions to be presented independently in a single behavioral session, enabling various behavioral experiments like probabilistic reinforcement tasks and choice behavior. The platform is also flexible and includes connectivity for additional customizable components. OHRBETS consists largely of 3D printed and low-cost components that reduce the total cost per system and maximizes reproducibility. Multiple research groups have developed models for head-fixed operant behavior with a variety of operant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloem et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vollmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vollmer et al., 2022</xref>), but many of these systems are built for a single experimental procedures with minimal publicly available resources needed for consistent replication. To assist with modification and reproduction of our system, we have created a GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/agordonfennell/OHRBETS">https://github.com/agordonfennell/OHRBETS</ext-link>; copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon-Fennell, 2023</xref>) that contains 3D models (also available through TinkerCad), assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, behavioral programs, and scripts for analysis. The OHRBETS platform will allow any investigator to harness the strength of head-fixed approaches to study the neurobiological underpinnings of motivation and related disease states while maintaining many crucial behavioral phenotypes established in freely moving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OHRBETS overview</title><p>We developed OHRBETS, a low-cost, open-source system for head-fixed behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our system consists of custom 3D printed and inexpensive, commercially available components bringing the total cost to around $600 for the operant-only version and around $1000 for the operant+multi-spout version. For head fixation, mice are implanted with a metal head ring and are easily and quickly secured on the head-fixed system for daily behavioral sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). To deliver solutions, including sucrose, we use gravity-fed tubing attached to a stainless steel lick spout that is gated by a solenoid (Parker). The position of the lick spout is controlled using a custom 3D printed micropositioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backyard Brains, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hietanen et al., 2018</xref>), and licks are detected using a capacitive touch sensing. To limit access to consumption, paralleling a retractable lick spout from the widely used freely moving operant assay, we used a linear actuator (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buehler, 2016</xref>) that is controlled using a 5 V micro servo for extending and retracting the spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A 43.2 mm diameter wheel (Lego, 86652c01) coupled to a rotary encoder is mounted underneath the mouse such that their forepaws’ deflections left or right can serve as the operant response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguillon-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>). To limit access to operant responding, paralleling retractable levers used in the freely moving operant assay, we developed a wheel brake controlled via an additional micro servo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). All behavioral components are controlled by an Arduino Mega and the timing of events is relayed via serial communication and recorded using a Python program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our system is inexpensive and easily assembled following instructions freely available through our GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/agordonfennell/OHRBETS">https://github.com/agordonfennell/OHRBETS</ext-link>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OHRBETS (Open-Source Head-fixed Rodent Behavioral Experimental Training System) operant conditioning.</title><p>Overview of functionality for operant conditioning (additional, optional multi-solution functionality illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We measured the linear travel of five sets of retractable spouts using high-speed video recording (200 fps) during 1000, 1 cm spout extensions/retractions and determined the position of the spout using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We found that the retractable spout follows a consistent and reliable pattern with &gt;98% of extensions reaching a terminal position within 0.3 mm of each other in under 180 ms of the extension command (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). We measured the braking ability of four sets of wheel brakes by manually rotating the wheel at different rates in both directions and then programmatically engaging the brake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The wheel brake rapidly stopped wheel rotation in 100% of trials, even with manual velocities that exceed that which a mouse can produce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the effectiveness of the brake to stop wheel rotation in data obtained during operant conditioning experiments and found that most mouse-generated rotations ceased in under 250 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). Together, these results indicate that OHRBETS produces reliable spout extension/retraction and wheel braking using inexpensive micro servos and 3D printed components, and therefore will effectively limit access to consummatory and operant responses during behavioral experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mice rapidly learn head-fixed operant conditioning for sucrose and display operant behaviors established in freely moving experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting the task design for retractable spout training.

We trained head-fixed, water-restricted mice to perform operant conditioning in three stages: (1) free-access lick training, (2) retractable spout training, and (3) operant conditioning (Materials and methods). To measure the reproducibility of OHRBETS, all experiments were conducted using four independent operant-stage assemblies (referred to as box ID, data shown in supplements). To assess the potential differences between subsets of mice, we compared behaviors across each independent OHRBETS setup (box ID), sex, cohort (order of head-fixed and freely moving behavior). We compared the behaviors measured across box ID to determine if each setup was consistent enough to produce quantitatively similar behaviors despite the inherent variability associated with independent behavioral setups.</p><p>We trained mice on a single session of free-access lick training to facilitate licking from the spout and reduce stress associated with head fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Free-access lick training consisted of a 10 min session where each lick immediately triggered a delivery of ~1.5 µL of 10% sucrose which approximates free-access consumption from a standard lick spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During training, 100% of mice licked for sucrose throughout the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similar to the standard freely moving free-access assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spector et al., 1998</xref>), OHRBETS-trained mice licked in discrete licking bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In the free-access lick training session, the total number of licks and the licking microstructure was consistent across sex, cohort, and box ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–P</xref>), as well as across freely moving and head-fixed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Q–V</xref>).</p><p>Next, mice completed three sessions of retractable lick spout training - building the association between spout extension and the availability of reward to enhance the learning rate in subsequent operant conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinhauer et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each session consisted of 60 trials of spout extension, delivery of five pulses of 10% sucrose (~1.5 µL/pulse, 200 ms inter-pulse interval), and a 5 s access period for liquid to be consumed during which an auditory tone (5 kHz, 80 dB) was presented. Mice licked to consume sucrose delivered on most trials with a short latency between spout extension and licking throughout each session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By the third session of training, 31 out of 31 mice licked during 90% of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Mice demonstrated a learned association between spout extension and a simultaneous auditory tone with the availability of sucrose, as they reduced their latency from spout extension to first lick across the three sessions of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). No changes in the proportion of trials with a lick or the number of licks per trial over sessions were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Female mice displayed a higher lick latency in response to spout extension compared to males on the first session of training, but the proportion of trials with a lick and the number of licks per trial was not statistically different between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, H, K</xref>). There were no differences in behavior across cohorts or behavioral systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F, I, G, J, M</xref>), aside from a significant interaction between cohort and session for the mean trial lick count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2L</xref>). Together, these data indicate that mice rapidly learn to lick for sucrose during discrete windows of access.</p><p>After free-access lick training and retractable spout training, water-restricted mice were operantly conditioned for sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Operant conditioning consisted of six sessions of responding for 10% sucrose under fixed-ratio schedule (1/4 rotation for session 1; 1/2 rotation for sessions 2–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; Materials and methods). To assess if mice learned the operant requirement, we examined whether mice increased responding in the active direction over sessions and exhibited a response bias for the active over the inactive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyser et al., 2000</xref>). We found that mice learned to turn the wheel to obtain 10% sucrose in as little as one session, as 25/31 mice showed greater rotation in the active direction compared to the inactive direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, session 1). By the sixth session of operant conditioning, 29/31 mice showed net rotation in the active direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, data from all sessions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), that was the product of increased rotation in the active direction and no change in rotation in the inactive direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As a group, mice showed significantly more rotation in the active direction compared to the inactive direction starting at the second session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Mice that were trained in each of the four boxes showed similar inter-lick intervals, trial lick counts, and latency to lick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). When analyzing behavioral data based on sex, cohort, and box ID, we found only minor differences in behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E–Y</xref>). Notably, we found that over the course of training sessions, female mice exhibit a reduced total active rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3H</xref>), reduced total lick count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3Q</xref>), and reduced bias for rotation in the active direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3T</xref>). These data indicate that mice rapidly exhibit operant responding for sucrose using OHRBETS, and this behavior is consistent across training history and behavioral setup with only minor differences observed between males and females.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-86183-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Video of operant responding for 10% sucrose.</title><p>Video of operant responding for 10% sucrose under a fixed ratio (FR) of 1/2 turn.</p></caption></media><p>Next, we determined if OHRBETS could reproduce other behaviors that have been established in freely moving rodents, including increased active responding following increased cost of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kliner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winger and Woods, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), progressive ratio responding with a fixed reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sclafani and Ackroff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winger and Woods, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), and reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forgays and Levin, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klanker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). To measure the relationship between cost and active response rate, after completing one session with a fixed ratio of 1/4 turn and five sessions of a fixed ratio of 1/2 turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>), we increased the fixed ratio to 1 turn and measured operant responding for four sessions. As observed in freely moving rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), when we increased the cost of reward, mice significantly increased responding in the active direction but not the inactive direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, all sessions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), indicating that they show flexible response rates as a function of reward cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kliner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winger and Woods, 1985</xref>). Next, to measure the motivation to seek different reward magnitudes, we tested mice over multiple sessions of progressive ratio responding for sucrose of varying volumes (1, 5, 10 deliveries of ~1.5 µL of 10% sucrose, counterbalanced order). During progressive-ratio sessions, mice were tested with a linear or logarithmic reinforcement schedule, where the cost for each subsequent reinforcer was higher than the last (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, left, Materials and methods). Under both schedules, mice responded for rewards during progressive ratio and displayed increased breakpoints for greater reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sclafani and Ackroff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winger and Woods, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, right). To determine if mice can learn reversals in response contingency, we trained a naïve group of mice to perform operant responding with an initial rotational direction contingency for five sessions and then switched the contingency and allowed mice to re-learn over seven sessions. We found that mice displayed reversal learning, as they reversed the terminal cumulative position (initially active-initially inactive) following contingency reversal and training over seven sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klanker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Finally, to directly compare behavior during head-fixed and freely moving versions of operant conditioning, we examined behavioral responding in the two tasks within the same mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). We found that mice showed similar changes in response vigor with increased cost of reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>) and similar pattern of reduction in responding over the course of a session after the first 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>) but earned more liquid in the freely moving version of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that mice display flexible operant behavior in our head-fixed system that is sensitive to the cost of reward, the magnitude of reward, and reward contingency, and produces behavior in a parallel manner to freely moving operant conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>OHRBETS-trained mice exhibit positive and negative reinforcement of operant responding during optogenetic stimulation of lateral hypothalamic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons</title><p>After establishing that OHRBETS can measure operant responding for caloric rewards in mice, we determined if OHRBETS can measure operant responding to obtain or avoid optogenetic stimulation of brain circuits that have been previously established to be rewarding or aversive in freely moving rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>).

We first trained mice to nose poke (fixed ratio 1 poke) or turn a wheel (fixed ratio 1/2 turn) to obtain optogenetic stimulation (1 s, 20 Hz, 5 ms pulse duration) of LHA<sup>GABA</sup> cells over four to five sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; training data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). Next, we measured operant responses for different stimulation frequencies by running mice through five sessions of positive optogenetic reinforcement with one of five stimulation frequencies (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 Hz) in counterbalanced order. On the last 20 Hz self-stimulation training session, Vgat-Cre mice expressing ChR2 in the LHA (LHA<sup>GABA</sup>:ChR2) displayed high levels of operant responding for the active hole or active direction and displayed strong discrimination between active and inactive responses; Vgat-Cre mice expressing the mCherry control construct in the LHA (LHA<sup>GABA</sup>:Control) displayed little to no responding and did not discriminate between responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). In both the freely moving and head-fixed conditions, LHA<sup>GABA</sup>:ChR2 mice displayed greater active response rates for higher stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, G and H</xref>) that were positively correlated across the two versions of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To elicit negative reinforcement (responses to cease an aversive stimulus) in the head-fixed procedure, we trained mice to turn a wheel to earn a 3 s pause of continuous stimulation of LHA<sup>Glut</sup> neurons at 5 Hz for sessions 1–5 and 10 Hz for sessions 6–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Following training, Vglut2-Cre mice with expression of ChR2 in the LHA (LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2) displayed high levels of responding in the active direction and strong discrimination between the active and inactive directions, while Vglut2-Cre mice with expression of mCherry control construct in the LHA (LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:Control) displayed little to no responding and no discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Over the course of training, LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2 mice, but not LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:Control mice, increased the number of pauses earned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Compared to LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:Control, LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2 mice showed substantially higher active rotation as well as a moderately higher inactive rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J, L</xref>). LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2 mice acquired negative reinforcement behavior at a reduced rate compared to positive reinforcement for LHA<sup>GABA</sup> optogenetic stimulation (seven sessions to acquisition of negative reinforcement vs one session for positive reinforcement; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, K</xref>). Like positive reinforcement, LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2 mice that were trained on negative reinforcement rapidly ceased responding when the optogenetic stimulation was removed and resumed responding when optogenetic stimulation was reintroduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>, right). To compare behavior in head-fixed to freely moving procedures, we trained the same mice under negative reinforcement in a freely moving procedure. We found that, compared to LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:Control mice, LHA<sup>Glut</sup>:ChR2 mice displayed suppressed amounts of active-responding, number of pauses earned, and inactive responding during the freely moving condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G–I</xref>). The discrepancy between acquisition of negative reinforcement in the head-fixed assay versus the freely moving assay could be attributed to the reduced range of actions mice can make in the head-fixed assay. These results indicate that OHRBETS can elicit responding under negative reinforcement using a simple stimulation procedure that is incapable of producing responding in traditional freely moving conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Head-fixed mice express real-time place preference and avoidance behaviors</title><p>We designed and tested a procedure analogous to measuring valance using real-time place testing (RTPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tye and Deisseroth, 2012</xref>) in head-fixed mice which we name wheel time preference (WTP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). RTPT is extensively used to measure the appetitive or aversive characteristics of neuronal manipulations and importing this approach to head-fixed mice using WTP will permit new and exciting experiments not possible in freely moving subjects. With the same mice utilized for operant conditioning (Materials and methods), we used stimulation of LHA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons as a positive unconditioned stimulus and stimulation of LHA<sup>Glut</sup> neurons as a negative unconditioned stimulus because these two populations have been previously shown to drive real-time place preference and real-time place avoidance, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, for fiber placement see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-cre mice expressing mCherry were pooled and used as a single control group after observing no statistical differences in behavior between the two genotypes. In the standard RTPT, freely moving mice traverse a two-chamber arena in which they receive optogenetic stimulation when the mouse is located in one of the two chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top). In WTP using OHRBETS, the response wheel was divided into two halves relative to the starting position of the wheel, one of which was paired with optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom). To enhance the mouse’s ability to determine their position on the wheel, we included two auditory tones of different frequencies (5 kHz and 10 kHz, 80 dB) that indicated the mouse’s position in the two zones. The two-chamber RTPT and WTP assays offers a distinct advantage for comparing behavior across different versions of the assay because throughout the entire session duration the subject is in one of two states (stimulated or not), allowing for a one-to-one comparison of the amount of time stimulated over the fixed session duration. For both tasks, mice were initially habituated without stimulation for one session and then underwent RTPT/WTP over six sessions with frequency and chamber/wheel-zone pairing counterbalanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For the WTP, mice were initially trained without an auditory tone indicating the wheel zone. After initial training, we paired the wheel zones with auditory tones and found that mice exhibited more obvious preference/avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), so in subsequent sessions these zone cues were added to the task design. Using this approach, we measured the similarity in preference/avoidance behavior with a range of rewarding and aversive stimulation magnitudes across freely moving RTPT and head-fixed WTP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Head-fixed wheel time preference (WTP) and aversion associated with stimulation of lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) subpopulations mirrors freely moving behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Approach, placements depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>.

However, during behavioral sessions, multiple mice were able to consume enough fluid to maintain weight above 90% baseline body weight. Separate groups of mice were used for sucrose, quinine, and sodium chloride solution sets to control for training history. All groups of mice were initially conditioned on free-access licking in one to two sessions and then conditioned with the multi-spout procedure for three to seven sessions prior to five sessions of counterbalanced spout pairing (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The licks measured using this approach approximate consumption, as total number of licks during each session is strongly correlated with weight in fluid consumed during the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using this approach, we successfully measured a range of consumption responses with each set of solutions.</p><p>Mice displayed gradations in licking for different concentrations of sucrose, quinine, and sodium chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–W</xref>).

Mice licking for gradations of quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed a modest range of licking behavior where trials with higher concentrations of quinine elicited a lower number of licks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loney and Meyer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and O</xref>) and shorter time spent licking during the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). Mice licking for gradations of NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q–W</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) showed a large range of licking behavior where trials with higher concentrations of NaCl elicited a lower number of licks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T, V</xref>) and shorter time spent licking during the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5U</xref>).

Mice in the sucrose set started with high licking rates and showed a gradual satiation that resulted in decreased licking across all concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>); mice in the quinine set started with high licking rates but rapidly dropped by around trial 40 across all concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>); and mice in the NaCl set showed only a minor reduction in licking across all concentrations throughout the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5W</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Comparing the total number of licks per session across the three sets of solutions revealed that mice displayed the highest number of licks during the sucrose set, then NaCl, then quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Comparing task engagement using the proportion of trials with licking across the three sets of solutions, mice in the quinine set showed substantially lower proportion of trials with licks compared to mice in the sets for sucrose or NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Mice displayed little to no relationship between the number of licks in the session and weight of the mouse or amount of fluid consumed/provided on the previous session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). We also found that older mice displayed higher lick rates for sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K, L</xref>). Finally, we found no sex differences in task performance, except a lower proportion of trials with licking in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that OHRBETS successfully measures a range of consumption behavior for differential concentrations of appetitive and aversive solutions.</p><p>Given that mice showed a smaller range of licking for gradations in quinine compared to NaCl, we further investigated licking behavior with additional sets of 1:4 serial dilutions of quinine with higher concentrations (starting concentration: low = 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–P</xref>), med = 5 mM, high = 10 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each quinine set produced a modest range of licking behavior with less licking for higher concentrations of quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Mice displayed a lower total licking in the high set compared to the med and low sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>), and mice in all sets showed similar task engagement as indicated by proportion of trials with licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Mice in all sets abruptly stopped licking part-way through the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Overall, each quinine set was capable of producing a range of licking behavior but failed to support licking throughout the entirety of the behavioral session.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Homeostatic demand shifts within-session consumption of gradients of sucrose and NaCl</title><p>To determine if OHRBETS multi-spout assay could detect shifts in consumption behavior following behavioral challenges, we measured consumption of a gradient of sucrose concentrations across homeostatic demand states. We trained mice in the multi-spout brief-access task for five sessions under water restriction, then five sessions under food restriction, and ending with five sessions under no restriction (ad libitum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We observed strong effects of restriction state on consumption behavior across sucrose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Most notably, mice showed a substantially larger range of licking behavior under food restriction compared to water restriction and ad-libitum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Mice showed vastly different levels of total number of licks with the greatest number of licks for all concentrations under water restriction, then food restriction, then ad libitum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Mice also displayed differences in licking rate throughout the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

These data demonstrate that a diverse set of operant and consummatory behaviors are compatible with head-fixed procedures run with a single hardware setup and will serve as a resource for future investigations into these behaviors using neuroscience approaches that rely on head fixation.</p><p>Behavior measures within our head-fixed adaptations of freely moving operant assays reproduce many important phenotypes originally characterized in freely moving behavior. Mice rapidly learn operant responding for sucrose and then flexibly express responding as a function of reward cost and reward size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kliner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reilly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sclafani and Ackroff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winger and Woods, 1985</xref>). Using optogenetic stimulation, which offers tighter control over the precise magnitude and timing of appetitive and aversive states, mice exhibited quantitatively similar positive optogenetic reinforcement, preference, and avoidance behavior with our head-fixed and freely moving approaches. The ability to conduct operant reinforcement and WTP with a single setup is particularly useful in measures of valence-related neural circuits, but these results also imply that the head-fixed WTP procedure could be used to test the appetitive and aversive quality of other stimuli that are challenging to test in freely moving conditions including discrete somatosensory stimuli. Taken together, our results establish that our behavioral system produces robust, reproducible operant behavior consistent with the commonly employed freely moving counterparts.</p><p>Despite the quantitatively similar preference and aversion we measured between the head-fixed WTP assay and freely moving RTPT assay, there exists multiple differences between these assays that could influence behavioral results and their interpretation. Similar to the RTPT assay, the WTP assay assesses valence through the use of two mutually exclusive states (e.g. optogenetic stimulation vs non-stimulation). However, the WTP assay does not replicate the spatial components of the RTPT assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon-Fennell and Stuber, 2021</xref>). The head-fixed and freely moving assays almost certainly rely on different neuronal circuits for completing the task, as the head-fixed WTP does not contain the spatial contextual cues that are inherent to freely moving RTPT and instead relies on discrete auditory cues in addition to the internal state of the subject. Due in part to this distinct difference, we do not expect that all circuit manipulations will produce comparable behavior across the head-fixed WTP and freely moving RTPT even though optogenetic stimulation of LHA<sup>GABA</sup> and LHA<sup>Glut</sup> produced similar preference and avoidance behaviors within these two assays. Therefore, while WTP conducted using OHRBETS offers the ability for new and exciting experiments to assess valence of stimuli in head-fixed mice, the relation of these results to the results of RTPT should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In addition to the operant conditioning experiments, our system can facilitate multi-solution brief-access experiments for studying consummatory behavior. In our task, mice show consumption of a gradient of sucrose, quinine, and NaCl concentrations that closely matches behavior with the freely moving version of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbit and Luschei, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coss et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glendinning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">St John et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loney and Meyer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Villavicencio et al., 2018</xref>). Licking increased monotonically with increased concentrations of sucrose across all homeostatic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glendinning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spector et al., 1998</xref>). However, homeostatic demand states produced pronounced differences in the range of consumption behavior across sucrose concentration, as food restriction produced a substantially larger range of licking behavior compared to water restriction. One unexpected finding was that mice showed vastly different behavior when licking for the aversive tastants quinine and hypertonic NaCl. When licking for quinine, mice abruptly ceased consumption for all concentrations mid-way through the session. On the other hand, when licking for NaCl, mice continue to consume large amounts of low concentrations of NaCl throughout the entire session. These results may be explained by an additive effect of quinine that builds in aversion over trials and results in a lingering bitter taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leach and Noble, 1986</xref>) that attenuates motivation to initiate consumption. During the NaCl sessions, NaCl may stimulate thirst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kraly et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’KELLY, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stricker et al., 2002</xref>) resulting in enhanced motivation to consume water. Thus, the multi-spout brief-access task with gradients of NaCl can be a uniquely advantageous approach for eliciting a high number of strongly aversive events in response to the highest concentrations of NaCl (1.0 and 1.5 M) while continuing to sustain behavioral engagement. Changes in task design could improve performance during the quinine task, such as including water rinse trials between each quinine trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loney and Meyer, 2018</xref>). In addition to using a gradient of solution concentrations, any number of combinations of tastants could be used to study a whole host of behavioral phenomena including innate and conditioned consumption behaviors.</p><p>One potential confound of the radial head design for the multi-spout brief-access experiments is that subjects may be able to learn the relationship between the rotational position of the radial head and the solution in order to use this information to predict solutions before tasting them. We attempted to mitigate this by counterbalancing the spout ID and solution pairings over sessions and conducting experiments in the dark, but we still observed modest reductions in the proportion of trials with licking at the highest concentrations of NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>) which may indicate that mice are able to learn to predict the solution identity over the course of a behavioral session. This effect is not universal, as we did not observe differences in the proportion of trials with licking during sessions with gradients of sucrose and quinine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>). To reduce the chance that anticipatory information is shaping the neuronal correlates associated with different solution trials and ensure that neuronal signals are in response to tasting the solution, we recommend filtering trials to include only trials with licking as we performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Minor adjustments to the approach including increased distance of retraction/extension with enhanced light blockage could further reduce the ability of the subject to predict the solution. Future designs could also take advantage of needle bundles to completely remove the solution prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perez et al., 2013</xref>). Overall the data indicates that under some circumstances, mice are able to predict the solution which should be carefully considered when analyzing behavior and neuronal activity.</p><p>Using our multi-spout brief-access task in conjunction with GRAB-DA fiber photometry, we observed dopamine dynamics that positively correlated with relative solution value and consumption. Previous studies have revealed that dopamine release in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hajnal et al., 2004</xref>) and dopamine neuron activity scales with reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>). We found that dopamine release in these subregions scales with the relative value of the solution being consumed and the amount of concurrent consumption and is strongly influenced by solutions present in a session and the mouse’s homeostatic demand state. We observed differential scaling in the NAcShM and NAcShL across solution sets and homeostatic demand. Dopamine release in the NAcShL showed higher amplitude increases to the most rewarding solutions, especially during consumption of sucrose in both water- and food-deprived states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While we observed greater GRAB-DA signals in the NAcShL compared to the NAcShM, it is important to consider that the GRAB-DA signal reflects changes in dopamine release rather than absolute levels of dopamine. This means that the greater signals we observed in the NAcShL could be the consequence of greater dopamine release or a lower dopamine tone at baseline. The range of dopamine release in the NAcShL closely matches the range of consumption behavior within each stage of the task, while dopamine release in the NAcShM appears disproportionately higher during consumption of gradients of NaCl. If we assume that the range of values is greater during multi-spout consumption of gradients of NaCl compared to gradients of sucrose, as indicated by a greater range in licking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>), then the greater range of dopamine release in the NAcShM could imply that dopamine release in this structure tracks value. Alternatively, this result could indicate a specific role of dopamine release in the NAcShM that corresponds to shaping behavior or learning in the face of aversive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). By conducting these experiments using OHRBETS, we removed approach behaviors that occur prior to consumption and isolated neuronal responses specifically during consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) without interference of activity ramps observed in freely moving behavioral designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Future experiments are necessary to reveal the specific contribution of licking, taste, and value to widespread dopaminergic signals and how these signals causally influence ongoing consumption or learning.</p><p>Eliminating locomotion improves compatibility with many standard neuroscience approaches including optogenetics, fiber photometry, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. To prevent twisting of tethers, each of these approaches requires a commutator in freely moving conditions, but with head fixation the need for a commutator is eliminated. This facilitates multiplexed experiments with simultaneous use of multiple approaches that each rely on independent tethers without the risk of weighing down the animal, tangling, or twisting to the point of affecting task performance. For fiber photometry, fixing the animal dramatically reduces motion artifacts, thereby reducing the need for an isosbestic to correct for motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). This opens the ability to conduct experiments with fluorescence biosensors without known isosbestic points or without true isosbestic points. Recent advances in optical imaging have opened up new approaches in freely moving animals, but the cutting edge of optical technologies will typically start with tabletop microscopes. Using head-fixed models permits users to embrace cutting edge imaging technologies without waiting for further advances to bring the technology into freely moving animals. The use of OHRBETS allows for enhanced compatibility with a variety of neuroscience technologies and will enable novel, multiplexed experiments that would be difficult or impossible to conduct in freely moving animals.</p><p>While head-fixed experiments offer many advantages, they come with important caveats, limitations, and experimental design considerations. Head fixation can be acutely stressful to mice and causes increased levels of circulating stress markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Juczewski et al., 2020</xref>), which could impair learning and interact with other manipulations. Comparisons between head-fixed and freely moving behaviors should be made cautiously, as the stress produced by head fixation may influence behaviors and neuronal activity. Future studies should investigate the relationship between different head-fixed approaches and stress responses to determine best practices for reducing stress associated with head fixation in mice. The advantage of limiting the range of behaviors a subject can display comes at the cost of reduced naturalistic character, which can impair behavior and related neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronov and Tank, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, isolation of components of behavior provides powerful insight into the neuronal mechanisms that underlie the particular component of behavior but may impair insight into how the related neuronal circuits function during more complex behaviors and contexts. Even in the presence of these caveats, extensive research conducted in head-fixed non-human primates has made vast progress in a multitude of areas of neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) including appetitive and consummatory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>). The greatest insights into the neuronal mechanisms of behavior will come from a mixture of both naturalistic behaviors and highly controlled behaviors facilitated by head-fixed behaviors made possible with OHRBETS.</p><p>The OHRBETS platform presented here was designed to be scalable, flexible, and compatible with external hardware. By using low-cost, open-source, and 3D printed components and publishing extensive instructions for assembly, our system is affordable and scalable across labs of all sizes and budgets. Despite the use of low-cost and 3D printed components, our system is remarkably consistent and reliable across hundreds of behavioral sessions. Our hardware and software are modular, as all hardware components can be easily swapped, and all behavioral programs are written to produce data with a uniform format. Using different combinations of components will facilitate conducting a wide variety of behavioral experiments including all the experiments presented in this manuscript and many more. By using an Arduino Mega case as a microprocessor mounted within a 3D printed enclosure, one can integrate many different forms of connectivity to interface with external hardware. In the online models, we have options for communication via BNC, Cat6, and DB25 that can be easily combined to suit the user’s needs. Altogether, OHRBETS is a complete platform for diverse behavioral experiments in head-fixed animals that can be easily adapted by the broader scientific community to conduct an even wider range of procedures that are compatible with monitoring and manipulating neural dynamics in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The timing of events was recorded via serial communication from the Arduino to the computer (PC, running Windows10) by USB. Lick spouts were made by smoothing 23 gauge blunt fill needles using a Dremel with a sanding disk. Liquid delivery was controlled by solenoids (Parker 003-0257-900) gated by the Arduino, using a 24 V transistor. The retractable spout, radial spout, and wheel brake utilized micro servos (Tower Pro SG92R). Licks on each spout were detected individually using a capacitive touch sensor (Adafruit MPR121) attached to each metal spout. Importantly, the baseline capacitance of each sensor was kept to a minimum and touch thresholds were reduced from standard values (see GitHub for detailed instructions). The MPR121 is compatible with optical experiments but may not be compatible with all electrophysiology approaches and may therefore need to be replaced with other approaches for measuring licks.

All animal procedures were pre-approved by Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Washington (#4450-01) or University of Illinois at Chicago (#20-031). A mixture of wild-type and transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J background were used for behavioral experiments throughout the paper. All mice were bred in the lab from mouse lines obtained from Jackson Laboratory aside from 16 wild-type mice obtained directly from Jackson Laboratory. No differences were observed across transgenic lines, so all data was pooled.

Mice used in fiber photometry and optogenetic experiments were singly housed to prevent damage to the optical fibers while all other mice were group-housed. Mice were at least P55 prior to surgery and all groups consistent of both males and females. Mice were assigned to groups randomly at the start of the experiment and the experimenter was not blinded to group identity. Mice were kept on a reverse 12 hr light/dark cycle and behavioral experiments were conducted within the dark cycle unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Surgeries</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5–2% maintenance), shaved using electric clippers, injected with analgesic (carprofen, 10 mg/kg, s.c.), and then mounted in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf) with heat support. Skin overlying the skull was injected with a local anesthetic (lidocaine, 2%, s.c.) and then sterilized using ethanol and betadine. Next, an incision was made using a scalpel, and the skull was cleared of tissue and scored using the sharp point of a scalpel. The skull was leveled, two burr holes were drilled in the lateral portion of the occipital bone, and two micro screws were turned into the bone. We then coated the bottom of a stainless steel head ring (custom machined, see GitHub for design) with Super Glue, placed it onto the skull of the mouse, and then encased the head ring and skull screws with dental cement making sure the underside of the ring remained intact. After the dental cement had time to fully dry, the mouse was removed from the stereotaxic frame and allowed to recover with heat support before being returned to their home cage. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 1 week prior to dietary restriction.</p><p>Mice used for optogenetic or fiber photometry experiments underwent the same procedure as above with the addition of a viral injection and fiber implantation. Following implantation of skull screws, we drilled a burr hole overlaying the brain region target. We then lowered a glass injection pipette into the target brain region and injected the virus at a rate of 1 nL/s using a Nanoject III (Drummond), waited 5 min for diffusion, and then slowly retracted the pipette. For optogenetic experiments, we injected 300 nL of AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (titer: 3.2e12) or AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-mCherry (titer: 3.3e12), and for fiber photometry experiments, we injected 400 nL of AAV9-hSyn-GRAB-DA1h (titer: 2.7e13) or AAV9-hSyn-GRAB-DA2m (titer: 2.4e13). The following stereotaxic coordinates (relative to bregma) were used for injection targets: LHA (0° angle; AP: –1.3 mm; ML: ±1.1 mm; DV: –5.2 mm), NAc medal shell (10° angle; AP: 1.7 mm; ML: ±1.5 mm; DV: –4.8 mm), and NAc lateral shell (10° angle; AP: 1.7 mm; ML: ±2.5 mm; DV: –4.6 mm). Next, we lowered a 200 µm optic fiber for optogenetic experiments (1.25 mm ferrule, 6 mm fiber length, RWD) or a 400 µm optic fiber for fiber photometry experiments (2.5 mm ferrule, 6 mm fiber length, MFC_400/470–0.37_6 mm_MF2.5_FLT, Doric) 0.2 mm dorsal to the injection site and then encased the fiber extending from the brain, metal ferrule, and head ring with Super Glue and dental cement.

In the first session, mice were brought into the behavioral room and allowed to explore the head-fixed apparatus to become acquainted with the sights, smells, and sounds of the behavioral box. On the second session, mice were brought into the behavior room and scruffed twice. In the third session, mice were brought into the behavior room, scruffed twice, and then gently had their rear end and hind paws placed in a 50 mL conical twice. After each habituation session, the mouse was immediately provided food or water depending on their deprivation status. Mice undergoing head-fixed operant conditioning for sucrose or head-fixed multi-spout consumption were habituated to head fixation and trained to lick for sucrose in a single 10 min session. During this session, mice were given free access to water (mice used for quinine and NaCl multi-spout experiments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>]) or 10% sucrose (mice used for all other experiments). Free access was approximated using closed-loop delivery of a pulse of fluid (~1.5 µL) each time the mouse licked the spout. During the training session, mice were head-fixed, and the spout was brought forward to gently touch the mouse’s mouth to encourage licking before being moved to be positioned ~2–3 mm in front of the mouse’s mouth where it remained throughout the session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Head-fixed operant conditioning for sucrose</title><p>Retractable spout training consisted of three daily sessions of 60 trials with 5 s access periods separated by 20–40 s inter-trial intervals. During each access period, an auditory tone (5 kHz, 80 dB) was played and five pulses of ~1.5 µL sucrose were delivered with a 200 ms inter pulse interval. We delivered pulses of sucrose to encourage licking in bouts and to minimize the chance that a large droplet of sucrose would fall.</p><p>Operant conditioning training consisted of six 30 min sessions of initial training, four sessions of increased fixed ratio, and then five to six sessions of progressive ratio. Throughout operant conditioning, one direction of rotation was assigned as the active direction and the opposite direction was assigned as inactive (counterbalanced across mice). Rotation in the active direction earned sucrose delivery. Each sucrose delivery consisted of wheel brake engagement, followed by spout extension and five pulses of ~1.5 µL of 10% sucrose with an inter-pulse interval of 200 ms. During the 3 s access period, the spout remained extended, a 5 kHz auditory tone was presented, and the brake was left engaged. Rotation in the inactive direction led to wheel brake engagement for the same length of time as the total brake time with active rotation, but the spout did not extend, and sucrose was not delivered. During initial training, the fixed ratio of reward was 1/4 turn in the first session and 1/2 turn during the next five sessions. During increased cost sessions, the fixed ratio was increased to one turn. A total of three mice that underwent initial training were removed from progressive-ratio training, two for not learning the task and one that lost their headcap during behavior. During progressive ratio, the wheel turn cost of reward was increased either semilogarithmic: 0.25, 0.5, 0.81, 1.21, 1.71, 2.3, 3.1, 4.1, etc., approximating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Richardson and Roberts, 1996</xref>) or linearly by 0.5 rotation (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, etc.) each time a reward was earned. The session duration was 1 hr, or 15 min without earning a reinforcer, whichever comes first.</p><p>Reversal training was performed in a naive cohort of mice using an identical procedure to initial operant conditioning training, except in session 6 the direction of the wheel rotation that was reinforced was inverted (right turn reinforced → left turn reinforced). Following reversal, the mice were trained on the task for an additional seven sessions of operant conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Optogenetic experiments</title><p>Vgat-Cre and Vglut2-Cre mice underwent surgery for experiments with optogenetics outlined above. After at least 4 weeks of recovery, mice were trained on RTPT/WTP and optogenetic reinforcement experiments in series. All mice were trained on RTPT/WTP prior to optogenetic reinforcement, but the order of head-fixed and freely moving versions were counterbalanced across mice.</p><p>Freely moving RTPT consisted of one session of habituation and six sessions of RTPT with different stimulation frequencies. During habituation, mice were scruffed, attached to an optic fiber, and allowed to explore the RTPT chamber for 10 min. The RTPT chamber was a two-chamber apparatus (50 × 50 × 25 cm<sup>3</sup> black plexiglass) with two identical compartments. Over the next six sessions, mice underwent daily 20 min RTPT sessions with stimulation paired with one of the two compartments. The position of each mouse was tracked in real time using Ethovision (Noldus) and when the mouse’s center point was detected in one of the two compartments it triggered continuous laser stimulation (5 ms pulses, ~10 mW power, frequencies: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 Hz). To prevent associations between stimulation and chambers in the RTPT chamber, the stimulation frequency and compartment paired with laser stimulation were counterbalanced across sessions.</p><p>Head-fixed WTP consisted of three sessions of habituation and twelve sessions of WTP with different stimulation frequencies (six sessions without and six sessions with a tone indicating the mouse’s position). During habituation, mice were habituated to head fixation as outlined above but without sucrose provided. Over the next 12 sessions, mice underwent daily 20 min WTP sessions with stimulation paired to one half of the wheel. Throughout WTP, mice were head-fixed, an optic fiber was connected and covered using blackout tape, and the start of the session was indicated when the wheel brake was disengaged. At the start of the session, the starting wheel position was set in the unpaired zone adjacent to the paired zone. The wheel rotation was tracked by recording the rotation of the wheel relative to the starting position (64 positions/1 rotation) and when the mouse’s position was detected in one of the two zones it triggered continuous laser stimulation (5 ms pulses, ~10 mW power, frequencies: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 Hz). During sessions 1–6 of WTP, there were no extraneous cues indicating which zone the mouse was located in. During sessions 7–12 of WTP, there were tone cues (5 and 10 kHz) that indicated if the mouse was in the paired or unpaired zones of the wheel. To prevent learned associations between stimulation and zones over multiple sessions, we counterbalanced the following factors across sessions: the stimulation frequency, side of the wheel paired with laser stimulation, and the tone paired with laser stimulation.</p><p>Freely moving operant conditioning for optogenetic stimulation with positive reinforcement consisted of one session of habituation, four sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training, and six sessions of optogenetic reinforcement with different stimulation frequencies. During habituation, mice were scruffed, attached to an optic fiber, and allowed to explore the optogenetic reinforcement chamber (MED Associates) for 20 min. The optogenetic reinforcement chamber contained two nose pokes with a light cue located inside and a light cue located above each nose poke, as well as an auditory tone generator. Time stamps of hardware and behavioral events were recorded using MED Associates. During daily 20 min optogenetic reinforcement sessions, one nose poke into the active nose poke triggered 1 s of laser stimulation and concurrent illumination of the active nose poke light cues and 5 kHz auditory tone. Nose pokes during the 1 s stimulation period were recorded but did not result in an additional stimulation. Nose pokes in the inactive hole were recorded but had no programmed consequence. To train mice to respond for laser stimulation, mice were run through five sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training with 20 Hz stimulation. To measure the operant response rates across stimulation frequencies, mice were run though an additional six sessions of optogenetic reinforcement with different stimulation frequencies (5 ms pulses, ~10 mW power, frequencies: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 Hz).</p><p>Head-fixed operant conditioning for optogenetic stimulation with positive reinforcement consisted of five sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training and six sessions of optogenetic reinforcement with different stimulation frequencies. During daily 20 min optogenetic reinforcement sessions, wheel rotation in the active direction triggered 1 s of laser stimulation and concurrent 5 kHz auditory tone. The wheel brake was disengaged throughout the behavioral session. Rotation during the 1 s stimulation period was recorded but did not count toward additional stimulation. Rotation in the inactive direction was recorded but had no programmed consequence. Mice were trained over five sessions of optogenetic reinforcement for 20 Hz stimulation with a fixed ratio of 1/4 turn on session 1 and fixed ratio of 1/2 turn on sessions 2–5. To measure the operant response rates across stimulation frequencies, mice were tested over an additional six sessions of optogenetic reinforcement with different stimulation frequencies (5 ms pulses, ~10 mW power, frequencies: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 Hz) and a fixed ratio of 1/2 turn.</p><p>Freely moving operant conditioning for optogenetic stimulation with negative reinforcement consisted of one session of habituation and three sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training. The habituation and behavioral hardware were identical to the freely moving operant conditioning for optogenetic stimulation with positive reinforcement described above. During daily 20 min optogenetic reinforcement sessions, continuous stimulation was turned on at the start of the session and one nose poke into the active nose poke paused laser stimulation for 3 s and triggered concurrent illumination of the active nose poke light cues and 5 kHz auditory tone. Nose pokes during the 3 s pause period were recorded but did not result in an additional pause. Nose pokes in the inactive hole were recorded but had no programmed consequence.</p><p>Head-fixed operant conditioning for optogenetic stimulation with negative reinforcement consisted of 11 sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training. During daily 20 min optogenetic reinforcement sessions, laser stimulation was turned on at the start of the session and wheel rotation in the active direction paused laser stimulation for 3 s and triggered a concurrent 5 kHz auditory tone. The wheel brake was disengaged throughout the behavioral session. Rotation during the 3 s pause period was recorded but did not count toward additional pause. Rotation in the inactive direction was recorded but had no programmed consequence. Mice were run through five sessions of optogenetic reinforcement training for 5 Hz stimulation and then six sessions for 10 Hz stimulation with a fixed ratio of 1/4 turn in session 1 and fixed ratio of 1/2 in sessions 2–11.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Head-fixed multi-spout consumption</title><p>Mice were habituated to head fixation as outlined above, and then ran through one to three sessions of spout training (see <italic>Habituation to head fixation and free-access lick training</italic>). The multi-spout assay consisted of daily sessions with 100 trials of 3 s access to one of five different solutions (pseudorandom order with two presentations of each solution per every 10 trials), each session with an inter-trial interval of 5–10 s sampled from a uniform distribution. Licks were detected using a capacitive touch sensor and triggered solution delivery via solenoid opening. The duration of opening for each solenoid was calibrated before each experiment to deliver approximately 1.5 µL per solenoid opening by weighing the weight of water produced with 100 solenoid openings. To control for a spout effect, the pairing of solutions to spouts was counterbalanced such that each spout was paired with each solution over every five sessions. Mice were trained for a minimum of three sessions prior to the five consecutive sessions that are averaged together and used for analysis. Mice in experiments with quinine or NaCl were initially trained in the multi-spout assay with water on all five spouts for three sessions prior to introducing quinine or NaCl solutions. Mice in quinine experiment were tested with the low quinine dilution set (1 mM, 1:4 serial dilution) for eight sessions, high (10 mM, 1:4 serial dilution) for three sessions, and med (5 mM, 1:4 serial dilution) for three sessions in series.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Homeostatic demand multi-spout experiments</title><p>For experiments with alterations in the homeostatic demand for sucrose solution, mice were trained on the multi-spout assay under three homeostatic states in series (water-restricted, food-restricted, then ad libitum). First, mice under water restriction were trained in the multi-spout assay for different concentrations of sucrose over eight sessions. Mice were then removed from water restriction and maintained on food restriction for 1 week prior to being run through the multi-spout assay for five sessions. Finally, mice were removed from all restrictions and maintained with ad libitum access to food and water for three sessions prior to being run through the multi-spout assay for eight sessions. The final five sessions from each homeostatic demand state were used for analysis. Mice that went through the fiber photometry recording experiment were run through the same procedure except the order of water restriction and food restriction was counterbalanced across mice, and they were run for three sessions of free-access spout training.</p><p>For experiments with alterations in the homeostatic demand for sodium chloride, mice were trained under water restriction and were then run under two homeostatic states in counterbalanced order (sodium-deplete, sodium-replete). First, mice under water restriction were trained in the multi-spout assay with different concentrations of sodium chloride over 10 sessions. Mice were removed from water restriction and given ad libitum access to water for 48 hr prior to manipulations of sodium demand. To generate sodium demand, we used two injections of diuretic furosemide (50 mg/kg) over 2 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jarvie and Palmiter, 2017</xref>). Mice were weighed, injected with furosemide, and then placed into a clean cage with bedding for 2 hr before being weighed again to confirm diuretic effect (~5% weight loss). Mice were then returned to a clean home cage with ad libitum access water and sodium free chow (Envigo, TD.90228) (sodium-deplete) or a novel sodium-balanced chow (Envigo, TD.90229) (sodium-replete). Mice underwent the same procedure a second time 24 hr later and then were tested for behavior after an additional 24 hr. Mice were tested in the multi-spout assay under either sodium-deplete or sodium-replete states in a single session. Following 48 hr of ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory chow, mice went through the furosemide treatment and behavioral testing again with the opposite homeostatic state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Wild-type mice underwent surgery for expression of dopamine sensors and fiber implantation as outlined above (see <italic>Surgeries</italic>) before undergoing multi-spout consumption of sucrose under different homeostatic demand states (see <italic>Homeostatic demand multi-spout experiments</italic>). We recorded dopamine dynamics in the NAc medial shell and lateral shell simultaneously during behavior in the multi-spout assay over three consecutive sessions in each homeostatic demand state. After head fixation, we connected to the mouse’s fiber implant, patch cables (Doric, 400 µm, 0.37 NA, 2.5 mm stainless steel ferrules) coupled to a six-port mini cube (Doric, FMC6_IE(400-410)_E1(460–490)_F1(500–540)_E2(555–570)_F2(580–680)_S) that was coupled to an integrated fiber photometry system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, RZ10X). We delivered 405 nm and 465 nm light sinusoidal modulated at 211 Hz and 331 Hz, respectively. The average power for each wavelength was calibrated to 30 µW using a power meter (Lux integrated with the RZ10x) prior to the experiment. The fluorescent emission produced by 405 nm and 465 nm excitation were collected using the same fiber used to deliver light and were measured on a photodetector (Lux) and demodulated during recording. The timing of behavioral events were recorded via TTL communication to the fiber photometry system.</p><p>Fiber photometry was analyzed using custom Python and R scripts that are freely accessible through our corresponding public repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/8015631">https://zenodo.org/record/8015631</ext-link>). A custom Python script was used to convert raw data into tidy format and then an assortment of custom R functions were used to process the fiber photometry signals. The decay in signal throughout the session for the 405 and 465 channels were corrected by fitting and subtracting a third-degree polynomial to each raw signal. We then normalized the signals by computing <italic>z</italic>-scores using the mean and standard deviation of the entire session. Using the onset of each access period, we created perievent time histograms with time relative to access onset and then resampled signals to 20 samples per second. We used the 405 signal to assess movement artifacts but did not observe any abrupt changes in fluorescence that typically indicate such artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). The 405 signal was not used to correct the 465 signal because we observed simultaneous opposing signals in the 405 and 465 signal that may be attributed to the fact that 405 is not an ideal isosbestic signal for GRAB-DA. The 465 signal in perievent time histograms was shifted based on the mean signal during the 3 s prior to the onset of the access period. To summarize the dopamine signal during access to each solution, we computed the average and peak signal during the access period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Histology</title><p>We conducted post hoc histology to determine the location of viral expression and optical fiber locations for mice in optogenetic and fiber photometry experiments. At the conclusion of the experiment, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 20 mL 1× PBS and 20 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Heads were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hr, brains were removed and post-fixed for an additional 24 hr, and then brains were transferred to 30% sucrose until they sank. Brains were frozen at –20°C and sectioned at 40 µm on a cryostat (Leica). Every other brain section was collected in 1× PBS and then mounted on a glass slide. Slides were cover-slipped using the mounting medium Fluoroshield with DAPI for visualizing cell nuclei. Sections that contained the bottom of the optic fiber were imaged with epifluorescence at ×5 magnification (Zeiss, ApoTome2; Zen Blue Edition). The location of optic fibers was determined by mapping the position of the fiber using a mouse brain histology atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>).

open-source platform for measuring action elicitation and consummatory behavior in head-fixed animals. The authors present exceptional evidence that this platform allows animals to perform a truly voluntary action whilst their head is held still. The results have the potential to have a broad impact in the field as many labs start to move towards measuring head-fixed behavior effectively, although this is said with the caveat that such behavior will never be an ideal replication of naturalistic behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86183.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bradfield</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03f0f6041</institution-id><institution>University of Technology Sydney</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bradfield</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03f0f6041</institution-id><institution>University of Technology Sydney</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Calipari</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vm5rt34</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gutiérrez</surname><given-names>Ranier</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/009eqmr18</institution-id><institution>CINVESTAV</institution></institution-wrap><country>Mexico</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.13.523828">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.13.523828v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Laura A Bradfield as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Erin Calipari (Reviewer #2); Ranier Gutiérrez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. With your revision, please provide a point x point response to reach reviewer critique in the public and private reviews, paying special attention to the essential revisions below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please rectify issues regarding terminology and density to make the manuscript more accessible to readers. In particular, we found the use of the term &quot;negative ICSS&quot; in Figure to be confusing as, although it is negative reinforcement, it is not clear what &quot;negative ICSS&quot; comprises. Please see specific reviewer comments for more details on this point.</p><p>2) Each reviewer was concerned about the influence of spatial cues (or lack of influence where one would be expected) on results. For instance, we had concerns regarding the putative replication of real-time place preference tasks given the absence of a spatial element in the head-fixed task. Reviewer #3 also had concerns regarding the spatial locations of each sipper that might be encoded as a cue. Please either add caveats to the interpretation of the current tasks or move the relevant figures to supplemental material.</p><p>3) Please include a key resource table.</p><p>4) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report summary statistics (e.g., t, F values) and degrees of freedom, exact p-values, and 95% confidence intervals wherever possible. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.&quot; This should be in the main manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As I do not do head-fixed research, I would just like to know how novel this system is if the authors could please comment.</p><p>2. I suggest the authors include more detail in the manuscript on how to build the system.</p><p>3. I suggest the authors include a statement as to their purpose for comparing across experimental set-ups (i.e. to show the similarities in systems despite the alterations in variables).</p><p>4. Personally I would remove Figure 3 from the manuscript altogether. However, if it is kept in, the authors definitely need to add some caveats discussing how the head-fixed version differs from the free-moving version, as well as noting that the brain cells/circuits involved may differ between tasks.</p><p>5. My preference would be to have the statistics reported in the paper so these can be easily accessed alongside the data they are referring to.</p><p>6. Perhaps authors could clarify their reasoning for making this inference about medial shell without engaging in circular logic.</p><p>7. Grammatical and other errors:</p><p>a. LHA is never spelled out in full (and so before I looked at the diagrams I thought the authors were referring to the lateral habenula).</p><p>b. Line 199 there is an extra 'a' between males and females.</p><p>c. Session should be plural in both cases, line 277.</p><p>8. I also wasn't sure if NaCl could be called 'strongly aversive as they keep drinking it throughout the session at low concentrations. Perhaps the authors could clarify this about the concentrations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do have some suggestions for the authors that I believe would improve rigor and accessibility.</p><p>1) The authors present an impressive collection of experiments and behavioral analysis as validation of the OHRBETS platform, however, some of the extensive analyses and data portrayal may make the straightforward findings relatively difficult to digest as a reader (especially one that does not have a strong background in reinforcement learning). A general streamlining of each figure may improve readability/accessibility. Some suggestions are below:</p><p>a. Figure 1: A single graph is likely sufficient to convey each behavioral manipulation (i.e. response cost, progressive ratio, contingency reversal). When presented in bulk, a reader that is not as familiar with different behavioral portrayals may get bogged down in multiple representations of a singular message. Individual session records are informative (and suitable for a supplementary figure) but may be unnecessary here.</p><p>b. Alternatively, Figure 1A-E (Apparatus diagram and mechanical validation) may be better served as a stand-alone figure, apart from Figure1F-Q.</p><p>c. Figure 2: The correlations in panel I don't provide any information that can't be discerned from the analysis conveyed in panel H.</p><p>d. This is true of Figure 3F as well.</p><p>e. Analysis such as in Figure 3 Supplement 1C are excessive – p-values, correlation coefficients, etc. should not be parametrically compared and don't need to be visually depicted.</p><p>2) It's not clear that the wheel-turning procedure depicted in Figure 3 is entirely analogous to a place preference procedure. RTPP procedures in freely-moving animals likely involve spatial learning/associative processes that may not be necessary to perform the wheel-turning task (under the control of an auditory cue). A task involving visual VR (perhaps with tactile stimuli discriminating wheel position) may be better suited for an RTPP analogue. This could be addressed by not specifically describing this task in this way.</p><p>3) &quot;Negative ICSS&quot; is not the appropriate term for the task described in figure 2, as the animals avoid/escape stimulation as opposed to 'self-stimulating'. Revise the language here for clarity – e.g positive and negative reinforcement with ICS, ICS avoidance, etc.</p><p>4) The circadian effects on consummatory behavior are orderly but don't provide critical validation of consummatory measures – while in line with the literature, this may be more appropriate as a supplemental figure; however, I will leave that up to the authors to decide what they think is appropriate.</p><p>5) Repeatedly referring to the platform as an 'ecosystem' more confusing than descriptive and limiting jargon would make the manuscript more accessible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is quite relevant to the Neuroscience field and will be of general interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> audience. The experiments were carefully done. It is expected that OHRBETS will be widely used in multiple Neuroscience labs. However, I have some major comments that the authors need to address to improve the manuscript.</p><p>The authors failed to discuss the major caveat of OHRBETS, since each sipper is spatially put in a different location (rather than putting them in a bundle, see https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00492.2012). Hence, with overtraining, this spatial exteroceptive information could be used by mice to anticipate taste identity. For example, if one concentration is Quinine and the other different tastants (sucrose, NaCl, HCl), is it possible that mice learn to predict Quinine or sucrose stimuli? This experiment is not shown since the Authors used different mice and only tested arrays of concentrations of one taste quality. I would like the authors to discuss the possibility that mice could use the spatial location of sippers as a cue. Perhaps a future device could be improved by using needles in a bundle rather than a circular configuration of the sippers.</p><p>The introduction is overly optimistic and biased towards only the positive benefits of head-fixed preparations. It will benefit to briefly introduce some caveats of the technique right from the introduction, for example, authors wrote:</p><p>&quot;Eliminating or controlling physical approach behaviors also allows for isolation of both appetitive and consummatory behaviors and related neuronal dynamics. By removing turning associated with locomotion, head-fixed behavioral approaches offer enhanced compatibility with neuroscience approaches that require tethers including optogenetics and fiber-photometry&quot;.</p><p>It is a common misconception to assume that head-fixed mice are not moving at all, they, in fact, continue performing subtle movements during head fixation, we can measure them using cell loads.

Thus, it is unknown if this device is really compatible with electrophysiological recordings, such as neuropixels.</p><p>More importantly, although the authors mention it briefly in the discussion, the Stress induced by restricting the mice is an enormous difference between freely moving and head-fixed preparations that should always be highlighted. The authors did not measure stress hormones, but some previous work shows this effect.</p><p>At the discussion, nothing is mentioned about NAcShL dopamine results!!

We have also added a full paragraph to the discussion where we outline the differences in the task requirements and relevant neuronal circuits between the freely-moving RTPP and head-fixed WTP. We understand that the head-fixed task is not a perfect analog of the RTPP task, however based on the similarity in the resulting time spent in the stimulation chamber/zone we believe that the WTP is able to replicate the valence assessment that many in the field uses RTPP to measure. We believe that the WTP with OHRBETS opens up new possibilities for assessing preference in head-fixed mice and this justifies keeping the figure within the main manuscript.</p><p>To thoroughly address the potential confound of spatial information during the multi-spout experiment, we have added an additional supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 5) that depicts the proportion of trials with licking and added a paragraph to the discussion centered on the potential confound associated with learning the solution identity.

As I do not do head-fixed research, I would just like to know how novel this system is if the authors could please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The novelty of the system stems from the synergistic combination of functionality, the low-cost open source nature of the design, and the breadth of behavioral procedures the system is able to support. The use of a wheel as an operant response was adapted from the International Brain Laboratory rig which has been used extensively for visual discrimination tasks. We adapted this wheel design to make the response closer to lever pressing through the use of the wheel brake, which ensures that subjects have to rotate the wheel in discrete rotational bouts rather than continuously spinning the wheel and potentially disengaging and allowing the wheel to rotate independently. There are no examples of systems capable of delivering 5+ solutions within a behavioral session or conducting valence testing with a modification of real-time place preference without the cost and complexity associated with virtual reality. We believe that the combination of factors, the flexibility and scalability of the system makes OHRBETS a novel and useful system for diverse motivation and consumption behaviors in head-fixed mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The task was designed to reduce any predictive information from the subject calibrating rotational position and linear position of the multi-head such that the terminal position of each spout was located in roughly the same spatial position relative to the subject. We also counterbalance the spout ID and the solution over sessions to minimize over training of the subjects. However, despite these mitigating steps, the mice show less trials with engaging in licking during the high molar NaCl during the multi-NaCl sessions (see attached figure). This indicates to us that mice are capable of learning to at least partially predict the solution identity prior to tasting the solution while still maintaining enough trials with licking to measure neuronal correlates in response to aversive tastants. The ability to predict solutions prior to licking does not seem to be present during the multi-quinine sessions, possibly due to the substantially lower number of completed trials or a poorer ability to distinguish between difference concentrations. We chose a radial head design in order to eliminate the risk of tastant contamination across trials, but we agree that a needle bungle approach should be effective at reducing the solution prediction and future versions of the system could incorporate this approach.</p><p>We have included the data presented here as a supplemental figure and we have included a paragraph discussing the potential confound and possible mitigation within the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction is overly optimistic and biased towards only the positive benefits of head-fixed preparations.

However, according to personal communication with Dr. Ottenheimer, the MPR121 capacitive touch sensor may not be compatible with all neuropixels rigs. We now address the possibility of incompatibility in the methods section after referring to the MPR121.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, although the authors mention it briefly in the discussion, the Stress induced by restricting the mice is an enormous difference between freely moving and head-fixed preparations that should always be highlighted.

We completely agree that the stress associated with head-fixation is a major potential confound that should be highlighted within the manuscript. To thoroughly acknowledge the potential confounds associated with head-fixation stress, we have added the following in the second sentence of the introduction: “At the cost of reduced naturalistic behavior and enhanced stress…”.</p><p>To more thoroughly address the concerns associated with head-fixation stress, we have also expanded the discussion of stress within the caveats paragraph in the discussion:</p><p>“Comparisons between head-fixed and freely moving behaviors should be made cautiously, as the stress produced by head-fixation may influence behaviors and neuronal activity. Future studies should investigate the relationship between different head-fixed approaches and stress responses to determine best practices for reducing stress associated with head-fixation in mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the discussion, nothing is mentioned about NAcShL dopamine results!! DA release in this region was more robust than NAcShM.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to keep the discussion concise but should have included a more detailed discussion of the dopamine release in both the NAcShL and NAcShM. We have added the following discussion:</p><p>“Dopamine release in the NAcShL shows higher amplitude increases to the most rewarding solutions, especially during consumption of sucrose in both water and food deprived states (Figure 8). While we observed greater GRAB-DA signals in the NAcShL compared to the NAcShM, it is important to consider that the GRAB-DA signal reflects changes in dopamine release rather than absolute levels of dopamine. This means that the greater signals we observe in the NAcShL could be the consequence of greater dopamine release, or a lower dopamine tone at baseline.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
