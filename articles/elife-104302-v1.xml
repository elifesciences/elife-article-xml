to track transplants non-invasively by PET/CT in mouse models, without the need for genetic modification of the transferred cells. We provide a comparison of the specificity and kinetics of the PET signals acquired when using nanobodies radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, and <sup>18</sup>F, and find that the chelation of the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radioisotopes to anti-TfR nanobodies results in radioisotope release upon endocytosis of the radiolabeled nanobodies. We used a knock-in mouse that expresses a TfR with a human ectodomain (Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic>) as a source of bone marrow for transplants into C57BL/6 recipients and show that V<sub>H</sub>H188 detects such transplants by PET/CT. Conversely, C57BL/6 bone marrow and B16.F10 melanoma cell line transplanted into Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> recipients can be imaged with V<sub>H</sub>H123. In C57BL/6 mice impregnated by Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> males, we saw an intense V<sub>H</sub>H188 signal in the placenta, showing that TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs accumulate at the placental barrier but do not enter the fetal tissue. We were unable to observe accumulation of the anti-TfR radiotracers in the central nervous system (CNS) by PET/CT but showed evidence of CNS accumulation by radiospectrometry. The model presented here can be used to track many transplanted cell types by PET/CT, provided cells express TfR, as is typically the case for proliferating cells such as tumor lines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PET/CT</kwd><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>biodistribution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001491</institution-id><institution>Belgian American Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-FELLOW-E044/PDF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balligand</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010978</institution-id><institution>Wallonie-Bruxelles International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WBI.World SUB/2021/512532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balligand</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grand Challenges GC01-C04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Strooper</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name><name><surname>Dewilde</surname><given-names>Maarten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Interne Fondsen</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaspers</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name><name><surname>Dewilde</surname><given-names>Maarten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Methusalem</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Strooper</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two radio-labeled nanobodies and a single knock-in mouse model suffice to track the biodistribution of various unmodified cell-types in live mice by PET/CT.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-invasive tracking of specific cell types in vivo is a desirable goal in many fields of biomedical research, particularly as it pertains to immunology and cancer. Knowledge of the biodistribution of immune cells and/or tumor cells in a disease model is essential to monitor therapeutic interventions. Real-time non-invasive in vivo imaging may be achieved by several methods, each with their strengths and limitations. Fluorescence and luminescence-based methods suffer from absorbance and dispersal of emitted light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>), which limits the depth at which images of acceptable resolution can be obtained. Fluorescence-based methods in conjunction with multi-photon microscopy provide cellular resolution, but usually require invasive surgery to gain access to the cells of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Methods that rely on the use of radioisotopes, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) do not suffer those drawbacks. While SPECT and PET lack the resolution of optical microscopy, they have the advantage of being non-invasive, quantitative, and enabling whole-body imaging in small animals at a resolution of ~1 mm, or a 1 microliter volume, for PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serkova et al., 2021</xref>) and even lower than 1 mm for SPECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Have et al., 2009</xref>). These methods are finding increasing use in the field of tumor immunology, as they can provide a whole-body image, unlike other approaches.</p><p>Current PET/CT cell tracing methods require the use of a cell-specific tracer. This typically relies on the detection of an endogenous surface marker that is specific for the cells of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2019</xref>), or by genetically engineering cells of interest to enable their visualization, for example through expression of a viral kinase of unique specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gambhir et al., 2000</xref>), or by introduction of a surface marker that can be selectively visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minn et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>V<sub>H</sub>Hs, also termed nanobodies, are enjoying increasing use for the generation of immuno-PET tracers that yield images of a quality superior to what is achieved using regular, intact immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harmand and Islam, 2021</xref>). Nanobodies are the recombinantly expressed variable fragments (V<sub>H</sub>) of heavy chain-only immunoglobulins produced by camelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingram et al., 2018</xref>). Their small size (~15 kDa), superior tissue penetration, specificity, affinity, and much shorter circulatory half-life compared to intact immunoglobulins make nanobodies excellent tracers for in vivo imaging. We here apply nanobodies specific for the transferrin receptor to track the fate of transplanted cells non-invasively.</p><p>The transferrin receptor (TfR; CD71; encoded by <italic>Tfrc</italic>) is a homodimeric type-II transmembrane protein that is near-ubiquitously expressed, in particular on proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawabata, 2019</xref>). This includes many tumor cells with some variability depending on the tumor type and differentiation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryschich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faulk et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daniels et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basuli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rychtarcikova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kindrat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horniblow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shirakihara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prutki et al., 2006</xref>). The TfR binds to and endocytoses iron (Fe<sup>+++</sup>)-loaded transferrin (Tf). Tf remains bound to the TfR in endosomal compartments, where the resident low pH releases the Fe<sup>+++</sup> cargo and thus converts Tf into apoTf, which remains TfR-bound at endosomal pH. From there, TfR-bound apoTf returns to the cell surface, where the TfR releases apoTf at neutral pH. TfR is also expressed by endothelial cells that line the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for delivery of Fe<sup>+++</sup>-loaded transferrin to the central nervous system by transcytosis. The nanobodies used in this study bind TfR and can traverse the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2022</xref>). Mouse embryos critically depend on an iron supply in the form of Tf captured from the maternal circulation, delivered to the embryo via the TfR expressed on the syncytiotrophoblast-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sangkhae and Nemeth, 2019</xref>). Whether the small size of nanobodies allows them by analogy with the BBB- to traverse the placenta and reach the embryo has not been explored.</p><p>We use two nanobodies: V<sub>H</sub>H123 (also termed Nb62 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>) and V<sub>H</sub>H188, which recognize the murine TfR and the human TfR (TFRC), respectively. We use these V<sub>H</sub>Hs together with a knock-in mouse model that expresses a TfR with a human TfR ectodomain (Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2022</xref>). The specificity of each nanobody for the respective TfR and the availability of Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice as a source of primary cells allows us to track different cell types in a transplant setting. V<sub>H</sub>H123 allows the detection of cells of mouse origin, such as bone marrow progenitors or tumor cells, transplanted into Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice. Conversely, we use V<sub>H</sub>H188 to track primary cells from Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice after transfer into wild-type mice. Pregnancy represents a unique model akin to a transplant. We report the first immuno-PET study on localization of the TfR in mouse embryos in live mice.</p><p>We find that <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu, ligated to these TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs by non-covalent chelation, are released from the imaging agent upon binding the TfR, due to internalization and exposure to low endosomal pH. The release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu from imaging agents are factors to consider when using these over extended periods of time. Covalent modification of V<sub>H</sub>Hs with <sup>18</sup>F avoids the release of free radioisotope, but the short half-life of <sup>18</sup>F limits the observation window to &lt;12 hr. We compare the use of three commonly used positron-emitting isotopes (<sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, and <sup>18</sup>F) and offer a suite of tools to track many cell types in mice, without the requirement for specific cell markers or genome editing. At most, crossing of a mouse model of interest with the Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mouse line would be required (deposited at Jackson Laboratories, strain 038212).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>V<sub>H</sub>H123 binds mouse TfR and V<sub>H</sub>H188 binds human(ized) TfR in vitro and in vivo</title><p>We characterized the specificity of V<sub>H</sub>H123 (anti-mouse TfR) and V<sub>H</sub>H188 (anti-human TfR) by biochemical methods and by PET/CT. We confirmed the specificity of each anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H for its target by immunoprecipitation from lysates of HEK293 (human) or B16.F10 (mouse) cell lines. We show that both V<sub>H</sub>Hs bind only to the appropriate TfR, with no obvious cross-reactivity to other surface-expressed proteins by immunoblot, LC/MSMS analysis of immunoprecipitates, SDS-PAGE of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The mean activity measured by PET was significantly different between matched and unmatched V<sub>H</sub>H/mouse pairs in the liver, spleen, femoro-tibial articulation (knee), and spleen, by region of interest (ROI) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). While the signals from long bone extremities and vertebrae suggest uptake of the anti-TfR radioconjugate by bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zimmer et al., 2011</xref>), presumably due to the high demand for iron required for erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richard and Verdier, 2020</xref>), this pattern of label distribution is better explained by sequestration of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in mineralized bone and cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raavé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou et al., 2011</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The weak signal from the diaphyses of the femora relative to the intense signal in the vertebral column and bone extremities suggests that accumulation of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in mineralized bone predominates under these conditions. To assess this, we measured the activity of specific tissues ex vivo 72 hr post radiotracer injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Several tissues showed significant differences in activity between the matched and unmatched mouse/V<sub>H</sub>H pairs: particularly in the brain, spleen, small intestine, and liver. Femur bones flushed of all bone marrow retained a very strong activity in the matched conditions – showing that the mineral bone retains a high activity when depleted of bone marrow (&gt;200,000 CPM/bone) – confirming the deposit of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in the bone matrix. Nevertheless, flushed bone marrow showed activity (20,000–30,000 CPM/flushed bone) that was significantly higher in the matched vs. unmatched conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We conclude that at later timepoints, the strong PET signals in the long bone extremities (femur, tibia, and humerus) are due in part to bone marrow accumulation of anti-TfR radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>Hs, but predominantly so to accumulation of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in the mineralized bone matrix. No obvious accumulation of tracer was seen in brain parenchyma by PET, but significant differences of activity were found in the ex vivo analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), in line with the reported ability of V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize the TfR to deliver bound materials across the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wouters et al., 2020</xref>). The failure to detect a PET signal of adequate strength in the brain are due to the comparatively small amounts of anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H that cross the BBB. When analyzing PET images obtained with V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize targets other than the TfR, which includes V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rashidian et al., 2017</xref>), Ly6C/G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pishesha et al., 2022</xref>), or CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Priem et al., 2020</xref>), as examined previously, no accumulation of <sup>89</sup>Zr in skeletal elements was seen. These previous observations, combined with the lack of any bone signal in the mismatched anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H/mouse pairs, lead us to conclude that free <sup>89</sup>Zr is released from the V<sub>H</sub>H-conjugates in vivo, but only when the V<sub>H</sub>H binds to its respective TfR.</p><p>Because chelation of <sup>89</sup>Zr to DFO depends on its charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imura et al., 2021</xref>), we hypothesized that binding of V<sub>H</sub>H-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates to the appropriate TfR delivers them to endosomal compartments of low pH, where <sup>89</sup>Zr is then released from the DFO moiety. We examined release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO construct in vitro by exposure to low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). <sup>89</sup>Zr is freed from the adduct at pH &lt;5.6, which is well within the pH range of late endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cain et al., 1989</xref>). Whether the mildly acidic pH of early or recycling endosomal compartments is sufficient for isotope release in vivo remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison of <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, and <sup>18</sup>F isotopes conjugated to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs</title><p>Having observed the release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO imaging agent, we considered the use of <sup>64</sup>Cu as an alternative radioisotope. We also synthesized an adduct covalently labeled with <sup>18</sup>F to circumvent any possible release of free radioisotope. The rather different half-lives of <sup>89</sup>Zr (~3.3 days), <sup>64</sup>Cu (~12 hr), and <sup>18</sup>F (~110 min) dictate the observation windows allowed by their use, which we arbitrarily set at 3–5 half-lives, thus ranging from 10 hr (<sup>18</sup>F) to ~2 weeks (<sup>89</sup>Zr), with ~3% of the injected dose remaining after 5 half-lives due to isotope decay.</p><p>We generated a V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu version, where <sup>64</sup>Cu is chelated by NOTA and would not accumulate in mineralized bone if released. The use of a <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled tracer should allow an observation window of 3–5 half-lives, i.e., ~36–60 hr. For comparison, we produced a V<sub>H</sub>H123-tetrazine-TCO-<sup>18</sup>F construct, where <sup>18</sup>F is incorporated covalently through tetrazine-TCO click-chemistry, by an inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder (IEDDA) reaction between V<sub>H</sub>H123-tetrazine and <sup>18</sup>F-TCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Selvaraj and Fox, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). This precludes isotope release other than by proteolysis. We injected these imaging agents for a side-by-side comparison with V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). At 1 hr post-injection of the <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, or <sup>18</sup>F-labeled radiotracer, we observe a strong PET signal in the diaphyses and both epiphyses of the femora and in the coxal bones and sacrum (bone marrow), thus showing that V<sub>H</sub>H123 accumulates specifically at those locations, and that the signal is not simply due to free radioisotope only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H123 also accumulated in the spleen. The <sup>18</sup>F-based imaging agent provided a sharper picture, with some signal originating from the gut and gall bladder, typically seen when using <sup>18</sup>F-based radiotracers comprising bulky hydrophobic moieties, in this case a TCO-Tetrazine clicked product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). At the 12 hr timepoint the <sup>18</sup>F signal had fully decayed due to the short half-life of <sup>18</sup>F. Improved signal quality is thus offset by the shorter half-life of <sup>18</sup>F. For the <sup>64</sup>Cu-based agent, the bone marrow signal remains weakly visible at 24 hr post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The liver and gut signals increase at later timepoints for the <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled tracer, a phenomenon attributable to a slow release of <sup>64</sup>Cu from NOTA to plasma proteins such as albumin, which delivers copper to the liver where it can then be conjugated to ceruloplasmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dearling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mirick et al., 1999</xref>). In mice that received the <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled agent, we mostly observe a signal from the bone extremities and vertebrae at 24 hr post-injection, which we attribute to labeling of mineralized bone with free <sup>89</sup>Zr with a minor contribution of a TfR-specific bone marrow signal. For all imaging agents, we observe a pair of punctiform signals in the anterior region of the cranium. These appear very prominently with the <sup>18</sup>F tracer, and at later timepoints -but less clearly- with the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu imaging agents, potentially explained by the lower positron emission range of <sup>18</sup>F. Limited by the resolution of the CT images, we tentatively attribute these signals to the accumulation of the radiotracer in the roots of the incisors, where iron uptake is required for proper amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKee et al., 1987</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the PET signals acquired 1 hour after injection of <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu and <sup>18</sup>F-labelled VHH123.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (left column) and Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice (right column) were injected with 3.7 MBq (100 µCi) of different V<sub>H</sub>H-123-PEG(20 kDa) based conjugates as indicated on the left side of the panels.

This is particularly clear from a ROI analysis of the liver and knee PET signals, when normalized to the average kidney signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), that shows a shift of distribution of PET signal towards the liver with <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled V<sub>H</sub>H123 and towards the knee for <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled VHHs at later timepoints post-injection. Combined, these results establish specificity of recognition of the respective V<sub>H</sub>Hs for their intended targets.

We used V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr to determine whether bone marrow engraftment would suffice to reproduce the signal pattern observed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. At 2 weeks post bone marrow transplantation, 24 hr after injection of V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr, the presence of the transferred cells in the marrow is observed in the spleen and femoral bone, together with a strong signal from free <sup>89</sup>Zr accumulation in the bone matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The signal in the spleen appeared more prominent than that observed when imaging wild-type C57BL/6 mice at 24 hr post-injection of the same VHH, as pointed out through ROI analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which could reveal the presence of hematopoietic bone marrow in the spleen. The same observations were made in the reverse experiment where transplantation of Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> bone marrow into C57BL/6 recipients was performed before imaging the recipients 15 days after transplantation using V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and G</xref>). Strikingly, the images acquired at 1 hr post V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr injection show a powerful signal in the spleen, something not observed when imaging Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice with the same radiotracer, which can be easily interpreted as the presence of bone marrow engraftment in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and G</xref>). As a control, V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr was unable to show engraftment of C57BL/6 bone marrow cells in an isogenic recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and G</xref>). Because the transferred bone marrow cells proliferated in the 14 days prior to imaging, they reached numbers adequate for the release of <sup>89</sup>Zr that would then accumulate in the bone matrix. Indeed, imaging of Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> recipient mice immediately after C57BL/6 bone marrow transplantation using V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr reveals only a faint signal in the knee and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Specific tracing of TfR-positive cells of mouse or human origin is thus possible when using V<sub>H</sub>H123 or V<sub>H</sub>H188 as the tracer in a Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> or wild-type recipient, respectively. Depending on the mass of TfR<sup>+</sup> cells present the recipients, timing of tracer injection and the PET imaging session is critical to avoid the confounding effect of the free <sup>89</sup>Zr bone matrix signal.

Imaging done at 2 weeks post-inoculation of the B16F10 tumor did not yield a clear signal in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as metastases typically arise some 3 weeks after injection for this number of cells.

No signal was detected in the no tumor control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

The PET signal from B16.F10 metastases in the lung correlates well with what appears to be dense tumor tissue on the corresponding CT image.

It is important to emphasize that ROI analysis on lung and heart is less precise, due to breathing movements and beating heart during acquisition of the PET signal. Kidney signals were significantly different between tumor-free mice that received V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu and the other groups, which we attribute to a difference in clearance rate of the radioconjugates.

Since all proliferating cells express TfR, in principle, any tumor or proliferating cell of mouse origin can be detected non-invasively without the need for genetic modification of the transplanted cells.

Maternal Tf is taken up at the blood-placenta barrier (BPB) to deliver iron to the developing embryo. We asked whether the V<sub>H</sub>H188 nanobody would detect TfR expressed by syncytiotrophoblasts-I at the BPB. C57BL/6 females were mated with a Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> male or with a C57BL/6 male as a control. Embryos will thus be heterozygous for the presence of the two TfR isoforms. We hypothesize that proper mouse and human TfR homodimers will be formed, in addition to the possible formation of the interspecific hybrid TfR heterodimer. Two weeks post-fertilization, the pregnant females were injected retro-orbitally with V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr. We observed rapid uptake of the V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr radiotracer in the individual placentas of the heterozygous (Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/wt</sup></italic>) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

We attribute the low but detectable signal for V<sub>H</sub>H188 to possible cross-reactivity to the mouse TfR when expressed at the very high levels on syncytiotrophoblast-I: placental tissue expresses a much higher than average level of Tfr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sangkhae and Nemeth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2009</xref>).

These include the monitoring of tumor growth in response to various forms of therapy in a pre-clinical setting, or to follow the fate of transplanted cells of hematopoietic origin. Methods currently in use include luminescence-based approaches, in which the transplanted cells are engineered to express a suitable reporter, such as a luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2011</xref>). Luminescence methods do not provide cellular resolution. Alternatively, to achieve single-cell resolution, fluorescence-based methods have been applied in multi-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>), but this typically involves invasive surgical interventions to expose the target tissue or organ, because absorption by surrounding tissue limits the depth of penetration of the excitation beam and emitted fluorescence.</p><p>Non-invasive methods such as NMR lack the specificity to detect particular cell populations, although tumors that exceed a certain size are readily visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serkova et al., 2021</xref>). SPECT and PET can detect specific cell populations based on the use of radiolabeled ligands that recognize them, but lack single-cell resolution. The most widely used radioisotopes for SPECT include <sup>123</sup>I and <sup>99</sup>Tc, with half-lives of ~13 hr and ~6 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adak et al., 2012</xref>). Radiolabeled immunoglobulins used as imaging agents show excellent specificity, but their molecular mass (~150 kDa) impedes efficient tissue penetration and imposes a long circulatory half-life. When using immunoglobulin-based imaging agents for PET, the use of long-lived radioisotopes such as <sup>89</sup>Zr (t<sub>1/2</sub>=~3.3 days) is, therefore, indicated.</p><p>The introduction of nanobodies for SPECT and PET overcomes many of the limitations of immunoglobulin-based imaging agents. The small size of nanobodies improves tissue penetration and drastically reduces the circulatory half-life of nanobody-based imaging agents. Free nanobodies are typically excreted via the kidneys and have a circulatory half-life of ~30 min, versus a half-life (in mice) of several days for intact immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oliveira et al., 2013</xref>). This means that unbound nanobodies are rapidly cleared from the circulation to yield a much-improved signal-to-noise ratio. Conjugation of a PEG<sub>20kDa</sub> moiety further improves contrast by reducing somewhat the renal clearance rate of the nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rashidian et al., 2016</xref>). Chemo-enzymatic methods for the modification of nanobodies allow their site-specific and reproducible modification with substituents of interest, including the installation of chelators for radiometals such as <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu, as well as click handles for site-specific covalent modification with <sup>18</sup>F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harmand and Islam, 2021</xref>).</p><p>For detection of tumors, xenografts in immunocompromised mice are widely used in combination with tumor-specific imaging agents. Typically, they are based on antibodies that recognize human-specific surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freise and Wu, 2015</xref>). Methods for the detection of tumors of mouse origin in their natural host are few and far between. It is for this reason that we explored the possibility of using a congenic pair of mice in combination with nanobodies that distinguish the congenic marker, in this case, the TfR. We show that a combination of anti-TfR nanobodies and mice that express either a wild-type (mouse) or a humanized TfR may be used to trace different cell types in vivo that express the TfR. To that end, we transferred hematopoietic bone marrow cells and B16.F10 melanoma cells into the respective mouse recipients. It is thus possible to track cells of mouse origin in humanized Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice and humanized Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mouse bone marrow in C57BL/6 mice. Mice carrying Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/wt</sup></italic> fetuses showed a strong signal for VHH188 in the placenta, indicative of trans-endothelial transport of the imaging agent. Except for the TfR on syncytiotrophoblast-I, at 14 days of gestation, no other embryonic tissues showed any accumulation of label.</p><p>The combination of human and mouse-specific anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs with mice that were engineered to express a TfR with the human TfR ectodomain constitutes a congenic pair of mice ideally suited for a variety of transplant experiments. The growth of tumors of mouse origin, when transplanted into Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mice, can be followed non-invasively, for example, in response to various treatments. Conversely, human patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX models) can be followed upon transplantation into mice without a requirement for genetic modification of the transplant, even if no tumor-specific antibodies are available. Transplantation of C57BL/6-isolated tissues and tumor cells (-lines) in Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> is straightforward, as both recipient and graft are of the same genetic background. The only required neo-epitope of the graft would be the ectodomain of the TfR, which we consider a negligible risk for immune rejection: the Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> mouse expresses a chimeric TfR protein where only aminoacids 196–381 of the mouse TfR are replaced with the homologous aminoacids of the human TfR, that have a 74% pairwise identity by alignment using Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madeira et al., 2024</xref>). The lack of an obvious PET signal in the CNS when imaging mice may be due to the fact that proteins that traverse the BBB, such as the TfR nanobody conjugates, accumulate in the CNS at a concentration far lower (around 1–5%) than that in blood plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pothin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meier et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, <sup>89</sup>Zr radioconjugates are prone to radioisotope release post-internalization, which is the first step of transcytosis required for plasma proteins to traverse the BBB. Finally, both the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radioconjugates were PEGylated, which may impede transcytosis. While the use of non-PEGylated <sup>18</sup>F radioconjugates might circumvent these issues, their short circulatory and isotopic half-life may not allow the visualization at adequate sensitivity of a signal in the CNS. Even so, gamma ray spectrometry on various organs from mice that received <sup>89</sup>Zr-conjugated anti-TfR tracers confirmed accumulation of both nanobodies in the CNS of the appropriate genotype compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu by the nanobody conjugates was a surprising observation, unique to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs. For no other <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled, PEGylated V<sub>H</sub>H have we seen such a striking and rapid release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr. The osteophilic properties of <sup>89</sup>Zr have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raavé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou et al., 2011</xref>) and confirmed in our hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The signal generated by free <sup>89</sup>Zr should, therefore, not be confused with the localization of anti-TfR nanobody to the spinal cord, bone marrow, or skeletal elements more generally. Careful interpretation is required when examining accumulation of tracer in bone marrow when using anti-TfR-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates or any other internalizing <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled tracer. The fact that the observed release was unique to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs, seen only in the presence of the appropriate target, may also be consistent with a mechanism that specifically targets the DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr chelate in compartments to which the TfR localizes. Perhaps release of Fe<sup>+++</sup> from Tf requires not only acidic pH but also the presence of some as yet unidentified co-factor that can act on the <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO chelate as well. Imaging experiments performed on pregnant C57BL/6 mice that carry Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/wt</sup></italic> embryos may shed further light on this question. Notwithstanding the very strong accumulation of label seen in the placenta, which we ascribe to the presence of the human-ectodomain modified TfR at the surface of the embryonic syncytiotrophoblast-I, we did not see any sign of release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr. Either the TfR upon internalization into the syncytiotrophoblast-I is never exposed to the low pH responsible for <sup>89</sup>Zr release in other tissues, but still sufficiently low to allow release of Fe<sup>+++</sup> from transferrin, or the hypothesized co-factor that mediates release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the DFO chelator is absent from the syncytiotrophoblast-I. We favor the former explanation because it would allow delivery of Fe<sup>+++</sup> to embryonic tissues and satisfy their demand for iron. Another possibility is that <sup>89</sup>Zr is indeed released at the level of syncytiotrophoblasts-I, but would remain trapped at the interface between syncytiotrophoblasts-I and -II, as it would then not be able to penetrate the fetal circulation via ferroportins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sangkhae and Nemeth, 2019</xref>). Release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr from DFO after epitope-binding should also be a concern in the development of <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO radio-conjugates destined for clinical use.</p><p>The issue of the ‘free <sup>89</sup>Zr signal pattern,’ defined as an intense signal originating from long bone extremities, vertebrae and coxal bone, induced by <sup>89</sup>Zr release may be traded for an increased signal in the liver by shifting to the use of <sup>64</sup>Cu as a PET isotope, which is attributed to the passive release of <sup>64</sup>Cu from NOTA – a phenomenon that has been well characterized in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dearling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mirick et al., 1999</xref>). The use of <sup>18</sup>F-labeled anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs conjugated through click chemistry avoids the complications of isotope release. However, <sup>18</sup>F comes with its own drawbacks, such as its short half-life, necessitating less convenient and far more expensive synthetic routes for tracer production, and the typical accumulation of label seen in organs of elimination such as the gall bladder and gastrointestinal tract when using TCO-tetrazine click-chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the ubiquitously expressed TfR may be used as a cell marker to track virtually any cell type of choice in vivo, provided they are transferred to a mouse model that expresses a different isoform of TfR. The Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/wt</sup></italic> mouse model has been deposited at the Jackson Laboratories and is, therefore, easily accessible (strain number 038212). Production and sortagging of nanobodies to generate PET tracers is a relatively simple process. These nanobodies and the Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu</sup></italic> model may thus benefit the field of in vivo imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 000664;<break/> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:MGI:2159769">MGI:2159769</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6-<italic>Tfrc<sup>tm1(TFRC)Bdes</sup></italic>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wouters et al., 2022</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 038212;<break/> hAPI KI;<break/> Tfrc<italic><sup>hu/hu </sup></italic>;<break/> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:038212">IMSR_JAX:038212</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain donated to Jackson Labs<break/> by Dr. M.

For radio-labeling, a stock solution of 129.5 MBq (3.5 mCi) of <sup>89</sup>Zr<sup>4+</sup> in a 1 M oxalate solution (purchased from the Madison-Wisconsin University Cyclotron Lab) was adjusted to a pH of 6.8–7.5 with a 75% (vol/vol) of 2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 400% (vol/vol) of 0.5 M HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. 37 MBq (1mCi) of pH-adjusted <sup>89</sup>Zr was then mixed with 100 µg of V<sub>H</sub>H-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>-DFO for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by removal of unbound <sup>89</sup>Zr using a PD-10 gravity desalting column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with Chelex-treated PBS. The column was eluted in fractions of 600 µL, the activity of which was measured using a dose calibrator (AtomLab 500, Biodex). The fraction corresponding to the peak activity (typically fraction 6 with an activity of typically 37 kBq/µL (1 µCi/µL)) was used for injection. The free <sup>89</sup>Zr remaining in the desalting column was typically &lt;10% of input: 37 kBq (100 µCi) suggesting a radioelement chelation efficiency of ~90%. For conjugation of <sup>64</sup>Cu, GGG-NOTA-Azide was conjugated to the V<sub>H</sub>H through sortase A transpeptidation (NOTA: 2,2′,2”-(1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid). The resulting conjugate was then further conjugated to PEG<sub>20kDa</sub> by click chemistry as described above. For radio-labeling, a stock solution of 1.48 GBq (40 mCi) of <sup>64</sup>CuCl<sub>2</sub> (purchased from the Madison Wisconsin University Cyclotron Lab) was mixed with 150 µg of V<sub>H</sub>H conjugate in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature on a shaker. Unbound <sup>64</sup>Cu was removed from the mixture by passage onto a PD-10 gravity-fed desalting column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The elution of the column, peak activity measurements, and injection doses were the same as with <sup>89</sup>Zr, as described above. <sup>18</sup>F-based V<sub>H</sub>H conjugates were ready for injection post click-chemistry of the tetrazine-conjugated V<sub>H</sub>Hs with <sup>18</sup>F-TCO at the Molecular Cancer Imaging Facility at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, M.A. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Synthesis of <sup>18</sup>F-TCO is described below. In short, V<sub>H</sub>H123-tetrazine (25 μL, 230 μM) was diluted with 668 μL of 1 x PBS. To this solution, 754.8 MBq (20.4 mCi) of <sup>18</sup>F-TCO were added in 37 μL of EtOH. The reaction mixture was placed on a Thermomixer at 300 rpm at 25 °C. V<sub>H</sub>H188-tetrazine (21 μL, 275 μM) was diluted with 843 μL of 1 x PBS and reacted with 943.5 MBq (25.5 mCi) of <sup>18</sup>F-TCO in 45 μL of EtOH. Progress of click reactions was monitored by spotting iTLC-SG strip (Agilent, SGI0001) with 0.5 μL of reaction mixture at 5 and 10 min until about 20% of clicked product was detected in the mixture (10 min). For purification, 200 μL of TCO-agarose slurry (50% slurry in 20% EtOH, Click Chemistry Tools, 1198–5) was added to the top of a pre-equilibrated PD-10 column. The column was then washed with 30 mL of sterile 1 x PBS. Each <sup>18</sup>F-TCO-tetrazine-V<sub>H</sub>H click reaction mixture was loaded onto a column. When the solution reached bed level, 1.6 mL of 1 x PBS was added, and the <sup>18</sup>F-radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H was then eluted with 2x1 mL fractions of PBS. For <sup>18</sup>F-V<sub>H</sub>H123, the first 1 mL fraction contained 13.98 MBq (378 μCi) of product and the second 1 mL fraction measured 82.88 MBq (2.24 mCi). The first fraction was discarded, and after checking pH and radiochemical purity of the second fraction (iTLC-SG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), the final formulation contained 78.07 MBq (2.11 mCi) of <sup>18</sup>F-V<sub>H</sub>H123 in 0.95 mL of 1 x PBS. For <sup>18</sup>F-V<sub>H</sub>H188, the first 1 mL fraction contained 30.97 MBq (837 μCi) of product and the second 1 mL fraction measured 138.38 MBq (3.74 mCi). The first fraction was discarded, and after checking pH and radiochemical purity of the second fraction (iTLC-SG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), the final formulation contained 128.02 MBq (3.46 mCi) of <sup>18</sup>F-V<sub>H</sub>H188 in 0.91 mL in 1 x PBS. Each were used immediately after synthesis for radio-imaging. All final preparations of conjugates were confirmed to be ~pH 7.4 by testing with pH paper.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>PET/CT imaging</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized using 2.0% isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub> at a flow rate of ∼1 liter per minute. For all radiotracers, 1.85–3.7 MBq (50–100 µCi) of radiotracer was injected retro-orbitally (typically in a 50–100 µL volume, depending on final activity/mL of radiotracer). PET/CT images were acquired using a G8 PET/CT machine (Sofie biotech – Perkin Elmer) with a 10 min PET signal detection window at several timepoints post-injection: 1–2 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, then every 24 hr until 96 hr post-injection or until the radioisotope had decayed. Each PET acquisition was followed by a 1.5 min CT scan. Raw acquired images were processed by the manufacturer’s automatic image reconstruction software to generate DICOM files. Images were then visualized, rendered, and analyzed using VivoQuant 3.5 software, patch 2 (Invicro). For ID%/cc, images were produced using ID%/g scales that were converted to ID%/cc by postulating that 1 mL of tissue = 1 g. Mice were kept anesthetized by continuous inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane during the acquisition of PET/CT images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ex vivo measurement of activity</title><p>Mice injected with <sup>89</sup>Zr-radiolabeled conjugates were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. No capillary depletion was performed. Organs were harvested post-mortem and collected in pre-weighed 5 mL assay tubes. Each organ was weighed prior to gamma-counting using a Packard E5003 instrument. ID%/g (injected dose percentage per gram of tissue) for each sample was calculated using the following formula: (activity of sample (MBq)/total injected activity (MBq))/sample weight (g)×100. For whole blood, sample weight was calculated by considering that 1 mL of whole blood = 1.06 g. Bone marrow was harvested by extensive flushing of harvested femurs with 4 mL total volume of PBS per femur. For comparing the activity of bone marrow vs emptied bone, weight of both sample types was considered as equal to 1, in order to generate a ID%/bone scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal anti-TfR IgG (mouse and human cross-reactive), clone H68.4, Abcam catalog #ab269513.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK 293 (originally from ATCC, ref#CRL-1573) and B16.F10 (originally from ATCC, ref#CRL-6475) cells were provided by the laboratory of Dr. Stephanie Dougan – Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.

authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the manuscript could be clearer and more beneficial to the readers with the following suggested revisions:</p><p>(1) The abstract should include information on the comparative performance of 89Zr 64Cu and 18F labeled nanobodies, especially noting the challenges with DFO-89Zr and NOTA-64Cu.</p><p>(2) The abstract should explicitly note the types of transplants assessed and the specific PET findings.</p><p>(3) The abstract should note the negative results in terms of brain PET findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for these three suggestions. We have now included this information in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Based on the data shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, it seems that the nanobodies bind to quite a few proteins other than TfR. This should be discussed frankly as a limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>The presence of multiple other bands and proteins identified by LC/MS in Figure 1 is typical for immunoprecipitation experiments, as performed under the conditions used: all proteins other than TfR that are identified in Table 1 are abundant cytoplasmic (cytoskeletal) and/or nuclear proteins. More rigorous washing would perhaps have removed some of these contaminants at the risk of losing some of the specific signal as well. We have added a comment to this effect. In an in vivo setting, this would be of minor concern, as these proteins would be inaccessible to our nanobodies. In fact, when VHH123 radioconjugates are injected in huTfr+/+ mice (or VHH188 in C57BL/6), we observe no specific signal – which supports this conclusion.</p><p>We therefore state: “We show that both V<sub>H</sub>Hs bind only to the appropriate TfR, with no obvious cross-reactivity to other surface-expressed proteins by immunoblot, LC/MSMS analysis of immunoprecipitates, SDS-PAGE of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled proteins and flow cytometry (Fig 1;Table 1).”. We have added some clarification to make this clearer, and we also include the full LC/MSMS data tables are also added in supplemental materials, as supplementary Table 1. We have included subcellular localization information for each protein identified through LC/MSMS in Table 1 as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Why did the authors use DFO, which is well known to leak Zr, rather than the current standard for 89Zr PET, DFO* (DFO-star)?</p></disp-quote><p>We used DFO rather than DFO-star for several reasons: (1) because we had already conducted and published numerous other studies using DFO-conjugated nanobodies and not observed any release of <sup>89</sup>Zr, (2) commercially sourced clickchemistry enabled DFO-star (such as DFO*-DBCO) was not available at the time of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 2B appears to show complex structures, more complex than just GGG-DFOazide, and GGG-NOTA-azide. This should be explained in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two supplemental figures and methods that recapitulate how we generated what we have termed as GGG-DFO-Azide and GGG-NOTA-Azide. We have updated the legend of Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Why is there a double band in Suppl. Fig 9 for VHH123-NOTA-Azide?</p></disp-quote><p>Under optimal conditions, sortase A-mediated transpeptidation is efficient, resulting in the formation of a peptide bond between the C-terminally LPETG-tagged protein and the GGG-probe. However, extended reaction times or suboptimal concentrations of modified GGG-probes (which are often in limited supply) in the reaction mixture, allow hydrolysis of the sortase A-LPET-protein intermediate. The hydrolysis product can no longer participate in a sortase A reaction. This is what explains the doublet in the reaction used to generate VHH123-NOTA-N<sub>3</sub> – the upper band is VHH123-NOTA-N<sub>3</sub> and the lower band is the hydrolysis product. VHH123-LPET, is unable to react with PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>-DBCO (the lower band that appears at the same position of migration in the next lane on the gel). We noticed that an adjacent lane was mislabelled as ‘VHH188-NOTA-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>’ when in fact it was ‘VHH123-NOTA-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>’. This has been corrected.</p><p>The hydrolysis product, VHH123-LPET, has a short circulatory half-life and obviously lacks the PEG moiety as well as the chelator. It therefore cannot chelate <sup>64</sup>Cu. Its presence should not interfere with PET imaging. Since all animals were injected with the same measured dose of <sup>64</sup>Cu labeled-conjugate, the presence of an unlabeled TfRbinding competitor in the form of VHH123-LPET - at a &lt;&lt; 1:1 molar ratio to the labelled nanobody – would be of no consequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) More details should be provided about the tetrazine-TCO click chemistry for 18F labeling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added supplementary methods and figures that detail how <sup>18</sup>F-TCO was generated. For the principle of TCO-tetrazine click-chemistry, a brief description was added in the text, as well as a reference to a review on the subject.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) For the data shown in Figure 3H, the authors should state whether the brain tissues were capillary depleted, and if so, how this was performed and how complete the procedure was.</p></disp-quote><p>No capillary depletion of the brain tissues was performed, as this was challenging to perform in compliance with the radiosafety protocols in place at our institution. We have updated the legend of figure 3H and methods to include this important detail. Whole blood gamma-counting did not show any obvious di erence of activity across the 4 groups in figure 3G (same mice as in figure 3H), which would go against the interpretation that activity di erences in the brain (figure 3H) are solely attributable to residual activity from blood in the capillaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The authors should experimentally test the hypotheses that the PEG adduct reduced BBB transcytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 is correct to point out that we have not tested un-PEGylated conjugates of <sup>64</sup>Cu and <sup>89</sup>Zr with the anti-TfR nanobodies and we currently do not have the means to perform additional experiments. However, the <sup>18</sup>F conjugates were not PEGylated, and these also fail to show any detectable signal in the CNS by PET/CT (see figure 4A). PEGylation alone cannot be the sole factor that limits transcytosis across the BBB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) It was interesting to note that the Cu appears to dissociate from the NOTA chelator. The authors should provide more information about the kinetics of this process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested the kinetics of dissociation between <sup>64</sup>Cu and the NOTA conjugates in vitro, like we have done for <sup>89</sup>Zr and DFO (supplemental figure 2), because previous work (see references 35 and 36 by Dearling JL and Mirick GR and colleagues) has shown that NOTA and other copper chelators tend to release free copper radioisotopes in the liver, a commonly reported artifact. We have also included a new set of images that show the biodistribution of VHH123-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu in huTfR+/+ mice, where we still observe a substantial signal in the liver, indicating release of <sup>64</sup>Cu from NOTA, in the absence of the anti-TfR VHH binding to its target. This was clearly not seen using the DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates. Binding of the VHH to TfR, followed by internalization, appears to be required for the release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from DFO, prompting us to investigate this phenomenon further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The authors should increase the sample size, and test two different radiolabels for the transplant imaging results (Figs. 5 and 6), since these seem to be the ones they feel are the most important, based on the title and abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that more repeats would increase the significance of our findings, but we unfortunately do not have the means of performing additional experiments at this time (the lab at Boston Children’s Hospital has closed as Dr. Ploegh has retired). We believe that the results are compelling and will be of use to the in vivo imaging community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Fig. 6G appears to show a false positive result for the kidney imaging. Is this real, or an artifact of small sample size?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that the kidney signals in figure 6 are somewhat puzzling. The difference between the tumor-bearing mice that received VHH123 and VHHEnh conjugates is not significant – with the obvious caveat that the VHHEnh group is comprised of only 2 mice, so sample size may well be a factor here. If we compare the signals of the VHH123 conjugate in tumor-bearing mice vs. tumor-free mice, the VHH123 conjugates would have cleared much faster in the tumor-free mice over 24 hours (since no epitope is present for VHH123 to bind to), thus weakening the kidney signal observed after 24 hours. The same would be true for all the other tissues – except for the liver (where free <sup>64</sup>Cu that leaks from NOTA accumulates). VHHEnh conjugates in tumor-bearing mice show a significant kidney signal – although no VHH123 target epitope is present in these mice. B16.F10 tumors at 4 weeks of growth tend to be necrotic and can passively retain any radiotracer – this generates the weak lung signal visible in Fig 6D – thus the radiotracer would clear at a slower rate than VHH123 conjugates in tumor-free mice giving a higher kidney signal at 24 hours.</p><p>No tumors were found in the kidneys post-necropsy. We attribute the differences in kidney signals to di erent kinetics of clearance of the radioconjugates. We have added this explanation to the results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Are the results shown in Fig. 7 generalizable? The authors should the constructs with 18F labeling and without the PEG adduct.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that it would be very interesting to confirm these observations using 18F radioconjugates. The results should be generalizable, as the difference between signals can only be attributed to the presence of the recognized epitope in the placenta– which is in fact the only variable that differs between the two groups. At the time of conducting the study, we had not planned to perform the same experiments with 18F radioconjugates – partly because synthesis of 18F radioconjugates is more challenging (and costly) than the production of 89Zr-labeled nanobodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) The authors should discuss the relative safety of 89Zr and 64Cu. It is likely to be quite a bit worse than for 18F, since the 89Zr and 64Cu have longer half-lives, dissociate from their chelators, and lodge in off-target tissues. An alternative interpretation of the authors' data could be that 89Zr and 64Cu labeling in this context are unsuitable for the stated purposes of PET imaging. In this case, the key experiments shown in Figs. 5-7 should be repeated with the 18F labeled nanobody constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our vision was to o er a tool to the scientific community interested in in vivo tracking of cells in di erent preclinical disease models. The question of safety regarding 89Zr and 64Cu for clinical use was therefore not a factor we then considered. However, we have now included a section in the discussion about the potential safety issue of <sup>89</sup>Zr release and bone accumulation in clinical settings, especially for radioconjugates that target an internalizing surface protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) The authors should remark on the somewhat surprisingly modest amount of BBB transcytosis in the discussion. What were the a inities of the nanobodies?</p></disp-quote><p>The a inities and binding kinetics of both nanobodies was described in a separate work that is referenced in the introduction (references 21 and 22 by Wouters Y and colleagues). Through other methods that rely on a highly sensitive bio-assay, it was shown that both VHH123 and VHH188 are capable of transcytosis: both nanobodies coupled to a neurotensin peptide induced a drop of temperature after i.v. injection in matching mouse strains (VHH123 in C57BL/6 and VHH188 in huTfr +/+). The lack of any compelling CNS signal by PET/CT is discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) More details of the methods should be provided in the supplement.</p><p>a. What was the source of the penta-mutant Sortase A-His6?</p></disp-quote><p>Sortase A pentamutant is produced in-house, by cytoplasmic expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21 strain), using a plasmid vector encoding a truncated and mutated version of Sortase A. References were added, as well as the Addgene repository number (51140).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. What was the yield of the sortase reactions?</p></disp-quote><p>For small proteins, such as nanobodies/ V<sub>H</sub>Hs, we find that the yield of a sortase A reaction typically is &gt; 75%. This is what we observed for all our conjugations. The methods section was updated to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. What was the source of the GGG-Azide-DFO and GGG-Azide NOTA? Based on the structures shown in Fig. 2, these appear to be more complex that was noted in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now detailed the synthesis of GGG-DFO-Azide and GGG-NOTA-Azide in the supplementary methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. More details about the source and purity of the tetrazine and TCO labeling reagents should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included information on the synthesis of GGG-tetrazine in the supplementary methods. Concerning the synthesis of <sup>18</sup>F-TCO, we have also included a detailed description of the compound in supplementary methods. The reaction between GGG-tetrazine and <sup>18</sup>F-TCO is now further detailed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. The TCO-agarose slurry purification should be explained in more detail, and the results should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a detailed procedure of how the TCO-agarose slurry purification was performed in the methods sections. We had already included the Radio-Thin Layer Chromatography QC data of the final VHH123-18F and VHH188-18F purifications in the supplementary figures – which are obtained immediately after TCOagarose slurry purification. The detailed yields of the TCO-agarose slurry purification in terms of activity of each collected fraction is now detailed in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. The CT parameters should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more information about the PET/CT imaging procedure in the methods section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Authors should discuss the possibility of the TfR as a rejection antigen. Murine TfR is foreign for hTfR+/+ mice and vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not discussed this possibility, as we believe the risk of rejection of huTfR+ cells in moTfR+ mice (or vice versa) is negligible. The cells and mice are of the same genetic background – save for the coding region of ectodomain of the TfR (spanning amino acids ~194 to 390 of the full length TfR, which is 763 AA). The pairwise identity of both human and mouse TfR ectodomains is of 73% after alignment of both AA sequences using Clustal Omega. We agree that we cannot formally exclude the possibility of an immune rejection, and have now mentioned this possibility in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any clinical use of the anti-human TfR receptor PET tracer?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not currently envision an application for the anti-human TfR VHH in PET/CT in a clinical setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the in vivo anti-mouse TfR uptake level in C57BL/6 mice consistently higher than the anti-human TfR receptor PET tracer in hTfR+/+ mice? Is this due to differences in characteristics of the VHH's (e.g. a inity, internalization properties), or rather due to a different biological behavior of the hTfR-transgene (e.g. reduced internalization properties)?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed observed that VHH123 uptake and binding appears to be more robust than that of VHH188 to their respective targets. Moreover, after later times post-injection (&gt; 48h), VHH188 appears to display a very low reactivity to C57BL/6 (moTfR+) cells (see Figure 3B). We attribute this to the respective affinities and specificities of both VHHs. We have not investigated the VHH binding kinetics of the mouse versus humanectodomain TfR proteins in vitro. Internalization should be mildly different at best, as <sup>89</sup>Zr release from DFO occurs with both VHHs in both C57BL/6 and huTfR +/+ mouse models (when injected in a matched configuration). The huTfR +/+ mice rely exclusively on the huTfr for their iron supply. They are healthy with no obvious pathological features. The behavior of the huTfr is therefore presumably similar, if not identical to that of the mouse Tfr, bearing in mind that the huTfr and the mouse Tfr are both reliant on mouse Tf as their ligand</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The anti-TfR VHHs were initially developed as a carrier for BBB-transport of VHH-based drug conjugates (previous publications). The data shown here reduces enthusiasm towards this application. Uptake in the brain is several log-factors lower than physiological uptake elsewhere. Potential consequences of off-brain uptake on potential toxicity of VHH-based drug-conjugates could be better emphasized in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe a significant presence of the anti-TfR VHHs in the CNS by PET/CT. We have addressed several possibilities: longer circulation times post-injection may favor transcytosis of the VHHs through the BBB. However, because transcytosis requires endocytosis –<sup>89</sup>Zr may be released by their chelating moiety at this step. The only radiotracers with a covalent bond between the radio-isotope and the VHHs in our work are the <sup>18</sup>F VHHs, but the signal acquisition window may have been too short to observe transcytosis and accumulation in the CNS. Another possible caveat is that PEGylation of the radiotracers may be an obstacle to transcytosis. The circulatory halflife of unpegylated VHHs is too low to allow adequate visualization after 24 hours postinjection, as the conjugates rapidly clear from the circulation (t ½ = 30 minutes or less). We have updated the discussion to address these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In several locations (I have counted 5) a space is missing between words, please double-check.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully checked the manuscript to remove any remaining typos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me why for the melanoma-tracking experiment the tracer is switched from the 89Zr-labeled variant to the 64Cu-labeled variant.</p></disp-quote><p>The decision to switch to the <sup>64</sup>Cu labeled VHHs for the melanoma experiment stemmed from a wish to (1) evaluate the performance of the <sup>64</sup>Cu-radioconjugates in detecting transplanted cells as we had done with the <sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates and (2) assess how the (non-specific) liver signal seen with <sup>64</sup>Cu contrasts with a specific signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>typo in discussion: C57BL/6 instead of C57B/6</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me why in FIG1B cells are labeled with 35S. Is it correct that the signals seen are due to staining membranes with anti-TfR mAbs? Or is this an autoradiography of the gel?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1B cells were labeled with 35S-Met/Cys, while the images shown are indeed those of Western Blots, using an anti-TfR monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody to detect human and mouse TfR retrieved by the anti Tfr VHHs. Autoradiography using the same lysates showed the presence of contaminants in the VHH eluates, as commonly seen in immunoprecipitates from metabolically labeled cells (as distinct from IP/Westerns). For this reason, we performed a Western Blot on the same samples to confirm TfR pull-down. As written in the results section, we also performed LCMS analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins to better characterize contaminating proteins (Table 1). To clarify this, we have now added the autoradiographs in supplementary data (supplementary figure 15) and added a reference to these observation in the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ROI quantifications in all figures: these should be expressed as %ID/cc instead of %ID/g.

For ex vivo tissue counts, %ID/g has been calculated based on injected dose (except for figure 3G, where the comparisons in %ID/G are not possible due to the uncertain nature of bone marrow and whole blood). All figures have now been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig4: it would be good to also see respective mouse controls (C57BL6 vs hTfR+/+) for the 64Cu- and 18F-labeled VHH123 tracers. Each radiolabeling methodology changes in vivo biodistribution and specificity, which can be better assessed by using appropriate controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We had performed these controls but they were not included in the manuscript as deemed redundant with the results of Figure 3. We have now separated Figure 4 in two panels (Figure 4A and 4B) with figure 4A showing the 1h timepoint post-injection of VHH123 radiotracers in C57BL/6 vs huTfr<sup>+/+</sup> and Figure 4B showing the 24h timepoint in the same configuration. ROI analyses were also done on the huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> controls and were included in Figure 4C as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig7: is it correct that mouse imaging is performed at 24h p.i. and dissected embryo's at 72h p.i.? Why are there 2 days between each procedure of the same animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We acquired images at di erent timepoints, specifically at 1h, 24h, 48h and 72 hours after radio-tracer injection. As 72 h was the last timepoint, the mice were sacrificed the same day and embryo dissection performed thereafter, at 72 hours post radiotracer injection. We decided to show the 24h timepoint images as they were the most representative of the series, o ering the best signal-to-noise ratio. The signal pattern did not change over the course from 24h to 72h. We have now added those timepoints in the supplementary data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
