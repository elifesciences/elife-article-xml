Despite the presence of parasites in the peripheral blood, no symptoms develop. Disease severity is correlated with the levels of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) adhering within blood vessels. Changes in iRBC adhesion capacity have been linked to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections, however how this is occurring is still unknown. Here, we present evidence that RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) transcription in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is downregulated in field isolates obtained from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. Through experiments with in vitro cultured parasites, we have uncovered an RNA Pol III-dependent mechanism that controls pathogen proliferation and expression of a major virulence factor in response to external stimuli. Our findings establish a connection between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cytoadhesion and a non-coding RNA family transcribed by Pol III. Additionally, we have identified <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Maf1 as a pivotal regulator of Pol III transcription, both for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for responding adaptively to external signals. These results introduce a novel perspective that contributes to our understanding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence. Furthermore, they establish a connection between this regulatory process and the occurrence of seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>ncRNA</kwd><kwd><italic>var</italic> genes</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherf</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-CE15-0009-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherf</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG PlasmoSilencing 670301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherf</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA polymerase III plays a crucial role in controlling virulence in response to environmental changes and provides a new molecular perspective into the development of asymptomatic malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria that annually affects over 200 million people, with 619,000 fatal cases, majorly African children under the age of 5. The disease is transmitted to its human host during a blood meal by the parasites’ vector, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Disease symptoms are seen while the parasite multiplies asexually within the host RBCs. During this time, variant surface antigens (VSAs) are exported and displayed on the surface of the infected red blood cells (iRBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wahlgren et al., 2017</xref>). During the ~48 hr asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, the parasite develops through different morphological stages: ring (circulating), trophozoite, and schizont (sequestered in capillaries). Expression of one type of VSA that is linked to immune evasion and pathogenesis, termed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leech et al., 1984</xref>), can bind to a wide range of receptors on endothelial cells such as CD36. PfEMP1 binding mediates adhesion to the vascular endothelium within the host, thereby preventing mature iRBCs from traveling to, and being cleared by, the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites replicate via schizogony inside the host RBCs generating the infectious form, termed merozoites. Upon bursting of the iRBC, merozoites invade new RBCs, thus enabling the cycle to restart. The number of merozoites per schizont has been shown to reduce in unfavorable conditions as a way to diminish the total parasite load and therefore overall disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mancio-Silva et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> chronic infection relies largely on mutually exclusive expression of PfEMP1 surface adhesins, that are encoded by the <italic>var</italic> virulence gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scherf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>). The expression of <italic>var</italic> genes, while under tight epigenetic regulation by the parasite, is additionally controlled by a family of ncRNA, termed RUF6. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 encodes 15 RUF6 genes dispersed over several chromosomes located adjacent to central <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>). RUF6 ncRNA have been observed to associate with the active <italic>var</italic> gene in trans and transcriptional repression disrupts the monoallelic expression of <italic>var</italic> genes by downregulating the entire <italic>var</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcons-Simon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guizetti et al., 2016</xref>). Genetically modified parasites that express the entire RUF6 gene family show a general upregulation of <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence is linked to cytoadhesion and sequestration as a result of reduced clearance of iRBCs in the spleen and increased microcapillary obstruction and local inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Substantial sequestration of iRBCs in critical target organs has been associated with severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guillochon et al., 2022</xref>). In long-term asymptomatic infections, found during prolonged low transmission dry seasons in malaria-endemic regions, decreased cytoadhesion and longer circulation time of iRBCs in the blood has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>). It is not fully understood how asymptomatic infections develop and are maintained nor is a molecular understanding of host and parasite factors, that underlies disease severity during the dry and wet seasons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Deitsch, 2022</xref>). Disease severity appears to be influenced by a variety of factors derived from the human host, parasite, and environment. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are auxotrophic for various nutrients including glucose, certain types of amino acids, and lipids, which must be obtained from the host. Physiological conditions in the host, like diabetes, pregnancy, diet, and immunity, can change the metabolic environment the parasites are exposed to. Numerous studies conclude that host immunity is a contributing factor to the maintenance of asymptomatic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimenyi et al., 2019</xref>). While it is proposed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence regulation contributes to decreased endothelial binding, the mechanism and factors involved remains to be determined.</p><p>Almost all eukaryotes use conserved nutrient sensing pathways, including mTOR, GCN2, GCN5, Rgt2/Snf3, and Snf1/AMPK signaling cascades (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). Most notably, the target of rapamycin complex (TORC) pathway involves the signaling of external factors to control many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, TORC participates in the regulation of RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) activity via the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Maf1. When nutrients are available and mTOR kinase is active, Maf1 is hyperphosphorylated resulting in an inactive cytoplasmic state. Stress-induced Maf1 dephosphorylation results in nuclear localization and inhibition of RNA Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pluta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rollins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vannini et al., 2010</xref>). This pathway responds to a range of positive and negative external stimuli, most notably the presence of amino acids, that drive or inhibit cellular growth. The majority of the TORC pathway components are lost in the apicomplexan lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLean and Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serfontein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dam et al., 2011</xref>). While <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes none of the core TORC1 components, it does contain a homologue to Maf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLean and Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>). The biology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Pf-Maf1 is still poorly characterized.</p><p>Here, we present data showing inhibition of RNA Pol III transcription in field isolates from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. We present evidence for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Maf1 as a negative regulator of RNA Pol III-transcribed genes including tRNA and RUF6 ncRNA, and demonstrate that this mechanism is responsive to external stimuli using in vitro culture. Inhibition of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cytoadherence, via the regulation of RNA Pol III activity, represents a new paradigm contributing to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence and links this process to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RUF6 ncRNA is downregulated in asymptomatic individuals during the dry season</title><p>We and others have previously established the role of the 15-member RUF6 ncRNA gene family in <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcons-Simon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diffendall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guizetti et al., 2016</xref>). RUF6 ncRNA protein complex associates with the active <italic>var</italic> gene expression site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diffendall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guizetti et al., 2016</xref>), and knockdown (KD) of the ncRNA RUF6 gene family dramatically reduced <italic>var</italic> gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcons-Simon et al., 2020</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis identified highly conserved RNA Pol III binding elements (conserved A- and B-box sequence) within RUF6 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guizetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), hinting at a role for RNA Pol III in virulence gene regulation. Thus, we determined the effects of RNA Pol III inhibition on gene transcription in synchronized wildtype parasites. We observed downregulation of tRNA and RUF6 transcription after 21 hr of treatment with a commercially available RNA Pol III inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, no changes were observed in the transcription of an RNA Pol II-regulated gene, <italic>uce</italic> (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, PF3D7_0812600; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As predicted from the RUF6 sequence, our data provide direct experimental evidence for RNA Pol III-dependent transcription of RUF6 genes.</p><p>We next wanted to determine if RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, specifically RUF6 ncRNA, varied between parasites causing different clinical states of malaria infection, since previous studies did not include RNA Pol III-transcribed genes for their data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>). We first re-analyzed raw RNA-seq data, from a previous study that compared parasites infecting individuals during the dry versus wet season in a malaria-endemic region of Mali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2020</xref>), to include these genes. We were able to retrieve transcriptional data for two RNA Pol III-transcribed tRNAs (tRNA Leucine Pf3D7_API05400 and tRNA Asparagine Pf3D7_API05500, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), both of which show significantly lower levels in parasites infecting asymptomatic individuals during the dry season (n=12) when compared to parasites infecting symptomatic individuals during the wet season (n=12).</p><p>We further investigated whether RNA Pol III modulates gene transcription in field isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> from different individuals infected during the wet and dry season in malaria-endemic regions (The Gambia). In this pilot study, we analyzed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> steady-state levels of RNA in venous blood samples taken from individuals with asymptomatic parasitemia during the dry season (n=17), as well as mildly symptomatic malaria infections during the wet season (n=14) in The Gambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of total RNA showed that levels of tRNAs (Asparagine and Valine) were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in parasites from asymptomatic infections during the dry season compared to parasites causing symptomatic infections during the wet season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Likewise, RUF6 ncRNA was significantly downregulated (p&lt;0.005) in parasites from asymptomatic infections during the dry season when compared to symptomatic infections during the wet season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

These results demonstrate that PfMaf1 mediates the observed decrease in RNA Pol III-transcribed genes with MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation.</p><p>Previous attempts to develop a KO line did not yield success, as highlighted by McLean and Jacobs-Lorena in 2017. However, our strain with an inducible system for degrading PfMaf1 protein has unveiled a twofold function of PfMaf1: (i) to help maintain Pol III transcription at levels essential for optimal parasite proliferation, and (ii) to serve as a key element in an environmental sensing pathway that directly controls Pol III activity.</p><p>Finally, we set out to link <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence gene expression with decreased RUF6 transcription, by investigating the effect of MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation on cytoadherence of 3D7 iRBCs. We found that in static binding assays to the endothelial receptor CD36, bound to plastic dishes, adhesion of iRBCs was reduced by 50% with MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was also confirmed at the protein level using antibodies directed against the conserved intracellular ATS domain of PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).

This discovery illuminates a previously unidentified adaptive molecular process in the parasite’s cytoadhesion and proliferation. We propose a connection with asymptomatic infections prevalent during the dry season in African regions, a period characterized by reduced mosquito transmission. In our analysis, we compared RNA from parasites in symptomatic individuals during the wet season to those in asymptomatic individuals in the dry season. In this comparison, we noted a reduction in the levels of tRNAs and RUF6 ncRNA, with the latter being recognized for its involvement in regulating <italic>var</italic> gene expression, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>. To date, RNA Pol III has not been acknowledged as a factor influencing the virulence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in mild or asymptomatic malaria infections. Additionally, our research revealed a link between elevated serum MgCl<sub>2</sub> levels and asymptomatic malaria infections, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The normal concentration range for MgCl<sub>2</sub> in human serum is between [0.7 and 1.0 mM], while mild hypermagnesemia is characterized by levels ranging from [2.2 to 3.5 mM]. In our pilot study, the average concentration was observed to be around [0.7 mM] during the wet season and increased to [1.1 mM] in the dry season.</p><p>To investigate the potential mechanistic link between the changes in MgCl<sub>2</sub> levels and Pol III activity, we established an in vitro culture assay for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that enabled us to delve into the molecular mechanism underpinning the environment-dependent inhibition of Pol III. We experimented with various concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to assess its effect on Pol III activity. The standard culture medium we used contains [0.5 mM] of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Our observations indicated a progressive inhibition of Pol III activity in the range of [1–3 mM]. To further explore the molecular mechanisms involved, we opted to use a concentration of 3 mmol/L in our continued studies. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed inhibition of Pol III transcription of tRNA and the RUF6 ncRNA gene family. Subsequent RNA-seq data validated that transcriptional inhibition, induced by MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation, is primarily limited to canonical RNA Pol III-transcribed genes, which include A- and B-box containing sequences, and notably the RUF6 gene, crucial for the activation of <italic>var</italic> genes. Our findings established that the inhibition of <italic>var</italic> gene expression, mediated by Pol III, led to a decrease in the cytoadherence of iRBCs when supplemented with MgCl<sub>2</sub>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. We noted a reduction of over 50% in binding to the endothelial receptor CD36 in a static binding assay. It is expected that the inhibition of iRBC cytoadherence would be even more pronounced under the physiological shear stress typically found in human capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crabb et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Having established the role of Pol III in the expression of virulence genes, we subsequently showed a link between environmental factors and Maf1, which is the only known eukaryotic repressor of Pol III. We created an inducible system designed to specifically reduce PfMaf1 protein levels, enabling us to explore its influence on Pol III activity. Proteomic analysis through mass spectrometry of PfMaf1’s interactome showed its association with various nuclear RNA Pol III subunits, reinforcing its function as a repressor of Pol III in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. PfMaf1 showed nuclear presence under standard growth conditions. Nuclear shuttling usually increases under specific conditions (stress, nutrient starvation) by changing the phosphorylation state of the Maf1 protein in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michels et al., 2010</xref>). Our study supports a model in which a critical baseline amount of PfMaf1 in the nucleus is essential to modulate the expression of tRNAs by RNA Pol III during the multinucleated blood stage of the parasite. This regulation is essential for the parasite to balance its energy resources efficiently while producing large numbers of new infective forms, known as merozoites. Under optimal growth conditions, a single parasite undergoes several rounds of genome replication, forming approximately 30 nuclei within a shared cytoplasm. When PfMaf1 is completely removed, the transcription levels of tRNA Valine and RUF6 ncRNA increase more than threefold, while the transcription level of a Pol II-mediated housekeeping gene UCE remains unchanged. This significant elevation of tRNA transcription beyond physiological levels could potentially lead to an energy deficit within the cell, resulting in the observed reduction in the parasite’s multiplication rate, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>. In clinical isolates, parasite densities have been associated with malaria pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nyarko and Claessens, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomson-Luque et al., 2021</xref>) and low parasite densities are also a feature of asymptomatic malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murray et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Nutrient availability in the host has been demonstrated to have a profound effect on the replication of parasites using <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> as a rodent malaria model. Reports from cultured blood stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites showed that amino acid deficiency can alter parasite growth and survival to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLean and Jacobs-Lorena, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marreiros et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that nutrients involved in <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine metabolism can also affect <italic>var</italic> gene switching in cultured parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2023</xref>). Individuals infected with malaria, compared to healthy individuals, were found to have decreased levels (up to 54%) of plasma-free amino acids, which could be the result of a nutrient-reduced diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leopold et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, dietary intake, including energy, protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and folate, was found to decrease significantly in individuals during the dry season in areas of Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">M’Kaibi et al., 2015</xref>). Blood serum magnesium levels can fluctuate in humans and were found to decrease with increasing disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Innocent et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, plasma magnesium levels were significantly increased in asymptomatic individuals during the dry season compared to symptomatic individuals during the wet season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Wet season samples were within the range of normal serum magnesium levels, whereas dry season samples were higher. It is noteworthy that intracellular magnesium was found to increase in yeast as a result of calorie restriction, defined as a decrease in dietary glucose intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that our MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplementation could be mimicking low glucose conditions and thus, low nutrient availability. Although interactions between human malaria and malnutrition have been studied for many years, the evidence linking an effect between the two remains inconclusive at the mechanistic level. Our study sets the stage for exploring whether there are additional external stimuli, beyond magnesium chloride, that could activate the regulatory pathway of RNA Pol III. Given the lack of a conventional TOR pathway in malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serfontein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dam et al., 2011</xref>), the exact signaling pathway that activates PfMaf1 remains unknown. Our mass spectrometry analysis of PfMaf1’s cytoplasmic binding partners has identified interactions with enzymes, such as phosphatases and kinases, which could potentially influence Maf1 activity. This discovery opens up new avenues for future research into the environmental sensing mechanisms that function upstream of PfMaf1.</p><p>A traditional view posits that the decreased cytoadherence seen in dry season parasites may be affected by host immunity, which impairs the parasites’ adhesion capabilities. Although experimental evidence supporting this theory is missing, our research introduces a novel perspective to this critical topic by highlighting the role of metabolic changes in modulating virulence gene expression.</p><p>In summary, our research demonstrates that RNA Pol III activity, regulated by environmental factors, plays a crucial role in the proliferation of parasites and in reducing the cytoadhesive capacity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. This discovery unveils a previously unknown molecular process, significantly enhancing our understanding of subclinical parasite persistence. The insights gained from this study could pave the way for novel strategies aimed at preventing severe malaria by promoting reduced pathogen virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite and serum samples from malaria infected patients</title><p>Venous blood draw of different infected individuals in The Gambia during the dry and wet seasons was collected as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogang et al., 2024</xref>.

Separation was performed on a 50 cm nanoviper column (i.d. 75 μm, C18, Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 2 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific) regulated to a temperature of 50°C with a linear gradient from 2% to 25% buffer B (100% MeCN in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over 91 min. MS1 data were collected in the Orbitrap (120,000 resolution; maximum injection time 60 ms; AGC 4×10<sup>5</sup>). Charges states between 2 and 7 were required for MS2 analysis, and a 60 s dynamic exclusion window was used. MS2 scan were performed in the ion trap in rapid mode with HCD fragmentation (isolation window 1.2 Da; NCE 30%; maximum injection time 60 ms; AGC 104).</p><p>For identification, the data were searched against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (UP000005640_9606) and the <italic>P. falciparum 3D7</italic> (UP000001450_36329) UniProt databases using Sequest HT through proteome discoverer (version 2.4). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two miss cleavages sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, Met-loss, Met-loss-Acetyl and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of cysteins were set as fixed modification. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0.6 Da for MS/MS peaks. The resulting files were further processed using myProMS version 3.9.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms">https://github.com/bioinfo-pf-curie/myproms</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poullet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poullet et al., 2007</xref>). FDR calculation used Percolator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">The et al., 2016</xref>) and was set to 1% at the peptide level for the whole study. The label-free quantification was performed by peptide Extracted Ion Chromatograms (XICs), reextracted across all conditions and computed with MassChroQ version 2.2.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valot et al., 2011</xref>). For protein quantification, XICs from proteotypic peptides shared between compared conditions (TopN matching) and missed cleavages were allowed. Median and scale normalization was applied on the total signal to correct the XICs for each biological replicate (n=5 in each condition). To estimate the significance of the change in protein abundance, a linear model (adjusted on peptides and biological replicates) was performed, and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure. Proteins with at least two distinct peptides in three replicates of a same state, a twofold enrichment, and an adjusted p-value≤0.05 were considered significantly enriched in sample comparisons. Proteins unique to a condition were also considered if they matched the peptides criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>IF assay</title><p>pSLI-Maf1-FKBP control, +MgCl<sub>2</sub> parasites were used with rat anti-HA (Roche 3F10) antibodies. 10 µL of iRBCs were washed with PBS and fixed with for 30 min in 0.0075% glutaraldehyde/4% PFA/DPBS.

The mechanisms underlying parasite adaptation during the low transmission season remain poorly understood. The authors previously established that members of the non-coding RNA RUF6 gene family, transcribed by RNA pol III, are required for expression of the main variant surface antigens in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PfEMP1, which drive parasite cytoadherence and pathogenicity. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of RNA pol III transcription in the regulation of PfEMP1 expression in different clinical states, either symptomatic malaria cases during the wet season or asymptomatic infections during the dry season.</p><p>By reanalyzing RNAseq data from a previous study in Mali, complemented with RT-qPCR on new samples collected in The Gambia, the authors first report the down-regulation of RNA pol III genes (tRNAs, RUF6) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates collected from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season, as compared to isolates from symptomatic (wet season) individuals. They also confirm the down-regulation of var (DBLalpha) gene expression in asymptomatic infection as compared to symptomatic malaria. Plasma analysis in the two groups in the Gambian study reveals higher Magnesium levels in dry season as compared to wet season samples, pointing at a possible role of external factors. The authors tested the effect of MgCl2 supplementation on cultured parasites, as well as three other stimuli (temperature, low glucose, Ile deprivation), and show that Ile deprivation and MgCl2 both induce down-regulation of RNA pol III transcription but not pol I or pol II (except the active var gene). Using RNAseq, they show that MgCl2 supplementation predominantly inhibits RNA pol III-transcribed genes, including the entire RUF6 family. Conditional depletion of Maf1 leads to the up-regulation of RNA pol III gene transcription, confirming that Maf1 is a RNA pol III inhibitor in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, as described in other organisms. Quantitative mass spectrometry shows that Maf1 interacts with RNA pol III complex in the nucleus, and with distinct proteins including two phosphatases in the cytoplasm. Using the Maf1 cKD parasites, the authors document that down-regulation of RNA pol III by MgCl2 is dependent on Maf1. Finally, they show that MgCl2 results in decreased cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes, associated with reduced PfEMP1 expression.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-The work is very well performed and presented.</p><p>-The study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism relying on RNA pol III-dependent regulation of variant surface antigens in response to external signals, which could contribute to parasite adaptation during the low transmission season.</p><p>-Potential regulators of Maf1 were identified by mass spectrometry, including phosphatases, paving the way for future mechanistic studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-The signaling pathway upstream of Maf1 remains unknown. In eukaryotes, Maf1 is a negative regulator of RNA pol III and is regulated by external signals via the TORC pathway. Since TORC components are absent in the apicomplexan lineage, one central question that remains open is how Maf1 is regulated in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Magnesium is probably not the sole stimulus involved, as suggested by the observation that Ile deprivation also down-regulates RNA pol III activity.</p><p>-The study does not address why MgCl2 levels vary depending on the clinical state. It is unclear whether plasma magnesium is increased during asymptomatic malaria or decreased during symptomatic infection, as the study does not include control groups with non-infected individuals.

Having previously found that knockdown of the ncRNA ruf6 gene family reduces var gene expression in vitro, they now present experimental evidence for the regulation of ruf6 and subsequently, var gene expression by Pol III using a commercially available inhibitor. They confirm their findings with samples from a previously published Gambian cohort study using asymptomatic dry season and mildly symptomatic wet season samples, showing that higher levels of Pol III-dependent transcripts and var transcripts as well as lower MgCl2 plasma concentrations are present in wet season samples. From this, they hypothesize that the external stimuli heat, reduced glucose and essential amino acid supply, and increased MgCl2 levels are sensed by the parasite through the only known Pol III inhibitor Maf1 and result in lower Pol III activity and fewer ruf6 transcripts, which in turn reduces var gene expression, leading to reduced cytoadherence and virulence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. In their in vitro experiments they focus on investigating higher MgCl2 levels and their impact on Pol III and Maf1 activity as well as var gene expression and parasites adherence to purified CD36, thereby successfully confirming their hypothesis for MgCl2. Nicely, MgCl2-induced down-regulation of Pol III activity was shown to be dependent on Maf1 using a knock-down cell line. Additionally, they show that the Maf1-KD cell line displays a slower growth rate with fewer merozoites per schizonts and Maf1 interacts with RNA pol III subunits and some kinases/phosphatases.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>It is understandable that the RNA samples from the Gambian cohort were limited, but for all in vitro analyses a larger panel of qPCR primers or RNAseq would have been feasible. I also understand the rationale for using the general var primer pair (DBLa) for field isolates, but since the authors were working with a clonal parasite line (3D7) in vitro, qPCR with specific 3D7/NF54 primer pairs or RNAseq, which would also allow inferences about ruf6 regulation of specific (neighboring?) var genes and other Pol III-regulated genes, would have been a far better option.</p><p>As far as I could see from the resubmitted manuscript, the authors did not correct the statistical analyses. For example, they continue to apply a t-test to fold-change values (which must be transformed to log2), many t-test based analyses rely on only 2-3 replicates (a non-parametric test would be more appropriate), they have not corrected for multiple testing, and it is unclear how the authors handle technical and biological replicates in their plots. Therefore, I still suspect that more appropriate statistical analyses might have an impact on the significance of their results.</p><p>I agree that CD36 binding is associated with mild malaria, but since the authors only make a link between Pol III and CD36 binding in vitro, I think it is an overstatement to claim something like &quot;Our study reveals a regulatory mechanism in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> involving RNA Polymerase III, which plays a pivotal role in the parasite's virulence.&quot;</p><p>Finally, if the authors have checked all the relevant literature on MgCl2, it should be easy for them to give a brief explanation why they included only one study and ignored all the other contradictory results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95879.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This work describes a new pathway by which malaria parasites, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, may regulate their growth and virulence (i.e. their expression of virulence-linked cytoadhesins). This is a topic of considerable interest in the field - does this important parasite sense factor(s) in its host bloodstream and regulate itself accordingly? Several fragments of evidence have come out on this topic in the past decade, showing, for example, reduced parasite growth under calorie restriction (in mice); parasite dormancy in response to amino acid starvation (in culture and in mice), and also reduced virulence in dry-season, low-parasitaemia infections in humans. The molecular mechanisms that may underlie this interesting biology remain only poorly understood.</p><p>Here, the authors show that dry-season <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites have reduced expression of Pol3-transcribed tRNAs and ncRNAs that positively regulate virulence gene expression. They link the level of Pol3 activity to PfMaf1, a remnant of the largely-absent nutrient-sensing TOR pathway in this parasite. They propose that in the dry season, human hosts may be calorie-restricted, leading to Maf1 moving to the nucleus and suppressing Pol3, thus downregulated growth and virulence of parasites. The evidence is intriguing and the idea is conceptually elegant.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The use of dry/wet-season field samples from The Gambia is a strength, showing potential real-world relevance. The generation of an inducible knockdown of Maf1 in lab-cultured parasites is also a strength, allowing this pathway to be studied somewhat in isolation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The signals upstream of Maf1 remain rather a black box. 4 are tested - heatshock and low-glucose, which seem to suppress ALL transcription; low-Isoleucine and high magnesium, which suppress Pol3. Therefore the authors use Mg supplementation throughout as a 'starvation type' stimulus. They do not discuss why they didn't use amino acid limitation, which could be more easily rationalised physiologically. It may for experimental simplicity (no need for dropout media) but this should be discussed, and ideally sample experiments with low-IsoLeu should be done too, to see if the responses (e.g. cytoadhesion) are all the same.</p><p>(2) The proteomics, conducted to seek partners of Maf1, is probably the weakest part. From Fig S4 it is clear that the proteins highlighted in the text are highly selected (as ones that might be relevant, e.g. phosphatases), but many others are more enriched. It would be good to see (a) the top hits from the whole list provided as a short table within the main proteomics figure, along with the GO terms that actually came top in enrichment; (b) the whole list provided as a supp. spreadsheet for easy re-analysis, rather than a PDF which cannot be easily re-used.</p><p>(3) Fig 3 shows the Maf1-low line has very poor growth after only 5 days but it is stated that no dead parasites are seen even after 8 cycles and the merozoites number is down only ~18 to 15... is this too small to account for such poor growth (~5-fold reduced in a single cycle, day 3-5)? It would additionally be interesting to see a cell-cycle length assessment and invasion assay, to see of Maf1-low parasite have further defects in growth.</p><p>Other weaknesses, which are more restricted but were not addressed in revision, are highlighted below:</p><p>Fig S1B - The downregulation of RNAPol3 transcripts caused by a commercial Pol3 inhibitor is pretty weak - mostly non-significant. The authors might comment on why they think this is, when interfering with PfMaf1 evidently has a greater effect.</p><p>Fig 2D: the legend states ' Expressed transcripts from three replicates between control and addition of MgCl2 that are significantly up-regulated are highlighted in red while significantly down-regulated RNA Pol III genes are highlighted in blue (FDR corrected p-value of &lt;0.05) and a FC {greater than or equal to}{plus minus} 1.95 with examples listed as text'. This isn't very clear. The authors could clarify whether they took ALL (Pol3 or not) upregulated genes to show in red, but only putative Pol3-regulated genes to show in blue? If so, why? Or did they take all significantly downregulated genes, and found they were all annotated as pol3 transcribed? (I cannot see any dots that are not blue. If there are some, a clearer figure is needed?)</p><p>Line 227: 'PfMaf1 levels were shown to decrease by approximately 57% in total extracts after one cycle' - the provenance of this very precise percentage isn't clear (it does not appear on the figure). Is it densitometry of a western blot? And if so, is it an average of the 3 replicates that are stated in the legend (but not shown), or from the single example blot shown in Figure 3?</p><p>Fig 4A: the western blot, as shown, lacks controls, both for loading and for completeness of cyto/nuclear fractionation. To avoid confusion, these should be shown in the main figure, as is standard in the field, rather than separately in a supp figure. Ideally, 3 repeats should be done, with densitiometry quantification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95879.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Diffendall</surname><given-names>Gretchen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Claes</surname><given-names>Aurelie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barcons-Simon</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nyarko</surname><given-names>Prince</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Montpellier</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montpellier</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dingli</surname><given-names>Florent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Curie</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Miguel M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lisbon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lisbon</named-content></addr-line><country>Portugal</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Loew</surname><given-names>Damarys</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Curie</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Claessens</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Montpellier</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montpellier</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scherf</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Here we address the major points raised by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The signaling pathway upstream of Maf1 remains unknown.

Unfortunately, field studies and human volunteer studies do not always have all the ideal controls that in vitro studies have. We recognize that [3mM] is higher than the normal range for magnesium levels, which is why we included a revised Supplementary Figure 3A.

Data presentation lacks clarity, the number of biological replicates is rather low and the statistical analyses need to be largely revised. Although the in vivo data from wet (mildly symptomatic) and dry (asymptomatic) season parasites with different expression levels of Pol III-regulated genes, var genes, and MgCl2 are interesting, the link between the in vitro data and the in vivo virulence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, which is made in many sections of the manuscript, should be toned down. Especially since (i) the only endothelial receptor studied is CD36, which is associated with parasite binding during mild malaria, and (ii) several studies provide contradictory data on MgCl2 levels during malaria and in different disease states, which is not further discussed, but the authors mainly focused on this external stimulus in their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, ideally, we would have liked to do full RNA-seq on The Gambia samples.

We believe that an appropriate number of replicates was done for the experiments. The wet symptomatic samples from this study were from mildly symptomatic individuals, as stated in the manuscript. Therefore, CD36 was a relevant receptor to use for our studies.</p><p>We agree that the published studies about magnesium levels in infected individuals are not always consistent. What these studies do not consider is the time of year, whether the infection occurred during the dry or wet season. These studies were also done in different regions of the world using different technologies. For this reason, we only highlight the observed difference observed in our field study data from The Gambia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The signals upstream of Maf1 remain rather a black box. 4 are tested - heat shock and low-glucose, which seem to suppress ALL transcription; low-Isoleucine and high magnesium, which suppress Pol3.

It may be for experimental simplicity (no need for dropout media) but this should be discussed, and ideally, sample experiments with low-IsoLeu should be done too, to see if the responses (e.g. cytoadhesion) are all the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that deprivation of isoleucine would have been another experimental assay for our study, but it also would not have been as novel as magnesium. While understanding the exact mechanism or involvement of magnesium as a stress condition was not the scope of this manuscript, we believe that our data will be valuable into demonstrating that external stimuli act on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence gene expression via RNA Pol III inhibition. Since we also had plasma level data for magnesium, and not isoleucine, we believed it made for a better external factor to use for our in vitro studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The proteomics, conducted to seek partners of Maf1, is probably the weakest part. From Figure S3: the proteins highlighted in the text are clearly highly selected (as ones that might be relevant, e.g. phosphatases), but many others are more enriched. It would be good to see the whole list, and which GO terms actually came top in enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the reviewer did not see the attached supplementary Co-IP MS data. The file includes all proteins found in each sample as well as GO term analysis. For the purpose of this work, we highlight proteins potentially involved in the canonical role of Maf1 that have been shown in model organisms to reversibly inhibit RNA Pol III (phosphatases, RNA Pol III subunits).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3 shows the Maf1-low line has very poor growth after only 5 days but it is stated that no dead parasites are seen even after 8 cycles and the merozoites number is down only ~18 to 15... is this too small to account for such poor growth (~5-fold reduced in a single cycle, day 3-5)? It would additionally be interesting to see a cell-cycle length assessment and invasion assay, to see if Maf1-low parasites have further defects in growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the observed reduced merozoite numbers may not the only cause of the reduced growth rate. Other factors in the PfMaf1 knock-down line may contribute to the observed poor growth.</p></body></sub-article></article>
