Early life is a period of heightened developmental plasticity and sensitivity to environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker, 2007</xref>). Under the developmental origins of health and disease framework, environmental stimuli alter foetal and early life programming to shape physiology and contribute to adult disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wadhwa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Growing evidence implicates telomere length (TL) attrition as a potentially critical underlying mechanism that links early life adverse events with poor health outcomes later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Price et al., 2013</xref>). The erosion of telomeres, the DNA repeats, and protein complexes at the ends of chromosomes, during cell division gradually leads to cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackburn, 2001</xref>). Shorter TL is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and early mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cawthon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzpatrick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salpea et al., 2010</xref>). In our previous study, we hypothesized that early life interventions designed to improve nutrition and decrease environmental faecal contamination would reduce infections and inflammation – exposures associated with TL attrition – and, thereby, slow TL attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). The interventions improved linear growth (length-for-age Z scores) but were unexpectedly associated with shortened TL during the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>), findings that challenged the prevailing paradigm that early-life stressors shorten TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ridout et al., 2015</xref>) and motivated the hypothesis of the present study: that accelerated TL attrition in early life could be associated with improved growth.</p><p>Growth and neurodevelopment occur because of hypertrophy and cell proliferation in the growth plate and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laron, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loveridge and Noble, 1994</xref>), and TL shortens in proportion to the number of cell replications. Measurements of growth and TL may be related or unrelated epiphenomena of an underlying causal process linking environmental insults to child neurodevelopmental outcomes. The pathogeneses of common phenotypes of malnutrition are complex and poorly understood. Stunting (low length for age) reflects chronic exposure to undernutrition and infections, wasting (low weight for length) indicates acute weight loss, and underweight (low weight for age) serves as a composite indicator for wasting, stunting, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">World Health Organization, 2010</xref>). Stunted, wasted, and underweight children often experience impaired neurodevelopment and educational performance, increased risk of infections and chronic disease, reduced adult economic productivity, and increased mortality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">World Health Organization, 2010</xref>). The rapidly expanding field of infant telomere biology may contribute to our understanding of the causal pathway leading to impaired neurodevelopment because the highest rates of TL attrition, growth, and development occur during the first 2 years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elwood, 2004</xref>). During this dynamic period, increases and decreases in TL among individual children have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosquet Enlow et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we evaluated the potential association between TL and growth in early life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The WASH Benefits study was a cluster-randomised controlled trial designed to study the effects of improved drinking water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition on child growth and diarrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>). The study was conducted in rural villages in the Gazipur, Mymensingh, Tangail, and Kishoreganj districts of Bangladesh. This substudy only focused on children in the control and the combined nutrition, water, sanitation, and handwashing (N + WSH) intervention arms. Clusters were defined as eight neighbouring households with eligible pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>We enrolled pregnant women in their first two trimesters and their in utero children between 31 May 2012 and 7 July 2013. Households with relocation plans in the following year, households without home ownership, and households with high iron content in their water sources were excluded from the study. This analysis focused on index children, defined as in utero children of enrolled women. In this substudy, children were excluded from blood collection if any two of the following criteria for moderate to severe dehydration were met: (1) restless, irritable, (2) sunken eyes, (3) drinks eagerly, thirsty, and (4) pinched skin returns to normal position slowly. Children who were listless or unable to perform normal activities were also excluded from blood collection. Two children were excluded based on these criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Procedures</title><p>The trial consisted of six intervention arms and a double-sized control arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>). This substudy only assessed children in the control arm and the combined intervention arm. The combined intervention consisted of the following components: water treatment (Aquatabs; NaDCC) and safe storage vessel, sanitation (child potties, sani-scoop hoes to remove faeces, and a double pit latrine with a hygienic water seal), handwashing (handwashing stations near the latrine and kitchen, including soapy water bottles and detergent soap), and nutrition (lipid-based nutrient supplements [Nutriset, Malaunay, France] that included ≥100% of the recommended daily allowance of 12 vitamins and 9 minerals with 9.6 g of fat and 2.6 g of protein daily for children 6–24 months of age and age-appropriate recommendations on maternal nutrition and infant feeding practices) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>). To promote recommended behaviours, community health promoters visited study compounds in the intervention arm at least once per week during the initial 6 months of the trial and at least once biweekly thereafter. Participants in the control arm did not receive interventions or promoter visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Relative TL measurements</title><p>Relative TL, expressed as the ratio of telomere to single-copy gene abundance (T/S ratio), was measured in whole blood at Year 1 (median age 14 months) and Year 2 (median age 28 months) after intervention delivery. The protocol for the measurement of relative TL, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). We measured relative TL by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), expressed as the ratio of telomere to single-copy gene abundance (T/S ratio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cawthon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Genomic DNA was extracted from heparin-anti-coagulated whole blood stored at –80°C using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). DNA quantity and quality was assessed using a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Products, Wilmington, DE). DNA was stored at –80°C for batch TL analysis. Of the 1384 DNA samples, 8 did not pass quality control (an OD260/OD280 between 1.7 and 2.0 and concentration greater than 10 ng/µl) and one sample failed to amplify, resulting in 1375 samples with valid TL data. The intra-class correlation coefficients were as follows: 0.04 T/S ratio for TL at Year 1, 0.08 T/S ratio for TL at Year 2, and 0.18 T/S ratio for the change in TL between Years 1 and 2.</p><p>The telomere qPCR primers were <italic>tel1b</italic> [5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">CGGTTT(GTTTGG)<sub>5</sub>GTT</named-content>-3'], used at a final concentration of 100 nM, and <italic>tel2b</italic> [5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTTG(CCTTAC)<sub>5</sub>CCT</named-content>-3'], used at a final concentration of 900 nM.

The final reaction mix consisted of the following: 20 mM Tris–hydrochloride, pH 8.4; 50 mM potassium chloride; 200 μM each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate; 1% dimethyl sulfoxide; 0.4× SYBR green I; 22 ng <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA; 0.4 Units of platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Inc, Carlsbad, CA), and approximately 6.6 ng of genomic DNA per 11 µl reaction.</p><p>A threefold serial dilution of a commercial human genomic DNA (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#11691112001) containing 26, 8.75, 2.9, 0.97, 0.324, and 0.108 ng of DNA was included in each PCR run as the reference standard. The quantity of targeted templates in each sample was determined relative to the reference DNA sample by the maximum second-derivative method in the Roche LC480 program. The reaction was carried out in a Roche LightCycler 480 in 384-well plates, with triplicate wells for each sample. Dixon Q test was used to exclude outliers from the triplicates. The average of the T and S triplicate wells after outlier removal was used to calculate the T/S ratio for each sample. The same reference DNA was used for all PCR runs.</p><p>We applied a telomere (T) thermal profile consisting of denaturing at 96°C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 96°C for 1 s and annealing or extension at 54°C for 60 s with fluorescence data collection and a single-copy gene (S) thermal profile consisting of denaturing at 96°C for 1 min followed by eight cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 58°C for 1 s, and extension at 72°C for 20 s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 96°C for 1 s, annealing at 58°C for 1 s, extension at 72°C for 20 s, and holding at 83°C for 5 s with data collection. The T/S ratio for each sample was measured in duplicate runs, each with triplicate wells. When the duplicate T/S values disagreed by more than 7%, the sample was run in triplicate and the two closest values were used.</p><p>Eight control genomic DNA samples were included to calculate a normalising factor for each run. In each batch, the T/S ratio of each control DNA was divided by the average T/S ratio for the same DNA from 10 runs to generate a normalising factor that was then used to correct the participant DNA samples to generate the final T/S ratio. The DNA extraction and TL measurements were performed in two batches (3.5 months apart) using the same lots of reagents. To account for assay batch variations, 48 samples from the first batch were re-assayed together with the second batch of samples; then, data from the second batch of samples were adjusted by a factor of 1.05 (derived from the systematic difference between the first batch values versus the second batch values for these 48 samples).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Following standard protocols for anthropometric outcomes measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cogill,, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Onis et al., 2004</xref>), pairs of trained anthropometrists measured recumbent length (accurate to 0.1 cm), weight without clothing, and head circumference in triplicate. We used the median of the three measurements to calculate length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and head circumference-for-age Z scores standardised to the WHO 2006 child growth standards using publicly available software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software">https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software</ext-link>). The WHO 2006 multicentre growth reference study constructed Z score curves for boys and girls aged 0–60 months based on measurements from a sample of healthy breastfed infants and young children living in the United States, Oman, Norway, Brazil, Ghana, and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Onis et al., 2006</xref>). Z score calculations (Z score = (raw measurement – reference population mean)/reference population standard deviation) in this study used reference population means and standard deviations derived from the WHO 2006 child growth standards. Child age was determined using birthdates verified when possible using vaccination cards. Age at the time of measurement was compared against the Z score curves for the WHO 2006 reference population. Length, weight, and head circumference were measured at Years 1 and 2 post-intervention (median ages 14 and 28 months). We excluded children from Z score analyses if their growth measurements were outside biologically plausible ranges according to WHO recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Onis et al., 2004</xref>). Due to widespread malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries, the mean anthropometric Z scores will generally be &lt;0 during the first 2 years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2013</xref>). Stunting was defined as length-for-age Z scores below –2 standard deviations from the WHO length-for-age standards median, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores &lt; –2, and wasting was defined as weight-for-length Z scores &lt; –2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Exposures</title><p>We assessed the following exposures: TLs at Year 1, TLs at Year 2, and change in TL between Years 1 and 2 post-intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Outcomes</title><p>We assessed child length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and head circumference-for-age Z scores at Year 1 and Year 2.

To estimate the minimum detectable effect between quartiles of TL, we assumed a two-sided alpha of 5% and standard deviations of +1.00 LAZ, + 0.97 WAZ, and +0.90 WLZ. The cluster-level intra-class correlation coefficient within our study was 0.07 for LAZ, 0.04 for WAZ, and 0.02 for WLZ.

Notably, longer relative TL was strongly associated with better linear growth at age 1 year. By age 2, this concurrent association was largely attenuated. These findings extend our inference of early childhood telomere dynamics within the context of the drinking water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition trial among young children in rural Bangladesh and support an adaptive role for telomere attrition, consistent with recently proposed hypotheses in evolutionary biology: the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic> and the <italic>metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The core tenet of the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic> is that there is an energetic cost to maintain long telomeres either through the active prevention of telomere attrition or promotion of telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young, 2018</xref>). Expending energy to sustain long telomeres limits energy resources necessary for other developmental or maintenance processes. The <italic>metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis</italic> expands on the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic> by proposing that the body will engage in active TL regulation as a means to address environmentally induced ‘emergency states’ that require increased energy expenditure (e.g., psychological stress, accelerated growth, nutrient shortage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>). This short-term process prioritises resolution of the ‘emergency state’ to ensure survival over other bodily processes with potentially longer-term benefits. For example, a byproduct of telomere attrition is the acquisition of easily accessibly nucleotides for the body to redirect towards processes essential to address ‘emergency states’.</p><p>In our previous study, children receiving the drinking water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional intervention had better growth and shorter TL at Year 1 compared to children in the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>). Linear growth velocity peaks during the first year of life and declines thereafter until puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avila, 2021</xref>). Because early life growth involves increases in cell size and/or high rates of cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monaghan and Ozanne, 2018</xref>), during periods of rapid growth, energetic imbalances occur as the body expends increased energy to support cell replication processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>). In the trial, the interventions created an optimal environment to promote child growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luby et al., 2018</xref>), but according to the <italic>metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis</italic>, rapid growth may have incurred a temporary energy debt which the body perceived as an ‘emergency state’ and actively shortened telomeres to resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>). Because longer telomeres are energetically costly to maintain, according to the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic>, short-term accelerated telomere attrition would enable the redirection of energy towards processes involved in growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young, 2018</xref>) and would therefore be beneficial as a long-term strategy for health and longevity.</p><p>The findings of this study are consistent with the evolutionary framework and the previous trial results. Rapid telomere attrition may be essential to balance the energy deficit during short-term ‘emergency states’ to ensure individual survival or promote growth during the first year of life. Conversely, with age, perpetual telomere attrition over longer periods would result in crossing the critical lower threshold of TL, which would trigger cell senescence or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>). Several studies in humans and other species suggest an association between longer TL, higher lifetime fitness, and increased longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young, 2018</xref>). As a long-term strategy, long TL could represent a healthy initial setting that would confer resilience to cells, as they would be able to withstand more TL erosion events over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>).</p><p>One caveat to note is that the concurrent associations lack the temporal ordering necessary to infer causal relationships. However, these results are consistent with other studies that have found positive associations between growth and TL: a study in Bangladesh found that low birth weight was associated with shorter TL at age 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raqib et al., 2007</xref>), and better early-life linear growth was associated with longer TL at age 21 years in a Filipino cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masterson et al., 2019</xref>). Better growth during childhood is associated with reductions in adult mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ong et al., 2013</xref>). Besides the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic> and the <italic>metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis</italic>, another potential mechanism underpinning the positive association between TL and growth is that infections contribute to poor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphrey, 2009</xref>) via increased immune activation leading to T-cell proliferation and accelerated telomere attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aviv, 2004</xref>). Because the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, oxidative stress, and immune activation affect TL and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>), forthcoming biochemical assessments of these systems within this cohort may further elucidate the biological pathways between TL and growth.</p><p>This is the first study to assess and demonstrate an association between TL and growth during the first 2 years of life. A limitation of the study is the lack of TL measurements prior to Year 1. Although a positive association was observed between simultaneous measurements of TL and linear growth at Year 1, we are unable to infer the temporal ordering of TL or growth on the causal pathway at Year 1. The study had limited statistical power to detect small differences in length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and head circumference-for-age Z scores and to delineate dose–response relationships between TL and growth; to address these issues, future studies should enrol sufficiently large sample sizes. Findings from this low-income, rural setting in Bangladesh, where growth failure is common, may not generalise to other populations; however, this well-characterised paediatric population provided a relevant setting to test the hypothesis. Although the heritability of TL is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broer et al., 2013</xref>), we did not assess maternal and paternal TL. However, the potential bias from this source is minimal because parental TL does not satisfy the criteria for a potential confounder: although parental TL is strongly associated with child TL, there is no evidence to suggest that parental TL is associated with child growth. To address genetics, maternal height was screened as a covariate for inclusion in adjusted models. The study also screened several other covariates thought to be associated with TL and growth, but due to the observational nature of this assessment, the potential for unmeasured confounding remains a limitation.</p><p>Because rates of TL attrition in somatic tissue reflect stem cell replication and the study only assessed TL in whole blood, measurements in other minimally proliferative tissue types might yield differences in TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniali et al., 2013</xref>). However, within the same individual, some studies suggest high synchrony between TL attrition rates in peripheral blood and those within other somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takubo et al., 2002</xref>). Whole blood TL represents a composite measurement of TL from a heterogeneous population of cell types in varying abundance. Although change in TL is correlated across peripheral blood mononuclear cells, B cells, and T cells within the same individual, TL shortens faster in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to whole blood cells and B cells compared to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zole and Ranka, 2019</xref>). These differences in TL attrition may affect individual results across similar studies assessing TL in distinct immune cell subsets. Although terminal restriction fragment analysis via the Southern blot procedure is considered the ‘gold standard’ to measure absolute TL, the assay requires a prohibitively large volume of blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we adopted the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach, which requires less DNA, measures relative TL by determining the ratio of telomeric DNA (T) to a reference single-copy gene signal (S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cawthon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), and is a validated approach that is widely used in epidemiological settings. TLs measured by Southern blot and qPCR are strongly correlated (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aviv et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The first 2 years of life represent a sensitive period for child growth and development. Although TL was associated with linear growth during the first year of life, this study highlights our limited understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms along these pathways. Telomeres may play a causal adaptive role in child growth or serve as a ‘molecular clock’ that gauges cumulative environmental exposures that affect both early-life telomere dynamics and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casagrande and Hau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shalev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Young, 2018</xref>). A large body of existing research links stress to short TL among all ages; however, the unexpected findings from this study suggest that TL dynamics reflect different processes during childhood and have implications for healthy trajectories. Prospective birth cohort studies conducted in a range of geographical contexts, with frequent longitudinal measurements, would further delineate the relationship between early life telomeres and growth.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a co-founder of Telomere Diagnostics Inc, a telomere measurement company.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eduardo Franco as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Janet Wojcicki (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is my lightly edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review (first person statements are kept for nuancing the comments). Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Following up on a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper in which they demonstrated that water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional intervention improved linear growth and unexpectedly shortened childhood telomere length (TL), Lin et al., now show that TL is associated with concurrent and subsequent growth. Although existing research links stress to TL attrition, our unexpected findings suggest a more complex relationship between childhood TL dynamics and healthy trajectories.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the idea of the paper is interesting, I find that the main conclusions of the authors are not supported by their statistical analyses (lack of multiple testing correction). My main concern with the study relates to the statistical power and the results reported as significant. The sample size is small and therefore most of the associations tested were not significant. The associations reported as significant showed p-values between 1% and 5%. The number of tests performed in the study are quite large, and some multiple correction testing should be included, which would probably deem most of them as non-significant.</p><p>I would also like to see the analyses performed on TL as a continuous variable instead of quartiles of its distribution. The authors hypothesise that TL has an effect on the studied traits, and I think this is expected to be linear, however, this is not tested explicitly. The tests comparing quartiles of TL distribution are somewhat arbitrary (just Q1 v. all others) and although the means are nominally significantly different in some cases, they go up and down rather than showing a linear pattern: From Table 2, LAZ year 1. Q1mean: -1.66 Q2mean: -1.33 Q3mean: -1.44 Q4mean: -1.27. The reason behind this analysis is not justified as the lack of linearity is not discussed in the results. I think the associations claimed by the authors are not supported by their analyses.</p><p>Some of the tables are somewhat difficult to navigate because they contain a lot of information, but this is not particularly problematic.</p><p>In your limitations section, you should comment on whether your TL measurement approach was the most optimal. Some would argue that Southern blot is the better than PCR.</p><p>My understanding is that the heritability of telomere length is quite large (~70%, see e.g., https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2012303) As no genetic data is available this cannot be addressed easily but I would like to see a bit of discussion with respect of the implications of this. Since it is not mentioned I assume all the children are unrelated to each other, otherwise results could be biased because of the genetic structure of the population.</p><p>Reporting results without correcting for the relevant covariates is misleading and unnecessarily complicates the main tables.</p><p>The authors indicate that median TL in year 1 is 14 months and in year 2, 28 months but there are no additional data given including SD or mean, range.</p><p>Change in TL is a mean of 0.04 but again there is no data given on mean time period that change is measured and what are the ranges for children? Age is adjusted for in analyses (as days) but there is no descriptive analysis of age in relation to TL measurement or TL change. Also, the authors indicate that there is an adjustment for regression to the mean due to the correlation between timepoint 1 and change in TL but also no discussion of how the authors discerned there was regression to the mean. Also how did this adjustment change findings?</p><p>The discussion is cursory in regards to paradoxical findings regarding accelerated TL attrition and decreased HC as well as shorter TL at year 1 and lower WLZ at year 2. The authors only conclude that growth is more complex that previously indicated without providing any hypotheses of what could explain this? The authors should review other publications that have found paradoxical results in TL with metabolic change including the review paper by Casagrande and Hau on Telomere attrition (Biology Letters 2019).</p><p>Lines 80-81 – should state the intervention was associated with shortened TL – not that it itself shortened TL</p><p>Lines 111-112 – the abbreviations were not previously defined. Please define these.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60389.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the idea of the paper is interesting, I find that the main conclusions of the authors are not supported by their statistical analyses (lack of multiple testing correction).

However, we agree with the Reviewer’s suggestion to include multiple testing for the reasons outlined. We have revised the manuscript and have added a footnote to each table and asterisks to p-values indicating “<sup>*</sup>P-value &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure”. We have also added a sentence to the Methods section: “We reported unadjusted p-values and adjusted for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (at an FDR of 5%) within each hypothesis using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.” The key finding with a p-value &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was as follows:</p><p>“At Year 1, longer TL was concurrently associated with taller children (+0.23 SD adjusted difference in length-for-age Z score between the 10th and 90th percentile (95% CI 0.05, 0.42; FDR-corrected p-value = 0.01)) (Table 2 and Supplementary file 1b; Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also like to see the analyses performed on TL as a continuous variable instead of quartiles of its distribution.

We have addressed the Reviewer’s concerns by changing the analytical approach and performing the analyses on telomere length as a continuous variable instead of quartiles of its distribution. We made the following revisions in light of our revised analytical approach:</p><p>– We have revised the Methods section:</p><p>“We summarized mean anthropometric Z scores [length-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, and head circumference-for-age Z scores], change in anthropometric Z scores, length velocity, weight velocity, and head circumference velocity across the distribution of TL or change in TL using natural smoothing splines (generalized additive models), both unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounding covariates. We estimated differences in Z scores and pointwise confidence intervals compared to a reference level of the lowest observed TL or change in TL. We reported the differences and confidence intervals between the 10th percentile and 90th percentile of TL or change in TL distribution using predictions from the generalized additive models.”</p><p>– All Tables, Figures, and Supplementary Materials have been revised to reflect this change in analytical approach.</p><p>– We have also extensively revised the Title, Abstract, Results, and Discussion sections to reflect the changed results and inference. The key finding with a p-value &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was as follows:</p><p>“At Year 1, longer TL was concurrently associated with taller children (+0.23 SD adjusted difference in length-for-age Z score between the 10th and 90th percentile (95% CI 0.05, 0.42; FDR-corrected p-value = 0.01)) (Table 2 and Supplementary file 1b; Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the tables are somewhat difficult to navigate because they contain a lot of information, but this is not particularly problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this recommendation. We have simplified the Main Tables formatting by moving the unadjusted estimates to Supplementary Tables to improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In your limitations section, you should comment on whether your TL measurement approach was the most optimal. Some would argue that Southern blot is the better than PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included the following language in the Limitations section of the Discussion:</p><p>“Although terminal restriction fragment analysis via the Southern blot procedure is considered the ‘gold standard’ to measure absolute telomere length, the assay requires a prohibitively large volume of blood (Lai, Wright, and Shay, 2018). Therefore, we adopted the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach, which requires less DNA, measures relative telomere length by determining the ratio of telomeric DNA (T) to a reference single-copy gene signal (S) (Cawthon, 2002; J. Lin et al., 2010), and is a validated approach that is widely used in epidemiological settings. Telomere lengths measured by Southern blot and qPCR are strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.9) (Aviv et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My understanding is that the heritability of telomere length is quite large (~70%, see e.g., https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2012303) As no genetic data is available this cannot be addressed easily but I would like to see a bit of discussion with respect of the implications of this. Since it is not mentioned I assume all the children are unrelated to each other, otherwise results could be biased because of the genetic structure of the population.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting this issue. We have added the following language to the limitation section of the Discussion and included this citation:</p><p>“Although the heritability of TL is high (Broer et al., 2013), we did not assess maternal and paternal telomere length. However, the potential bias from this source is minimal because parental TL does not satisfy the criteria for a potential confounder: although parental TL is strongly associated with child TL, there is no evidence to suggest that parental TL is associated with child growth. To address genetics, maternal height was screened as a covariate for inclusion in adjusted models.”</p><p>Our analysis included three sets of twins. We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding one twin from each pair, which yielded similar results as our primary analysis (compare effect estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> to Table 2). Thus, including the three sets of twins in our primary analysis resulted in minimal bias.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Twin

The median and interquartile range (IQR) for TL at Year 1, TL at Year 2, and change in TL between Years 1 and 2 were included in Table 1. We have added the median and IQR for child age in months at Year 1 and Year 2 to Table 1. We have also added months between telomere length measurements at Year 1 and Year 2 to Table 1 to address the median time period and IQR that change in telomere length was measured. We have added the following lines to the Results section:</p><p>– “The median age of the children was 14.3 (IQR: 12.6 to 15.6) months at Year 1 and 28.2 (IQR: 26.9 to 29.6) months at Year 2 (Table 1).”</p><p>– “The median months between telomere length measurements at Years 1 and 2 was 13.9 months (IQR: 13.5 to 14.7).”</p><p>We created one new Figure (Figure 3) and two new Figure supplements (Figure 3—figure supplements 1–2) (included below) to address the regression to the mean issue. Figure 3 shows an association (r = -0.18, p-value &lt;0.001) between baseline telomere length at Year 1 and the change in telomere length between Years 1 and 2. Because there is a correlation, the regression to the mean effects is present. We corrected for the regression to the mean effect using the equation in Verhulst <italic>et al.,</italic> (Verhulst, Aviv, Benetos, Berenson, and Kark, 2013).</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the regression to the mean comparison of unadjusted association between change in telomere length and growth outcomes (growth at Year 2, change in growth between Years 1 and 2, and growth velocity between Years 1 and 2). In the figure, we compared the analyses using the uncorrected change in telomere length versus the regression to the mean-corrected change in telomere length and displayed the comparison of the unadjusted differences in mean anthropometry Z-scores between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of telomere length measurement.

The unadjusted and adjusted results were similar.</p><p>In addition to adding three figures to the Supplementary Tables, we also added the following paragraph to the Results section to summarize the regression to the mean assessment and these results:</p><p>“We tested for the regression to the mean (RTM) effect by assessing the association between baseline telomere length at Year 1 and the change in telomere length between Years 1 and 2 (r = -0.18, p-value &lt; 0.001) (Figure 3). Because we observed that the correlation between Year 1 TL and TL change between Years 1 and 2 was partly due to regression to the mean (RTM) (Figure 3) (Berry, Eaton, Ekholm, and Fox, 1984), we used the equation in Verhulst et al. to correct for the RTM effect in the primary analyses (Verhulst et al., 2013). Comparing associations between change in telomere length, uncorrected and corrected for the RTM effect, and growth outcomes yielded similar estimates (Figure 3—figure supplements 1–2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is cursory in regards to paradoxical findings regarding accelerated TL attrition and decreased HC as well as shorter TL at year 1 and lower WLZ at year 2. The authors only conclude that growth is more complex that previously indicated without providing any hypotheses of what could explain this? The authors should review other publications that have found paradoxical results in TL with metabolic change including the review paper by Casagrande and Hau on Telomere attrition (Biology Letters 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>After addressing the Reviewers’ comments above: changing the analytical approach and performing the analyses on telomere length as a continuous variable instead of quartiles of its distribution and adjusting for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, the paradoxical results of decreased HCZ and lower WLZ were no longer significant. However, we thank the Reviewer for the suggestions to review the Casagrande and Hau paper. The Reviewer’s suggestion greatly strengthened the Discussion section. Based on the ideas outlined in the Casagrande and Hau review paper (the <italic>costly maintenance hypothesis</italic> and the <italic>metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis</italic>), we revised and added new paragraphs to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Our findings suggest that TL is associated with linear growth in the first year of life. Notably, longer relative TL was strongly associated with better linear growth at age 1 year. By age 2, this concurrent association was largely attenuated. These findings extend our inference of early childhood telomere dynamics within the context of the drinking water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition trial among young children in rural Bangladesh and support an adaptive role for telomere attrition, consistent with recently proposed hypotheses in evolutionary biology: the costly maintenance hypothesis and the metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis (Casagrande and Hau, 2019; Young, 2018).</p><p>The core tenet of the costly maintenance hypothesis is that there is an energetic cost to maintain long telomeres either through the active prevention of telomere attrition or promotion of telomere elongation (Young, 2018). Expending energy to sustain long telomeres limits energy resources necessary for other developmental or maintenance processes. The metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis expands on the costly maintenance hypothesis by proposing that the body will engage in active TL regulation as a means to address environmentally-induced ‘emergency states’ that require increased energy expenditure (e.g., psychological stress, accelerated growth, nutrient shortage) (Casagrande and Hau, 2019). This short-term process prioritizes resolution of the ‘emergency state’ to ensure survival over other bodily processes with potentially longer-term benefits. For example, a byproduct of telomere attrition is the acquisition of easily accessibly nucleotides for the body to redirect towards processes essential to address ‘emergency states’.</p><p>In our previous study, children receiving the drinking water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional intervention had better growth and shorter TL at Year 1 compared to children in the control group (A. Lin et al., 2017; Luby et al., 2018). Linear growth velocity peaks during the first year of life and declines thereafter until puberty (Avila, 2021). Because early life growth involves increases in cell size and / or high rates of cell replication (Monaghan and Ozanne, 2018), during periods of rapid growth, energetic imbalances occur as the body expends increased energy to support cell replication processes (Casagrande and Hau, 2019). In the trial, the interventions created an optimal environment to promote child growth (Luby et al., 2018), but according to the metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis, rapid growth may have incurred a temporary energy debt which the body perceived as an ‘emergency state’ and actively shortened telomeres to resolve (Casagrande and Hau, 2019). Because longer telomeres are energetically costly to maintain, according to the costly maintenance hypothesis, short-term accelerated telomere attrition would enable the redirection of energy towards processes involved in growth (Young, 2018) and would therefore be beneficial as a long-term strategy for health and longevity.</p><p>The findings of this study are consistent with the evolutionary framework and the previous trial results. Rapid telomere attrition may be essential to balance the energy deficit during short-term ‘emergency states’ to ensure individual survival or promote growth during the first year of life. Conversely, with age, perpetual telomere attrition over longer periods would result in crossing the critical lower threshold of TL, which would trigger cell senescence or apoptosis (Casagrande and Hau, 2019). Several studies in humans and other species suggest an association between longer telomere length, higher lifetime fitness, and increased longevity (Young, 2018). As a long-term strategy, long TL could represent a healthy initial setting that would confer resilience to cells, as they would be able to withstand more TL erosion events over the life course (Casagrande and Hau, 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 80-81 – should state the intervention was associated with shortened TL – not that it itself shortened TL</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this sentence:</p><p>“The interventions improved linear growth (length for age) but were unexpectedly associated with shortened TL during the first year of life (Lin et al., 2017; Luby et al., 2018), findings that challenged the prevailing paradigm that early-life stressors shorten TL (Ridout et al., 2015) and motivated the hypothesis of the present study: that accelerated TL attrition in early life could be associated with improved growth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 111-112 – the abbreviations were not previously defined.
