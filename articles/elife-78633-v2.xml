been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, however, breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 are still growing rapidly due to the emergence of immune-evasive variants, especially Omicron. It is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum vaccines to better control the pandemic of these variants. Here, we present a mosaic-type trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate, which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. Tests in rats showed that the designed mos-tri-RBD, whether used alone or as a booster shot, elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants. Neutralizing antibody ID50 titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were substantially higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD (containing homologous RBDs from prototype strain) or the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Our study indicates that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic, which may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to public health and has so far resulted in over six million deaths worldwide. Mass vaccination programs have reduced the risk of serious illness and death in many people, but the virus continues to persist and circulate in communities across the globe. Furthermore, the current vaccines may be less effective against the new variants of the virus, such as Omicron and Delta, which are continually emerging and evolving. Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective vaccines that can provide broad protection against existing and future forms of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>There are several different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but they all work in a similar way. They contain molecules that induce immune responses in individuals to help the body recognize and more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2 if they happen to encounter it in the future. These immune responses may be so specific that new variants of a virus may not be recognized by them. Therefore, a commonly used strategy for producing vaccines with broad protection is to make multiple vaccines that each targets different variants and then mix them together before administering to patients.</p><p>Here, Zhang et al. took a different approach by designing a new vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV2 that contained three different versions of part of a SARS-CoV2 protein – the so-called spike protein – all linked together as one molecule. The different versions of the spike protein fragment were designed to include key features of the fragments found in Omicron and several other SARS-CoV-2 variants. The experiments found that this candidate vaccine elicited a much higher immune response against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in rats than an existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. It was also effective as a booster shot after a first vaccination with the existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that the molecule developed by Zhang et al. induces potent and broad immune responses against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 including Omicron in rats. The next steps following on from this work are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in clinical trials. In the future, it may be possible to use a similar approach to develop new broad-spectrum vaccines against other viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>omicron variant</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>broad-spectrum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Vaccine and Serum Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KTZC1900026C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Qi Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal experiments show that the mosaic-type immunogen integrating key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants elicits broad neutralization against divergent SARS-CoV-2 strains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously evolving, and the emergence of new variants has caused successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the circulating variants, five strains, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, have been classified into variants of concern (VOCs) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/">https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/</ext-link>). Alpha, as the first VOC, became a globally dominant strain in early 2021, which was then replaced by Delta variant from the summer of 2021. These two variants exhibited slightly and moderately less sensitivity to neutralization by serum from vaccinated individuals, with one- to twofold and two- to threefold reductions in neutralizing titers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipsitch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Widge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Planas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pegu et al., 2021</xref>). Beta and Gamma variants outbroke in Africa and South America from early to mid-2021, respectively. Beta variant showed significantly greater immune escape capability and was 3- to 15-fold less susceptible to neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipsitch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Planas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). Gamma strain also exhibited obvious reduced neutralizing sensitivity, but the reduction in neutralizing titers was not as substantial as that of Beta strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lazarevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dejnirattisai et al., 2021</xref>). Besides that, the variants of interest (VOIs) designated by WHO, including Lambda and Mu, have also been reported to have certain immune evasion abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lou et al., 2021</xref>). The potential immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 variants raised concerns about the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines, and new generation vaccines specific to Beta variant have been developed by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaway and Ledford, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Logue et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the pandemic of Omicron variant posed a more serious threat to the protective effectiveness of the currently used vaccines. The Omicron variant, also known as B.1.1.529, was first detected in Botswana and reported from South Africa, which was considered to be associated with the sharp rise of infection cases in multiple provinces in South Africa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern">https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern</ext-link>). Preliminary evidence indicates that this variant may be more transmissible and may have a higher reinfection risk than other VOCs, and thus just two days after its discovery, Omicron has been assigned as a VOC by the WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vaughan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Callaway, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kupferschmidt and Vogel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torjesen, 2021</xref>). According to the data from GISGAID, so far, Omicron has spread rapidly to more than 95 countries and the reported cases of this variant are growing rapidly around the world (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/">https://www.gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/</ext-link>). Omicron carries 15 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein that is the immunodominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Compared with other VOCs, the substantially more mutations, as well as their important locations for antibody binding, may enable Omicron to escape the immune protection offered by previous infection or vaccination. Our recent study on the neutralizing sensitivity of the convalescent serum against pseudo-typed Omicron showed that the mean neutralizing titer at a 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) was significantly decreased 8.4-fold compared to the D614G strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Several studies reported by other groups also demonstrated remarkable resistance of Omicron to neutralization by sera from convalescent patients or vaccinated individuals. Neutralizing antibody ID50 titers against Omicron variant in the individuals administered by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were dramatically reduced 8.6–22 folds compared to the D614G reference strain and by contrast, only 4.3- to 5-fold decline was observed for Beta variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cele et al., 2022</xref>). Sera from the individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 or Ad26.COV2.S failed to neutralize Omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rössler et al., 2021</xref>). Tests on a panel of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies showed that Omicron variant evaded neutralization of the majority of these antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2022</xref>). As of February 2022, the Omicron variant has evolved into multiple lineages, including BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. The extensive immune-escape capability of Omicron and other circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants from previous infections and vaccinations raises an urgent need of developing effective broad-spectrum vaccines against these immune-evasive variants.</p><p>Guided by structural and computational analyses of S protein RBD, we have developed a trimeric form of RBD vaccine candidate, that is, the homologous trimeric RBD (homo-tri-RBD), in which three RBDs from the prototype SARS-CoV-2 strain were connected end-to-end into a single molecule and co-assembled into a trimeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). Animal experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated potent protection offered by this vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaabi et al., 2022</xref>). At present, homo-tri-RBD has completed phase I/II clinical trial and approved by the United Arab Emirates for emergency use. Here, our vaccine design scheme was extended to broaden its immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other immune-evasive variants, we present a mosaic-type trimeric RBD (mos-tri-RBD) vaccine candidate, in which the key mutations derived from Omicron (BA.1) as well as other VOCs and VOIs were integrated into the immunogen. The immunogenicity of the designed mos-tri-RBD was evaluated in rats by using live-virus neutralization assays. To illustrate its superiority in stimulating broad-spectrum neutralizing activities against Omicron and other immune-evasive variants, the cross-reactive immunity induced by mos-tri-RBD was compared with that elicited by homo-tri-RBD and the BIBP inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Especially, given that large-scale populations worldwide have received the primary series of vaccination, the immunogenicity of the designed mos-tri-RBD as a booster dose following the primary vaccination of BBIBP-CorV was also evaluated and compared with the booster vaccinations of homo-tri-RBD and BBIBP-CorV. Our results showed that the immunization with mos-tri-RBD either alone or as a booster dose elicited potent broad-reactive neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron, which was immunogenically superior to homo-tri-RBD and BBIBP-CorV.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of the mos-tri-RBD based on the RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and other variants</title><p>RBD forms a relatively compacted and isolated domain in the structure of spike (S) protein, and the beta-sheets in the core as well as the existence of four disulfide bonds stabilizes the tertiary structure of the domain. The N- and C-termini of RBD are close together, and there exist long loops in both termini. These structural features inspired our construction of a trimeric form of RBD (tri-RBD) through an end-to-end connection of three RBDs into a single chain, in which their own long loops at the N- and C-termini serve as the linkers. The designed tri-RBD enables the accommodation of three RBDs in one immunogen, which can be extended to include Omicron RBD into the immunogen.</p><p>In this study, mos-tri-RBD was designed targeting Omicron as well as other emerging variants with distinct immune evasion capability. Mos-tri-RBD also consisted of three RBDs, one of which was derived from Omicron and the other two were artificially designed to carry the key mutations appearing in SARS-CoV-2 variants. These key mutations integrated into mos-tri-RBD were selected as those appearing in SARS-CoV-2 VOCs or VOIs and simultaneously being ranked in the top ten most frequently occurring mutations in RBD as counted by Wei group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weilab.math.msu.edu/MutationAnalyzer/">https://weilab.math.msu.edu/MutationAnalyzer/</ext-link>). According to this criterion, a total of eight mutations were chosen and introduced into the two artificially designed RBDs (The details on these mutations were provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), where one RBD contained the mutations of K417N, L452R, T478K, F490S and N501Y, and the other included K417T, S477N and E484K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Many pieces of evidence have indicated that these mutations largely contribute to the immune escape of the related variants. We sought to integrate these key mutations into a single immunogen to elicit cross-neutralization against not only SARS-CoV-2 Omicron but also other circulating variants. To facilitate the self-trimerization of mos-tri-RBD, for each RBD the residues 319–537 were truncated from the S protein to retain the long loops at both termini, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Our previous studies have shown that the RBDs with this truncation scheme can correctly fold and co-assemble into a trimeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The details on the eight selected mutations integrated into the two artificially designed RBDs.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Mutations</th><th align="left" valign="top">Rank of the observed frequency</th><th align="left" valign="top">VOCs and VOIs carrying the mutations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">L452R</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1</td><td align="left" valign="top">Delta</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">T478K</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2</td><td align="left" valign="top">Delta, Omicron</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">N501Y</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3</td><td align="left" valign="top">Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Omicron, Mu</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">E484K</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">4</td><td align="left" valign="top">Beta, Gamma, Mu</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">K417T</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gamma</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">S477N</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6</td><td align="left" valign="top">Omicron</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">K417N</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">8</td><td align="left" valign="top">Beta, Omicron</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">F490S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10</td><td align="left" valign="top">Lambda</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design, expression and characterization of the mosaic-type trimeric form of RBD (mos-tri-RBD).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the designed mos-tri-RBD.

Compared with ‘BBIBP-CorV +BBIBP-CorV’ vaccination, the neutralizing antibody GMT against Omicron variant in the ‘BBIBP-CorV +homo-tri-RBD’ immunization group was increased from &lt;85 to 194, however, the value was also significantly lower than that against the prototype strain. Furthermore, similar to the results of pseudo-virus neutralization assay, ‘BBIBP-CorV +mos-tri-RBD’ vaccination elicited remarkably improved live-virus neutralizing antibodies with a GMT value of 731 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Compared to booster vaccinations of BBIBP-CorV and homo-tri-RBD, boosting with mos-tri-RBD induced &gt;8.6-fold and 3.8-fold higher Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies, respectively, which provides an effective booster vaccine against Omicron variant. Similar results were also observed for Beta and Delta variants. In ‘BBIBP-CorV +BBIBP-CorV’ vaccination groups, both Beta and Delta variants exhibited less sensitivity to neutralization by the sera from the immunized rats. While, the neutralizing antibody GMT against Beta variant elicited by ‘BBIBP-CorV +homo-tri-RBD’ was increased from 229 to 532 (2.3-fold), and further improved to 1568 (6.8-fold) by ‘BBIBP-CorV +mos-tri-RBD’ vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For Delta variant, the neutralizing antibody GMT boosted by mos-tri-RBD and homo-tri-RBD was 5.5-fold and 10.3-fold, respectively, higher than that boosted by BBIBP-CorV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results implied that mos-tri-RBD was immunologically superior to homo-tri-RBD and BBIBP-CorV as a booster dose against Omicron and other immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>In summary, both pseudo- and live-virus neutralization assays demonstrated that the designed mos-tri-RBD could serve as an effective booster vaccine to elicit potent and cross-reactive immunity against not only prototype virus but also Omicron and other variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies indicated that Omicron variant might lead to less severe disease than earlier pandemic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ledford, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sigal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolter et al., 2022</xref>), in which the hospitalization risk was reduced by 29% for Omicron compared with Delta variant, and the fatality rates decreased from 3.4% for Delta to 1.9% for Omicron. However, Omicron variant is still a global threat due to its higher transmissibility and increased resistance to antiviral immunity. Facing the severe pandemic of Omicron, WHO has recommended updating the composition of current COVID vaccines and developing multivalent or cross-protective vaccines against the variants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news/item/">https://www.who.int/news/item/</ext-link>). Here, we designed a mosaic-type tri-RBD (mos-tri-RBD), which harbors the key mutations derived from Omicron and other immune-evasive variants, to broaden the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. The immunogenicity of the designed mosaic-type vaccine candidate was assessed in rats, and live-virus neutralization assays showed that mos-tri-RBD elicited broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody response against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron. Considering that large-scale populations in the world have completed the primary series of vaccination, the immunogenicity of the designed mos-tri-RBD was also evaluated as a booster dose following the vaccination of BBIBP-CorV. Tests in rats showed that the mos-tri-RBD booster vaccination elicited more than 2.8–3.9-fold higher neutralizing antibodies against Omicron compared to the booster vaccination of homo-tri-RBD, and more than 8.3–9.6-fold higher compared to the booster of BBIBP-CorV. For other SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and VOIs, the neutralizing antibody titers induced by the mos-tri-RBD booster were 1.2–4.5-fold higher than the homo-tri-RBD booster, and 4.6–10.3-fold higher than the BBIBP-CorV booster. Thus, mos-tri-RBD may serve as a broad-neutralizing vaccine candidate, which could be used alone or as a booster shot in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.</p><p>A commonly used strategy for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines is to produce polyvalent vaccines that contain multiple strain-specific monovalent components. Considering the potential immune escape capability of Beta variant, several studies have designed the Beta-specific COVID-19 vaccines and applied combining with the anti-prototype ones to broaden immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaway and Ledford, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Logue et al., 2021</xref>). Targeting the Omicron strain with stronger immune evasion ability, several vaccine manufacturers have announced the update of the composition of their COVID-19 vaccines to provide effective protection against Omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen, 2021</xref>). In the present work, we provided another strategy for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that is, the construction of mosaic-type vaccines which incorporate multiple antigens and key mutations derived from different variants into a single hybrid immunogen. The mosaic strategy has been successfully applied to the development of broad-spectrum vaccines for HIV, coronaviruses and influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barouch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kanekiyo et al., 2019</xref>), and several studies have demonstrated that mosaic-type immunogen elicited superior B cell responses both in quantity and quality compared to the homotypic immunogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kanekiyo et al., 2019</xref>). Our results also showed that the constructed mos-tri-RBD not only strengthens but also broadens neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 virus continuously evolves, and the mutation rate was estimated to be <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mn>1.12</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> mutations per site-year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amicone et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it is believed that the virus may acquire new mutations, and new variants will continue to emerge. Our mosaic-type vaccine can be easily modified to incorporate new residue mutations to fight against the possible emerging variants in the future.</p><p>The construction of mosaic-type immunogen, which combines the key mutations relevant to immune evasion into a single molecule, provides an effective strategy to achieve broad-spectrum neutralization in a single-component vaccine. The mosaic strategy may also be used in the developments of mRNA- and DNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>SARS-CoV-2 virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Live SARS-CoV-2 prototype virus (QD-01 strain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>SARS-CoV-2 virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Live SARS-CoV-2 Omicron virus (NPRC 2.192100005 strain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>SARS-CoV-2 virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Live SARS-CoV-2 Beta virus (GD84 strain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>SARS-CoV-2 virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Live SARS-CoV-2 Delta virus (GD96 strain)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SARS-CoV-2 prototype, Omicron (BA.1), Omicron (BA.2), Omicron (BA.3), Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Lambda and Mu pseudo-viruses</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>;

After incubation, Vero cell suspension, with a density of (1.5–2)×10<sup>5</sup> per mL, in the medium M199 that contains 5% FBS was added into the mixture with 100 μL per well. Both negative serum and positive reference serum (obtained from the National Institute for Food and Drug Control of China) were included in the plate as controls.

Then, the cellular changes caused by CPE were observed under the microscope, and the wells with cytopathic changes were recorded. Neutralizing antibody titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that could inhibit 50% CPE (ID50), which was calculated by the Karber method. The ID50 for the serum below the LOQ of 20 in the assay was set to 20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>One-way ANOVA with the LSD t-test method was used for the comparison of data from multiple groups, and Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis between two groups. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****&lt;0.0001.

SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain sub-units containing mutations from Omicron sub-variant BA.1 as well as other variants. They demonstrate that this is more effective at boosting neutralizing immunity against Omicron sub-variants and other variants including Beta and Delta than the same vaccine design but incorporating ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike. While vaccine manufacturers are currently racing to make boosters based on Omicron sub-variant sequences, the approach presented in this paper, which combines mutations in addition to those found on individual Omicron sub-variant sequences, may offer another perspective on how to boost previous vaccine immunity to tackle emerging variants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78633.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sigal</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04qzfn040</institution-id><institution>University of KwaZulu-Natal</institution></institution-wrap><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Agnihotri</surname><given-names>Pragati</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04v1j8c44</institution-id><institution>Advanced Bioscience Laboratories</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.29.486173">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.29.486173v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;A mosaic-type trimeric RBD-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces potent neutralization against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pragati Agnihotri (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While there was enthusiasm for the work, since the results have implications for designing vaccines and therefore people's health, the experiments should be clearly described.</p><p>The methodology in this paper was not clear to one of the reviewers, including fundamental aspects such as the number of animals used per experiment, the limit of detection/quantification, and how the live virus neutralization assay was done. These technical points are key to evaluating the reproducibility of the results. Information such as annotated images of the raw data in the live virus neutralization assay may be provided to help the reviewers evaluate the work, and the results shown in the figure panels should be fully explained in the figure legends and text. Consideration may be given to a rebuttal if these technical points are resolved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>More broadly acting SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are required and the approach of the authors to use a mosaic vaccine is reasonable. The major drawback of the work is that it is unclear exactly how the work was done, making it difficult to evaluate.</p><p>The methodology behind the live virus neutralization assay, a key assay in the paper, is unclear to me. In the methods, the authors state that &quot;The serum virus mixed solution was incubated at 37 ℃ for 2 h. After incubation, Vero cell suspension with a density of 2×105 per mL was added into the mixture. Cell-only and virus-only wells were also included in the plate as controls. The plates were incubated at 37 ℃ for 5 to 7 days.&quot; What exactly is measured here, plaques or foci? How is the fact that Omicron does not infect Vero cells well dealt with? The incubation time of 5 to 7 days is extremely long and would not work for most assays.</p><p>Similarly, it is unclear how many animals are used per experiment, although by counting the number of points it seems to be 9 or 10 per group. What the limit of quantification/detection for the assay is unclear, although it may be a 1:10 dilution judging that at the adjuvant only control as the points are at that value in Figures 2-4. The meaning of the different lines in Figure 1D is not well explained.</p><p>Given that the approach described has implications for designing vaccines and so has a direct bearing on population health, the methodology should be more rigorously described.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript deserved to be published in eLife.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A mosaic-type trimeric RBD-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces potent neutralization against Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Betty Diamond (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors clarified how the live virus neutralization results were obtained in the rebuttal letter but this explanation should also be included in the Methods section and more details should be added.</p><p>Specifically, as the authors acknowledge, Omicron BA.1 infection of Vero cells is generally inefficient and may not be very cytopathic, yet the authors quantified the cytopathic effect. Vero infection and the cytopathic effect were achieved with a Vero passaged BA.1.1, which likely accumulated mutations in vitro which allowed for this. While mutations outside of the spike may not strongly affect neutralization, the authors should present the sequence of the spike region of the BA1.1 isolate they used to show that no spike mutations were introduced.</p><p>It would also be very helpful if the sequences of viruses used in this work were to be deposited in a repository such as GISAID and the accessions listed.</p><p>2) In Figure 2 and Figure 4, the authors set titer values below the limit of quantification (which was 20) to 10. This seems arbitrary. Values below 20 should be set to 20, extrapolated using the fit, or listed as below LOQ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78633.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Multiple Omicron strains isolated from different places, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin and Changchun, were screened. As pointed out by the reviewer, not all the strains infect Vero cells well. After serial passages in Vero cells, the Omicron strain (BA.1.1, a sublineage of BA.1; No. NPRC 2.192100005) isolated from Shanghai was selected, which adapted to and propagated well in Vero cells. Typical cytopathic changes of Vero cells caused by Omicron infection can be observed after 5-7 days of incubation. It was found that after infection with Omicron virus, the Vero cells lose their normal shape, becoming round or shrinking. Some cells start to detach and are afloat. The isolation and selection of Omicron virus were carried out by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC.</p><p>The live-virus neutralization assay adopted in our study was based on inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE). The detailed procedure of the assay was as follows. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, and diluted 1:20 using cell culture medium 199 (M199). Then, the sera were two-fold serially diluted in 96-well plate with 50 μL per well. An equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 solution containing 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> of live virus was added to the well and mixed with the serum. The serum-virus mixed solution was cultured 2 h in the incubator maintaining a consistent temperature of 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). After incubation, Vero cell suspension, with a density of (1.5-2)×10<sup>5</sup> per mL, in the medium M199 that contains 5% fetal bovine serum was added into the mixture with 100 μL per well. Both negative serum and positive reference serum (obtained from the National Institute for Food and Drug Control of China) were included in the plate as controls. Cell control (no virus and no tested serum) was also included. The titer of the virus was also titrated as a comparison in the assay. Subsequently, the plates were incubated for 5 to 7 days in the incubator maintaining a consistent temperature of 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Then, the cellular changes caused by CPE were observed under the microscope, and the wells with cytopathic changes were recorded. Neutralizing antibody titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that could inhibit 50% CPE, which was calculated by the Karber method. The titer for the serum below the detection limit of 20 in the assay was set to 10. The procedure of the live-virus neutralization assay has been described in detail in the revised manuscript. (Please see pages 30-31 highlighted in yellow).</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the limitation of the experimental equipment and the consideration of biosafety, no images for the cytopathic effect of Vero cells in the live-virus neutralizing assay were obtained from the BSL3 facility of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC.</p><p>Our live-virus neutralizing antibody detection method has been validated carefully and used to evaluate the immunogenicity of the homo-tri-RBD vaccine developed by our group in a phase 2 trial [Ref: Kaabi NA, et al. (2022) Immunogenicity and safety of NVSI-06-07 as a heterologous booster after priming with BBIBP-CorV: a phase 2 trial. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 7:171.] The specificity, repeatability, intermediate precision, linearity, relative accuracy and virus titer titration have been verified, respectively. The validation process and results met all acceptance criteria defined in the validation protocol, and a standard operating procedure (SOP) has been formulated. During the validation of the detection method, the WHO international reference materials were tested by using our method, and the detected neutralizing antibody titer was 320, which was consistent with the results reported by other studies [Ref: Li J, et al. (2022) Heterologous AD5-nCOV plus CoronaVac versus homologous CoronaVac vaccination: a randomized phase 4 trial. Nature Medicine 28:401-409.]. In addition, 18 human convalescent serum samples were tested by using our method, and the detected GMT value was 56.3, which agreed well with previously reported results obtained by other groups[Ref: Yang S, et al.

The sequencing result showed that there were 40 residue mutations, deletions or insertions in the spike region compared to the prototype virus. All these mutations commonly occurred in BA.1.1 sub-lineage with &gt;70% prevalence, according to the analysis by the Lineage Comparison Tool of the outbreak.info web server [Ref: https://outbreak.info/compare-lineages]. BLAST search against the sequences collected in GISAID showed that many Omicron BA.1.1 spike gene sequences with 100% identity to our sequence have been reported [Ref: https://www.epicov.org/epi3/frontend#2ccaab].
