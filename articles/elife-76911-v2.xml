mammalian characteristic, but several mammals, such as whales, naked mole-rats, and humans, have notably less hair. To find the genetic basis of reduced hair quantity, we used our evolutionary-rates-based method, RERconverge, to identify coding and noncoding sequences that evolve at significantly different rates in so-called hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. Using RERconverge, we performed a genome-wide scan over 62 mammal species using 19,149 genes and 343,598 conserved noncoding regions. In addition to detecting known and potential novel hair-related genes, we also discovered hundreds of putative hair-related regulatory elements. Computational investigation revealed that genes and their associated noncoding regions show different evolutionary patterns and influence different aspects of hair growth and development. Many genes under accelerated evolution are associated with the structure of the hair shaft itself, while evolutionary rate shifts in noncoding regions also included the dermal papilla and matrix regions of the hair follicle that contribute to hair growth and cycling. Genes that were top ranked for coding sequence acceleration included known hair and skin genes <italic>KRT2</italic>, <italic>KRT35</italic>, <italic>PKP1</italic>, and <italic>PTPRM</italic> that surprisingly showed no signals of evolutionary rate shifts in nearby noncoding regions. Conversely, accelerated noncoding regions are most strongly enriched near regulatory hair-related genes and microRNAs, such as <italic>mir205</italic>, <italic>ELF3</italic>, and <italic>FOXC1</italic>, that themselves do not show rate shifts in their protein-coding sequences. Such dichotomy highlights the interplay between the evolution of protein sequence and regulatory sequence to contribute to the emergence of a convergent phenotype.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whales, elephants, humans, and naked mole-rats all share a somewhat rare trait for mammals: their bodies are covered with little to no hair. The common ancestors of each of these species are considerably hairier which must mean that hairlessness evolved multiple times independently. When distantly related species evolve similar traits, it can be interpreted as a certain aspect of their evolution repeating itself. This process is called ‘convergent evolution’ and may provide insights about how different species were able to arrive at the same outcome. One possibility is that they have undergone similar genetic changes such as turning on or off key genes that play a role in the trait’s development.</p><p>Kowalczyk et al. set out to identify what genetic changes may have contributed to the convergent evolution of hairlessness in unrelated species of mammals. By looking at the genomes of 62 mammalian species, they hoped to link specific genomic elements to the origins of the hairless trait. The genetic sequences under investigation included nearly 20,000 genes that encode information about how to make proteins, as well as 350,000 regulatory sequences composed of non-coding DNA, which specify when and how genes are activated. This marks the first time genetic mechanisms behind various hair traits have been studied in such a diverse group of mammals.</p><p>Using a computational approach, Kowalczyk et al. identified parts of the genome that have evolved similarly in mammalian species that have lost their hair. They found that genes and regulatory sequences, that had been previously associated with hair growth, accumulated mutations at significantly different rates in hairless versus hairy mammals. This indicates that these regions associated hair growth are also related to evolution of hairlessness. This includes several genes that encode keratin proteins, the main material that makes up hair. The team also reported an increased rate of evolution in genes and regulatory sequences that were not previously known to be involved in hair growth or hairlessness in mammals. Together these results suggest that a specific set of genetic changes have occurred several times in different mammalian lineages to drive the evolution of hairlessness in unrelated species.</p><p>Kowalczyk et al. describe the parts of the genome that may be involved in controlling hair growth. Once their findings are validated, they could be used to develop treatments for hair loss in humans. Additionally, their computational approach could be applied to other examples of convergent evolution where genomic data is available, allowing scientists to better understand how the same traits evolve in different species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair</kwd><kwd>convergent evolution</kwd><kwd>hairless</kwd><kwd>regressive evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG009299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kowalczyk</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY030546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kowalczyk</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studying the genomes of mammals with sparse hair covering identifies specific genes and regulatory regions responsible for the formation of hair and skin, some of which were previously unrecognized.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair is a defining mammalian characteristic with a variety of functions, from sensory perception to heat retention to skin protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pough et al., 1989</xref>). Although the mammalian ancestor is believed to have had hair, and in fact the development of hair is a key evolutionary innovation along the mammalian lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eckhart et al., 2008</xref>), numerous mammals subsequently lost much of their hair. Many marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, dugongs, and walruses, have sparse hair coverage likely related to hydrodynamic adaptations to allow those species to thrive in a marine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nery et al., 2014</xref>). Large terrestrial mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses also have little hair, likely to enable heat dissipation diminished by the species’ large sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuller et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, humans are also relatively hairless, a phenotypic characteristic that, while stark, has long been of mysterious origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kushlan, 1980</xref>). Just as hair coverage varies across mammal species, coverage for an individual organism can change over time in response to environmental factors. For example, Arctic mammals such as foxes and hares famously demonstrate dramatic coat changes in different seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Hair follicles are established during embryonic development as a result of interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the skin, and such interactions also drive follicle movement in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Hair follicles consist of a complex set of structures under the skin that support the hair shaft itself, which protrudes above the skin. The hair shaft contains an outer layer called the cuticle, an inner cortex later, and sometimes a central medulla core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plowman et al., 2018</xref>). Structures under the skin support the growth and formation of the hair follicle. Of particular interest are the dermal papilla and matrix region, both located at the base of the hair follicle. The dermal papilla is a key controller of regulation of hair growth and follicle morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Veraitch et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, transplantation of dermal papilla cells has been repeatedly demonstrated to result in hair growth in previously hairless tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jahoda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jahoda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reynolds and Jahoda, 1992</xref>). Just above the dermal papilla, the matrix generates stem cells to the growing hair shaft and the root sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plowman et al., 2018</xref>). The two regions work together to regulate and carry out hair growth – the dermal papilla is the master controller that instructs the hair-growing engine of the matrix region.</p><p>During hair growth, a hair follicle goes through three stages of growth called anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. During the anagen phase, the hair shaft is generated and grows out through the skin, while catagen phase ends hair growth and telogen phase causes the follicle to become dormant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso and Fuchs, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Changes to several hair-related genes are known to result in hairlessness in specific species. The <italic>Hr</italic> gene in mice, so named because of its role in the hair phenotype, results in hairless mice when knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benavides et al., 2009</xref>). In Mexican dogs, the <italic>FOXI3</italic> gene has been found to be associated not only with hairlessness, but also associated with dental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drögemüller et al., 2008</xref>). In the American Hairless Terrier, mutation in a different gene, <italic>SGK3</italic>, is responsible for relative hairlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parker et al., 2017</xref>). Fibroblast growth factor genes such as <italic>FGF5</italic> and <italic>FGF7</italic> are also heavily implicated in hair growth because their absence causes drastic changes to coat length and appearance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>). Such genes are associated with keratinocyte growth in which keratins and keratin-associated proteins play a key role. Unsurprisingly, specific structural proteins that comprise hair shafts and their associated genes, known as <italic>KRTAP</italic> genes or hair-specific keratins, are also heavily implicated in hair-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plowman et al., 2018</xref>). They also appear to be unique to mammals, although some <italic>KRTAP</italic>-like genes have been found in reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eckhart et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although genetic changes associated with induced hairlessness in specific domesticated species are useful, it is unclear whether such changes reflect evolutionary changes that result in spontaneous hairlessness and how much such changes are convergent across all or many naturally hairless species. By taking advantage of natural biological replicates of independent evolution of hairlessness in mammals, we can learn about global genetic mechanisms underlying the hairless phenotype.</p><p>Mammalian hairlessness is a convergent trait since it independently evolved multiple times across the mammalian phylogeny. We can therefore characterize the nature of its convergence at the molecular level to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the trait. For example, if a gene is evolving quickly in hairless species and slowly in non-hairless species, that implies that the gene may be associated with hairlessness. We focus on the relative evolutionary rate of genomic sequence, which is a measure of how fast the sequence is evolving relative to its expected rate. Unlike seeking sequence convergence to a specific amino acid or nucleotide, using an evolutionary-rates-based method detects convergent shifts in evolutionary rates across an entire region of interest (such as a gene or putative regulatory element). Evolutionary rate shifts reflect the amount of evolutionary pressure acting on genomic elements, and multiple studies investigating diverse phenotypes have found that phenotypic convergence is indeed associated with convergent changes in evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chikina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapheim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kowalczyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Partha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Partha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prudent et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wertheim et al., 2015</xref>). We used RERconverge, an established computational pipeline, to link convergently evolving genes and noncoding regions to convergent evolution of mammalian hairlessness. Previous work using RERconverge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kowalczyk et al., 2019</xref>) to detect convergent evolutionary rate shifts in genes and noncoding elements associated with convergently evolving traits has identified the putative genetic basis of the marine phenotype in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chikina et al., 2016</xref>), the fossorial phenotype in subterranean mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Partha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Partha et al., 2019</xref>), and extreme longevity in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kowalczyk et al., 2020</xref>). Those studies revealed trends that are not species-specific, but instead represent relevant genetic changes that occurred phylogeny-wide.</p><p>Here, we further explored the genetic basis of hairlessness across the mammalian phylogeny by finding genes and noncoding regions under relaxation of evolutionary constraint (i.e., evolving faster) in hairless species. Such genetic elements likely have reduced selective constraint in species with less hair and thus accumulate substitutions at a more rapid rate. To find genetic elements under accelerated evolution in hairless species, we performed a genome-wide scan across 62 mammal species using RERconverge on 19,149 orthologous genes and 343,598 conserved noncoding elements. In addition to recapturing known hair-related elements, we also identified novel putative hair-related genetic elements previously overlooked by targeted studies. Importantly, newly uncovered genes and noncoding regions were not only related to keratins, but they also represented a suite of genetic functionality underlying hair growth. Such findings represent strong candidates for future experimental testing related to the hair phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phenotype assignment</title><p>The hairless phenotype in mammals arose at least nine independent times along the mammalian phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Genomic regions that experienced evolutionary rate shifts in tandem with mammalian loss of hair were considered potentially associated with phenotype loss. Ten extant and one ancestral hairless species were identified based on species hair density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Broadly, species with skin visible through hair were classified as hairless, namely, rhinoceros, elephant, naked mole-rat, human, pig, armadillo, walrus, manatee, dolphin, and orca.

In the case of cetaceans, we retained all three branches (orca, dolphin, and the orca-dolphin ancestor) as foreground to maximize statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phenotypic confounders</title><p>Hairless species share other convergent characteristics that could confound associations between the hairless phenotype and evolutionary rate shifts. In particular, several hairless species are large and many are marine mammals. Therefore, any signal related to hairless species could be driven instead by confounders. Problems with these two confounders were handled in two different ways.</p><p>To handle large body size as a confounder, body size was regressed from relative evolutionary rates on an element-by-element basis. In other words, the residuals from the linear relationship between body size and relative evolutionary rates were retained to eliminate the effect of body size on relative evolutionary rate trend. In doing so, any effects related to the relationship between body size and hairlessness were mitigated.</p><p>Marine status, on the other hand, is a trait of potential interest because marine mammals experienced unique hair and skin changes during the transition from a terrestrial to a marine environment. However, it is also of interest how much signal is driven by the marine phenotype versus the hairless phenotype. Therefore, Bayes factors were used to quantify the amount of support for the marine phenotype versus the hairless phenotype. A larger Bayes factor indicated more contribution from one model versus another. A ratio of 5 or greater for the hairless phenotype versus the marine phenotype indicated strongly more support for signal driven by hairlessness. Many hair-related pathways evolving faster in hairless species according to RERconverge also indicated that signal was indeed driven by the hairless phenotype as opposed to its heavy confounder, the marine phenotype, according to Bayes factor analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bayes factors reveal the proportion of signal driven by the marine phenotype versus the hairless phenotype.</title><p>Depicted are precision-recall curves demonstrating how Bayes factors of the contrasting hairless and marine phenotypes rank genes related to skin, hair, and olfaction. Also plotted is a ranking based on the ratio of hairlessness and marine Bayes factors (hVSm = hairlessness Bayes factor/marine Bayes factor). The ratio of the Bayes factors quantifies the amount of support for the hairless phenotype beyond the support for the marine phenotype per gene. In other words, a high Bayes factor ratio indicates a signal of evolutionary convergence associated with hairlessness that is not only driven by signals of convergence in hairless marine mammals. The hairless phenotype had much greater power to enrich for genes expressed in skin (GTEx data) compared to the marine phenotype, indicating that accelerated evolution is driven more strongly by hairlessness. Both the marine and hairless phenotypes enriched for genes in hair follicle expression genes, indicating that both contribute to accelerated evolution of those genes. Olfactory genes, on the other hand, are expected to show acceleration only related to the marine phenotype. As expected, the marine phenotype is much more strongly enriched for olfactory genes than the hairless phenotype.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76911-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Species-specific analyses</title><p>In addition to conducting convergent evolution analyses to identify genetic elements evolving at different rates across all hairless species, we also conducted complementary analyses to detect elements evolving at different rates in individual hairless species to demonstrate the importance of convergent evolution in our analyses. Indeed, the strength of enrichment for hair follicle-related genes among top hits steadily increases as more hairless species share rate shifts in those genes, an indicator of the power of the convergent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Further, analyses on single species alone only show enrichment for hair follicle-related genes among top hits in 2 hairless species out of 10 – armadillo and pig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Note that the odds ratio for an enrichment with a minimum of one species is not well defined because most genes genome-wide have at least one hairless species with a significant rate shift (18,582 genes out of 18,822 that could be tested), including all hair follicle genes, and their enrichment was not significant (p=0.64). Overall, enrichment strength increases moving from left to right on the plot as the geneset of interest becomes restricted to genes with a larger number of species with rate shifts, although p-values are less extreme because there are simply fewer genes in those categories with higher numbers of species.

A Fisher’s exact test was then run to test for enrichment of hair follicle genes (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) among genes with significant rate shifts. Although two hairless species do show significant rate shifts, the trend is not consistent across all hairless species, most of which show similar enrichment to non-hairless species. This suggests that studying single species alone is often insufficient to identify hair-related genes. Further, genes with substantial changes in individual species may represent species-specific adaptation that do not apply globally across species that share similar phenotypes. Finally, single-species analyses are insufficient to distinguish genetic element functions may be related to a variety of species-specific adaptations and they are unable to prioritize function-related elements due to the large number of unique changes observed in each species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, counts range from 5,641 for orca to 12,103 for manatee).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76911-fig3-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Also of important note is that every individual hairless species has thousands of genes with significant rate shifts in that species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). It is impossible to tell which of those rate shifts is associated with hairlessness specifically because the species have many unique phenotypes other than hairlessness that could be responsible for rate shifts in their respective genes. Convergent analyses allow for more concrete identification of hair-related elements by weeding out rate shifts that are not shared across species with the convergent hairless phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Known hair-related genetic elements evolve faster in hairless species</title><p>We used RERconverge to identify genes and noncoding elements evolving at significantly faster or slower rates in hairless species compared to haired species (see ‘Methods’). Briefly, the evolutionary rates of genetic elements were compared in hairless versus haired species using a rank-based hypothesis test, and we generated p-values empirically with a newly developed method, termed permulations, that uses phylogenetically constrained phenotype permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saputra et al., 2020</xref>). The permulation method compares the correlation statistics from the true phenotype to correlation statistics that arise from randomized phenotypes that preserve the relative species relationships. Thus, small p-values indicate a specific association with the hairless phenotype.</p><p>We find that quantile–quantile (Q-Q) plots of permulation p-values from hypothesis tests for all genetic elements indicate a large deviation from the expected uniform distribution and thus an enrichment of significant permulation p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2 fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 2 and 3</xref>). Interestingly, noncoding regions appeared to show even stronger deviation from uniformity than coding regions, perhaps because regulatory changes more strongly underlie the convergent evolution of hairlessness. For both coding and noncoding regions, we show enrichment of significant p-values for both positive and negative evolutionary rate shifts, and the direction of the rate shifts is critical to interpretation. Positive rate shifts imply rate acceleration, which we interpret as a relaxation of evolutionary constraint. While positive rate shifts could theoretically be driven by positive selection, we demonstrate that this is not the case for our top-accelerated genes. Branch-site models to test for positive selection were performed using Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang, 2007</xref>) on top-accelerated genes. Tests showed little evidence for foreground-specific positive selection; out of 199 genes tested, 27 genes demonstrated hairless acceleration, but all such genes also showed evidence for tree-wide positive selection, suggesting that positive selection was not specific to hairless species although perhaps stronger (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). In fact, over half of our top genes from show evidence of pseudogenization, and therefore defunctionalized, in one or more hairless species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, regions with positive rate shifts evolve faster in hairless species due to relaxation of evolutionary constraint, perhaps because of reduced functionality driving or in conjunction with the hairlessness phenotype. Negative rate shifts indicate increased evolutionary constraint in hairless species, which implies increased functional importance of a genomic region. While negative shifts are more difficult to interpret in the context of trait loss, they may represent compensatory phenotypic evolution in response to trait loss.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Genes whose evolutionary rates are significantly associated with the hairless phenotype with significant parametric p-values, significant permulation p-values, positive statistic, and hairless versus marine Bayes factors (BF) greater than five.</title><p>BF marine and BF hairless are BF for those phenotypes individually, while BF hairless/BF marine is the ratio of the two. The ratio of the BF quantifies the amount of support for the hairless phenotype beyond the support for the marine phenotype per gene. In other words, a high BF ratio indicates a signal of evolutionary convergence associated with hairlessness that is not only driven by signals of convergence in hairless marine mammals. Also shown are enrichment statistics for noncoding regions near top genes. Adjusted p-values are Benjamini–Hochberg corrected.

In addition to identifying known genes, other understudied genes and microRNAs were also identified as key plausible targets for further inquiry into the genetic basis of hairlessness, and a suite of putative regulatory elements associated with hair and skin were uncovered.</p><p>The top-ranked gene was <italic>FGF11</italic>, a fibroblast growth factor gene. It evolved faster in hairless species due to relaxation of evolutionary constraint, indicating that it has reduced functionality in hairless species. Fibroblast growth factors are readily studied for a variety of functions, but the precise functionality of <italic>FGF11</italic> is unknown.

Interestingly, the gene related to hairlessness in Mexican hairless dogs is also related to dentition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drögemüller et al., 2008</xref>), implying plausibility for a hair-related gene to also be tooth-related.

First, identifying such regions genome-wide is difficult because they lack the defining characteristics that genes share, such as start and stop codons, and thus finding putative regulatory elements using sequence alone is an ongoing area of study. Our strategy of using conserved regions as putative regulatory elements likely misses many real regulatory sequences while simultaneously capturing conserved elements with no regulatory function. However, our method of sequence selection is also unbiased and provides a robust set of sequences to analyze, many of which likely do have regulatory functions. Second, validating our findings from noncoding regions is difficult because few CNEs have known functions. Therefore, to validate our noncoding results, we mapped noncoding regions to nearby genes and inferred CNE functions based on the functions of those genes. Such proximity-based mapping has known flaws because enhancers can have distal effects and chromatin state controls enhancers' access to genes regardless of distance. However, despite all of the potential sources of error, we identify global signal for noncoding regions under accelerated evolution in hairless species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and signal for hair-related acceleration of noncoding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>Further analyses of noncoding regions revealed an interesting deviation from signals of accelerated evolution in coding regions. Namely, coding regions primarily showed acceleration in genes related to texture and the structure of the hair shaft itself. Noncoding regions, on the other hand, showed accelerated evolution near genes related to the dermal papilla and the matrix. Both regions are essential for hair growth. The dermal papilla is the master controller of hair follicle development and hair growth, and it has in fact been repeatedly shown to be sufficient to cause hair growth. Dermal papilla cells, when transplanted to hairless skin such as footpads, have consistently been shown to result in development of hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jahoda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jahoda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reynolds and Jahoda, 1992</xref>). Since all mammals are capable of growing hair and do have at least some hair at some point in their life cycles, these findings imply that function of genes related to the dermal papilla must be preserved, and spatial and temporal changes in hair growth may be driven by noncoding regions. Much like the dermal papilla, the hair follicle matrix is essential for hair growth – mitotically active matrix cells give rise to all other inner hair structures, including the hair shaft and the root sheath. Early-stage matrix differentiation can even progress without dermal papilla signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mesler et al., 2017</xref>). Hair cannot exist without the dermal papilla and matrix, and alterations to their related noncoding regions could plausibly have a large impact on hair growth capabilities. Changes to their associated regulatory regions, on the other hand, may be more flexible and allow for the changes in hair localization, texture, and density that we observe in near-hairless mammals.</p><p>Other genes with nearby accelerated noncoding regions likewise demonstrate conservation in protein-coding sequence, possibly because of strong pleiotropy of hair- and skin-related genes. In fact, among the top-ranked non-keratin genes with quickly evolving nearby noncoding regions, only one gene showed a significant evolutionary rate shift in protein-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>FOXC1</italic> and <italic>ELF3</italic>, among the top-ranked genes, are strongly linked to hair and skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brembeck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) but also have other essential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sengez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seo et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings imply that many hair-related genes may have similar pleiotropy preventing accelerated evolution of coding sequence in hairless species. Instead, plasticity of gene regulation through accelerated evolution of noncoding regions may allow for the evolution of hairlessness.</p><p>Additionally based on noncoding sequences near regions of interest, mir205 was found to be the top-ranked microRNA with nearby noncoding sequences under accelerated evolution. Mir205 is well-established microRNA related to hair and skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), and it thereby serves as a strong validation that signals of convergent evolution are successfully identifying hair-related elements. The second-ranked mir1305 has been implicated in skin functionality with significantly different expression levels in damaged versus healthy skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2012</xref>). Numerous microRNAs have been implicated in hair- and skin-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andl and Botchkareva, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), likely a subset of the total elements involved in hair growth. In general, microRNAs are likely key players in hair follicle cycling because of their importance in stem cell regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng et al., 2015</xref>), and the microRNAs and their associated noncoding regions identified in this work serve as a valuable list of candidates for further inquiry. Likewise, noncoding regions near other hair-related genes are also under accelerated evolution in hairless species and may regulate hair- and skin-related functions. Further, some undercharacterized and plausibly hair- and skin-related genes, such as <italic>CCDC169-SOHLH2</italic> and <italic>FAM178B</italic>, have nearby accelerated noncoding regions and thus identify those genes and their regulatory regions as candidates for further experimental testing.</p><p>This study has revealed a slew of fresh candidate genes, noncoding regions, and microRNAs putatively associated with hair growth. Notably, it avoids identifying species-specific genetic changes that could be associated with any number of phenotypes unique to each species and instead looks for general hair-related genomic elements relevant across many species. As a genome-wide scan across a large swath of the mammalian phylogeny, it represents not only a step toward fully understanding hair growth, but also understanding the evolution of hair across all mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Calculating body size-regressed relative evolutionary rates</title><p>The RERconverge package in R was used to generate phylogenetic trees for each gene and noncoding region in which branch length represented the amount of evolutionary change, or the number of nonsynonymous substitutions, that occurred along that branch as described in several previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kowalczyk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kowalczyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Partha et al., 2019</xref>).

Therefore, classification of species as ‘hairless’ versus ‘haired’ was qualitatively based on density of hair covering and quantitatively based on the impact of removing species on the hair-related signal detected during analyses. Tendency was to err on the side of leniency when assigning species as hairless – any species with reduced hair quantity was classified as hairless.</p><p>Extant species classified as hairless were armadillo, elephant, white rhinoceros, pig, naked mole-rat, human, and marine mammals (manatee, pacific walrus, dolphin, and orca). The hairless set comprised all but one marine mammal in the 62 mammal species (the furry Weddell seal is not included in the hairless set). The only nonextant species classified as hairless was the orca-dolphin ancestor (the cetacean ancestor) because that species was likely also a hairless marine species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nery et al., 2014</xref>). The elephant–manatee ancestor was not classified as hairless because modern elephants have known extinct hairy sister species (wooly mammoths) that diverged after the elephant–manatee divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roca et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, classifying the elephant–manatee ancestor as hairy was the most parsimonious phenotype assignment for the afrotherian clade. The classification was also supported by the data, which indicated a stronger signal for skin-related genes when the elephant–manatee ancestor was classified as hairy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Although some species are undeniably hairy (dog, cat, sheep, etc.) and some are undeniably relatively hairless (orca, dolphin, elephant, etc.), some species are borderline cases. For example, the tenrec and hedgehog appear to have ‘spikes’ rather than hair. However, tenrec and hedgehog spikes (as well as porcupine quills) are modified hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leon Augustus, 1920</xref>), so we classified tenrec and hedgehog as hairy. Armadillo, pig, and human are likewise classified as hairless species but have relatively greater hair quantity than the other hairless species. The armadillo, like the tenrec and hedgehog, has a unique external modification, but unlike the tenrec and hedgehog, the armadillo’s shell is made of bone, not hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), so we classified the armadillo as hairless. Pig and human, on the other hand, have nonmodified skin that is nearly completely covered in hair (and in the case of humans, the hair is quite dense in some body areas), but both species have large swaths of body area where hair is so sparse that sun-exposed skin is clearly visible. Both species were classified as hairless due to this pervasive low hair density. To assess the impact of species assignment on skin- and hair-related signal, hairless species were systematically removed and relevant enrichment statistics were recalculated.

Instead of returning statistics and p-values, Bayes factors directly quantify the amount of support for an alternative hypothesis. For example, a Bayes factor value of 5 for a particular statistical test would indicate five times more support for the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis. Bayes factors can also be used to compare different alternative hypotheses by calculating the ratio of two Bayes factors.</p><p>When considering the hairless phenotype, we use Bayes factors to quantify the support for a linear model predicting phenotype using evolutionary rate information from each gene, with a higher Bayes factor indicating greater support. We perform this calculation for two alternative hypotheses: (1) a gene shows different evolutionary rates in hairless versus hairy species, and (2) a gene shows different evolutionary rates in marine species versus nonmarine species. The ratio of Bayes factors between the hairless and marine phenotypes quantifies the level of support of one phenotype over the other and thus can be used to tease apart intricacies of the two heavily confounded phenotype. When the Bayes factor for the hairless phenotype is much larger than the Bayes factor for the marine phenotype, that indicates stronger support for signal driven by hairlessness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calculating enrichment statistics</title><p>Enrichment statistics were calculated using MGI genesets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake et al., 2003</xref>), GTEx tissue annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papatheodorou et al., 2018</xref>), GO annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carbon et al., 2019</xref>), and genes highly expressed in hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The 70 hair follicle-specific genes were obtained by selecting the top 200 hair follicle-expressed genes and removing genes that were included in the top 10,000 genes with the highest minimum median expression across GTEx tissues, that is, ubiquitously expressed genes. Noncoding regions were mapped to annotations via distance from relevant genes – regions within 10,000 bases of a gene were assigned to that gene and its pathways. Noncoding regions were also mapped to microRNA coordinates using the same distance-based metric. All annotations are available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k98sf7m77">Dryad</ext-link>.</p><p>Pathway enrichment statistics were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which compares ranks of foreground values for elements in a pathway to background values for nonpathway elements. For each gene or noncoding element, the sign of the statistic times the log of the p-value were used to generate ranks. Empirical p-values from permulations were also generated using the same null phenotypes used for individual elements and detailed in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kowalczyk et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Permulations</title><p>In addition to computing parametric statistics directly from standard statistical tests, empirical p-values were also calculated using a permulation strategy. Permulations were used to generate null phenotype values, and the empirical p-value was calculated as the proportion of null statistics as extreme or more extreme than the observed parametric statistics. Such a strategy corrects for a nonuniform empirical null distribution at the gene level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and nonindependence among genetic elements at the pathway level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saputra et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Positive selection tests</title><p>For top-ranked genes under accelerated evolution in hairless species, all KRT and KRTAP genes, and various genes in top-ranked pathways under accelerated evolution in hairless species, branch-site models to test for positive selection were performed to identify whether rapidly evolving genes were undergoing positive selection or merely under relaxation of constraint. Such models were performed using a subset of the full 62 species mammalian phylogeny as shown in the ‘Phylogenetic trees’ section below.</p><p>Significance of relaxation of constraint for hairless species was assessed using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) between branch-site neutral (BS Neutral) and its nested null model M1 (sites neutral model) in PAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang, 2007</xref>). Similarly, LRTs between branch-site selection model (BS Alt Mod) and its null BS Neutral were used to infer positive selection in hairless species. For each test, p-values were estimated using the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Phylogeny-wide relaxation of constraint was additionally quantified using the LRTs between M2 (sites selection model) vs. M1 (sites neutral model) and M8 (sites selection model) vs. M8A (sites neutral model), respectively. Prior to performing the mammal-wide tests, hairless foreground species were removed to estimate significance of relaxation of constraint and positive selection from only the background mammalian branches. Removing hairless species allowed us to distinguish whether genes were under positive selection in all mammal species or only in hairless mammal species. Genes with significant signals of positive selection and nonsignificant signals of phylogeny-wide acceleration were inferred to be under positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kowalczyk et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Species-specific analyses</title><p>Further tests to identify genomic elements with evolutionary rate shifts in individual hairless species were conducted as follows. First, RERs from all extant species across all genes were retained and RERs for ancestral species were discarded. Next, RERs for hairless species were removed. Finally, for each gene, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was run to individually compare the RER of each hairless species to the RERs for the non-hairless species.</p><p>Results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were pooled in two different ways. First, for each gene, the number of species with significant rate shifts was counted. Using those counts, a Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a hair gene enrichment statistic between genes with cutoffs ranging from 1 to 10 species representing the minimum number of species with significant rate shifts. Hair follicle annotations used for enrichment are available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k98sf7m77">Dryad</ext-link>.</p><p>A second set of enrichment statistics was calculated using the same annotations to test for an enrichment of hair genes with significant rate shifts in each hairless species individually. To complement these analyses, a second set of non-hairless species was selected and tested using the same procedure as the hairless species. In short, those species were removed from the set of all RERs and then each was individually compared to the background set of RERs from species not in the set using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phylogenetic trees</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Master tree topology with average branch lengths</title><p><named-content content-type="sequence">((((((((((((((ailMel1:0.03854019703,((lepWed1:0.02002160645,odoRosDi:0.02064385875):0.01734764946,musFur1:0.04613997497):0.002879093616):0.009005888384,canFam3:0.05339127565):0.01185166857,felCat5:0.05020331605):0.03285617057,((((((bosTau7:0.02168740723,((capHir1:0.01157093136,oviAri3:0.01246322594):0.0049716126,panHod1:0.01522587482):0.01465511149):0.0662523666,(orcOrc1:0.006371664911,turTru2:0.01086552617):0.06014682602):0.01216198069,susScr3:0.0796745271):0.006785823323,(camFer1:0.01240650215,vicPac2:0.01096629635):0.06374554586):0.02551888691,(cerSim1:0.04977357056,equCab2:0.061454379):0.02510111297):0.00331214686,((eptFus1:0.03248546656,(myoDav1:0.02344332842,myoLuc2:0.01567729315):0.02193849809):0.09455328094,(pteAle1:0.005833353548,pteVam1:0.01611220178):0.07567400302):0.02385546003):0.002057771224):0.004845253848,(conCri1:0.1239823369,(eriEur2:0.1696142244,sorAra2:0.1934205791):0.02079474546):0.0235875333):0.01477733374,((((((chrAsi1:0.1017903453,echTel2:0.1749615473):0.01592632003,eleEdw1:0.1516860647):0.006610995228,oryAfe1:0.08326528894):0.008243787904,(loxAfr3:0.06812658238,triMan1:0.06198982615):0.0224994529):0.03384011363,dasNov3:0.1342602666):0.005989703247,(((macEug2:0.1270943532,sarHar1:0.09944141622):0.02717055443,monDom5:0.1181200712):0.1802966572,ornAna1:0.4322118716):0.2206952867):0.01316436193):0.01425600689,((((((cavPor3:0.09048639907,(chiLan1:0.05332953299,octDeg1:0.08476954109):0.01287861561):0.02118937782,hetGla2:0.08588673524):0.07432515556,speTri2:0.08896424642):0.006291577528,((((criGri1:0.04084640027,mesAur1:0.04456203524):0.02314125062,micOch1:0.06932402649):0.01947113467,(mm10:0.05273642272,rn5:0.05576007402):0.04435347588):0.08380065137,jacJac1:0.1438649666):0.04270536633):0.01663675397,(ochPri3:0.1256544445,oryCun2:0.07131655591):0.06535533418):0.009050428462,tupChi1:0.1191189141):0.003894252213):0.01379370868,otoGar3:0.108738222):0.04299750653,(calJac3:0.02474184521,saiBol1:0.02096868307):0.02784675729):0.0135408115,(chlSab1:0.007693724903,((macFas5:0.001292320552,rheMac3:0.00713015786):0.002951690224,papHam1:0.005199240711):0.002049749893):0.01566263562):0.007043113559,nomLeu3:0.01770384793):0.002187630666,ponAbe2:0.0164503644):0.005572327638,gorGor3:0.007765177171):0.001382639829,hg19:0.005957477577,panTro4:0.006721826689);</named-content></p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Subset of master tree used for branch-site models for positive selection</title><p><named-content content-type="sequence">(((((((((((lepWed1:0.02002160645,odoRosDi:0.02064385875):0.01734764946,musFur1:0.04613997497):0.02373665057,felCat5:0.05020331605):0.03285617057,((((((bosTau7:0.02168740723,oviAri3:0.03208995002):0.0662523666,(orcOrc1:0.006371664911,turTru2:0.01086552617):0.06014682602):0.01216198069,susScr3:0.0796745271):0.006785823323,vicPac2:0.0747118422):0.02551888691,(cerSim1:0.04977357056,equCab2:0.061454379):0.02510111297):0.00331214686,(myoDav1:0.1399351075,pteAle1:0.08150735657):0.02385546003):0.002057771224):0.004845253848,(conCri1:0.1239823369,sorAra2:0.2142153246):0.0235875333):0.01477733374,(((eleEdw1:0.1582970599,oryAfe1:0.08326528894):0.008243787904,(loxAfr3:0.06812658238,triMan1:0.06198982615):0.0224994529):0.03384011363,dasNov3:0.1342602666):0.01915406518):0.01425600689,(((((cavPor3:0.1116757769,hetGla2:0.08588673524):0.07432515556,speTri2:0.08896424642):0.006291577528,((criGri1:0.08345878555,mm10:0.09708989861):0.08380065137,jacJac1:0.1438649666):0.04270536633):0.01663675397,oryCun2:0.1366718901):0.009050428462,tupChi1:0.1191189141):0.003894252213):0.01379370868,otoGar3:0.108738222):0.04299750653,calJac3:0.0525886025):0.0135408115,(chlSab1:0.007693724903,rheMac3:0.01213159798):0.01566263562):0.01618571169,hg19:0.005957477577,panTro4:0.006721826689);</named-content></p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing -

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter H Sudmant (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a strong manuscript that all three reviewers thought was interesting and well-done. The reviewers have provided a number of comments and suggestions. All the reviewers' comments and suggestions are constructive so we encourage you to carefully consider them in your revisions. In particular, please pay attention to:</p><p>1) Reviewer's #3 point about your assumption that species &quot;use&quot; the same genes to accomplish hairlessness. The reviewer has proposed a complementary analysis that would enable you to relax this assumption.</p><p>2) The numerous points raised by all three reviewers about clarity in your presentation of methods and results of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do have some small comments and suggestions, some of which may be beyond the scope of the manuscript:</p><p>– It would seem that relaxed selection following hair reduction could eventually result in the total absence of a gene or CNE in the dataset. Can RERconverge handle gene or CNE deletions, and would these events be detected in the current approach?</p><p>– At the core of the paper is an argument that non-coding and coding genes are non-randomly contributing to the loss of hair. A hypothesis proposed here is based on pleiotropy, whereby the coding genes are under functional constraint and are limited to genes regulating hair physical structure and texture compared to regulatory regions near genes regulating developmental processes. Is there a way to assess this hypothesis with the data?

This could be important when considering correlated integumentary appendage phenotypes (such as teeth). Further, are there any interesting mutations in these genes in any particular lineages? For coding genes, are there truncating or loss of function mutations associated with these genes?<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Is the word &quot;permulation&quot; necessary? The overall analysis is a permutation, as the goal is to permute the hairless phenotype across the species set. My understanding is that the Brownian simulation is only to account for phylogenetic relationships. Obviously, one cannot randomly permute phenotypes because that would assume all species are independent from each other. The Brownian simulation is a clever solution because it maps out how haired vs. hairless can be permuted while accounting for relatedness. But again… the analysis is fundamentally a permutation, just not sure a new word is necessary.</p><p>2) For coding regions, nonsynonymous substitutions are counted. I assume this is normalized by the number of nonsynonymous sites in a gene, but this is never mentioned. Or maybe it's not important to normalize since they are looking for relative rates of change across species. Please clarify.</p><p>3) It is not clear if/how branch lengths are taken into account. It seems that short branches would be noisier compared to long branches. Of course, this might be the opposite for a a rapidly evolving region, if long branches are more saturated with changes. Does branch length need to be taken into account? Or does it make a difference?</p><p>4) It is not clear how the authors chose the exact species included in Figure 1. They rely on the UCSC 100-way alignment. There are quite a few placental species that are in the UCSC 100 way alignment that were not included here.</p><p>5) Figure 1C and 1D: It is not clear how many genes were in each of those categories to begin with. Also, it's likely that many genes occur in more than one category, so it is just difficult to interpret the figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76911.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a strong manuscript that all three reviewers thought was interesting and well-done.

See response to Reviewer #3’s point here:</p><p>Our analyses detect convergently evolving genomic elements associated with hairlessness for two reasons. First, species-specific analyses may detect genomic changes associated with any unique phenotypes in a particular species and it is difficult to distinguish which of those genomic changes are associated with hairlessness. Second, we are seeking genomic elements associated with hair growth in all mammals and species-specific adaptations will not be shared across all mammals.</p><p>Nevertheless, we conducted a complementary analysis to test for rate shifts specific to each hairless species compared to all of the non-hairless species. We then tested for enrichment of hair follicle genes among genes with significant rate shifts in different numbers of hairless species. For example, among all genes with significant rate shifts in at least <underline>one</underline> hairless species, is there an enrichment of hair follicle genes? Then, among all genes with significant rate shifts in at least <underline>two</underline> hairless species, is there an enrichment of hair follicle genes? Et cetera until we test for enrichment only in genes with rates shifts in all ten hairless species. As expected, the signal of enrichment gets stronger as more species share the rate shift (the “convergent signal”). This happens because the genes with shared rate shifts are more hair-specific than the genes with unshared rate shifts.</p><p>We also performed another analysis to test for enrichment of hair follicle genes among genes with significant rate shifts per hairless species. For example, in orca, are the genes with significant rate shifts enriched for hair follicle genes? To complement this analysis, we also repeated the procedure for non-hairless species for comparison. Only two of the ten hairless species show species-specific hair follicle enrichments, which indicates that most of the hairless species alone are insufficient to detect hair signal at all. Even among the two species with significant enrichment, there are thousands of total genes identified, many of which are likely related to other unique characteristics of those species other than hairlessness, and it is impossible to distinguish the hair-related genes from the other genes without additional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The numerous points raised by all three reviewers about clarity in your presentation of methods and results of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made numerous changes to the text to clarify presentation of our methods and results (as listed individually under relevant comments). We hope that these make our manuscript easier to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I do have some small comments and suggestions, some of which may be beyond the scope of the manuscript:</p><p>– It would seem that relaxed selection following hair reduction could eventually result in the total absence of a gene or CNE in the dataset. Can RERconverge handle gene or CNE deletions, and would these events be detected in the current approach?</p></disp-quote><p>In the current approach, deleted elements (or elements missed due to things like alignment issues) are simply treated as missing values. The species set is subset to include only species that have sequence information on a per-element basis. For protein coding analyses, other tools could be used to identify missing genes and determine if missingness is associated with the hairless phenotype, but these analyses would require careful consideration of many factors such as gene copy number, genome quality, and defunctionalization criteria, and we therefore believe that redoing such analyses would be beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Considering CNE deletions would likely be a fruitful avenue to find gains and losses associated with hairlessness and other convergent phenotypes. However, this is challenging due to uncertainty about the source of missing sequence and lack of standard likelihood models for indels. We believe addressing these challenges is beyond the scope of this paper. Our analyses were performed on highly conserved potential regulatory regions, but a gain/loss analysis would require inclusion of less conserved regions, which would both be more difficult to identify and more sensitive to additional considerations like genome quality and defunctionalization criteria. Such analyses would further require cell type-specific analyses since activity of regulatory elements is highly varied across cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At the core of the paper is an argument that non-coding and coding genes are non-randomly contributing to the loss of hair.

Just as genes have many functions, regulatory regions likely have different functions in different tissues and different developmental timepoints as well as in different species.</p><p>Some hair- and skin-related genes, like KRTs and KRTAPs, have relatively specific functions, but others have a wide range of functions, so as a rule, the genes we report are not particularly hair-specific. For example, FGF11 is a growth factor and GLRA4 appears to have a role in the central nervous system. However, since our knowledge of the full functionalities of all genes is incomplete, we do not think sufficient data exist to fully test the pleiotropy hypothesis because we simply do not know how pleiotropic the genes are, especially for lesser studied areas like hair follicle biology.</p><p>For noncoding regions, the dearth of data is even more notable. We would need to have tissue- and timepoint-specific regulatory activity across many hairy and hairless species to fully understand the regulatory machinery underlying the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Supplemental figure of correlation plots might be helpful for specific candidate genes mentioned in the text (FGF11, etc.), as it is unclear which combination of species is accelerated and driving the signature.

Note that all genes highlighted are supported by most, if not all, hairless species.</p><p>We also agree that analyzing defunctionalizing mutations in genes is very interesting and have added it for our top genes. The text now includes the following information regarding pseudogenes, and table 1 indicates pseudogenes in specific species.</p><p>“In fact, over half of our top genes from show evidence of pseudogenization, and therefore are defunctionalized, in one or more hairless species (Table 1) (W.K.

In practice, all three techniques (permulations, permutations, and phylogenetic simulations) are used in this context, so having a different word to distinguish permulations from unrestricted random shuffling (i.e. permutations) is something that we thought was important in communicating methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For coding regions, nonsynonymous substitutions are counted. I assume this is normalized by the number of nonsynonymous sites in a gene, but this is never mentioned. Or maybe it's not important to normalize since they are looking for relative rates of change across species. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The units on raw branch lengths are average number of substitutions per site, so a length correction already exists. (note that there are subsequent corrections of branch lengths to adjust for heteroskedasticity, normalize for average rate, etc., so the final branch lengths or RERs have different units from the raw branch lengths, but these are still accounting for sequence length).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear if/how branch lengths are taken into account. It seems that short branches would be noisier compared to long branches. Of course, this might be the opposite for a a rapidly evolving region, if long branches are more saturated with changes. Does branch length need to be taken into account? Or does it make a difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, longer branches generally show greater variability than shorter branches. This is a statistical anomaly known as heteroskedasticity and RERconverge corrects for it (demonstrated in Robust Method for Detecting Convergent Shifts in Evolutionary Rates, Partha et al. 2019). Branch lengths are converted to RERs (relative evolutionary rates) that are directly used to calculate associations, and the RERs include the statistical adjustments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear how the authors chose the exact species included in Figure 1. They rely on the UCSC 100-way alignment. There are quite a few placental species that are in the UCSC 100 way alignment that were not included here.</p></disp-quote><p>The species chosen for Figure 1 were selected relatively arbitrarily to include all of the hairless species and a representative set of other species to demonstrate the breadth and structure of the tree. Note that this species selection was solely used for Figure 1A for ease of visualization – for analyses, the full set of 62 species was used. We have added a sentence to the Figure 1A legend to clarify that the species list was subset only for visualization purposes as follows:</p><p>“Note that all 62 species were included in analyses and only a subset are shown here for visualization purposes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1C and 1D: It is not clear how many genes were in each of those categories to begin with. Also, it's likely that many genes occur in more than one category, so it is just difficult to interpret the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further investigated overlap in pathways highlighted in Figure 1 C and D. Note that Figure 1 Source Data 5 already included the information about pathway size, and we now additionally include Figure 1 Source Data 9 that reiterates that information as well as lists the number of genes shared between each pair of pathways. Note that we also provide a link to our pathway annotations so interested readers may further investigate or use the annotations themselves.</p><p>Supplements 2 and 3 to Figure 1 now show networks of pathway sizes and shared genes among pathways. Clusters were identified using a clustering algorithm through igraph that identifies neighborhoods based on the connectivity of the network. Families of pathways that clustered generally follow intuition about their relationships – for example, skin and hair pathways cluster together. Note that although pathways do overlap, they also have distinct genes. It would be surprising if related pathways were entirely distinct because genes often have many, sometimes quite divergent, functions. Overall, these findings are what we expect to see in these pathway annotations and do not affect our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
